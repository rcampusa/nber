Abstract:     Many undesirable activities are controlled by fines imposed by the

government.     In some contexts, such as antitrust violations and air pollution,

it makes sense to consider giving the fine to a private party as an inducement

for that party to discover and report the harmful behavior.      This paper com-

pares two "pure" forms of private enforcement--competitive and monopolistic--

to public enforcement, allowing for the cost of enforcement to differ among

the methods of enforcement.      If the individuals engaging in the undesirable

activity are potentially deterrable, then regardless of relative enforcement

costs, private (competitive or monopolistic) enforcement leads to less enforce-

ment than public enforcement and is socially inferior to public enforcement

if the damage from the activity is sufficiently large.     When. private enforce-

ment is cheaper than public enforcement, regulating private enforcers by

paying them something different than the fine for each violator detected can

achieve the socially most preferred outcome in the competitive case but not

in the monopolistic case.      If some individuals engaging in the activity are

undeterrable, these results hold if some simple additional conditions are

satisfied.     Also, depending on relative enforcement costs, monopolistic en-

forcement may result in more or less enforcement than competitive enforcement.

                                 1.   INTRODUCTION



     Whenever the government attempts to control undesirable behavior it must

choose a sanction to be imposed as well as an agent to do the enforcing.        It

is frequently the case that a particular sanction can be enforced within a

va~iety    of institutional arrangements.    For example, some antitrust penalties

in the United States are enforced both by public agencies--the Justice Depart-

ment and the Federal Trade Commission--and private parties--the victims of
the violations and their lawyers. 1-1/       Simultaneous enforcement by public

agencies and private parties also occurs in the control of air, water and

noise pollution, securities code violations, consumer product safety, and
land use. 1-2/    With a few exceptions (see below), economists have emphasized

the choice of the sanction (e.g., taxes versus standards), taking the enforcer

as given (usually the government).       In contrast, this essay focuses on the

choice of the enforcer for a particular type of sanction--a monetary payment

or fine.

     The most extensive discussion of the enforcement issue occurred in an

exchange between Becker and Stigler (1974) and Landes and Posner (1975).

Becker and Stigler suggested that private competitive enforcement of fines

--in which the first individual or firm to discover and report the violation

receives the fine--could duplicate the outcome under optimal public enforce-
ment. 1-3/    Landes and Posner, however, claimed that competitive enforcement

would lead unambiguously to too much enforcement relative to optimal public

enforcement.     Their intuitive explanation (p. 15) was based on the following

observations.     Under public enforcement, if the probability of enforcement is

unity ,the fine should be set equal to the external damage caused by the

activity.     By raising the fine and lowering the probability, the same level

of deterrence can be achieved at less cost.          Under private enforcement, .
                                       -2-


however, they argued that raising the fine would lead to a higher probability

since profit-maximizing enforcers would be induced to invest more in enforce-

ment.     From this they concluded that there would be private overenforcement.
Landes and Posner also argued that a private monopolist would overenforce for

the same reason, but they concluded that the level of monopolistic enforcement

would be less than in the competitive case (see below for the explanation).

        Both Becker and Stigler (1974) and Landes and Posner (1975) assumed in

their analysis that the cost of enforcement (to achieve any given probability)
was the same under competitive, monopolistic, and public enforcement. 1-4/

This assumption precluded welfare comparisons between private and public

enforcement since, at best, the outcome under private enforcement might

duplicate the outcome under optimal public enforcement.

        The present paper analyzes the competitive, monopolistic, and public
enforcement of fines allowing for the costs of enforcement to differ by the

choice of the enforcer.     There are a number of reasons to expect such differ-

ences.     First, the benefits from coordinating enforcement--for example,

avoiding duplication of investigative effort and exploiting economies of

scale in information processing--are obtained under public enforcement and

monopolistic enforcement, but not under competitive enforcement.     Second, the

profit motive might be imagined to lead to lower costs under either form of

private enforcement relative to public enforcement.     Third, when the revenue

from fines under public enforcement is not sufficient to finance enforcement

costs, there may be a deadweight burden incurred in making up the deficit

from other sources.      Conversely, if the fine revenue exceeds enforcement

costs, the effective cost of enforcement would be lower.      On balance, these

considerations suggest that monopolistic enforcement may be cheaper than

competitive enforcement, but that public enforcement could be more or less

expensive than private enforcement.
                                        -3-


     The general conclusions of this essay may be summarized briefly.          Regard-

less of relative enforcement costs, private         (competitiv~   or monopolistic)

enforcement leads    in'~   wide range of circumstances to less enforcement than

public enforcement, rather than more.         This result, which tends to occur when

the external damage from the violation is large, is easily explained.          Under

private enforcement, firms are willing to invest in enforcement only if they

at least break even--their fine revenue must be at least as large as their

enforcement costs.    Under public enforcement, however, the optimal solution

may result in fine revenue which is less than enforcement costs.            This is

particularly likely to occur when the damage from the violation is large

since it is then optimal to deter many potential violators.          Because the fine

that can be imposed is limited (by the wealth of the potential violators),

successfuldet,errence may require a high probability and correspondingly

large enforcement costs.      But successful deterrence and a limited fine may

not generate much fine revenue.       Even if private enforcement is less costly

than public enforcement, private firms may not be able to break even at this

level of deterrence and therefore would not be willing to enforce to this

extent.

     Public enforcement is socially preferable to private enforcement in many

circumstances even when public enforcement is much costlier.            This result

closely parallels the previous one.       The circumstances are the same ones

which lead to private underenforcement, and the superiority of public enforce-

ment tends to occur when the external damage from the violation is large.

The explanation for this result is also straightforward.            If the damage is

large, it is socially optimal to deter many potential violators.           If private

enforcement leads to less enforcement than public enforcement, then public

enforcement is more desirable in this respect.          However, public enforcement

may be costlier than private enforcement (for any given probability).          But if
                                       -4-


the external damage is sufficiently large, the advantages of a higher level

of enforcement will exceed the disadvantages of higher enforcement costs.

    Depending on relative enforcement costs, monopolistic enforcement may

result in more or less enforcement than competitive enforcement.       If the cost

of enforcement is the same under competitive and monopolistic enforcement,

then, as Landes and Posner (1975) showed, competitive enforcement may be

greater than monopolistic enforcement.       The reason is straightforward.   Given

a fine, the monopolist chooses a probability which generates (generally)

positive profits.     If, initially, competitive enforcement led to the same

probability and profits, additional firms would enter until the profits were

eliminated.     The result would be a higher probability.     However, because of

the benefits from coordinating enforcement (see above), competitive enforce-

ment may be more expensive than monopolistic enforcement.         If competitive

enforcement is sufficiently more expensive, then the level of competitive

enforcement will be less than that of monopolistic enforcement.         The high

costs lead the competitive enforcement industry to shrink.

        The above results suggest that any of the methods of enforcement may be

socially preferable, depending on the costs of each method as well as on the

magnitude of the external damage.    This will be illustrated explicitly through

an example in which enforcement costs are lowest under monopolistic enforce-

ment, higher under competitive enforcement, and highest under public enforce-

ment.     In the example, when damages are low, monopolistic enforcement is

socially preferable.     Over an intermediate range of damages, competitive

enforcement is most desirable.     And for higher damages, public enforcement is

superior.

        The previous results assumed that the private enforcers were paid the

fine for each violator caught.     The following result, applicable when private

enforcement is cheaper than public enforcement, is also shown.        Regulating
                                       -5-


private   enforc~rs ~   paying them something different than the fine for each

violator detected can achieve the socially most preferred outcome in the

competitive case but not generally in the monopolistic case.       The problem in

the monopolistic case is that it may not be possible to eliminate underen-

forcement.     The discussion of this result is deferred.
     The rest of the paper is organized as follows.     Section 2 describes the

basic model used to analyze the choice of enforcer.         Section 3 discusses

public enforcement.     Section 4 presents sufficient conditions for private

(competitive or monopolistic) underenforcement and for the superiority of

pub-lie enforcement.    Section 5 compares the levels of competitive and monopo-

listic enforcement.     Section 6 contains an example which illustrates the

results of sections 3 through 5 and shows the potential superiority of each

method of enforcement.      Section 7 considers public regulation of private

enforcement.     Section 8 briefly discusses two generalizations.    An appendix

contains proofs of some of the statements in the text.

                                   2.   THE MODEL



                                                                            2 l
     Individuals are assumed to have the same wealth and to be risk neutral. - /

Each individual faces the same probability distribution of private gain from

engaging in an activity which imposes damages on others.       For example, every-

one is assumed to be equally likely to need to double park in front of a

hospital as a result of some emergency.       (Also, each individual is equally

likely to be the victim of others' damages.)        An individual will engage in

the activity if his realized private gain exceeds the expected fine.         The

following notation will be used:

     y         initial wealth

     g         private gain from engaging in the activity

     h(.)      probability density of gains

     H(.)      cumulative distribution of h(.)

     g         maximum possible gain (minimum is zero)

     e         external damage

     p         probability that an individual who engages in

               the activity is caught

     f         fine collected from an individual who engages

               in the activity and is caught

The population will be normalized so that total population equals unity.

Thus, given an expected fine pf, [I-H(pf)] individuals will engage in the

activity.

     The cost of catching violators is assumed to depend on the fraction

caught and on an exogenous shift parameter, A       ~   1, which will be used to
                                           2 2
represent differences in enforcement costs: - /

        c(p, A)   cost of catching fraction p of individuals who

                  engage in the activity (oc/op > 0, OC/OA > 0,

                  and lim c(p, A)      =~   for all p > 0)
                      A-?OO

In the competitive case, this cost function measures the aggregate cost for

the industry, not the cost for each firm.                    The relevant values of the shiEt

parameter under public, competitive, and monopolistic enforcement will be                     ~,




        Since everyone is identical (ex ante) and risk neutral, social welfare,

W, equals the expected private gain from engaging in the activity, less the

expected damage imposed, and less the cost of enforcement.                      It will be useful

to emphasize that social welfare is a function of the enforcement cost shift

parameter; therefore, let

                                      g

(2.1)             W(p, f, A)     =   !gh(g)dg - [l-H(pf)]e - c(p, A).

                                     pf

        Under public enforcement, the public enforcement agency's (hereafter the

"agency") problem is to choose the probability and fine so as to maximize

social welfare.       Under monopolistic and competitive enforcement, the agency

still chooses the fine to maximize social welfare, but the probability is
                                 2-3/
determined by the private sector.---                      In the monopolistic case the proba-

bility is implicitly determined by profit maximization (provided that profits

are nonnegative), and in the competitive case by the condition that (in the

long run) profits are zero.           For given p and f, profits equal fine revenue,

pf[l-H(pf)], less enforcement costs, c.                     In all three cases, the fine is

facing the agency may be stated in the following way.

(2.6) incorporates the constraint that profits are nonnegative since the

monopolist is free to choose p       = 0.)
        This description of competitive and monopolistic enforcement assumes

that private enforcers receive the fine when they have detected a violator.

The feasibility and desirability of compensating private enforcers in other

ways is discussed in section 7.

                                   3.   PUBLI C ENFORCEMENT



        In this section the relevant features of public enforcement will be

developed.    After deriving the optimal fine and probability, the way in which

the probability varies with the external damage will be discussed.

        It is well known from the work of Becker (1968) and others that i f

individuals are risk neutral, the optimal fine equals their wealth.                  This

result is easy to show in the present model.                 Suppose, to the contrary, that

f* < y.     Let k    =p*f*    be the expected fine.         By raising f* to y and lowering

p* to k/y, the expected fine is maintained at k.                  Since individuals' deci-

sions whether to engage in the activity are unaffected, the first two terms

in the social welfare function (2.l)--private gains and external damages--are

unaffected.        The third term, enforcement costs, is reduced since the proba-

bility of catching violators has fallen.                Note that the optimality of the

fine equal to individuals' wealth does not depend on the magnitude of the

external damage e.

        Given f*    = y,    the optimal probability is determined implicitly by the

first order condition with respect to the probability (assuming a unique

interior maximum); after some manipulation this may be written as

                                                   oH       oc
(3.1)                                   [e - PY]op      =   op'

This condition has a natural interpretation.                 As the'probability is raised

marginally, enforcement costs rise by ocjop.                 However, fewer individuals en-

gage in the activity since the expected fine has risen; this effect is repre-

sented by oHjop.           Each individual who does not now engage in the activity

reduces external costs by e but forgoes private gains of py.                Since ocjop > 0

and oHjop > 0, it must be that e > py for (3.1) to be satisfied; in other
                                                     -10-


words, at the optimum there is a net benefit to society from each individual

who is induced not to engage in the activity.                         Thus, (3.1) states that the

marginal benefits of further deterrence from raising the probability just

equal the marginal costs of raising the probability.

        Since the optimal fine equals individual wealth regardless of the ex-

ternal damage, e, one would expect that an increase in e would lead to a

higher optimal probability.           In fact, it is straightforward to show that

(3.2)                                ~*                  oH/op
                                     de          =       [SOC]
                                                                  > 0,

where "SOC" refers to the second order condition, which is negative.

        As the external damage approaches zero, the optimal probability ap-

proaches zero:

(3.3)
                                          lim pi'(e)        =    O.
                                          e-70


Although a proof of (3.3) is contained in the appendix, the result is intu-

itively plausible.      The maximum possible benefit from deterrence is e (at

most everyone violates the rule).                    Since it is never worth spending more on

enforcement than the benefits from deterrence, spending must approach zero as

e approaches zero.       This implies that the optimal probability must approach

zero.

        As the external cost approaches infinity, the optimal probability                     ap~


proaches an upper bound:

(3.4)                        lim p*(e)               =   min[g/y, 1].
                             e 700

The proof of (3.4) is contained in the appendix.                         The intuition is as fol-

lows. 3 - l /   If the maximum possible gain, g, is less than (or equal to) indi-

viduals' wealth, y, then everyone is potentially deterrable (that is, could
                                        -11-


be deterred by some p ~ 1 and some f ~ y).3-2/ If the external damage they

impose is sufficiently large, then it becomes worthwhile to deter everyone.

To do so, the expected fine, p*y, must equal g; that is, p*           = g/y.   Any

higher p creates unnecessary costs.      If g is greater than y, then individuals

whose gains exceed yare undeterrable.          But, if e is sufficiently large, it

becomes worthwhile to deter everyone else; to do so, p* must equal 1.            In

brief,    (3.4) states that as the external damage approaches infinity, i t

becomes worthwhile to do everything possible to deter individuals from violat-

ing the rule.

        None of the above results depends on the level of the enforcement cost

shift parameter   ~.However,    the level of     ~   obviously affects the probability

which is optimal for any external damage e.          It is easy to show that

(3.5)                          ~*
                               dA   =                  < 0,

assuming a 2 C/apaA > O.   In other words, the optimal probability falls at each

level of the external damage when the schedule of enforcement costs rises,

provided that marginal enforcement costs also rise.

                            4.   PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT



     This section explains sufficient conditions for two results.                       The first

is that the expected fine under private enforcement, pOfo, is less than the

expected fine under public enforcement, p*f*.                    The second is that social

welfare is higher under public enforcement even though the cost of enforce-

ment (for any probability) may be much higher under public enforcement.                      Both

of these results occur when the external damage is "large."                        The comparison

of private and public enforcement when the external damage is small will be

discussed in the context of an example in section 6.

     Proposition 1:           Regardless of how the public agency chooses the fine

under private enforcement, regardless of whether the private enforcement

industry is competitive or monopolistic, and regardless of the relative costs

of private and public enforcement, there will be private underenforcement

(pOfO <    p~"'f*)   for sufficiently large external damages (e) i f

     (i)     all individuals who engage in the activity are potentially deter-

              rable    (g   ~ y), or if

     (ii) there are some undeterrable individuals                     (g   > y) and anyone of the
              following conditions holds:

              (a)     the number of undeterrable individuals (l-H(y)) is suffi-

                      ciently small,

              (b)     the wealth of individuals (y) is sufficiently small,

              (c)     the cost of enforcement approaches infinity as the probability

                      approaches unity (lim c(p, 1)          = 00).
                                          p-71

     The proof of Proposition I is presented in the appendix.                       The basic idea

behind the proof is relatively simple.                  Suppose first that all individuals

are potentially deterrable, that is              g~     y.   In this case the expected fine
                                      -13-


under optimal public enforcement approaches complete deterrence, g, as the

external cost, e, approaches infinity:       f*   = Y and   p* approaches   g/y.   If the

expected fine under private enforcement, pOfo, were to· approach complete

deterrence, fine revenue would approach zero.          Since enforcement costs are

positive for any positive p, profits would be negative.           Thus, pOfo must be

less than g, so there exists some e beyond which pOfo < p*f*.           When there are

some undeterrable individuals, that is       g > y,   this argument does not apply

directly because there will always be some fine revenue under private enforce-

ment.     In this case the expected fine under public enforcement approaches

maximum possible deterrence as e approaches infinity: f*          =y   and p* approaches

1.   For the expected fine under private enforcement to approach maximum

possible deterrence, po would have to approach 1.             Anyone of the three

additional conditions is sufficient to imply negative profits when po is in

the neighborhood of 1, regardless of fO       (~y).     The conditions with respect

to the number of undeterrable individuals, [l-H(y)], and their wealth, y,

lead to negative profits by making fine revenue sufficiently small, while the

last condition implies negative profits by making enforcement costs suffi-

ciently large.     Thus, po must be bounded away from 1 for all e, so there

again exists some e beyond which pOfo < p*f*.

        Put another way, the basic point of Proposition 1 is the following.

Under private enforcement, the only feasible combinations of the probability

and the fine are those which result in fine revenue at least as large as

enforcement costs.     But when the external damage is high, the optimal proba-

bility and fine under public enforcement are both high; this implies low fine

revenue--because of successful deterrence--and large enforcement costs.               The

high probability and fine may not be compatible with private enforcement,

even if private enforcement is less costly than public enforcement.                Hence,

private underenforcement. 4 - l /

        Proposition~:    Regardless of how the public agency chooses the fine

under    priv~te   enforcement, regardless of whether the private enforcement

industry is competitive or monopolistic, and regardless of how much costlier

public enforcement is than private enforcement (for any Ap < (0), public

enforcement is socially preferable to private enforcement for sufficiently

large external damages if any of the conditions stated in Proposition 1 hold.

        The proof of Proposition 2 is also contained in the appendix.          The

intuition behind the proof is easily explained.          If any of the conditions of

Proposition 1 are satisfied, there exists some level of the external damage

beyond which pOfo < p*f*.      The higher level of public enforcement has three

consequences for social welfare (2.1).        First, the private gains from engag-

ing in the activity are reduced because more potential violators are deterred.

Second, the external damages are reduced for the same reason.          Third, enforce-

ment costs may be higher because p* may exceed po, and         ~   may exceed both A
                                                                                    C
and~.       The first and the third effects, which reduce social welfare, can

have only a limited impact since at most everyone is deterred and the cost of

enforcement is finite for p < 1 and A <       00.   The second effect, which improves

social welfare, has an unlimited impact as the external damage increases.

Thus, public enforcement will lead to higher social welfare if the damage is

sufficiently large.

                   5.        COMPETITIVE VERSUS MONOPOLISTIC ENFORCEMENT



        This section states a sufficient condition for the result that the

expected fine under competitive enforcement, Pefe' is lower than the expected

fine under monopolistic enforcement, PMfM.                  This result occurs when the cost

of competitive enforcement is "large" relative to that of monopolistic enforce-

ment.    The relationship between competitive and monopolistic enforcement when

enforcement costs are similar will be described in the context of an example

in the next section.

        Proposition     2:       Regardless of how the public agency chooses the fine

under private enforcement and regardless of how costly monopolistic enforce-

ment is (for any        ~        <   ~),   competitive enforcement will be less than monopo-

listic enforcement (Pefe < PMfM) if competitive enforcement is sufficiently

costly (A       sufficiently large).
            e
        The proof, which is included in the appendix, is based on the following

reasoning.       If Pefe is at least as large as PMfM' then PC must be at least as

large as some positive probability (PMfM/ y , otherwise Pefe                 ~   PeY < PMfM).

Even at this probability, competitive enforcement costs grow without bound as

A increases.        Since there is only a finite amount of fine revenue that can
 e
possibly be raised, profits in the competitive enforcement industry must

become negative for A sufficiently large.                    This implies that Pefe must be
                     e
below PMfM if Ae is large enough.

        Obviously, if A is very large, i t may be preferable for the public
                       e
agency to choose f
                             e
                                 =0    because competitive enforcement is not worth its

costs at any level of enforcement.                   This is not why Pefe < PMfM when Ae is

large.     An example is presented in the next section in which 0 < Pefe < PMfM

over a range of A , when both f and f are chosen by the public agency to
                 e             e     M
maximize social welfare.

                                                6.   AN EXAMPLE



        In this section an analytically solvable example of the complete model

will be described.             Besides illustrating the results of the previous three

sections it will show how the public agency sets the fine under private

enforcement, and how the potential superiority of each method of enforcement

depends on the relative costs of enforcement and the magnitude of the external

damage.

        The example is characterized by two assumptions.                   First, the probability

density of private gains is uniform:

(6.1)                                    h(g)    = constant = l/g.
Second, enforcement costs are proportional to the probability of catching

violators and to the enforcement cost shift parameter:

(6.2)                                           c(p, A)   = Akp,
where A    ~   1 and k is the cost per unit of probability when A                 = 1.
        Given these assumptions, social welfare (2.1) becomes:


(6.3)                   W(p,   f,   A)   = [~-       p:n - [1 -;} - Akp.
The first term (in brackets) represents expected private gains, the second

expected external damages, and the third enforcement costs.

        Public enforcement.              Since f*    = y,    (6.3) is maximized just over p.   The

result is: 6- 1/

        There are three regions in terms of the external damage, e.                        For e

sufficiently small, it is not worthwhile controlling the activity at all

since the benefits--Iower damages--are less than the costs--enforcement costs

and foregone private gains.             For intermediate e the optimal probability is

positive and increasing with e.            Depending on whether g            5 y,   it increases to

I or g/y at some e and remains there for all higher e.

        Monopolistic enforcement.         The monopolist's profit function is:

(6.6)                        TI(p, f)     =

The monopolist's profit maximizing choice of p, given f, is:


(6.7)                               =                    for   f   ~   Ak.


Substituting (6.7) into (6.3) and maximizing over f gives the following result:

                        0,                 0,                      e S eM'

where

(6.9)                              eM = (3Ak + y) g/ 4y .

(When f
          M
              =y,   the monopolist's profits are strictly positive.)

        There are two regions in terms of the external damage.                      For e suf-

ficiently small, it is not worth controlling the activity, so the public

agency sets the fine at zero.            For larger e, it is worth controlling the

activity.         In this example the optimal fine under monopolistic enforcement

jumps from zero to y.6-2/

        Competitive enforcement.         The competitive industry's aggregate profits

must equal zero in equilibrium.            Thus,

Solving for p gives:

The discussion following (6.9) applies here as well.

        The public, monopolistic, and competitive enforcement results are sum-

marized in Figure 1.           The solid lines show in each case how the expected fine

varies with the level of external damages assuming that enforcement costs are

at their minimum, A           = 1.    Each of the schedules would shift, of course, if A

were higher.          The dashed line labeled "c-locus" is the locus of starting

points (ee) and levels (Pefe) for competitive enforcement defined by the

feasible range of A > 1.              For example, the competitive schedule when A       =3   is

illustrated.         The "m-locus" is defined similarly for monopolistic enforcement.

Under public enforcement, the expected fine schedule would shift to the right

in a parallel way as A increases.               Figure 1 is constructed on the assumptions

that g    = y,   so all individuals are potentially deterrable, and that k              = .25y,
that is, one-quarter of society's income would be required to catch everyone

when A    = 1.       None of the important qualitative results in Figure 1 depend on

these assumptions.

        Figure 1 illustrates the result of Proposition 1 concerning private

underenforcement.          Since everyone is potentially deterrable, condition (i) of
                                           -19-


Proposition 1 applies--a high enough external damage is sufficient to guaran-

tee private underenforcement.         Figure 1 shows that the minimum level of e

required before underenforcement is observed may be different under competi-

tive and monopolistic enforcement.          Figure 1 also shows that the level of

private enforcement may exceed that of public enforcement when damages are

low.       For example, when A   =1   for each method of enforcement, there is a

region of overenforcement for both competitive and monopolistic enforcement.

However, depending on relative enforcement costs, there may be no external

damage at which private overenforcement occurs.              Compare for example, the

competitive schedule in Figure 1 when A             =3   to the public schedule when

A   = 1.
       The intuitive explanation of private underenforcement (see sections 1

and 4) suggested that private underenforcement tends to occur when it is

optimal under public enforcement to deter "many" or "most" potential violators

(since fine revenue is then likely to be less than enforcement costs).

However, Figure 1 indicates indirectly that private underenforcement can

occur even when most potential violators are not deterred.              For example,

suppose A      =1   for both monopolistic and public enforcement.      At the external

damage at which PMfM first becomes less than p*f* (this occurs, coinciden-

tally, at e
                C
                    in Figure 1), p*f*   = .375y.   Since private gains are uniform

between 0 and g       = y,   this implies that even when it is optimal under public

enforcement to deter as few as 38% of the potential violators, monopolistic

enforcement is less than public enforcement.             If monopolistic enforcement is

costlier than public enforcement, then this underenforcement result can occur

at an even lower level of public deterrence.

       Figure 1 also illustrates the result of Proposition 3 that competitive

enforcement will be less than monopolistic enforcement if competitive enforce-

ment is sufficiently more expensive.          For example, if A    =1   for monopolistic

enforcement and A     =3   for competitive enforcement, this result is shown ex-

plicitly.   However, there are many combinations of          ~    and AC which also lead

to this result.       From (6.8) and (6.12) it is easy to show that the expected

fine under competitive enforcement will be less than the expected fine under

monopolistic enforcement if 2A -        ~     > yjk.   Since Figure 1 was constructed
                              C
on the assumption that k      = .25y,   yjk   =4   in this case.     That competitive

enforcement may exceed monopolistic enforcement is also shown in Figure 1

when AC   = ~ = 1.
     An example of welfare comparisons among public, competitive, and monopo-

listic enforcement is illustrated in Figure 2.            It is assumed that monopolis-

tic enforcement is least expensive (A          = 1),   competitive enforcement is more
 I

costly (A   = 1.5),    and public enforcement is most expensive (A         = 2).   The

corresponding expected fine schedules are shown in Figure 2.             A fourth expected

fine schedule, labeled "first-best (A         = 1),"   is included as a benchmark; this

is the schedule that would have been derived under public enforcement if

public enforcement were as cheap as possible (A           = 1).    The darkened portion

of each schedule indicates the range over which it is the socially preferred

method of enforcement.       When damages are very low (below eM in Figure 2),

violations are not worth controlling at all.           As damages increase, monopolis-

tic enforcement then becomes preferable because it is cheapest and "reasonably"

close to first-best enforcement.        For even higher damages, competitive enforce-

ment is best because it is then closer to first-best enforcement than monopo-

listic enforcement is, and it is still cheaper than public enforcement.

Finally, for sufficiently high damages, public enforcement becomes preferable

despite its costs because it leads to the highest level of enforcement,

coinciding with the level of first-best enforcement.

     Thus, Figure 2 illustrates the result of Proposition 2 concerning the

superiority of public enforcement.    Since everyone is potentially deterrable

in the example, a high enough external damage is sufficient to guarantee this

result.

     Public enforcement may also be socially preferable at low levels of

damages even when public enforcement is costlier than private enforcement.

For example, suppose A   =1   for monopolistic enforcement and A   =1   + e for

public enforcement, where e > 0 may be arbitrarily small.     At the level of

external damages eM in Figure 2, social welfare under monopolistic enforce-

ment is the same as when the activity is not controlled at all (by construc-

tion of eM)' and strictly less than social welfare under first-best enforce-

ment (since it is desirable to begin using first-best enforcement at a lower

level of damages).   But as e approaches zero, social welfare under public

enforcement approaches social welfare under first-best enforcement.       Thus,

for e sufficiently small, public enforcement will be socially preferable to

monopolistic enforcement for external damages just above eM in Figure 2.

This does not imply that public enforcement is more desirable at all higher

levels of the external damage.   To the contrary, at the level of the external

damage in Figure 2 where the monopolistic schedule crosses the first-best

schedule, monopolistic enforcement.is socially preferable.    It duplicates the

first-best outcome, whereas public enforcement is costlier since A > 1 (as a

result ,of the higher costs, the level of public enforcement would be lower).

By Proposition 2, however, public enforcement eventually becomes preferable

again for sufficiently high external damages.     Thus, the optimal choice of

enforcer may depend in a complicated way on relative enforcement costs and

the level of the external damage.

                  7.    PUBLIC REGULATION OF PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT



     When public enforcement is more expensive than private enforcement, it

is natural to ask whether some form of public regulation of private enforce-

ment can achieve the first-best outcome--what the public enforcement agency

would choose if it could enforce as cheaply as the private enforcers.        It is

obvious that this outcome can be reached in principle if the agency appropri-

ately compensates private enforcers on the basis of the probability of detect-

ing violators or, equivalently, the number of violators deterred.        However,

it may be very expensive or impossible for the agency to verify claims by

private enforcers that they had achieved a high probability and thereby

deterred a large number of individuals.        This would certainly be true in the

context of activities which can be concealed like securities fraud or price

fixing (but may not be true in other contexts like pollution).7-l/         Since

this difficulty does not arise if the compensation is based on the number of

violators actually caught, an interesting question is whether there exists

some compensation schedule based on this information which can achieve the

first-best outcome.      When the compensation schedule takes the simple form of

paying private enforcers a fixed amount per person caught, this amount will

be referred to as a bounty, b.

        Proposition~:    Under competitive enforcement, there exists a bounty

which can achieve (or come arbitrarily close to) the first-best outcome.

        The proof of this result is straightforward.     To achieve the first-best

outcome the public agency must choose f        =Y   (for the reason discussed in

section 3).     Given f = Y and a bounty b, the zero profit condition for the

competitive industry is

(7.1)                    n =   pb[l-H(py)] - c(p, A)    =   O.

Solving (7.1) for b leads to
                                         -23-


(7.2)                      b(p)   =    c(p, A)/p[l-H(py)].

This determines a finite bounty for every p > 0 provided that enforcement

costs, c, are not infinite and that the number of individuals engaging in the

activity, [l-H(py)], is not zero.        For enforcement costs to be infinite or

the number of violators to be zero, He optimal probability would have to be

at its upper bound,     P = min[g/y,   1].   In this case, a probability can be

achieved under competitive enforcement which is arbitrarily close to the

optima1 probability.     The remaining detail in the proof is to show that there

does not exist more than one probability which satisfies the zero profit

condition for the same bounty.        Intuitively, one would expect that the higher

the probability desired, the higher the bounty required, so this should not

be a problem.    This detail is left to the appendix.

        Proposition~:   Under monopolistic enforcement, there does not exist a

bounty which can correct (even approximately) for underenforcement if all

individuals are potentially deterrable (g ~ y) or if the number of undeter-

rable individuals (l-H(y)) is sufficiently small.

        The proof of this proposition is contained in the appendix.         To under-

stand the basic idea behind this result, suppose the monopolist maximizes

just bounty revenue, pb[l-H(py)], rather than revenue minus enforcement

costs.     This is equivalent, of course, to maximizing the number of violators

caught, p[l-H(py)], regardless of the bounty b.              If all individuals are

potentially deterrable and the probability were at the level which deterred

everyone, obviously no individuals would be caught.             Thus, no matter how

large the bounty is, it would pay the monopolist to choose a lower probabil-

ity than this one.      Taking enforcement costs into account tends to lower the

profit maximizing probability even further.         Since the optimal probability

approaches the probability which deters everyone as the external damage
                                      -24-


approaches infinity (3.4), there will be monopolistic underenforcement which

cannot be corrected by any bounty.    If there are some undeterrable individuals,

the same reasoning applies as long as the monopolist would iricrease the

number of violators caught by lowering the probability from unity.               If the

number of undeterrable individuals is sufficiently small, then lowering the

probability will have this effect--the reduction in the number of undeterrable

individuals caught will be offset by the increase in the number of potentially

deterrable individuals caught.

     Proposition 5 can be illustrated in terms of the example in the previous

section.   Assuming, as there, that   g =y   and k   = .25y,   and given f
                                                                             M
                                                                                 = y,   it

is easy to show that the monopolist's profit maximizing probability is PM               =
.5 - (y/.125b).   Thus, although PM is increasing with b, as b approaches

infinity, PM only approaches .5.

     The reason for the success of a bounty in the competitive case and its

failure in the monopolistic case is not entirely surprising.         In both cases,

a higher bounty induces a higher probability.7-2/       The higher probability in

turn reduces the number of individuals engaging in the activity.         While each

competitive firm treats the number of individuals engaging in the activity as

fixed, the monopolist takes the actual reduction into account.           When the

probability becomes high enough, this effect may become severe enough to put

a ceiling on the probability that the monopolist is willing to choose.

     In general, the amount of compensation can be any function of the number

of violators caught.    It may seem that limiting the function to the special

case of a fixed payment per person caught is what prevents the first-best

outcome from being achieved under monopolistic enforcement.          The following

proposition shows that this is not the case.

     Proposition~:     Under monopolistic enforcement, there does not exist any

schedule of compensation based on the number of violators caught which can
                                        -25-


correct for underenforcement if either of the conditions stated in Proposi-

tion 5 holds.

      The proof of this proposition is outlined here.           Let n(p)   = p[l-H(py)]
be the number of violators actually caught, and let           p>   0 be the probability

at which n(.) reaches its maximum (if there is more than one such probability,

let   p   be the smallest).   The discussion folloWing Proposition 5 indicated

that if either of the conditions stated there holds, a reduction in the

probability from the upper bound probability,        p = min[g/y,      1], increases the

number of persons caught; that is n I (p) <     o.    Thus,   P < p.     Since n(.) is

continuous (assuming h(.) is continuous) and nCO)        = 0,   for every probability

between    p and p there   exists a probability between 0 and      p which   leads to the

same number of violators caught.       As a result, no probability between        p and p
can be achieved--the monopolist would always choose the corresponding probabil-

ity below    p   since it would lead to the same compensation and lower enforcement

costs (if there is more than one such probability below             p,   the monopolist

will choose the lower of these).

      There is a potential difficulty with regulating private enforcers by

paying them something different than the fine which has not been incorporated

into the above analysis.       If private enforcers are taxed (a bounty less than

the fine), then, as Landes and Posner (1975, p. 24) have suggested, " . . . both

the apprehended offenders and the enforcer would be better off privately

negotiating a payment that was less than the statutory fine but greater than

the fine minus the tax."        If private enforcers are paid more than the fine,

there would be an incentive to fabricate offenses.            These considerations do

not necessarily imply, however, that this form of regulation cannot still

improve matters over unregulated private enforcement.              (Moreover, as Becker

and Stigler (1975) have forcefully argued, analogous problems of malfeasance

may arise under public enforcement.)

                           8.   CONCLUDING REMARKS


     There are two ways in which the present model can be made more realistic

without affecting the basic results.    If the individuals being controlled are

risk averse rather than risk neutral, then,      a~   Polinsky   a~d   Shavell (forthcom-

ing) have shown, the optimal fine under public enforcement is generally less

than individuals' wealth and the optimal probability is generally higher than

it would be if they were risk neutral.        However, it still appears to be true

that if the external damage is high enough, it is optimal under public enforce-
                                                                8-1/
ment to deter as many individuals as possible, possibly everyone.---              Then,

for the reasons discussed in this paper, (unregulated) private enforcement

may lead to underenforcement, and public enforcement would therefore be

superior if the external damage is large enough.          The result concerning the

comparison of competitive and monopolistic enforcement and those concerning

public regulation of private enforcement are essentially unaffected.

     The second way to make the model more realistic would be to include the

number of violators in the enforcement cost function as well as the probabil-

ity of catching them.   Enforcement costs would increase, .everything else

equal, if the probability rises or if the number of violators rises.              Then,

raising the probability might reduce costs since the number of individuals

engaging in the activity would fall.     However, it seems plausible to assume

that some costs must be incurred to set a high probability even if, as a

result of that probability, no one actually engages in the activity.               In

other words, to achieve complete deterrence (if that is possible) some "stand-

by" costs must be incurred (for example, policemen on street corners).             Then,

again for the reasons discussed here, (unregulated) private enforcers may not

be willing to enforce to the same extent as public enforcers and public

enforcement will be preferable if the damages are sufficiently large.              The

other results are essentially unchanged or can be reformulated.

          Proof of (3.4):              It is assumed that c(p) <             00   for all p < p, where

p   = min[g/y,     1].       For the reason noted in section 3, p* ~ g/y when g < y.

Thus, if lim p*(e) is not p, there exists a sequence e. ~                                 00   such that
                                                                                      1

           Proof of Proposition 1:              The proof will refer to the monopolist, although

it applies directly to the competitive case as well.                                 Regardless of how the

public agency chooses the fine under monopolistic enforcement, let po and f O

be any equilibrium probability and fine combination.                                 The resulting profits

to the monopolist are




Let zbe the expected fine pOfo.                           If f O < y, raise the fine to y and lower

the probability to z/y, so that the expected fine is constant.                                  Since revenue

would be constant and enforcement costs would be lower, the monopolist's

profits would be higher.                   Thus, for any equilibrium expected fine z, the

monopolist's profits are less than or equal to

                                         n(z)    =    z[l-H(z)] - c(z/y).

By the continuity of n, there exists a 6 > 0 such that n(z) < 0 for all z satis-

fying g - 6 < z ~ g.               Thus, pOf o ~ g - 6 and, given a sufficiently large e,

p~"'f~\-   >   g-   6.

           Second case:         g > y.     The expected fine under public enforcement ap-

proaches y.              At this expected fine the monopolist's profits are less than or

equal to

                                   n(y)   =     y[l-H(y)] - c(l).

If [l-H(y)] or yare sufficiently small, or if lim c(p)                            =   00,   n(y) will be
                                                                      p-71
negative.    Assuming n(y) is negative, the previous argument implies pOfo < p*f*

for sufficiently large e.

      Proof of Proposition 2:             If any of the conditions stated in Proposition 1

hold, then (from the proof of that proposition) there exists a 6 > 0 such

that pOfo ~ py - 6 for all e, where p                    = min[g/y,      1].    Let p be any probability
                                                     A



satisfying py - 6 < py < py, and let W(.) be social welfare as a function of

e assuming p     = p,   f   = y,    and A = ~ <           00.      Also, let WO(.) be social welfare

under private enforcement assuming A                     = AO      <~.       It is straightforward to

show that

                               A
                               py

                              pOfo


                        >     -g + [H(py)-H(py-6)]e - c(p, ~),

which is positive for sufficiently large e.                            Since social welfare under

public enforcement is at least as large as Wee) (p may not equal p*(e)), the

result follows.

      Proof of Proposition 3:             Fix    ~       <   00.    Suppose PCfC      ~   PMfM > 0 for all

AC·   Then PC   ~   PMfM/y > 0 for all AC.                This leads to a contradiction.                Compet-

itive profits are




                                   <


which is negative for sufficiently large A ' contradicting the zero profit
                                          C
condition.      Thus, PCfC < PMfM for large enough AC.

       Proof of    Proposition~:         It remains to be shown that db/dp > O.               From

(7.2),   wri~ing   oc/op as c',

               sign(dbjdp)     =     sign{c'p[l-H]         c([l-H] - phy)}.


It is assumed that the profit function               n   is strictly concave in p.           This

implies that at the p > 0 where profits are zero,


                          on/op      =    b[l-H] - bphy - c'        < O.

Using this result,


               c'p[l-H] - c([l-H] - phy)             > c'p[l-H] - c(c' /b)
                         =   c'(p[l-H] - (c/b))           =    0,


where the last equality follows from the zero profit condition.                        Thus, db/dp > O.

       Proof of Proposition    ~:     Setting f      = Y and    the bounty at b, the monopolist's

profits are


                              n(p)       =   pb[l-H(py)] - c(p).


Let p   = min[g/y, 1]    and assume that c'(p) < 00 (the result will clearly also

hold   if c'(p) = 00).   It is sufficient to show that


                                                           c' (p)   < - c' (p)


regardless of b, since this implies PM < P - £ for some £ >                      o.      If g ~ y,

[l-H(py)]   = [l-H(g)] = 0,    so n' (p) < -c' (p).            If g > y, n' (p)       < -c' (p) if

[l-H(py)]   = [l-H(y)]   is sufficiently small.            Since, by (3.4), lim p*(e)          = p,
                                                                                 e-700
the result follows.

     ~/     Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research.       Work

on this paper was supported by the National Science Foundation through a

grant (SOC 78-20159) to the law and economics program of the National Bureau

of Economic Research.    Any opinions expressed are those of the author and not

those of the NBER.    Helpful comments were provided by Lucian Bebchuk, Michael

Boskin, Robert Clark, Robert Cooter, Lewis Kornhauser, William Landes, Richard

Posner, Robert Prichard, Daniel Rubinfeld, Steven Shavell, and participants

in seminars at various universities during the 1978-79 academic year.

     1-1/     See, for example, Elzinga and Breit (1976).       A similar policy has

recently been adopted in Canada.     See Prichard and Trebilcock (1978).       In the

antitrust context, as in many other contexts (see note 1-2 below), it is

usually not the exact same sanction which is enforced both privately and

publicly, but rather, close substitutes.          For example, the Justice Department

can seek to impose a fine on an antitrust violator, whereas a private party

can seek "treble damages."

     1-2/     See, for example, Clark (forthcoming), Ellickson (1973), and

Mashaw (1975).     See also Dam (1975).

     1-3/     Because of other considerations (public malfeasance), Becker and

Stigler suggested a preference for private enforcement.            From a somewhat

different perspective, their discussion of private enforcement has been

formalized and supported by Harris and Raviv (1978).

     1-4/ This assumption was implicit in Becker and Stigler's discussion and

explicit in Landes and Posner's model (p. 10).          Landes and Posner did discuss

informally (pp. 29-30) why enforcement costs might differ.

     2-1/     Risk neutrality was also assumed by Becker and Stigler (1974) and

Landes and Posner (1975).      The present results would not be affected if in-
                                         N-2


dividuals were risk averse; see section 8.

     2-2/     In general, the cost also depends on the number of violators.

This effect is omitted since it is not central to the present argument.        All

of the main results carryover to the more general case; see section 8.

     2-3/     It is assumed that an equilibrium exists and is unique for each

fine under private enforcement.

     2-4/ It may not be possible to increase the maximum fine by including

the private gain g.     The gain may be concealed if it is money ("Swiss bank

account"), or it may be nonmonetary (tlsaving your spouse's life by speeding

to a hospital tl ).

      3-1/    The intuitive explanation presumes that enforcement costs are

finite for all probabilities.     This leads to a stronger statement than (3.4);

see the appendix.

      3-2/    Individuals for whom g    = yare indifferent between engaging and
not engaging in the activity when      p = 1 and f = y. Since nothing is affected,

it is assumed that they would choose not to engage in the activity.

      4-1/ In response to an earlier version of this paper, William Landes and

Richard Posner discovered that the possibility of private underenforcement

was implicit in their (1975) analysis.         They now maintain that an additional

assumption is necessary in order to guarantee their private overenforcement

result.      The assumption is that the wealth of injurers is not a binding

constraint on the choice of the fine under private enforcement.          But this

assumption is not likely to be satisfied when the external damage is "large"

since the enforcement agency would probably wish to choose a high fine in

order to achieve a high level of deterrence.

      6-1/ In describing the results for the three methods of enforcement, the

subscripts with respect to A are omitted for notational simplicity.
                                      N-3


     6-2/    In general the optimal fine probably would rise continuously as

the external damage increases.

     7-1/ Since it is assumed in the model that potential violators know the

probability of being detected by private enforcers, it may seem peculiar to

assume that the public enforcement agency may not be able to determine this

probability.    However, a more realistic assumption is that neither potential

violators nor the enforcement agency are able to estimate with much accuracy

the true probability under private enforcement.     The agency may not wish to

compensate private enforcers on the basis of such imperfect information.     As

long as potential violators perceive a higher probability when the true prob-

ability has risen, the basic features of the present analysis would not be

affected.

     7-2/ In the competitive case, this is shown in the proof of Proposition

4 in the appendix.     In the monopolistic case, it is easy to show that dp/db   =
-[l-H]/[SOC] >   o.
     8-1/ Suppose everyone is potentially deterrable.     As the damage goes to

infinity, if everyone is deterred, no one would bear any risk.     If there are

some undeterrable individuals, their bearing of risk must be taken into

account.     However, as the damage goes to infinity, if the probability ap-

proaches unity and the fine approaches wealth, the risk bearing would dis-

appear.     Thus, it seems in both cases that the optimal solution as the damage

approaches infinity is not affected by risk aversion.
