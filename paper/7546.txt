                                               ABSTRACT




        A fundamental problem entrepreneurs face in the formative stages of their businesses is how to

provide incentives for employees to protect, rather than steal, the source of organizational rents. We study

how the entrepreneur's response to this problem will determine the organization's internal structure, growth,

and its eventual size. In particular, our model suggests large, steep hierarchies will predominate in physical

capital intensive industries, and these will typically have seniority-based promotion policies. By contrast,

flat hierarchies will be seen in human capital intensive industries. These will have up-or-out promotion

systems, where experienced managers either become owners or are fired. Furthermore, flat hierarchies will

have more distinctive technologies or cultures than steep hierarchies. The model points to some

essential differences between organized hierarchies and markets.

   At the root of most enterprises generating economic surplus is an entrepreneur with an unique

critical resource such as an idea, good customer relationships, a new tool, or superior management

technique. A fundamental problem of entrepreneurship is how to enlist the co-operation of the

many agents necessary for production without ceding to them too much of the surplus generated

by the enterprise. The risk of being expropriated is, however, always inherent in production. In

particular, the entrepreneur has to give her employees (whom we call managers) close proximity

or access to the critical resource for them to learn to produce effectively. For example, a manager

has to understand the idea, be in contact with the key customers and suppliers, or even learn

the entrepreneur’s unique managerial techniques, in order to work effectively. But access also

gives the manager the opportunity to expropriate this critical resource and compete against the

entrepreneur. Managers may steal the idea, walk away with clients, or mimic the entrepreneur’s

management style, and start up a rival concern. The greater the access a manager has, the more

he can appropriate, and the more effectively he can compete. This paper explores the role of

organizational design in dealing with the problem of expropriation, and derives implications for

the shape, size, and growth of organizations.1

   Although it is intended to serve as a metaphor for all those activities that allow managers

to appropriate part of the value of the firm, the particular phenomenon we have in mind is not

unimportant. Intel, the microprocessor manufacturer, was started, not in a garage or basement

as many other Silicon Valley start-ups, but when Robert Noyce, the General Manager of Fairchild

Semiconductor, and Gordon Moore, its head of Research and Development walked out of Fairchild

and set up their own firm, Integrated Electronics. Shortly before their departure, a scientist in

Moore’s department had discovered the “silicon-gate” technique to produce semi-conductor memory

devices. This became an important part of Intel’s proposed product line. As a former employee of

both companies put it “Intel was founded to steal the silicon gate process from Fairchild.” [Jackson



                                                 1
1997, p26-27]. Clearly, of all Fairchild’s employees, Noyce and Moore had the greatest access

to Fairchild’s inventions, and at the very least, took a lot of knowledge and, equally important,

employees with them to the start-up. Thus Intel hit the ground running, and is now one of the

most profitable firms while Fairchild Semiconductor is virtually a footnote in business history. The

circumstances of Intel’s founding are not an exception. Bhide [2000, p.94] reports that 71% of the

firms included in the Inc 500 (a list of young, fast growing firms) were founded by people who

replicated or modified an idea encountered in their previous employment. The phenomenon has

also been important in the past. Many during the Industrial Revolution, including Arkwright who

“invented” the water frame, appropriated rather than discovered the technological advances their

names are associated with (Hall [1998, p. 310-347]).

   A simple example will help clarify the basic trade-off. Consider a master watchmaker in a

small town who has a more productive technology to make watches. The watchmaker would like

to produce with as many managers as possible. For now, there are two candidates for employment,

Ram and Pietro. The watchmaker knows that Ram or Pietro may expropriate her technology

and set up manufacture on their own. Also, the town is small so that there is room for only one

watchmaker, and since there are scale economies in advertising, the watchmaker who can produce

the most will prevail in any competition. Two factors will determine how much a watchmaker can

produce - how much of the technology she knows, and how many managers she has working for

her.

   The watchmaker will certainly perform the tasks that are at the core of her new technology

herself so that the others do not directly learn how they are done. But she has to interact with

the managers. She has two ways of offering access to herself and the technology. She can have

Ram and Pietro interact only with her (see Figure I). We call this the horizontal hierarchy because

Ram and Pietro are equidistant from the watchmaker and her technology, and the watchmaker



                                                 2
mediates all transactions within the organization. An alternative way is for the watchmaker to

interact only with Pietro (or Ram), and ask Ram to report to Pietro (see Figure II). This is the

vertical hierarchy where there is a chain of employees with the watchmaker at the top, and only

Pietro sees the watchmaker and her technology.

   Once hired, managers can either attempt to expropriate the technology and compete (a combi-

nation of actions we will term “compete”), or they can learn to perform the tasks their immediate

superior has assigned them (i.e., specialize). Because superiors assign subordinates to tasks that

complement their own skills, managers, once specialized, are useless without their superior and

can be productive only in a team that contains the superior. Managers who neither specialize nor

compete are useless in production.

   When managers interact directly with the watchmaker, they can observe her technology at close

quarters, though not perfectly. While the watchmaker can get a marginal product of 1 from each

manager in her team (and from herself), a manager operating with the expropriated technology

can produce only 0.75. Therefore, 75 percent is (for now) the degree of expropriability of the

technology and is a measure of the difficulty of enforcing property rights. Managers who do not

interact directly with the watchmaker cannot expropriate the technology and will specialize if they

get enough from doing so.

   Finally, we need to specify how output is divided among members of a team. Let us assume

that output in a production team is shared through bargaining from bottom up, with each manager

getting half of what he produces and half of what his subordinates send up - unless he happens to

be senior most in which case he gets everything that is sent up (we will describe the bargaining

game more formally later).

   Now let us consider managerial incentives in each organizational form. In the horizontal hierar-
                                                             1
chy, each manager produces 1 after specializing, and keeps   2   of it. A manager could also compete.



                                                 3
However, since the managers interact indirectly with each other via the watchmaker, they cannot

produce with each other as a team if the watchmaker does not join. So a manager who decides to

compete will have to produce with the stolen technology on his own. He can produce 0.75, but to

be able to generate this output he will first have to survive the competition. Since the watchmaker

can produce 1 on her own, she will prevail in any competition. As a result, the manager will

anticipate getting nothing if he competes, and instead, will prefer specializing.

   By forcing all interactions to go through the watchmaker, the horizontal hierarchy divides the

managers, in such a way that they will be easily defeated by the watchmaker even if they do

expropriate the technology. This allows the watchmaker to rule effectively. Landes [1986] argues

that organizations were, in fact, structured thus: “..patents were not always the best way to protect

knowledge. Instead, inventors preferred to try and keep devices and techniques secret, sometimes

by so dividing the process that no one worker could penetrate the technique. This is what the

great watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet proposed to do when he planned the mass production

of watches... the aim was ..security”.

   Matters are different in the vertical hierarchy. Ram cannot expropriate since Pietro is between

him and the watchmaker. Ram will specialize to Pietro if specialization is relatively costless. But

Pietro is in a very different position. If he specializes, he will keep half of the $1 he produces plus
              1
half of the   2   Ram gives up for a total of 34 . Pietro gets more than Ram, we will see, because the

vertical hierarchy gives him positional power – Ram is productive for the watchmaker only if Pietro

also joins them. This gives Pietro some bargaining power. Despite his positional power, however,

Pietro will compete because Ram will follow him out (since Ram is useless in any production team

without Pietro). Together with Ram, Pietro can produce a total of 1.5 if he competes. Since this is

greater than what the watchmaker can produce on her own, Pietro’s team will win the competition.

Moreover, Pietro only has to give Ram half of what Ram produces (=0.5*0.75) as compensation,



                                                    4
leaving 1.125 for himself.

   We immediately see that the incentive for managers to compete is higher in the vertical hierarchy

because superior managers – and not the watchmaker – command the loyalty of subordinates. The

strength of their bench allows them to offset the technological advantage of the watchmaker, and

win the competition. Note, however, that if the degree of expropriability of the technology were

lower - less than 50 percent – Pietro would prefer to specialize.

   Thus far, the horizontal hierarchy seems to dominate because the tactic of divide and conquer

is so effective. But the horizontal hierarchy “works” because managers have no positional power

whatsoever. While this is of little consequence when specialization costs managers little, it is

more problematic when costs are high. To see why, let the one-time personal cost to managers

of specialization be 1.01, and let each manager be able to work for two periods before retiring.

Finally, let the resource have a lower degree of expropriability, say 0.49.

   Now managers in the horizontal hierarchy will not specialize (though they will not expropriate

either). This is because each period, their position gives them a payoff of only 12 , for a total of 1

over two periods, which is less than the cost of specialization. While, the relative lack of managerial

power in a horizontal hierarchy works well to prevent expropriation, it provides poor incentives for

the manager to specialize.

   Even a vertical hierarchy does not seem possible since higher costs of specialization make

competing still more attractive than specialization. In particular, assuming Ram specializes, Pietro

does not want to specialize even though expropriability is at a level that ensured specialization when

the costs of specialization were zero. By specializing, Pietro gets 2∗ 34 −1.01 = 0.49 over two periods,

while he gets 2 ∗ 0.49 ∗ 1.5 = 1.47 by competing.2

   There is a way, however, for the entrepreneur to use both Ram and Pietro in the vertical

organization, though not in the first period. In the example thus far, Pietro will compete because



                                                   5
he is already in a position of power, with Ram below him, when he is required to specialize. Instead,

the watchmaker should employ only Pietro in the first period. Pietro alone cannot overcome the
                                                                                           1
watchmaker in competition. So he can either do nothing, or specialize and get              2   immediately.

In addition, Pietro knows that once he specializes, he will lose the incentive to compete in the

second period (we know from earlier that if expropriability is less than 50 percent, and if Pietro

does not have to incur the cost of specialization, he is loyal even with Ram as a subordinate). The

watchmaker will then be willing to trust him in the second period and will bring Ram in below
                                                                                                         3
him as in Figure II. This structure will give Pietro positional power and enable him to get              4.

                                 1
Anticipating a total payoff of   2   + 43 over two periods, Pietro will specialize at the outset. Moreover,

since Pietro can work only two periods, Ram will anticipate his turn at power in period 3, and also

specialize and so on...3

   Therefore, by restricting access initially to the technology to Pietro alone, the watchmaker

can obtain Pietro’s specialization. Pietro can then be entrusted with more positional power even

though he would have chosen to compete if placed in that position when unspecialized. A specialized

manager is more loyal, and a watchmaker with specialized managers can produce more than one

starting anew. Specialized employees become a critical resource in their own right that grow slowly

in number over time, even though nothing in the technology prevents infinite employees from being

hired and specializing at one go. The hierarchy evolves through specialization into something more

than a collection of people and resources.

   Finally, there is a way to give managers in the horizontal hierarchy the incentive to specialize

when specialization is costly, despite their impotence. It is to promise them potential participation

in the rents from ownership of the critical resource if they specialize. The watchmaker will ensure

an adequate rent to managers by limiting the number who have access and thus can bid for

ownership. Moreover, when the critical resource is highly expropriable, the watchmaker’s promise



                                                       6
to sell is credible because it is very difficult for her to run the hierarchy as an inactive owner once

her two periods of active life are over. Thus the model not only suggests why organizations like

legal and consulting partnerships – where assets like client relationships are hard to protect - are

flat, but also indicates what limits their size.

   In sum, our model suggests that in the formative stages of a business, an entrepreneur uses

control over access to the resource and specialized employees, as well as the allocation of ownership

over the resource to design the right balance of power between herself and her managers. Too much

power to managers will destabilize her own position, too little will give them little interest in the

well being of the firm. In the vertical hierarchy, the entrepreneur controls access to the critical

resource so as draw forth specialization, and then uses specialized employees strategically to control

the actions of new employees. In the horizontal hierarchy, the entrepreneur limits access not just

to limit the current power of employees, but also to give them confidence that if they specialize,

they will be among a select few that will have a chance to own the organization. The relative

abilities of these two distinctive structures to approach the technological production possibility

frontier depends on the parameters of the model, and results in a variety of empirical implications.

   The rest of the paper is as follows. In section I we lay out the framework. In section II we

analyze vertical hierarchies in a simplified three-period model. The steady-state solution is derived

in section III, while in section IV, we analyze the path to the steady state. In section V, we

study horizontal hierarchies and compare them with vertical ones. In section VI, we discuss the

implications of our model for a theory of the firm. Conclusions follow.

                                        I.    Framework

   We consider an overlapping generations world where each agent has two periods of physically

active life, a period when they are “young” and one when they are “old”. After these two periods,

they retire and can, at best, exert control rights (which we shall define momentarily) for the rest


                                                   7
of his (or her) life. After retirement, an agent has a constant probability γ of surviving the next

period. Everyone is risk neutral.

     An agent called the entrepreneur, possesses a valuable resource that she wants to exploit. She

needs “managers” to produce on a large scale. Many managers are born every period.

A.     Technology

Since our focus is not on the technological limits to organizational size, we assume the production

function is linear with each active agent contributing a unit of output. The total production of a

team composed of an active entrepreneur and n managers equals n + 1.4


B.     Sequence of events each period

The sequence of events is described in Figure III. At the beginning of the period, the agent who

controls the resource determines the hierarchy of access to it.5 Then, the managers who are

granted access choose whether to specialize or compete. If any manager decides to compete, the

original hierarchy breaks up into competing teams. Only the team that can produce the most

survives. Finally, all the members of the successful team bargain over future surplus and sign

sharing contracts. At the end of the period, production takes place and the payoff to each contract

is distributed.


C.     Access

Following Rajan and Zingales [1998], we define access as the ability to use, or work with, the critical

resource. Only a team of managers that has direct or indirect access to the resource can produce.

Future access is not contractible.6

     We will assume that one active agent (and at most one agent), has to have direct access

to the resource. Call this agent the head. Other managers can have indirect access by having



                                                  8
access to the head, or access to a manager who has access to the head and so on... The more

layers of management between a manager and the resource, the less access he has. We start by

examining vertical hierarchies of access where each manager has access to at most one member of

the production team who is closer to the resource (his superior) and one manager who is further

(his subordinate). If we define the head to be tier 1 then a manager’s tier, t, is uniquely defined

as one plus the tier of his superior. Figure IV depicts a vertical hierarchy with the entrepreneur as

the head and four additional managers.


D.       Specialization

Managers can add value to a team only after they specialize, that is, after they familiarize themselves

with the resource (which is why they need some access) and learn to work with their superior in

the production team. A manager’s cost of specializing is cS . Since the cost of specialization (or

training) for new recruits exceeds their value to the firm (see, for example, the evidence in Harhoff

and Kane [1993] and the literature cited in Prendergast [1999]), and managers produce at most 1,

we assume:

     Assumption 1: cS > 1

     A manager who specialized to a superior in the past does not need to specialize again if he

has the same superior this period, since he already knows the superior and is familiar with the

resource. The head does not have a superior, and does not have to specialize if he did so in the

past.7


E.    Competition

Access also provides a manager with the opportunity to appropriate the critical resource. A

manager could grab the resource and compete with the entrepreneur instead of specializing. His

subordinates have no choice but to follow him since they are specialized to him.8


                                                  9
   Suppose a manager in tier k decides to compete. Together with his n − k subordinates, he can

produce Λk (n − k + 1) where Λk is the degree of expropriability in tier k. The further the manager

is from the resource, the less he can expropriate, so Λk < Λj < 1 for all k > j > 0, and Λ for the

entrepreneur is 1. In order that competition be a serious threat, we will assume that:
                         1
   Assumption 2: Λk >    2   for all k > 0.

The personal cost to the manager of competing is cR .9 If a manager k decides to compete, all costs

in subsequent periods for his production team are also multiplied by Λk , indicating the stolen

resource is proportionally as hard to specialize to, or to appropriate. This preserves the symmetry

of the problem.

   After the initial sub period when managers choose simultaneously to specialize, do nothing,

or compete, there is no time to train additional managers before production takes place. So in

Figure IV, if manager M3 decides to compete while the rest specialize, there are two feasible

production teams: the first is headed by the entrepreneur, E, with subordinate manager M2 and

it can produce 2, and the second is headed by manager M3 with subordinates M4 and M5 and it

can produce 3Λ3 .

   To simplify the dynamics, we assume extreme economies of scale in marketing, which result

in a winner-take-all market where only the most productive team is successful and survives the

competition. So, in the example above, the team headed by the entrepreneur will survive if 2 ≥ 3Λ3 ,

else the team headed by M3 will survive. We break ties in favor of the incumbent head.

   We want to study how organizations emerge even in the most primitive economy, where con-

tracts are not easily enforced and sophisticated commitment mechanisms are not available. For

this reason we follow the incomplete contract literature (e.g., Grossman and Hart [1986]) in as-

suming that the end-of-period payoff from production is not contractible until immediately before

production begins. As a result, just before a successful team is ready to produce, the members will



                                                10
have to bargain about their respective shares of output.


F.     Bargaining

We assume the bargaining game to have the following extensive form. The manager at the bottom

of the hierarchy bargains with a unified coalition of his direct and indirect superiors over the total

surplus. The share the coalition gets from this first stage of bargaining is then further subdivided

through bargaining, between the manager at the bottom of this coalition and a unified coalition of

his superiors. This carries on until the highest member of the hierarchy bargains with the second

highest and divides the residual.

      In the bargaining between the coalition of superiors and the manager, the outside option of

the coalition is to produce without the manager (and his subordinates). The outside option of

the manager is to obtain a wage of 1 − θ elsewhere.10 If a manager does not join the production

team, none of his subordinates are of use to the team. This is because it is he who mediates their

interaction with the rest of the hierarchy.


G.      Outcome of Bargaining

Consider first a hierarchy with n managers where the entrepreneur has retired. Total production

is also n since the entrepreneur contributes no labor. Now let us see how this surplus is split.

      The lowest manager, Mn , with reservation value (1 − θ), bargains with the coalition formed by

higher tiers, who have a collective reservation value equal to n − 1 (the value they produce on their

own without this last manager). Splitting the incremental value he adds evenly, he gets11



                                     1               1             θ
(1)                              πn = [n − (n − 1)] + [1 − θ] = 1 − .
                                     2               2             2

        θ
Thus    2   is the portion of the lowest manager’s production the coalition of superiors gets because of



                                                    11
their control over the critical resource, and their total surplus is (n − 1) + 2θ . The lowest manager

of this coalition, Mn−1 , then bargains with his superiors and he gets πn−1 = 12 [(n − 1 + 2θ ) − (n −

2)] + 12 [1 − θ] = 1 − 4θ .

      Manager Mn−1 gets more than manager Mn because only when Mn−1 joins the production

team will the hierarchy above him be able to use his subordinate, manager Mn . Thus manager

Mn−1 can extract half the surplus (i.e., half of θ/2) that manager Mn sends up because he controls

his subordinate’s access.12

      Manager Mk ’s payoff in a hierarchy with n working managers is (see appendix):


                                                                 θ
(2)                                              πk = 1 −              .
                                                              2n−k+1


      A manager who controls access to more subordinates, n−k, has more positional power, and thus

more rents. Note that the manager’s payoff does not depend at all on the number of his superiors.

This simplifies the analysis considerably.         13   Also, the average pay of employees increases in the

size of the hierarchy, n, implying our model is consistent with the finding (e.g., Brown, Hamilton,

Medoff [1990]) that larger firms pay higher wages on average.

      The retired entrepreneur’s payoff is the residual amount, which is easily shown to be


                                                        n
                                                        X                   1
(3)                                       E(n) = n −          πj = θ(1 −      ).
                                                        j=1
                                                                           2n


Thus, and quite naturally, the retired entrepreneur’s rents increase as managers’ reservation wage

(1 − θ) decreases. The entrepreneur’s payoff if she is active and heads n − 1 managers can be

obtained by simply adding her rents from control of the resource to the payoff she would get

as the top active manager, the rents to her human capital. Thus her payoff if she is active is
         1               θ
θ(1 −   2n )   + (1 −   2n ).   Since E(n) − E(n − 1) > 0, the entrepreneur’s payoff increases in n. This



                                                          12
implies that in the absence of any other consideration, the entrepreneur would set the length of

the hierarchy to its first best value, i.e., infinity.

     The two important features of this bargaining structure are: i) for a given size of the hierarchy a

manager’s rent increases as his position moves up the hierarchy; ii) for a given position, a manager’s

rent increases in the number of subordinates. These features are more general than the particular

bargaining structure in which they are derived. They come from the hierarchy of access, which gives

managers positional power: Since only continuous chains of specialized managers are productive,

intermediate managers get some rent because they are indispensable links to lower managers.


H.     The Entrepreneur’s Problem

The entrepreneur’s objective is to maximize the present value of the rents she will get. Long

term compensation contracts cannot be credibly committed to, so managerial compensation will

be determined by bargaining, which in turn depends on the skills acquired by the manager and

their role in the hierarchy of access.14 The entrepreneur therefore can shape managerial incentives

only through organizational structure. We have already examined one tool she can use, control

over access, which she uses every period. Another tool entrepreneurs have when they start out is

the extent to which their organization is differentiated.

     The entrepreneur often can determine the extent to which the manager is mobile. For example,

among equally productive technologies, the entrepreneur can choose one that is more unique,

making it harder for an un-cooperative manager to find a job elsewhere. She can locate far away

from comparable employment so that the manager has to relocate completely if he quits (e.g.,

Rodriguez, [1999]). She can make the organization’s culture distinctive so that managers get

disutility working elsewhere. This ability of the entrepreneur to “differentiate” the technology,

location, or culture will be reflected in the specialized manager’s reservation wage conditional on

specializing. Specialization will take the manager’s reservation wage from zero to (1 − θ), where θ

                                                     13
is the extent of differentiation chosen by the entrepreneur and 1 ≥ θ > θ ≥ 0. Since differentiation

is based on factors like technology that are typically hard to alter, we assume the entrepreneur

picks it once and for all at the outset.

   Having determined the degree of differentiation at the outset, the entrepreneur will choose

access each period – which includes setting both the number of managers who have access and

also who reports to whom – so that the maximum number of managers will all specialize; more

specialized managers this period implies more production, and since managers can always be let go

next period, it poses no constraints on future production. Since the cost of specialization exceeds

the maximum possible single period rent any position in the hierarchy can offer, unspecialized

managers will be given access only when they are young. Furthermore, an old manager will be

given access only if he specialized in the past, and he can be placed as the head this period or

below his former superior (else his past specialization is wasted and he has no incentive to specialize

again). Also, the entrepreneur will not want to allow access to any manager who is expected to

break away and compete since that manager (and his subordinates) are useless to the entrepreneur’s

production team, even assuming they are not successful in the competition.

   Most issues of organizational design can be examined in a simple three period model. This is

where we start.


                            II.    The Three Period Model

   Let the world last for three periods and assume that the hierarchy reaches its large but finite

steady-state length N in the third period. The steady state length, which we will derive formally

later, turns out to be the maximum size the hierarchy can reach. For now, it gives us a simple

terminal condition. Let nt be the number of managers who get access for the first time in period

t and specialize.




                                                  14
A.     Managerial Incentives

A manager will not choose to compete if he expects his team to lose the winner-take-all competition

against the entrepreneur and her followers. Call this the competition constraint (CC). Even condi-

tional on expecting to win, he will not compete if he expects less surplus from doing so than from

specializing. Call this the conditional incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. Only one of these

constraints has to hold for the manager not to compete. Also, in his initial period the manager

should prefer to specialize and get a rent rather than do nothing and get nothing (IR constraint).

The entrepreneur will use differences in these constraints across managers and over time to build

the hierarchy.


B.     Incentives at date 2

Let us proceed by backward induction, and examine the incentives at date 2 first. The n1 managers

who specialized at date 1 are now old but still active. They are useful only if they are placed

immediately below the still active entrepreneur in the same order that they were in last period – if

any of these managers ends up with a different superior than in the past, he will have to specialize

again. Since the one-period payoff does not compensate for the cost, he will not specialize and will

render everyone below him useless to the hierarchy this period.

     Of course, some or all the old managers could be fired at date 2 starting from the managers

at the bottom. Let n01 ≤ n1 old managers be retained at date 2, and placed in their date-1 order

immediately below the active entrepreneur. The n2 young unspecialized managers who have a cost

cS of specialization will be placed after this.

     We want to find conditions under which all managers specialize. If all specialize, the length

of the productive team will be 1 + n01 + n2 because the entrepreneur is still active. Assuming all

others specialize, a manager in tier k knows if he competes, he and his 1 + n01 + n2 − k subordinates



                                                  15
will be defeated by the k − 1 member team consisting of his superiors and the entrepreneur if



                                 (CCS2 )          Λk (2 + n01 + n2 − k) < k − 1.



   The fear of being defeated is least for the highest manager in the hierarchy (k=2); he has the

most access, carries the most subordinates out with him if he competes, and only has to defeat the

solitary entrepreneur. In fact, our assumptions ensure that the highest old manager will defeat the

entrepreneur if he competes.15

   The only reason then that he will specialize is if he gets more doing so then competing. For an

old specialized manager in tier k this requires


                      θ                              1                         θ                            1
  (ICS2 ) [1 −       0          ] ≥ Λk [θ(1 −       0          ) + (1 −       0          )] + γΛk [θ(1 −      )] − cR .
                 22+n1 +n2 −k                   22+n1 +n2 −k              22+n1 +n2 −k                     2N


   The left-hand side is the manager’s rent from working for the hierarchy for the last period of

his active life. The right hand side is the expected payoff from competing, where the first term is

the break away manager’s rent this period from control of the appropriated resource, the second

is his rent from his own human capital, the third is his rent in the third period when he will be

retired, but will still control the resource.

   From assumption 2, it is easily seen that the right hand side of (ICS2 ) will increase faster with

the number of the manager’s subordinates, 1 + n01 + n2 − k than the left hand side.16 Therefore,

the old specialized manager with the greatest incentive to breakaway and compete is again the one

with the greatest number of subordinates, i.e., the one just below the active entrepreneur in tier

k = 2. It turns out, however, that so long as the hierarchy’s size is less than the steady state size,

N , this constraint will not bind. The reason is that in steady state at date 3, the old head will

have more subordinates and be closer to the resource (because the entrepreneur will have retired)


                                                         16
than any old manager at date 2. Since in steady state the head will not compete, it must be that

no old manager wants to compete at date 2.

    This implies that at date 2 the only limit to the size of the hierarchy is imposed by the incentives

of the young, unspecialized managers. For them to specialize rather than compete, either they

should not expect to survive the winner-take-all competition or they should expect to get less from

competing even if they survive. Consider the latter condition first. From arguments similar to

ones above, the young manager with the greatest incentive to compete is the one who is placed

highest in his incoming cohort of n2 managers, i.e., in tier 2 + n01 . Since the entrepreneur, and all

managers who entered at date 1, retire at date 3, this manager will become the head at date 3 if

he specializes. He specializes if


                 θ           θ                        1           θ                     1          θ
(ICU 2 ) [1 −       ] + [1 − N ] − cS ≥ Λ2+n01 [θ(1 − n2 ) + (1 − n2 )] + Λ2+n01 [θ(1 − N ) + (1 − N )] − cR .
                2n2         2                        2           2                     2          2


Comparing (ICU 2 ) with (ICS2 ), it is easy to see that (ICU 2 ) may be violated even when (ICS2 )

is not. The left hand side of (ICU 2 ), which is the young unspecialized manager’s payoff if he

specializes, includes two extra terms relative to an old manager’s payoff (the left hand side of

(ICS2 )). First, since the old are in their final working period in the organization, they do not get

rents next period (because they will retire). By contrast, a young manager has one more period

in the hierarchy after the current one in which he can earn a rent. While this effect alone would

give the young manager more incentive to specialize, the young manager also incurs the cost of

specialization. Since this cost exceeds any single period rent, the net benefit from specialization is

relatively lower for the unspecialized young than for the specialized old in the same position.

    Also the right-hand sides differ. The benefit from competing is relatively higher for the un-

specialized young because the young manager will be active in the third period, and expects the

high rents from his own human capital (in addition to the rents from the control over the resource


                                                       17
which are also enjoyed by an old manager who competes). Taking both sides together, in any given

position in the hierarchy, young unspecialized managers have a higher incentive to compete than

old specialized managers. Therefore, (ICU 2 ) may be violated even if (ICS2 ) is satisfied.

   If so, the only reason young managers will not compete is if they do not expect to win the

competition. Again, the highest young manager has the greatest likelihood of success because he

is closest to the critical resource, and has the greatest number of subordinates below him. He will

lose the winner-take-all competition if



            (CCU 2 )                                   Λ2+n01 n2 < 1 + n01 .



   The left hand side is the amount the young unspecialized manager can produce with the rest

of his cohort who follow him, the right hand side is the amount the entrepreneur can produce with

the loyal old managers. Either (ICU 2 ) or (CCU 2 ) has to be satisfied for the young manager not

to compete. So only one of the constraints will (generically) be binding, a fact that will greatly

simplify the ex ante maximization problem.

   It is now easy to see why specialized old managers are placed above unspecialized young man-

agers in the hierarchy. Old managers benefit less than the young by competing, hence they are

better suited to occupy the higher positions in the hierarchy where the incentive to compete is high-

est. Interestingly, such a policy of access also improves the incentive of the unspecialized young.

For a given length of hierarchy, this policy ensures the highest young manager has the fewest possi-

ble subordinates, and is furthest away from the resource. Not only does such a policy give him the

lowest return from competing even if successful, it also decreases his chance of being successful since

the entrepreneur will be supported by the loyal Praetorian Guard of the specialized. As a result,

the policy allows the entrepreneur to hire the most young. It follows that the number of specialized

managers retained at the top of the hierarchy at date 2 is the entire number who specialized in


                                                  18
the first period, i.e., n01 = n1 . In the appendix, we show more generally that a seniority-based

promotion policy where all specialized old managers are retained and placed in their prior-period

order above unspecialized young managers provides managers the best incentives. Thus, we have


Proposition 1. The level of production that can be achieved from any point in time onwards

       by a vertical hierarchy weakly, and sometimes strictly, increases in the number of managers

       who are active at that point and made specific investments in the past.


     Now let us examine incentives at date 1.


C.     Incentives in period 1

The hierarchy starts out in the first period, so all managers are unspecialized and young. The

incentive constraints of the young manager immediately below the entrepreneur will be tightest,

and we can write them as


                                  θ              θ                       1           θ
              (ICU 1 )   [1 −      n
                                      ] + [1 − n1 +n2 ] − cS ≥ Λ2 [θ(1 − n1 ) + (1 − n1 )]+
                                 2  1         2                         2           2

                                    1                    θ                         1
                     Λ2 [θ(1 −         R   ) + (1 −         R   )] + γΛ2 [θ(1 −      )] − cR .
                                 2n1 +n2              2n1 +n2                     2N




                 (CCU 1 )                                          Λ2 n1 < 1.



where nR
       2 is the number of young managers who will be given access at date 2 by the manager who

successfully breaks away at date 1. Since only one of these constraints has to be satisfied, the one

that is satisfied with the most number of managers n1 will be the limiting one.




                                                        19
D.     IR constraint

Finally, we have ignored IR constraints thus far. A manager’s rents increase as the number of

subordinates below him increases. Thus, the manager who is at the bottom of the hierarchy today

expects the lowest rents of his cohort if he specializes because the rest of his cohort will continue to

be placed above him in the future. Therefore, the relevant IR constraint is that of the lowest young

manager. Moreover, since the number of young hired increases over time, promotional prospects

improve, and the most binding IR constraint is of the lowest unspecialized young manager in the

first period which is17


                                                      θ          θ
            (IR)                                  [1 − ] + [1 − n2 +1 ] ≥ cS .
                                                      2        2


E.    The Entrepreneur’s Maximization Problem.

We can now write down the entrepreneur’s maximization problem


                       1             θ                1                 θ                  1
        max θ(1 −          ) + (1 − 1+n1 ) + [θ(1 − 1+n1 +n2 ) + (1 − 1+n1 +n2 )] + γθ(1 − N )
       θ, n1 , n2    21+n1         2               2                 2                    2


     subject to the managers having the incentives to specialize, i.e, s.t.

     (1) CCU 1 or ICU 1

     (2) CCU 2 or ICU 2

     (3) IR

     Now consider two important cases.


F.    Case 1: Uniformly high threat of competition in hierarchy.

Let expropriability, Λ, be high and constant with distance from the resource because all managers

need significant access in order to function. This would be the case for example, in a firm where

                                                   20
the critical resource is an idea or code that all managers need to know to be productive. The only

way to prevent managers from competing is to convince them they cannot be successful in the

winner-take-all competition. The relevant constraints in this case are (CCU 1 ), (CCU 2 ), and IR.

    Let the Int operator be the greatest integer less than its argument. Then CCU 1 implies n∗1 =

Int[ Λ1 ] = 1 because Λ >   1
                            2   by assumption 2. So the entrepreneur will hire only one young manager

at date 1, because more will overwhelm her in competition. In period 2, the entrepreneur is

confident of her own loyalty as well as this employee’s loyalty, so CCU 2 indicates she can hire

n∗2 = Int[ Λ2 ] ≥ 2.

    At the outset, the entrepreneur would like to set the degree of differentiation, θ, as high as

possible so as to extract the most rents from the managers. So the optimal degree of differentiation,

θ∗ , will be set so that managers are left with enough to just satisfy the IR constraint. Interestingly,

the necessity of motivating early employees may set in place a degree of differentiation that will

persist long after the original rationale vanishes.

    Ignoring integer constraints, the comparative statics are (all proofs are in the Appendix)


Proposition 2. (i) dn∗2 /dΛ ≤ 0; (ii) dθ∗ /dΛ ≤ 0.


    The first result is obvious: the hierarchy is kept small when expropriability increases so that

the entrepreneur and loyal specialized managers can keep the young unspecialized in check. More

interestingly, the reduced size of the date-2 hierarchy will decrease promotional prospects. The

entrepreneur will then be forced to give employees a greater share of every unit produced so

that they continue to have the incentive to specialize. Thus, when expropriability increases, the

entrepreneur is forced to lower the degree of differentiation, and her rents decrease even further.

    Proposition 2 throws some light on Saxenian’s [1996] comparison between computer industry

firms along Route 128 in Massachusetts and in Silicon Valley, California. Route 128 firms tended

to be large, vertically integrated organizations with very distinctive cultures. There was very little

                                                    21
lateral movement between these organizations. In Silicon Valley, by contrast, firms were smaller,

and possessed a more homogenous culture, with a lot of fraternizing and job hopping.

     Saxenian provides a sociological interpretation of these findings, contrasting the buttoned-down,

risk-averse East Coast culture with the more casual and risk- loving West. While we do not deny

these aspects may have played a role, we can provide an explanation based more on economics.

Since in the computer industry the main critical resource is ideas, the degree of expropriability

is potentially very high. Computer firms are very much aware of this problem and require their

employees to sign non-compete clauses. But California, unlike Massachusetts, has a historical

tradition of not enforcing these clauses. This institutional difference represents a rare case of an

exogenous difference in expropriability in the same industry. Consistent with the predictions of

Proposition 2, in Massachusetts where expropriability is lower, organizations are bigger and show

more differentiated technologies and culture – as evidenced by the lower job mobility across firms.

     Thus, better enforcement of property rights (lower Λ) can tilt rents towards the entrepreneur

– since she does not have to provide as much in incentives to ward off potential breakaway, she

can differentiate more to extract surplus from worker-managers. This might appear to vindicate

Marx’s position that the enforcement of private ownership claims to capital enables capitalists to

“exploit” workers (see Roemer [1988] for a lucid exposition). However, this comparative statics

result can be reversed in other circumstances as we will now see.


G.     Case 2: High threat of competition in close positions

Consider now a firm where only the managers in direct contact with the resource have sufficient

access to appropriate while expropriability falls off dramatically with distance. This is the case,

for example, in a firm where client relationships are the key resource. Only the partner dealing

with clients has an ability to walk off with them, while the lowly associate who does all the ground

work has no contact with clients and little ability to expropriate. In particular, if Λ2 is very high,

                                                  22
the CC constraint will bind in period 1. This implies that n1 = 1; only one manager will be

given access. But because this manager will specialize, he can loyally fill the position in period 2

without competing. Since expropriability is lower for the remaining subordinate positions, the IC

constraint rather than the CC constraint is likely to bind. Substituting n1 = 1 in (ICU 2 ), ignoring

the IR constraint for the moment, and solving the maximization problem (see appendix), we get a

bang-bang solution. The optimal degree of differentiation, θ∗ is 1 if


                                             1                            1
(4)                       γ[4Λ3 − 2][1 −      N
                                                ] + [4Λ3 − 3] + (2Λ3 − 1) N ≥ 0,
                                            2                            2


and θ∗ = θ otherwise. Given θ∗ , n∗2 is the maximum value consistent with (ICU 2 ).

      The entrepreneur’s profits increase both in the number of managers n2 and the extent of differ-

entiation, θ. However, as size increases, the highest young manager will have more subordinates,

and therefore more incentive to compete. Similarly, an increase in differentiation not only gives the

young manager less incentive to specialize, but also increases his surplus conditional on winning

the competition – more differentiation is a double-edged sword since it concentrates rents on the

possessor of the critical resource, thus making expropriation more attractive. Since (ICU 2 ) becomes

tighter as either θ or n2 increase, θ∗ and n∗2 are strategic substitutes.

      Condition (4) simply indicates when the entrepreneur gets more bang for the buck by increasing

θ. Since the left hand side of (4) increases in Λ3 , θ∗ increases in Λ3 , so n∗2 must decrease to keep

inequality (ICU 2 ) satisfied. Therefore,


Proposition 3. (i) dθ∗ /dΛ3 ≥ 0; (ii) dn∗2 /dΛ3 ≤ 0.


      Now with better property rights (lower Λ3 ), the profit maximizing entrepreneur will increase

the size of the organization, thus increasing the societal pie. But, in order to preserve manage-

rial incentives not to compete in a longer hierarchy, she will have to reduce the rents (lower θ)


                                                     23
she extracts off each manager. Thus, stricter enforcement of the entrepreneur’s private property

rights can lead to more surplus for worker-managers, and in contrast to the previous case, less

“exploitation”.

     We ignored the IR constraint in determining the above solution. If IR is satisfied at the optimal,

then it will have no effect. If not, the trade-off will move in favor of n∗2 at the expense of θ∗ , since

a longer date-2 hierarchy will improve anticipated promotional prospects at date 1, while a lower

θ will tilt rents towards the manager.


H.     Discussion

In the literature there are two main roles for promotion (see Prendergast [1999] for an excellent

survey): as a way for the firm to allocate more talented workers to higher positions with greater

marginal influence (e.g., Rosen [1982]), or as a reward for performance (e.g., Lazear and Rosen

[1981], Rosen [1986]). Talented workers are not necessarily the most senior ones, but seniority may

be a useful and objective index of talent that reduces influence activities (Milgrom and Roberts

[1990]). In our model, however, we abstract from issues of productivity – all managers are equally

productive. Promotion is then simply a way of filling sensitive positions with the loyal.

     Interestingly, concern about expropriation enables the hierarchy to commit to rewarding spe-

cialization, and we do not have to rely on repeated games to explain why the firm does not renege

on promised promotions(see Bull [1987]). In this, our work resembles that of Lazear [1981] or

Akerlof and Katz [1989] who argue that deferred compensation paid to older workers also serves as

an incentive for younger workers. Our work, however, differs in that compensation emerges from

the endogenous organizational structure rather than as part of an optimal pay package. Thus, it

does not require any exogenous source of commitment by the firm.

     The upward-sloped profile of wages is also consistent with Becker [1975], who points out that

a reduced initial salary is a way for young workers to post a bond for the training provided by the

                                                   24
firm. In our model, however, it is the worker who bears the cost of the initial training, and his low

wage is simply a reflection of his low bargaining power, while his upward wage profile indicates his

growing power in the firm.

   In the interests of space, we skip other cases in the three period model that add little additional

insight. We now examine the steady state.


                              III.    The Limits to Growth

   The artificial end-date prevented us from determining a steady state in the previous section.

We remedy this now by reverting to the infinite period world.

   We define a steady state equilibrium as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the game where the

state (the number of old specialized managers) is repeated every period.18 We solve for the steady

state equilibrium in Markov strategies assuming that there are no constraints on the initial state, so

that the entrepreneur can start out with any number of specialized old managers. If the hierarchy

can progress beyond initial growth traps (see later), this will indeed be the ultimate size of the

hierarchy.

   In a steady state equilibrium, each cohort will have equal size. There will be an equal number

of specialized managers above the highest entering young manager, and he can never win in com-

petition against them because Λ < 1. Therefore, the only limit to the size of the organization is

that the IC constraint should hold for the specialized head manager. Let n∗ (θ) = [log{[θΛ1 (2 −

γ)/(1 − γ) − 1]/[Λ1 (1 + θ − γ)/(1 − γ) − 1 − cR ]}]/2log2. Then,

Proposition 4. The vertical hierarchy has a cohort size in steady state Markov Perfect equilibrium

      of (i) nV = ∞ if cR ≥ Λ1 (2 + θ − γ))/(1 − γ) − 1 (ii) nV = n∗ if cR < Λ1 (2 + θ − γ)/(1 − γ) − 1.


   If the condition in (i) holds, then the IC constraint for the highest old manager always holds

regardless of the hierarchy’s length. Hence the hierarchy’s steady state length is infinity. Otherwise,



                                                  25
the head manager cannot have more than a certain number below him, else he will compete. This

is the situation in (ii).

      This result has been obtained conditional on a given choice of the level of differentiation. An

entrepreneur who wants to maximize the long run steady state level of profit will choose θ to

maximize the present discounted value of future profits, i.e., she will solve



                                                  1          1
(5)                                      max         θ[1 − 2nV (θ) ].
                                           θ     1−γ      2

We then have

                            (1−Λ1 +cR )(1−γ)                                                  (1−Λ1 +cR )(1−γ)
Proposition 5. If θ ≥              Λ1          then θ? = θ and nV (θ) = n∗ , otherwise θ? =          Λ1

        and nV = ∞.


      Intuitively, it is more profitable for the entrepreneur to increase the steady state size of the

hierarchy by reducing θ than to squeeze more out of each manager by increasing θ. Therefore, so

long as the size of the hierarchy is less than infinity, the entrepreneur will reduce θ to its minimum

possible level. Of course, if the potential size of the hierarchy reaches infinity at some level of θ

above θ, the entrepreneur has no need to reduce θ further. In short, the entrepreneur differentiates

the vertical hierarchy minimally.

      When θ∗ = θ (and the steady state length of the hierarchy is finite) we can easily derive the

comparative statics for steady state size:


Corollary 1. An increase in the cost of competition, cR , a decrease in expropriability, Λ1 , or a

        decrease in the probability of survival, γ, increase the steady state length of the hierarchy.


      Thus, better protection of property rights, both in the sense of increasing the cost of competing,

and reducing expropriability, increases the steady state length of the hierarchy. Moreover, the more

likely agents are to survive after retirement, the more they value long-run rents from property

                                                       26
compared to short-run income from employment, and the greater the incentive to break away and

compete.


A.     Discussion

A persistent result is the adverse effect of an increase in expropriability on the size of the hierarchy

whether at an interim date or in steady state. This suggests that when property rights are weak,

vertical hierarchies are small because the threat of expropriation does not allow them to grow and

production is stunted. As property rights become better enforced, vertical hierarchies are larger

and production is higher. When property rights are perfectly enforced (Λ = 0), however, there is

nothing distinctive about the hierarchy in our framework and its size becomes indeterminate.

     This provides a testable implication of our model. Countries with poor enforcement of property

rights should have small organizations and low per-capita income. Countries with better enforce-

ment of property rights should have larger organizations and higher per-capita income. Finally,

countries with an excellent enforcement of property rights have organizations of indeterminate size

but also enjoy very high per capita income.

     One might also think that the extent of expropriability would vary across industries within

a country. Property rights to physical assets are enforced in all but the most rapacious regimes.

However, a more sophisticated legal system is needed to enforce property rights to intangible assets

such as ideas or client relationships. This suggests a more subtle testable implication: the relative

size of firms in industries with intangible assets should increase when the efficiency of the judicial

system improves.

     In their study of firm size across industries and 15 European countries, Kumar, Rajan and Zin-

gales [1999] test these implications. They find that asset intensive industries where expropriability

is likely to be lowest have larger firms. They also find that countries with more efficient judicial

systems have larger firms. Furthermore, after correcting for industry and country effects, they find

                                                  27
that the relative size of firms in industries with intangible assets increases when the efficiency of

the judicial system improves.

   As we have argued, expropriability can also depend on the extent to which competition is

allowed. If regulations, or the state, assure a monopoly to the incumbent, then expropriability

is small, regardless of the enforcement of property rights. Therefore, state or natural monopolies

are likely to have long hierarchies. Not surprisingly, the first long hierarchies in history were the

army and the administration, two state monopolies. Interestingly, when property rights tend to be

weakly enforced, these tend to be the only organizations of any size.

   Finally, our model indicates the dangers for an entrepreneur in attempting to keep too much for

herself in the early stages by differentiating the organization extensively. Not only do managers have

little incentive to specialize, but also a high degree of differentiation concentrates a large amount

of rents in the hands of the one who controls the critical resource making expropriation more

attractive to subordinates. Analogously, the centralization of resources in a political dictatorship

can undermine the survival of the dictator because it provides incentives for a coup by others. In

order to achieve a stable organization, the entrepreneur has to sprinkle rents throughout it. This

is precisely what a low degree of differentiation achieves.


                       IV.      The Path to the Steady State

   To conclude our analysis of vertical hierarchies, let us ask how the hierarchy will grow to this

steady state. As we have seen, specialized managers will not compete when the hierarchy is of

smaller length than the steady state size, i.e., on the path to the steady state. Therefore, the

entrepreneur only needs to ensure the young managers do not compete. We will focus on the case

when the resource is highly expropriable so that the entrepreneur has to ensure each period that

she has the backing of enough specialized managers to defeat the highest unspecialized manager.

   Under these circumstances, we have already seen that the entrepreneur can give access to only

                                                 28
one unspecialized manager in the first period. Importantly, if the entrepreneur cannot be active in

the first period, she will not be able to start the organization since she can only hire unspecialized

managers who will break away and dispossess her. Thus, it is the entrepreneur’s ability to man the

most sensitive positions at the outset, before managerial loyalties are established, that enables her

to start an organization with strangers. Moreover, control over access alone will not be enough,

since the threat of competition is high, so the organization cannot be started by an arm’s length

owner. Only when the hierarchy has specialized employees can outside ownership arise.

      If the entrepreneur was young to begin with, she can be active for one more period in which

case the number hired in the second period satisfies Λ3 · n2 ≤ 2. This yields n2 = Int[ Λ23 ] ≥ 2.

Even though the entrepreneur retires now, the number of young managers that can be hired will

grow if n2 > 2.19 In period t, the number hired will be


                                                        nt−1
(6)                                        nt = Int[            ].
                                                       Λnt−1 +1


      Using (6) and ignoring integer problems, the rate of growth of the hierarchy, which is [(nt +
                                                           1/Λnt−1 +1 −Λnt−2 +1
nt−1 ) − (nt−1 + nt−2 )]/[(nt−1 + nt−2 )], simplifies to       1+Λnt−2 +1       .

      It is easily checked that the growth rate increases over time. If expropriability decreases to a

constant Λ beyond a certain distance from the resource (as seems natural), the growth rate becomes
              1
a constant    Λ   − 1, independent of size. This is Gibrat’s Law, derived not from industry market

structure and opportunities (see Sutton [1997] for an excellent review of the literature), but from

endogenous internal constraints on firm growth.

A.      Growth Traps

Despite the apparent inevitability of growth depicted above, there are situations when a hierarchy

is doomed to remain small. If the hierarchy in its initial stages is expected to grow slowly (because




                                                    29
of the high risk of expropriation), it may not provide managers enough future rents to give them

an incentive to specialize. As a result, the hierarchy may not even start up. Another way of saying

this is that improvements in the enforcement of property rights may draw forth more specialized

organizations in an economy.

     A hierarchy will also stagnate if at any point it cannot hire more new employees than existing

old. For example, n2 = 2 if expropriability is high enough, so only two unspecialized managers in

the second period. But the entrepreneur must retire in the third period as must his first specialized

manager. This leaves the hierarchy with only two specialized managers in the third period, the

same as it had in the second period. The hierarchy is trapped at a level of four managers (two

specialized and two unspecialized).

     A similar growth trap is encountered if the entrepreneur is old by the time he acquires the

critical resource. Even though he can hire one manager initially, the entrepreneur has to retire

in the next period, leaving just one active specialized manager again. The hierarchy cannot grow

beyond two employees (one old, one young) because the entrepreneur does not remain active long

enough to build a sufficiently large cadre to grow the firm.


B.     Evading growth traps

The important point to retain is that even though a hierarchy of substantial length may be feasible,

actual organizations may never reach that size. But this suggests that temporary shocks can move

a hierarchy out of, or into, a growth trap and can have long-term consequences.

     For example, a hierarchy can escape a growth trap when an entrepreneur can employ people

such as family who will not compete because they have strong social costs of doing so. This

may explain why behind the success of many professionally-managed firms lie families who were

critical in its initial stages. Hobsbawm [1996, p241] suggests such this was important in the early

development of European firms in the period 1848-1875: “The economic advantages of a large

                                                 30
family ...were of course still substantial. Within the business it guaranteed capital, perhaps useful

business contacts, and above all reliable managers”.20

   Another phenomenon our model may explain is why so many venerable firms today got their

start in times of war. During wars, governments typically confer monopolies on a chosen few (to

prevent “waste”). Since government-sanctioned monopoly implies low expropriability, firms can

grow substantially in such times without fear. But this temporary advantage may be enough to get

them over the growth trap so that even after the war ends and expropriability returns to normal,

these firms retain their size and growth rates.

   Adverse temporary shocks can also have permanent effects by decimating a firm’s stock of

organizational capital. Suppose a temporary shock (such as an economic depression or a financial

crisis) depresses the prospects of future rents within an organization, and hence the young managers’

incentive to make specific investments. This will lead to a drastic reduction in the number of

specialized managers available next period. The number of specialized will have to be rebuilt

painstakingly slowing the recovery. The firm’s feasible size as well as its rate of growth could fall

considerably. In extreme situations, firms could find themselves back in a growth trap with no way

out, even if opportunities returned to their old values.


                             V.     Horizontal Hierarchies

   Thus far, we have focused on vertical hierarchies where the primary problem is the incentive

to breakaway and compete. One alternative arrangement stands out as a remedy – the horizon-

tal hierarchy where the head has multiple subordinates in the tier immediately below her (see

Figure V).

   Since none of the managers have subordinates in this hierarchy, the active entrepreneur alone

can defeat any manager who competes (and managers cannot form coalitions against her because

they are not specialized to each other). So through a process of divide and conquer - preventing

                                                  31
managers from having subordinates that they can take with them – the entrepreneur ensures

competition is not a concern.21

      Of course, to continue with a horizontal hierarchy, on retirement the entrepreneur has to transfer

control to a manager. In the last period of the entrepreneur’s active life, his subordinates have

all specialized. Since all these subordinates have knowledge of the resource, the entrepreneur can

transfer control to one of them.

      Let us assume that control is transferred via an auction where the gains from trade are dis-

tributed among players according to their Shapley value. If the cohort size is n the Shapley value
                                            1
of a generic specialized manager is      n(n+1) S,where    S is the surplus accruing to the coalition of the

potential purchasers and seller.22 Since there are n managers who can purchase, the surplus that
                            n
accrues to the seller is   n+1 S.   This is also the price P the chosen purchaser pays for control.

      The rest of the managers who specialized will have to be fired since they are now old, and do

not have the incentive to specialize to the new boss. They will be replaced by young hires, who

have better incentives to specialize because they have eyes on the prize of becoming the head next

period.

      Therefore, the surplus to be split in the auction is the total production next period minus the

surplus that goes to next period’s n managers (1 − 2θ ) each, plus the price P at which today’s

purchaser will sell the resource at the end of the period; i.e.,



                                                         θ
(7)                                      S = n + 1 − (1 − )n + P.
                                                         2

                     n+1                                                      nθ
Substituting S =      n P   in (7) and solving for P, we get P = n[1 +        2 ].   The equilibrium steady
                                                                                                       nθ
state price is much more than the total surplus extracted by the head in a period (of (1 +             2 )).

This is because the price embeds some of the surplus extracted off future cohorts of managers.




                                                      32
      The lifetime expected surplus accruing to each young manager is


                               θ       1             θ    1 + nθ
                                                              2     1

      The expected surplus falls in the number of managers because each manager faces more com-

petition in the auction for ownership. Interestingly, the surplus does not depend on the level of

differentiation. What a manager loses to the entrepreneur in the first period as a result of a higher

θ, he recovers (in expectation) as a head in the second period.

      Since the surplus has to exceed cS for the manager to specialize, it must be that


                                                    1

                                                    n


      The entrepreneur’s objective is to maximize profits

which is increasing in both θ and n.

      Since the constraint (9) does not depend on θ, the entrepreneur will choose θ∗ = 1 and set the

optimal value nH so that the IR constraint (9) is just met. Therefore, comparing with the result

in proposition 5, we have

Proposition 6. The degree of differentiation in a horizontal hierarchy always weakly exceeds and

        sometimes strictly exceeds the degree of differentiation in a vertical hierarchy.


      This highlights an important difference between a vertical and horizontal organizations. Ver-

tical organizations find it optimal not to differentiate too much because this concentrates rents at

the top and limits their potential size. In the horizontal organization, however, the incentive to



                                                    33
expropriate is controlled by the strategy of divide and rule and is unaffected by how much rents are

concentrated at the top. Moreover, rents are naturally spread through the process of sale; what is

lost by a manager in a horizontal organization in wages is picked up in expected ownership so the

manager’s individual rationality constraint is unaffected by differentiation. As a result, horizontal

organizations differentiate maximally. It follows that the wages of the lowest manager, (1 − 2θ ), are

lower in a horizontal organization than in the vertical organization, and if the lowest managers are

on their IR constraint, the former organization’s expected income profile is more steeply sloped.


A.     Will Control Be Sold?

Thus far, we have assumed that the entrepreneur will sell control. Given the impossibility of

commitment, however, this sale will take place only if the entrepreneur has no better option other

than selling. Perhaps, however, she could continue to maintain control.

     Apart from the vertical hierarchy, there are potentially other forms of organization that could

allow the entrepreneur to maintain control of the resource. For example, on retirement from the

horizontal hierarchy, the entrepreneur could place an experienced manager as head and continue

to retain control of the resource. As we argue in the appendix, this hybrid (and other hybrid

forms) do not provide managers adequate incentives to specialize when θ = 1, and are therefore

not feasible.23

     This leaves the entrepreneur only one alternative: to convert the horizontal hierarchy into a

vertical hierarchy. It is easy to show that anticipating such a conversion, no manager in the initial

horizontal hierarchy has the incentive to specialize. Therefore, for the prospect of selling to be

seen as credible ex ante, the entrepreneur should prefer selling control to one manager rather than

retaining control through organizational change. While the size of the vertical hierarchy (and hence

the prospective rents to the entrepreneur from conversion) decrease in the ease of expropriability

(high Λ, low cR ), the size and rents in the horizontal hierarchy are unaffected by these parameters

                                                 34
since expropriability is not a concern. Therefore, conversion is dominated, and the entrepreneur’s

promise to sell control can be credible only when the ease of expropriability is very high. We have


Proposition 7. Consider a critical resource with parameters Λ ≡ {Λ1 , ..., Λn } = Λ̄, and cR = c̄R .

       If the entrepreneur prefers setting up a horizontal hierarchy at the outset, she also prefers to

       do so whenever Λ ≥ Λ̄ and cR ≤ c̄R .


     This proposition implies that there is a threshold of expropriability above which the horizontal

hierarchy will always be preferred.


B.     Comparison of Horizontal and Vertical Hierarchies

Consider now the difference between a vertical and a horizontal hierarchy. The main incentive

problem in a vertical hierarchy is expropriability. This limits the size of the hierarchy. The nature

of the hierarchy, however, puts positional power in the hands of managers. So managers are secure

in their rents and have the incentive to specialize.

     In a horizontal hierarchy, expropriability is dealt with by a process of divide and conquer. No

subordinate has enough power to overcome the head. But this gives them very little positional

power, and therefore little incentive to specialize. Hence the need of an internal sale of control

so as to motivate the incoming cohort to specialize. Moreover, size has to be limited so that

each manager has a reasonable chance of getting control. In other words, size is constrained by

individual rationality in horizontal hierarchies, while it is constrained by incentive compatibility in

vertical hierarchies.

     From proposition 7, we should expect horizontal hierarchies to predominate in sectors where

expropriability is very high. This accords with casual empiricism. The critical resources in human

capital intensive industries are strategies, client lists, and ideas, that are very hard to protect,

thus the flat structure of law and consulting firms. Interestingly, these are also the firms where

                                                  35
older managers sell their ownership stakes to select proven younger managers (see Bhide [1996], for

example). By contrast, organizations with very steep organizational pyramids typically seem to

be found in physical capital intensive industries like automobiles or natural or officially-sanctioned

monopolies like utilities and the government. If the property rights to physical capital are easily

protected from expropriation, and monopolies protected by definition from competition, these are

indeed organizations with a low Λ and our model predicts the observed vertical hierarchies.

   Horizontal hierarchies will have stronger cultures or more distinctive technologies of production

than vertical hierarchies. This is because the expected rents from ownership are widely spread in a

horizontal hierarchy so the entrepreneur can get the initial rents from differentiating the hierarchy

without destroying the incentives of managers. As a result, owners “exploit” new employees more

in a horizontal hierarchy, but this is compensated in the long run because employees have a chance

of becoming owners and “exploiting” succeeding generations of employees.

   Vertical and horizontal organizations differ in their treatment of the specialized old. In the

vertical hierarchy, they are a valuable resource who can man critical positions, allowing the en-

trepreneur to expand the hierarchy. In the horizontal hierarchy, apart from the favored few who

get ownership, they are detritus to be discarded. Unlike the unspecialized young, the old have no

prospect of ownership, and will not make the additional investment needed to make themselves use-

ful. Thus up-or-out policies follow naturally from differences in the nature of the hierarchies.24 An

immediate corollary is that vertical hierarchies will take time to reach their potential size because

they have to build on past specialization, while horizontal hierarchies can reach their potential

quickly.

   Finally, the sale of the resource to employees substantially alters incentives in a horizontal

hierarchy while it does little in a vertical hierarchy. The reasons are instructive. First, in a

horizontal hierarchy the head extracts a significant portion of the human capital that subordinates



                                                 36
contribute. So the critical resource in a horizontal organization is effectively a claim on a large

portion of the human capital of future generations of subordinates. Clearly, the prospect of getting

some of it can improve investment incentives substantially. By contrast, in a vertical hierarchy,

current managers absorb much of the surplus they generate each period, so very little of the human

capital of future generations is embodied in the critical resource. Second, in a horizontal hierarchy,

once the head is loyal, subordinates have little incentive to compete. By contrast, in a vertical

organization, ensuring the loyalty of the head only pushes the problem one step down. Perhaps

most important, absentee ownership is not possible in a horizontal hierarchy while it is in a vertical.

Therefore, if the sale of control does little to change the size of the vertical hierarchy there is no

incentive for the entrepreneur to sell because, given the imperfectly competitive nature of the

auction, she always gets more by retaining her stake.

   We now discuss what our work implies for the difference between organizations and markets.


                          VI.     Markets and Organizations

   What is the difference between hierarchies (organizations) and markets in our model? We

follow Coase’s [1937] depiction of the hierarchy as an entity where transactions are driven more by

authority or power than by prices. In our paper, the entrepreneur controls access to the critical

resource as well as access to the specialized human capital of the managers. In this sense, she has

some power. But managers are not powerless. In a vertical hierarchy, the specialized get positional

power, while in the horizontal hierarchy the specialized get (a chance at) the power from ownership.

This permits a distinction between those inside the organization (those who have access) and those

outside, as well as between those who have belonged for some time and have some power (the

specialized) and those who have just joined.

   Many of these distinctions cannot be drawn in the Property Rights approach, the seminal work

of Grossman and Hart [1986] and Hart and Moore [1990] (GHM).25 That approach is essentially a

                                                  37
static approach where the ownership of the critical resource and the legal right to make away with

it in the future gives the owner power. Since the Property Rights approach does not deem current

access necessary in any way (ownership is important only in that it helps control future access),

and the model is static, it does not help distinguish between people inside the organization and

people outside other than the owner(s).

   There is another important distinction in our work. Organizations cannot exist in the Property

Rights framework if the legal rights of ownership cannot be enforced. This is why that framework

emphasizes physical assets (or alienable intangible ones like patents), as well as a well functioning

legal system, to explain organized activity like firms. But then what does one make of consulting

or law firms where the assets are largely human capital, or how can one explain the existence of

organizations in economies (or sectors) where property rights are not well enforced? This is where

the distinction between ownership (which gives the owner the right to determine access now and in

the future) and control (which only gives the right to determine current access) is important. As we

show, the ability to control access today may be enough to project control rights into the future, so a

whole gamut of unique resources that cannot be owned but can only be controlled, even temporarily,

offer similar residual rights as does ownership, and allow the emergence of organizations.26 This

distinction between the role of ownership and the role of control is very useful if we want to model

large corporations where ownership is separated from control.

   The idea that the organizational core consists of unique capabilities and resources has become

crystallized in the Resource Based View of the firm (Penrose [1959], Wernerfelt [1984], Wernerfelt

and Montgomery [1988], Hamel and Prahalad [1990]). While the Resource Based View admits to a

greater variety of resources than does the Property Rights View, unlike our model it does not indi-

cate how these resources, especially intangible ones, provide authority around which organizations

can be built, or how they internally constrain organizational size.



                                                  38
   Finally, the superiority of organizations in our model does not rely on the permanent scarcity

of the critical resource. Organizational capabilities are built over time through specialization. In

particular, once the vertical hierarchy is built, even if the critical resource is no longer unique, the

hierarchy can produce more at that point than can a competing entrepreneur starting with a similar

resource even though technology does not constrain specialization or production possibilities. This

is because the web of specific investments built into the vertical hierarchy over time cannot be

reproduced instantaneously, through legal arrangement or by regulating access. This web could

also be termed its organizational capital (Klein [1988]).


                 VII.      Conclusion: Is the Hierarchy a Firm?


   At the core of our organization is a unique source of value, the critical resource, and three

mechanisms – access, specialization, and ownership – that tie agents to it. These mechanisms confer

on the organization a power of fiat which differs from ordinary market contracting. According to

Coase [1937], this is what distinguishes organizations from markets. Thus ours could be viewed as

an economic definition of an organization’s boundaries.

   The legal definition of the firm, however, is primarily in terms of ownership. Thus our notion

of organization sometimes differs from the legal definition. For instance, our theory can not only

encompass extra-legal organizations like the Mafia, but also networks of “independent” firms such

as an automobile manufacturer and its dedicated suppliers. At the same time, entities the law

defines as a firm may not fit our definition of an economic organization. For instance, a bond

trading group at an investment bank, tied to the bank only through its use of capital (which is

easily obtained elsewhere), is not really an integral economic part of the bank, though for all legal

and cash flow purposes, it is. The bank’s headquarters has no real power over the group and, for

all practical purposes, trades at arm’s length with it.27



                                                  39
   In our view, that our notion of economic organization does not fully overlap with the legal

definition of the firm is not a weakness of our theory. Instead, it points to inadequacies in the legal

definition. For instance, regulations such as anti-trust impose limitations on entities that belong

to a firm because it is believed they operate in a concerted manner, different from arm’s length

interactions in a market. If entities that are not part of the same firm operate in a concerted

manner, there is no reason why regulations (and the law) should not treat them as a single firm.

By contrast, entities that are currently treated by the law as part of the same firm but operate at

arm’s length should be treated differently.

   By distinguishing between an “economic” definition and a legal definition of the firm, we can

also understand the possible adverse efficiency consequences of the current legal definition. For

example, the corporate opportunity doctrine restricts the ability of managers to personally take

advantage of opportunities that come to them while they are agents of the firm. Thus, there is a

strong incentive for organizations to conform to the legal definition of a firm so that they can enjoy

the protection the law gives them against opportunistic employees, even if this is not the optimal

form of organization from an economic perspective.

   As physical assets become less important and give way to human capital, the boundaries of

the corporation defined in terms of the ownership of physical assets are becoming less meaningful.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to classify new hybrid entities such as EcoNets (keiretsu-type

alliances of internet firms) in traditional boxes. A deeper analysis of the economic nature of firms

is an necessary first step in understanding and dealing with these new entities. We hope our model

represents a small move in this direction.

A.     Derivation of manager k’s payoff

We prove this by induction.28 When k = n, (1) shows that (2) holds. Suppose (2) holds for

managers k + 1, ...n − 1. All we need to show then is that it holds for manager k. It is easy to see

that the payoff of the kth manager, Mk , is


                                            n
                                   1       X                     1

     The first term in brackets is the payoff remaining to be divided after managers below Mk have

taken their share, while the second term is the total output without Mk . Substituting from (2)

using the induction hypothesis


                       n                                                  n

(12)      πk = [(n −       (1 − n−j+1 ) − (k − 1)] + (1 − θ) = [2 − θ +         n−j+1
                                                                                      ].

Simplifying, we get (2).


B.     To prove that in any position a specialized manager has less incentive to

       compete than an unspecialized manager

To prove that in any position a specialized manager has less incentive to compete than an unspe-

cialized manager we need to write down the conditional IC constraints (the competition constraints

does not differ between the two).

     The specialized manager’s conditional IC constraint is



                           θ                       1                   θ
(13)             [1 −            ] ≥ Λk [θ(1 −            ) + (1 −            ) + Π0 (y k )] − cR .
                        2n−k+1                   2n−k+1              2n−k+1



                                                       41
   The left hand side of (13) is the payoff the specialized manager receives by working for an extra

period (his last one) in the firm. The right hand side is the present value of the payoff he obtains

if he competes. When he competes, in the first period he gets a rent for his human capital as the

head manager (producing with all his specialized subordinates) as well as a rent for his control

over the critical resource. After that he will get the present discounted value of the future rents

from the hierarchy because of his control of the resource, Λk Π0 (y k ). Discounted rent Π is indexed

by O, the age of the manager when he replicates, because the age of the manager may affect the

development of the hierarchy in future periods. Also, future rents are a function of y k , the number

of specialized young managers who follow him. The number of specialized old managers who follow

him is irrelevant for future rents because they will all retire this period.

   For an unspecialized manager in the k th position, the IC constraint is given by


          θ                   θ                                1              θ

(14)           ] + [1 − n −h(n ,y0 ,yk )+1 ] − cS ≥ Λk [θ(1 − n−k+1 ) + (1 − n−k+1 ) + ΠY (y k )] − cR ,
        2n−k+1         2 s    s                              2              2


where ns is the length of the hierarchy next period if all managers specialize this period, and h is

the tier the manager will be placed in next period (which depends on the length of the hierarchy,

the number of managers in his cohort, y 0 , the number of unspecialized managers below him, y k ).

   Comparing the unspecialized manager’s payoff with the specialized manager’s one we have:

i) regardless of the placement policy the left hand side of (13) is bigger than the l.h.s. of (14)

because of Assumption 1; ii) the right hand side of (14) is bigger than the r.h.s. of (13) because the

first terms are equal and ΠY (y k ) is greater than or equal to Π0 (y k ) because the young competing

manager has the option to decide how to use his own human capital next period unlike an old

manager who has to retire.

Otherwise, θ∗ = θ.

D.     Proofs of Propositions

Proof of Proposition 2

                                                                                   dn∗2
function or the IR constraint, thus its effect is only through n∗2 . Since         dΛ3    ≤ 0, the IR constraint
           dθ∗
requires   dΛ3   ≤ 0.


Proof of Proposition 3

     The left hand side of (4) is increasing in Λ, hence, θ∗ can flip from θ to 1 ≥ θ. Thus, (i) follows.

     The comparative static for n∗2 can be derived off inequality (16). Since the objective function

is increasing in θ∗ and n∗2 , we know that the constraint is binding. Thus, we can rewrite it as:




          θ           θ                    1           θ                 1          θ
  [1 −
(20)         ] + [1 − N ] − cS − Λ3 [θ(1 − n2 ) + (1 − n2 )] − Λ3 [θ(1 − N ) + (1 − N )] + cR = 0.
         2n2         2                    2           2                 2          2


For a given θ∗ , an increase in Λ3 reduces the left hand side of (20), thus for the equality to hold
                                                                            θ∗
n∗2 should drop, since the derivative of (20) with respect to n∗2 is        22
                                                                               log2(1 − 2Λ3 )   < 0. At the same

time, an increase in Λ3 leads to an increase in θ∗ because of (i). As before, in order for (20) to

hold n∗2 should drop, since the derivative of the left hand side of (20) with respect to θ∗ equals

− 2n12 (1 − Λ3 ) − 21N (1 − Λ3 ) − Λ3 (1 − 2n12 ) − Λ3 (1 − 21N ) < 0. Thus, (ii) follows from both the direct

and indirect effects of Λ3 on n∗2 .

                                                             − 1]         22n

                 Λ1 (1−γ+θ)
     If cR ≥         1−γ      − 1, then the above inequality is always satisfied because under assumption
    Λ1 (2−γ)
2     1−γ      − 1 > 0 ∀γ ∈ [0, 1] and thus the CIC constraint imposes no limits to the hierarchy. This

proves (i).
                Λ1 (1−γ+θ)
     If cR <        1−γ       − 1, then inequality (21) can be rewritten as


                      log{[θΛ1 (2 − γ)/(1 − γ) − 1]/[Λ1 (1 + θ − γ)/(1 − γ) − 1 − cR ]}
                 n≤                                                                     = n∗ .
                                                   2log2


Thus, the CIC is satisfied if n = n∗ . This proves (ii).


Proof of Proposition 5

     Differentiating (5) with respect to θ after substituting nV we get


                                            Λ1 (2 − γ)      Λ1
                                                       −1−     < 0.
                                              1−γ          1−γ


     The entrepreneur’s profits decrease in θ but only when size is finite. Once size becomes infinite,
            (1−Λ+cR )(1−γ)
i.e., θ <        Λ1            so that the head’s CIC constraint is satisfied for any value of n, then there
                                                       (1−Λ1 +cR )(1−γ)
is no need to reduce θ further. So if θ ≥                     Λ1          then θ? = θ and nV = n∗ . Otherwise
       (1−Λ1 +cR )(1−γ)
θ? =          Λ1          and nV = ∞.


Proof of Corollary 1

     From the definition of n∗ we obtain


                                                   θ[Λ1 (2 − γ)/(1 − γ) − 1]
(22)                                  22n∗ =                                   .
                                               Λ1 (1 − γ + θ)/(1 − γ) − 1 − cR

Since the left hand side is a monotone function of n, we can derive the comparative statics on firm’s

size just differentiating the r.h.s. w.r.t. the parameters.

                            ∂c     [Λ1 (1 − γ + θ)/(1 − γ) − 1 − cR ]2

                              =                                          < 0.
                         ∂γ     [Λ1 (1 − γ + θ) − (1 − γ) − cR (1 − γ)]2



Why the hybrid is not feasible.

   To see why the hybrid is not feasible, let n be the cohort size. Then, the surplus the entrepreneur

splits equally with the head is what the head produces plus what they can extract from subordinate

managers, totalling 1 + n2 . Thus, the surplus a young incoming manager expects over his lifetime

(including his initial period as a subordinate) is


                                      1 1 1 n  3  1
(23)                                   + [ + ]= +   .
                                      2 n 2 4  4 2n


   The expected surplus decreases in the number of managers in the cohort because the surplus

conditional on becoming head – which has a fixed component – is divided among more candidates.

But this creates a problem. From (23), the expected surplus when n ≥ 2 is less than or equal to 1,

which by assumption 1 is less than the cost of specialization, cS . Since the hybrid requires at least

two managers in the second tier (else it is a vertical hierarchy), we have to conclude that it is not

feasible when rewards come solely through promotions.


                                                  46
   Other hybrids that involve a horizontal organization with vertical “divisions” provides worse

incentives than does a pure horizontal organization. A sketch of the intuition follows: Let a head

have ns subordinates in the second tier and let each of these have k subordinates in a vertical line

(for a total of k ∗ ns + 1 managers in the hierarchy). Regardless of whether one of the second tier

is promoted or purchases control when the head retires, the managers who are subordinates of the

remaining n − 1 managers in the second tier are fired along with those managers. Now consider
                                                                             1
the incentives of a manager at the bottom of the hierarchy. He gets          2   in the first period, and has a
              1
probability   n   of being promoted by one rung in the second period and getting 34 . With probability
n−1                                                          1       13
 n ,   he will be fired. So he gets an expected income of    2   +   n 4.   Since n has to be at least 2 for

this to not be a vertical hierarchy, it is immediate that the expected rents are below 1 and hence

below cS .


Proof of Proposition 7

   (Sketch) For Λ → 1 and cR → 0 the vertical hierarchy is infeasible when the entrepreneur is

inactive. Also when the entrepreneur is active the per-period entrepreneurial rent in the horizontal

hierarchy is always greater than the per-period rent in the vertical hierarchy. Thus, in the limit

the horizontal hierarchy is always preferred.

   Therefore, all we need to show is that the entrepreneur’s preference for the vertical hierarchy

is decreasing in Λ and increasing in cR . The incentive constraints in the vertical hierarchy become

tighter as Λ increases and cR decreases, while the incentive constraints for the horizontal hierarchy

remain unchanged provided that the entrepreneur can credibly promise to sell. But as Λ increases

and cR decreases the entrepreneur’s incentive to sell also increases. Hence the proposition.

Notes
 1
   There is a large literature that discusses this problem (see,      for example, Williamson [1975], Cheung [1982],

Landes [1986], Liebeskind [1996], Rumelt [1987], Teece [1986], Mailath and Postelwaite [1990], and Rebitzer and

Taylor [1997]). Teece [1986] proposes that a firm mitigates expropriation by owning a set of complementary assets

that are critical to production while Rebitzer and Taylor [1997] argue that law firms reward those with the highest

threat of expropriation with higher rents.
   2
       After breaking away, each manager produces 0.49. Pietro gets half of what Ram produces for a total of 0.49 ∗ 1.5

each period.
   3
       In this example we assume that managers have a horizon of only two periods and that the cost of expropriating

the technology is zero. Both assumptions are relaxed in the model.
   4
       Examples of technology-based theories of the firm include Lucas [1978], Rosen [1982], Bolton and Dewatripont

[1994], and Garicano [1998].
   5
       While it is fairly uncontroversial that the entrepreneur can offer or refuse access to one manager, it is more

questionable whether she has the ability to regulate access further down the hierachy. We have proven similar results

under the assumption that the entrepreneur offers direct access only to one manager, who chooses his subordinate

among the pool of managers with access, and so on. Our notion that the entrepreneur allocates access is similar in

many ways to the notion in Holmstrom [1999], Holmstrom and Milgrom [1994] (particularly in their focus on the

allocation of tasks) and in Holmstrom and Roberts [1998] that the firm is a closed system that can allocate incentives

without being pressured by the market.
   6
       This is because access is short form for a broad category of memberships, delegated control rights and task

assignments that are very hard for the entrepreneur to specify precisely, and for courts to enforce. In the language

of Grossman and Hart [1986], the right to control access is a “residual” right of control that emanates from control

(though not necessarily ownership) of the resource. However, under some circumstances we do allow the resource to

be alienable (see later), and thus the right to control access can be sold.
   7
       In an earlier version of the paper, we assumed managers specialized to the technology only, and not to their

superior. The results were similar to the ones in this paper. In practice, specialization contains an element of

specialization to a technology and specialization to surrounding humans, which we hope to capture with the current

assumption.
   8
       Setting up as competition should also be viewed as a metaphor for all those activities that allow managers to

appropriate part of the value of the firm. Thus, while in large organizations it is rare to see top managers departing

with all their subordinates, is quite common to see them use their control of their subordinates to capture more


                                                           53
rents from the firm. Thus the basic trade-off –of increasing access so as to increase productive efficiency, and limiting

access to reduce the transfer of power – will continue to play an important role in determining the structure and

growth of large organizations.
   9
       This cost is more than just the effort cost of collecting the information about the resource, the psychic costs

of sneaking it away or the reputational costs of being deemed disloyal. It includes the expected legal costs of any

law suits the entrepreneur might file, and the added risks and stress of becoming an entrepreneur. For a capital

intensive technology, it could include the dead weight cost of raising finance to fund the new enterprise, a cost

which would increase with the degree of imperfections in the capital markets. In a family run firm, it includes the

social sanctions the family may impose for defying the family patriarch. Finally, in the spirit of Hansmann [1996]

(also see Alchian and Demsetz [1972], Jensen and Meckling [1976], Williamson (1975,1985)) it could be the costs of

reproducing interdependent contracts with the members of the production team. Taken together, these costs can be

substantial.
  10
       The manager does not have the resource, so he cannot produce with his subordinates. The reservation wage,

which we will describe momentarily, is public information. This ensures that bargaining will be efficient, making it

more difficult to achieve a stable firm. This is unlike Mailath and Postelwaite [1990] who show that when workers’

reservation value is unobservable, workers will not leave a firm because they cannot agree on how to split the future

surplus arising from their joint departure.
  11
       Since access is not contractible, superiors cannot commit to include or exclude the manager next period, neither

can the latter commit to work. Moreover, whether or not production takes place this period has no bearing on

whether production can take place next period. So next period’s possibilities have no effect on the bargaining.
  12
       We are certainly not the first to note that positions that are the only “connections” to other positions are a

source of power. This is explored in Granovetter [1984] and Burt [1992]
  13
       The only important property of the bargaining outcome is that a manager’s rent increases with his position.

This would be true, for example, if we assume that each manager gets the Shapley value. There are two reasons

why we chose not to use the the Shapley value in this context. First, it assumes, somewhat implausibly that each

manager has an equal right to make offers independent of his position in the hierarchy. Second, the expression for

the manager’s rent is not recursive, increasing significantly the computational burden.
  14
       While in reality, compensation can be committed to over short periods like a year, compensation over longer

periods like decades, which approximate the duration of a period in our model, is hard to commit to. Compensation

also cannot be made contingent on specialization, which is hard to verify.



                                                           54
  15
       By assumption 2, Λ2 (n01 + n2 ) > 1 whenever n01 + n2 ≥ 2. Since n01 ≥ 1 if there is at least one old manager and

n2 ≥ 1 when at least one manager is hired at date 2 (which is necessary for the hierarchy to survive into the next

period), n01 + n2 ≥ 2 and the manager will defeat the entrepreneur if he competes.
  16
       Bringing all the terms in (ICS2 ) to the left hand side and differentiating with respect to number of subordinates
                       θ
we obtain         1+n0 +n2 −k+1
                                  log2(1 − 2Λk ), which is negative by assumption 2.
              2      1

  17
       The lowest young manager today is placed over all the young next period, hence his incentive to specialize

increases in the number of young next period. The number of young increase between the first and second period

because there are trivially more specialized managers at date 2 than at date 1 when there are zero. They increase

between the second and third period because N is large. In general, the number of young will always increase in

every period except possibly the one in which the steady state is reached.
  18
       In a steady state with no competition, this implies that the size of the entering cohort is constant. An alternative

definition of steady state would be an equilibrium where the size of the hierarchy remains constant, but the size of

the entering cohort oscillates (an overlapping generations model allows the hierarchy size to be constant with the

entering cohort being the same size only every two periods). It is easy to prove that for every equilibrium where

the entering cohort size changes between periods, there is an equilibrium where the cohort size is constant and the

hierarchy at least as long. Thus, our focus on steady states with constant entering cohort size is without any loss of

generality.

       Since Λ ≤ 1 and n2 > 2, nt ≥ nt−1 > 2 for t > 2. If n2 > 2, it must be that              Λ2
                                                                                                     > 3, so that Λ2 <   3
                                                                                                                           .   Since

Λk ≤ Λ2 for k > 2, we have on substituting into (6) that nt ≥ Int[ 32 · nt−1 ] > nt−1 since nt−1 > 2.

       The extent to which one can rely on family and friends also depend on the level of trust prevailing in a society.

This might explain the finding of La Porta et al. [1997], that large firms are more important in countries with a

higher level of trust.
  21
       This resembles Marglin’s [1984] idea that the organization is imposed by the capitalist to make himself essential

to the production process on a continuing basis. But the horizontal hierarchy in our framework is not so much a tool

for exploitation as a device to prevent expropriation.
  22                                           (n−1)!
       Each manager has a probability          (n+1)!
                                                        of immediately following the seller and being pivotal to the creation of

surplus S.

       The entrepreneur would continue to choose θ = 1 at the outset if γ is low or the feasible cohort size n is relatively

large.
  24
       Kahn and Huberman [1988] offer a different explanation; an up or out policy emerges as an optimal mechanism to



                                                                    55
prevent firms from reneging on compensation to workers. Good workers cannot be labeled “bad” and not promoted

because they have to be fired, at some cost to the firm.
  25
       More recently, however, Hart and Moore [1999] depart from this approach by examining the ex ante allocation

of access to tasks, an analysis closer in spirit to ours though with a different focus.
  26
       While the ability to sell possession is essential to provide incentives in a horizontal hierarchy when θ = 1, the

ability derived from law to enforce future exclusion is not an essential feature of the resource. So, for example, a

lawyer could “sell” his clients by introducing the purchaser to all of them and then take retirement. Another way of

describing the general point is that formal authority (see Aghion and Tirole [1997]) that typically is thought of as

deriving from legal constructs like ownership may, in fact, emerge from more informal past processes.
  27
       In this, our views are similar to Baker, Gibbons and Murphy [1997] who see a continuum of structures between

the firm and the market.
