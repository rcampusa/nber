Introduction

The experience of Argentina during the Great Depression provides an ideal historical laboratory for the
investigation of macroeconomic stability and policy choice in a small open economy under a fixed exchange
rate regime. Given recent developing country experiences in Latin America and Asia, including examples of
contemporary monetary regimes with currency boards very similar to Argentina’s institutions of the early
twentieth century, there is considerable topical interest in these questions. The essential questions is: what
happens if you employ a currency board and there is an external crash or deflation threat? This was the
nature of the crisis in the 1930s for many countries, and the same potential problem faces Argentina, Hong
Kong, and other countries in the 1990s. What should they do today? To inform that question we ask: What
did Argentina do in the past?
        The Great Depression began in Argentina in the late 1920s, even before the traditional date for the
onset of the Depression in the core, the Wall Street crash of 1929. Like many countries of the periphery,
Argentina was exposed to the commodity lottery. As Díaz Alejandro (1983) and Kindleberger (1986) have
noted, this exposure led to macroeconomic fortunes collapsing as the terms of trade worsened through the
1920s. By December 1929, the balance of payments crisis was severe, and the exchange rate was allowed
to float after a mere two-year resumption of the gold standard. But this was not a decisive break from
macroeconomic orthodoxy. Fiscal policies remained conservative under Uriburu, and, even more than in
other countries like the United States; we even find evidence of fiscal tightening just as the worst of the
Depression hit during 1929–31 (Ortíz 1993).
        Recovery began in 1931, as output grew for the first time in several years, and by 1934-35, output
had regained its 1929 level. We show that assigning fiscal policy any responsibility for this recovery is
implausible: by any measure fiscal policy actually tightened during the early 1930s, as in many other Latin
American countries, and as in the United States. Orthodoxy in fiscal policy was not an immediate casualty
of the change in regime. Thus we move on to examine monetary policy actions from 1929 to 1935, seeking
for evidence of a change of regime. Although many commentators would see the creation of the Banco
Central (Central Bank) in 1935, according to Federico Pinedo’s plan, as the main monetary policy event of
the 1930s in Argentina, we instead emphasize the remarkable decision of the Caja de Conversión
(Conversion Office, a currency board) to began rediscounting and so forge an independent monetary policy,
as early as 1931, at the urging of Raúl Prebisch. This decision to sterilize gold losses to offset monetary
contractions was the decisive break with the old orthodoxy. In many ways, the later creation of the Central
Bank merely rubber-stamped the operations of this new macroeconomic policy regime, and continued these


                                                   2
operations after 1935.1 But the Argentine recovery was complete by 1935; and the only pre-1935 change in
regime that could be assigned a role in ending the Argentine Great Depression was the change in ideas at
the Conversion Office. Yet, did it make a difference?
          To investigate the question, we conduct an econometric analysis of prices, exchange rates, and
interest rates. We find that the change of monetary regime was essential to Argentina’s recovery in that it
helped avert a devastating collapse of prices, and, potentially, of output in 1931–33. Instead of following
the United States and other countries into this abyss, Argentina’s regime shift destroyed deflationary
expectations, permanently lowering previously extremely high real interest rates. In other ways, though,
policy was still limited by orthodox thinking. Sterilizations offset gold outflows to a large degree, but never
counteracted them to any great degree: indeed the money base barely changed from 1929 to 1935, though at
least it didn’t shrink as much as orthodoxy would have required. So there was no “Keynes” effect at work,
no large money injection to stimulate aggregate demand via the money market. In this sense, Argentina was
still a prisoner of its intellectual and economic history, and the Conversion Office, though willing to follow
Prebisch’s plan, was not willing to push it as far as it might to use monetary expansion as a device to end
the Depression more quickly. Using monetary policy, it was apparently very hard to break from the
constraint of purchasing power parity (PPP) at this stage, so aggregate demand was hard to manipulate.
          In the end, the key channel through which the change in monetary regime had real effects was via
the destruction of deflationary expectations. With nominal interest rates subject to the zero floor, this
change of regime could significantly reduce ex ante and ex post real interest rates. This was indeed the
case, promoting recovery through increases in aggregate demand via investment and consumption activity:
the “Mundell” effect of the change in expectations was the vital source of recovery. Hence we think that the
institutional change heralded by the rejection of an old orthodoxy was just as essential to recovery from the
Great Depression in the periphery as in the core.



Contours of the Argentine Great Depression

The Great Depression marked the end of an epoch where free trade and integration into external capital
markets acted as the main recipes to secure economic growth and prosperity for the Latin American
Countries (Díaz Alejando 1983, 1984). In important studies, O’Connell (1984) and De Paiva Abreu (1984)
noted how the dramatic change in the international economy shaped political-economy views about the
welfare enhancing aspects of an outward economic orientation in two of the most important Latin American


    1
        In substantive terms, we could argue, the main contribution of the central bank was to put in place a rescue


                                                       3
countries, Brazil and Argentina. In the deteriorating climate for trade in the 1930s, both countries tried to
structure bilateral trade agreements with the two world powers, United Kingdom and the United States,
with mixed results. The asymmetric bargaining power of the new international economic order took its toll
on their domestic economies. For Argentina, although economic problems had retarded economic growth
since 1914 (Taylor 1992), there was a pressure to stand by the old liberal orthodoxy. Even during and after
the worst recession in Argentine history, during World War One, few policymakers seriously questioned the
return to orthodoxy as the goal for the 1920s, to rebuild an economic order predicated on openness in
markets and adherence to the gold standard as a monetary rule.2 This view was only broken as the threat of
an even worse economic collapse loomed in the early 1930s.
        In Table 1, we depict some important macroeconomic data that characterizes the impact of the
Great Depression on the Argentine economy. From 1929 to 1932, Argentina imported the severe
deflationary pressures in the international economy.3 The external terms of trade declined by 24% and the
trade share, defined as the ratio of the semi-sum of exports and imports to real output went from an all-time
high of 36% in the late twenties to a low of 28% in 1932. If one were to judge by its trade exposure,
Argentina was one of the most vulnerable economies in the presence of such sizeable foreign shocks—
shocks that, in addition to pure deflation, also included fierce terms of trade declines as countries took their
hits in the “commodity lottery.”4
        However, it is astonishing is that the Argentine Great Depression was so mild and short-lived by
international standards. Hence, the notion that an important change in economic policy took place, and
saved Argentina from more pronounced suffering, deserves close scrutiny. As can be gleaned from Table 1,
from peak to trough (1929 to 1932), the domestic real output fell by “only” 14% and had even surpassed
its 1929 level already by 1935. Deflation, a curse to avoid in the inter-war period, was only about 6% in
the 1929-1932 period. The behavior of output and prices compares favorably, say, to North American




package for the financial sector using the proceeds of gold revaluation.
    2
      Though rarely remarked on, this point about the relative size of Argentine recessions bears repeating. We can
measure the size of recession by a simple technique, cumulating deviations below the previous peak level of log
output over subsequent years, until the previous peak is surpassed, and measuring the cumulative loss as a fraction
of annual output. Using this yardstick, the three largest recessions of the period from 1884 (the start of annual
output data) to 1940 are the Baring Crisis of the years 1890–93 (4 years, cumulative loss 31%), the recession of
1914–19 (6 years, 63%), and the Great Depression of 1930–34 (5 years, 43%). See della Paolera and Taylor
(1998).

more than 30% from peak to trough, and a decline in their price level of more than 20%.5

        The Argentine performance is also very good by the standards of the periphery. Other Latin
American countries were much more affected by the downturn. In the same 1929–32 period, Mexico’s
prices and output fell by 19%, Chile’s real output by 27%, and Brazil’s by 28%. Here it is interesting to
note that the mere presence of currency depreciations of important magnitude is not directly related to the
extent of the experienced depression. For example, in Brazil there was a 66% depreciation of its currency,
in Mexico 47%, while the Argentine paper peso declined by 63% with respect to the gold dollar.
        Thus, it is important here to distinguish between those currency depreciations that were part of a
change in the macroeconomic regime and others that merely reflected typical foreign exchange market
pressure in an inconvertible regime during a severe downturn in the balance of payments. As we shall see
later for the Argentine case, there is an enormous difference between: (a) just letting the currency depreciate
as a mean to restore equilibrium in the money market; and (b) installing a new policy regime à la Sargent
(1983) that will influence expectations and hence alter the course of economic decisions. The distinction is
between a country choosing to depreciate as part of a regime switch versus being forced to depreciate
whilst adhering to orthodoxy. This was recognized by della Paolera and Ortiz (1995): “…the 1931 year,
however, was without doubt a peculiar one: the year started with the combination of an extremely orthodox
domestic fiscal policy and an unequivocal convergence towards a fiduciary monetary system…”. In other
words, if she were free to choose to effect a full-fledged change in her monetary regime, as a proactive
political economy decision, Argentina must have had a lot of room for maneuver. Indeed she did: years of
orthodox adherence to the gold standard had led to a massive build up of gold reserves, and an enormous
backing for the domestic currency.
        From Table 1 we note that around 1930, almost 80% of the money base was backed with gold. The
inelastic relationship between gold and money finally broke in 1931 when the government decided to switch
from targeting the gold reserves backing the quantity of money to targeting the nominal quantity of money
itself. In this manner, the Argentine authorities halted a decline in the quantity of money in a bid to avert
deflation. The gold stock was critical. The use of gold for fiscal purposes, to service external debt
obligations, allowed the government to maintain a very orthodox fiscal policy by using these tied-up
resources; thus did Argentina escape default on foreign debts in the 1930s, a very unusual feat for a
peripheral country. So the new policy mix was chosen: sound finance in the realm of fiscal affairs, and, at
the same time, an unorthodox fiduciary monetary regime. In 1931 and 1932, the domestic credit component
of the money base, frozen at 293 million pesos for 32 years, increased to such an extent that it already
accounted for 62% of the money base by 1932.




                                                   7
        Other macroeconomic responses stand out in Table 1. Investment fell by about one half in 1929–
31, then by another third in 1932. Private consumption fell by about a quarter. Both shifts greatly exceeded
the fall in output. One can understand the perceived need to implement some change in policies to redress
the negative expectations that prevailed. The banks’ interest rate was pretty flat at around 7%, so an
injection of liquidity could perhaps ease the credit market via the “Keynes effect.” But most of the effort to
change expectations had to come through the “Mundell effect”—the destruction of deflationary
expectations.6
        For Argentina, it might be observed that the dramatic declines in output, investment, and
consumption ceased, and then reversed, after 1932 (Table 1). The evolution of the real exchange rate
suggests that the authorities were successful in the regime change, and were able to anchor the real
exchange rate in spite of the sizeable deterioration in the terms of trade. Export growth and sustained
import compression assisted recovery. In short, by 1933 Argentina had circumvented the most devastating
effects of the World Depression.7 Did policy choices make a difference? In the next section we examine the
features of Argentine fiscal and monetary policies.



The Interwar Gold Standard: Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy

In important studies, Díaz Alejandro (1983) and Ortiz (1993) have characterized the Argentine Great
Depression as a definite “blessing”—in the sense of creating an opportunity to adopt new economic policies
and institutions. This new institutional regime, by deviating from the prevailing mentalité of the orthodox
gold standard, could insulate the domestic economy from the dismal global scenario.8 Such a reaction was
hard to envisage just a few years earlier. In this section we discuss Argentina’s position as a small open
economy at the periphery and her struggle, over more than a century, to securely establish credible
monetary, fiscal, and financial institutions. This effort followed from a political consensus in which few
seriously doubted the rewards that would (and did) accrue to Argentina in return for embracing
globalization in the late nineteenth century and playing by the “rules of the game” as laid down by private


    6
       Temin (1989) noted the impact of these two effects in the 1930s recovery in the core countries, and he too
stressed the importance of the Mundell effect and the change of expectations that followed the change of regime
(see also Eichengreen 1992a; 1992b). The U.S. experience under Hoover and then FDR is a classic example of
such a regime shift (Temin and Wigmore 1990; also Romer 1992).

finance and governments in the core: free movements of capital, labor, and goods were a key ingredient in
Argentina’s pre-1914 success. Against this backdrop, and despite the instability in the global economy after
1914, it should still be apparent what extraordinary intellectual and technocratic obstacles policymakers
had to surmount in the 1930s before they could effect a radical change in the macroeconomic regime, and
depart from the prevailing orthodoxy even ahead of most of the developed countries of the core. In this
context, the timing and depth of institutional changes are crucial to determine when and how policy actions
modified behavior and expectations in the domestic economy, and we therefore spend some time surveying
the evolution of fiscal and monetary policies.


Fiscal Policy

Whereas the above discussion highlights the changing context of monetary policy over the 1930s, the
historical record shows no similar evolution towards an interventionist stance in the sphere of fiscal policy.
As we shall show presently, Argentina’s basic orthodox fiscal stance, of seeking to maintain budget
balance, was conserved even during the worst years of the Great Depression. For a number of reasons we
should not consider this outcome surprising.
        First, even in the economies of the core, the power of fiscal policy was not fully unleashed to
insulate economies from the recession. Thus, for example, the classic Keynesian tool of macroeconomic
management did not fail, but rather was never really used, as was famously pointed out by Brown (1956).9
Simply put, for all the fanfare about the impact of New Deal spending programs, it was hard to find any
evidence of full employment deficits in the U.S. in the 1930s. Indeed, for many years, the net fiscal impact
appeared to be even slightly contractionary.
        Second, even if fiscal activism was an option for core countries in the 1930s, with their developed
taxation systems and fiscal sophistication, it was likely to be much less of a feasible policy choice for
countries at the periphery. Peripheral countries simply had much less developed government structures for
managing, administering, and implementing large spending programs. This was the case throughout Latin
America, for example, where Twomey (1983) discovered that few countries in the 1930s were capable of
developing new fiscal programs in response to the Great Depression.
        There is no strong prior reason to expect Argentina to deviate from this more general pattern.
Argentina had kept up a much more rigid historical adherence to orthodoxy and the “rules of the game”



various Latin American economies coped with them. It will be seen that the performance of several [Latin
American] economies was remarkably good , under the circumstances…”
    9
      This finding was further reinforced by the work of Peppers (1973) and Romer (1992).

under the classical gold standard. This was in an attempt to win credibility from core countries, gain access
to foreign capital (successfully), and pursue a greater degree of macroeconomic stability than other
countries in the region. Thus, there is, arguably, every reason to expect Argentina to have been even more
fiscally orthodox than her neighbors up to and even during the 1930s. The 1930s fiscal experience in
Argentina more or less accords with expectations:
    Tax revenues lagged behind expenditures during President Yrigoyen’s administration; in 1930
    nominal tax revenues, heavily dependent on import duties, fell in absolute amounts….Large
    deficits were registered in 1930 and 1931, which could be regarded as being induced by the decline
    in foreign trade rather than as autonomous acts of policy….As in other Latin American countries
    fiscal heterodoxy was discredited in Argentina by lax budgets during the late 1920s. Both the
    Uriburu and the Justo administrations attempted to reduce expenditures and to increase taxes
    during the early 1930s; an income tax was introduced in 1932 and tariff rates were increased
    earlier. (Díaz Alejandro 1983, 21)


          Various data sources confirm this view. One simple measure is the fiscal action of the central
government, shown in Figure 1. It is apparent that at the start of the interwar period customs taxes levied

                                                    10
on imports constituted a large share of revenues, as is typical in all developing countries, accounting for
$199 million out of $370 million pesos of tax revenues in 1913, or about 54%. Consequently, tax revenues
were likely to be cyclically correlated with trade conditions, and thus general economic conditions, since
during recessions, import contraction was a standard response. This is borne out by the data, with dramatic
declines in customs taxes during the WWI crisis, in the 1921–22 and 1926 recessions, and, strikingly, after
1929 and throughout the 1930s. As government spending increased more or less on a trend in this period,
there was thus some scope for an endogenous (though not, by definition a full employment) deficit to
appear in these recessions, and indeed temporary deficits were run up in World War One and in 1921–22.
        The fiscal response in the 1930s was not so forgiving, as is also shown by Figure 1. High
expenditures were run up in 1928–30, but were drastically cut back during 1931–33, generating a big
contractionary effect just as the economy fell into the Great Depression. There was no Argentine New Deal
as far as central government program expenditure was concerned. At the same time, although customs
taxes were falling in line with the trade crisis, total taxes were increasing. President Uriburu, like Hoover in
the United States, was a fiscal conservative, and was searching for a means to close the fiscal gap, and
return closer to an orthodox budget balance. One important part of the package was a dramatic increase in
direct taxes, in the form of income and wealth taxes, which rose from a typical level of $25 million pesos
(less than 5% of all revenues) in the 1920s, to $92 million (almost 15%) in 1933. With a broad array of
aggressive tax programs, the government raised taxes consistently every year after 1930, and closed the
deficit from $240 million pesos in 1929, to just $126 million in 1933.

           These conclusions hold up when an appropriately normalized measure of fiscal stance is
calculated: we use the ratio of the deficit to GDP. Figure 2 shows this data using information now on the
overall consolidated deficits of the entire public sector going back to 1900. Comparing the classical gold
standard years with the interwar and even the interventionist years of the 1930s reveals no marked shift in
the propensity of the Argentine government to employ deficit finance, or apply fiscal policy as a
countercyclical measure. And again, it is apparent that after 1930, fiscal policy so measured became ever
more contractionary in both actual, and, thus, even more so, in adjusted full-employment terms.
           Far from pursuing expansionary fiscal policy via increased full employment deficits, the Argentine
fiscal response during the Great Depression was such as to generate not even increases in actual deficits,
but rather a move toward surplus. We concur with Díaz Alejandro (1983, 22), that “[i]n short, there is no
evidence that during the early 1930s the Argentine government sought to increase the full employment
budget deficit as a means to compensate for the fall in aggregate demand.” The net effect of fiscal actions
were, then, surely contractionary, and remained so through at least 1935. The empirical search for a source


                                                  12
of Argentine economic recovery must focus elsewhere, therefore, and as our earlier evidence suggests, must
concern itself with the escape from gold-standard orthodoxy embodied in the change in monetary regime.
        In fact, fiscal orthodoxy and monetary tensions were two sides of the same coin. Intense fiscal
pressure was felt in many Latin American countries in 1929–30. Tax revenues fell and foreign lenders
refused to roll over debts in the worsening international climate. Deflations and depreciations raised the
burden of foreign-denominated debt service. The deficit for 1930 stood at 4.3% of output, a marked
increase from previous years (Table 1). Debt service had risen from 18% of the budget in 1930 to 29% in
1932 Díaz Alejandro (1983, 20–21). Many countries chose to default in this situation, but Argentina never
wavered from her external sovereign debt obligations, and here fiscal policy and commercial policy were
also tied together. With so much of her trade linked to Britain, and with Britain imposing imperial trade
preferences under the Ottawa accord, Argentina was left to plead for some trade concessions from a weak
position. She finally obtained unfavorable terms under a mostly bilateral trade deal, the Roca-Runciman
pact of 1933 (Díaz Alejandro 1983, 28–29; Salera 1941). So as not to derail this crucial trading pact,
Argentina maintained debt service, understanding that British creditors could not be let down or else severe
trade penalties might result from a diplomatic crisis.
        The fiscal gap could not be closed by default, and attempts to raise tax revenues proved
insufficient. The only remaining answer was to activate the last fiscal resource left to the government: the
large gold stock sitting idle in the vaults of the Conversion Office. This course was taken, but the price for
subscribing to this fiscally orthodox response was to draw down to gold stock and, ipso facto, the money
base, given the mechanical rules of operation followed at the Conversion Office. Thus a deflationary money
contraction was an inevitable but undesirable side-effect of the fiscal course chosen—at least so long as the
Conversion Office played by its own rules.

Monetary Policy

Historically, from 1899 until the founding of the Central Bank in 1935, Argentina was under a currency-
board regime (Table 2). The Caja de Conversión (Conversion Office) was the institution responsible for
the administration of the domestic monetary regime. The Conversion Office held the typical macroeconomic
responsibility of a currency-board: during periods of convertibility, they followed the orthodox gold-
standard rules of the game, standing ready to automatically exchange domestic paper money for specie at
the specified fixed nominal value of the domestic currency in terms of gold. In other words, the Conversion
Office was just that, a window that mechanically and instantaneously swapped paper pesos for specie. By
adopting the gold-standard system, the monetary authorities unilaterally anchored the external value of the

currency. Hence, they could not control the nominal quantity of money in the economy, and this quantity
became an endogenous variable that depended on domestic and world money market conditions.
        It is interesting to see how closely the Conversion Office adhered to these rules, and we can use
high-frequency monthly data to probe the question. In a pure gold standard regime, expansions and
contractions of the nominal quantity of money are exactly correlated with variations in the gold stock at the
Conversion Office. For the 1900–1914 and the 1927–1929 gold standard periods, there is a one-to-one
robust association between money and gold as shown by the data in Table 3 and Figure 3. The correlation
coefficient is exactly one and the sample monthly means of both money and gold stock changes are 2.6
million paper pesos for the prewar period and 4.4 million paper pesos for the 1927–1929 period. Thus,
there was long-lived respect for the currency rule, and inflows and outflows of gold were fully tolerated and
directly converted into changes in the money base.
        More remarkably, there was even strict adherence to the money-gold rule in the float from 1914 to
1927, during a period of suspension of convertibility. In this period, as many core countries witnessed
inflations and hyperinflations during and after World War One, Argentina maintained a key element of
orthodoxy. There was no wild recourse to money printing, even if the exchange rate had drifted away from
its anchor. Indeed, such drift in the exchange rate was unavoidable as most other countries had abandoned
their pegs too after 1914 and until the mid-1920s. Unilaterally, however, Argentina did what she could to
stick to orthodoxy. As was analyzed elsewhere, the suspension of convertibility was foreseen in 1914 as a
temporary political-economy decision to overcome the disruption of international trade and finance during
World War One. This adherence to convertibility was all the more remarkable given the enormous

economic contraction in the years 1914–19 already noted above. All the same, changes in money tracked
changes in gold for the entire period from 1900 to 1931.
            After 1914 convertibility was suspended and exchange controls applied. Nonetheless, there were
occasional outflows of gold for official purposes, and at the Conversion Office these were still
accompanied by a strict application of the gold-for-peso rule.10 But for the most part, in this period 1914 to
1927 the Conversion Office worked in an asymmetric fashion: the monetary base augmented automatically
when gold reserves increased but gold extractions were rarely allowed. Only in five months during 1914:8
to 1919:12 were outflows registered, and only for eight months during 1920:1 to 1927:11 (see again Table
3 and Figure 3). Consequently, in periods of demand pressure in the foreign exchange market, notably in

       But here note that outflows were very limited: 5 out of 65 months in 1914–20, and 8 out of 95 months in
1920–27. Thus the coefficients for the outflows sample yield large standard errors. Still, the hypothesis of a unit
coefficient cannot be rejected.

drain and a monetary contraction, in contrast the quantity of base money remained unchanged and
adjustment instead took the form of a depreciation of the exchange rate, or, an increase in the paper
currency premium relative to the paper-gold par (Figure 4).11 However, it was recognized by policymakers
and even by the market players that resumption at par was the only possible steady state solution to the
turbulence in the monetary and financial markets. How could this tension be resolved?
         A “one-way” gold standard, as this has been called, was still consistent with the long run goal of
resumption at par. for a simple reason. During the boom years of 1900–14, Argentina had built up a huge
gold backing for the currency; and from 1914 to the mid-1920s Argentina had husbanded that stock
carefully via the “one-way” devices of the Conversion Office. By the mid-1920s, resumption still looked
credible because this strategy left Argentina with much stronger backing for the currency, at least as
compared to many core countries, as the gold-exchange standard was built. Thus, actions and beliefs
reinforced each other during this “one-way” gold-standard regime. Actions were geared to the monetization
of gold inflows to expand the quantity of money but officials at the Conversion Office were strict about
targeting the gold-backing of the quantity of money to a minimum of 78% in the turbulent 1920–25 years.
At the same time, core gold standard countries such as Italy, Netherlands, Norway, or the United States
never surpassed a gold-cover ratio of 50% of the money base.
         It is relevant to ask what price Argentina paid in terms of deviation from parity in the foreign
exchange market given this curious “one-way” gold standard policy. Did the exchange rate rise well above
par, requiring a big appreciation to permit resumption? Not at all. The most dramatic foreign exchange
crisis in 1920–21 combined sudden declines in export volumes and the terms of trade. Even so, the
premium over par in the foreign exchange market never went above 33%,12 European countries could
achieve such close convergence to prewar parity only by the mid-1920s, when they started to resume the
gold standard.
         Several observers have noted that the European experience with floating exchange rates after 1914
were dismal in the absence of a well-understood monetary “straight jacket” to limit expansionary monetary
policies, with monetization often deriving from unsustainable fiscal gaps.13 Conditions in Argentina could

    12
       In the opposite circumstance, of gold inflow pressure, Argentina was even more orthodox than other
countries; in the 1918–19 postwar years, the paper peso strengthened well above par before the Conversion Office
decided to permit and monetize incipient gold inflows. In 1918 and 1919, the paper peso in terms of the gold-peso
was quoted at 2.14 and 2.2, well below the 2.27 par value.

not have been more different. More orthodox than the core itself, this peripheral country, from 1914
through to resumption in 1927, lived by the rhetoric, and also the actions, of a government intent on the
idea of resumption at parity. To this end, and notwithstanding the suspension of convertibility and the “one-
way” gold standard, the regime in place was still essentially a metallic monetary regime, and the prevailing
mentalité allowed no room for money issues not fully backed by gold. Historical experience with profligate
monetary policies in the 1880s and before, and the inflation and economic chaos that ensued from such
actions, lived on in the minds of the Argentine policymakers. Fear of repeat inflation underpinned their
strong faith in the religion of the gold standard, which they saw as an effective way for the Argentine
authorities to tie their own hands. Even the severe 1914–19 economic downturn could not break this
commitment.
        Students who focus on the impact of World War One on the Argentine economy might dispute the
idea that from 1900 to 1931 the country maintained a metallic regime because of the emergency laws
installed in August 1914 to overcome the severe financial crisis. The purpose of the 1914 rediscount law
was twofold. First, it established that the state-owned Banco de la Nación could rediscount commercial
paper from other private commercial banks by using up liquid reserves (that is by declining its vault-cash-
to-deposit ratio. Second, it established that, with the consent of the Executive Power, the Conversion Office
could also effect emergency issues (that is, non-backed increases in the quantity of money) as long as gold
reserves at the Conversion Office never fell below 40% of the outstanding money base.
        The first measure was intended to delegate to the Banco de la Nación, a quasi-public bank, and the
largest of all banks, the microeconomic responsibility to forestall liquidity problems in the financial system.
In that sense, one might say that the Banco de la Nación was a forerunner of the Central Bank because it
had a rediscount window. However, the action of rediscounting commercial paper through this first
provision in the law could only effect a change in inside money, or banking money (M3), and not in the
monetary base (M0) which was controlled by the Conversion Office.
        More important, therefore, is the second provision of the law that allowed the Conversion Office to
rediscount commercial and government paper so long as gold backing stayed above a 40% lower bound.
Here we see, as early as 1914, and just 15 years after the 1899 convertibility law, that there was a clear
innovation: the design of an institutional capability that would permit the Conversion Office to de-link gold
and currency movements. Was it used at all? In the period to April 1931 the answer is: almost never. With

the exception of three months in the economic crisis of 1925, the monetary authorities never issued
fiduciary notes.14
         Let us examine the evolution of the money base and the actions of the monetary authorities. Figure
5 shows the evolution of the money base (M0) and its components during the years of the Conversion
Office (January 1900 to April 1935) and the first years of the Central Bank (May 1935 to December
1940). The constancy of the fiduciary issue of the Conversion Office is immediately apparent in the first
component of the money base, and, above it we see the gold-backed component: the strict gold-money rule
applied. Except for a small blip in 1925, and a few other months (where lags kept gold and money slightly




    14
       The conservatism of the Conversion Office contrasts markedly with the more activist behavior of the Banco
de la Nación. The bank rediscounted commercial paper in a countercyclical fashion (Salama, 1997). However at its
maximum, rediscounts never represented more than 4% of a broad definition of money such as M3.

                                                  19
out of synchronization), there were no new money issue not covered by gold at the Conversion Office.15 For
this reason we found the very strict correlations between gold and money seen in Table 3 and Figure 3.
Consequently, we think of there being no significant change of monetary regime until 1931.
         The old regime survived from 1900, through the years of turmoil from 1914 until resumption in
1929, and even beyond the last departure from convertibility in 1929 until 1931. But the previously noted
deflationary pressures and fiscal strains unleashed by the World Depression were sufficient to expose the
suffocating potential of the gold standard “straight jacket.” Moreover, given the circumstances, mere
suspension of the gold standard did not suffice to provide release from gold standard mentalité. If gold had
to be spent in a fiscal rearguard action, the traditional operations of the Conversion Office would have led
to major adverse monetary shock, unless the rules of the game changed. They did:
    Maintenance of liquidity was not simply a matter of ending convertibility. On the one hand, even
    after the abandonment of the gold standard, some countries such as Argentina shipped gold abroad
    to service the external debt and sold foreign exchange to stem the currency depreciation. On the
    other hand, as early as 1931 South American monetary authorities began to adopt measures which
    Professor E. W. Kemmerer and Sir Otto Niemeyer would have found unsound. Thus, the Argentine
    Caja de Conversión, whose old and only duty was to exchange gold for domestic currency and vice
    versa, began in 1931 to issue domestic currency in exchange for private commercial paper. By
    1931 the old Caja even issued domestic currency against treasury paper (Díaz Alejandro, 1983,
    16–17)

         It is therefore very important to note that the association between money and gold totally breaks
down for the period after April 1931 (Table 3 and Figure 3). Gold inflows ceased at this point, but
subsequent gold outflows for fiscal use were sterilized. In many months there we no gold movements, but
the Conversion Office unilaterally changed the nominal stock of money. Accordingly, we consider this the
decisive regime change for Argentine economic policy, certainly during the Great Depression and possibly
for the twentieth century as a whole. It was then that rediscounts began at the Conversion Office (Figure 5).
These rediscounts offset the gold losses that began in 1929, and the fiscal use of gold in the subsequent
years. The rediscounts began under the auspices of the 1914 law, and were soon augmented by a new series
of rediscounts of treasury paper under the “Patriotic Loan” legislation of 1932, which further enhanced the
power of the Conversion Office to make new fiduciary issues via open market operations.
         Thus it was in April 1931 that the macroeconomic and, specifically, the monetary regime shifted
from being a metallic regime to a fiduciary regime. At the end of that year, after just nine months, fiat notes
rediscounted by the Conversion Office went from zero to represent a 30% of the outstanding monetary


    15
      Note that during World War One, and to a lesser extent in the early 1930s, difficulties in shipping gold out
of Europe meant that incipient gold inflows to Argentina were held in European vaults (Legaciónes), but were the
property of the Conversion Office. These were counted as gold backing, and are denoted separately in Figure 5.

base. In 1932, the stock of fiat issues rediscounted by the virtue of the Law of 1914 accounted for 35% of
the monetary base. At that time, the gold backing had already fallen from the targeted 78% in 1929 to 43%,
a ratio slightly above the lower bound limit allowed by the law. In this context, it is instructive to examine
expectations as indicated by behavior in foreign exchange markets: in 1930, the gold premium stood at a
maximum of 28% still below the 1923 mark. However, when the authorities sterilized the fiscal outflow of
gold in 1931 and began rediscounting, the premium skyrocketed to 81% and never reverted to a lower value
(see Figure 4).
         The reaction of the foreign exchange market was a (very rapid) manifestation of beliefs that had
changed: agents increasingly were coming to see the delinking of gold and currency as an increasingly
permanent phenomenon. In a moment, when we will examine the mechanics of institutional change and the
impact of monetary policy, we will see that the macroeconomic regime saw a drastic quantifiable change in
1931. We argue that this precocious heterodox approach by policymakers might have helped Argentina


                                                        21
avoid a severe economic collapse in the Great Depression of the kind seen in so many other countries. The
decisive delinking of gold flows and the change in the quantity of money are evident from the figures
presented in the fourth quadrant in Figure 3. For the 1931–1935 period the average annual change in the
gold stock was –6.7 million paper pesos but the average annual million pesos change in the quantity of
money was +0.6 million paper pesos.
           However, before pursuing a quantitative analysis we think it important to note exactly how
remarkable it was that policymakers were able to make such a dramatic change in regime given the decades
of adherence to monetary orthodoxy. From a political economy point of view, how was it possible for such
heterodox policies be contemplated in a country that had witnessed the Baring crash and had struggled for
years to maintain credible monetary and financial institutions?



The Political Economy of Reflation in Argentina: A Deja-Vu in 1929?

The very costly effects of deflation on the economy were nothing new in Argentine macroeconomic history.
Was this just a seemingly unfortunate fact? The only benefit was what could be learned from the
experience.
           In the aftermath of the 1891 Baring crash, the paper peso, previously equivalent to one gold peso
(and one gold dollar) by the virtue of the 1881 Convertibility Law, suffered a depreciation of 274%. In
spite of the severe misalignment, in 1893, and in the middle of negotiations with international creditors to
settle the external debt situation, Argentine monetary authorities assured international investors that
convertibility would be resumed at anytime and at par. Subsequently, however, there arose a political-
economy debate on whether a gold standard regime should be restored at the original 1881 parity, or if,
instead, a conversion was to be pursued at the then prevailing market exchange rate, thus accommodating
the devaluation.16 Urban sectors and commercial interests favored a convertibility plan fixed at par, while
exporters and industrial sectors called for a higher nominal exchange rate because they believed that any
further deflation of the economy would undermine the profitability of the real sector.
           The most important political-economy argument denouncing the damaging effects of deflation
originated with Silvio Gesell (1862–1930). In an article entitled “Monetary Anemia” written in 1898,
Gesell noted the problem of the debt-deflation trap, anticipating Irving Fisher’s original work by almost
thirty years: “If money gets more expensive, debts increase in exact proportion to the rise in the cost of
money. Nominally nothing changes, but materially the debt load increases. With the prospect of having to


    16
         This section follows closely della Paolera (1994, 28–29).

                                                      22
pay triple what one received, who will dare go into debt to start a new industry in the country?….The
increase in the value of money is the common cause for all the country’s economic troubles….”17 Gesell’s
fear of deflation came to be the dominant view, and the idea of a resumption at par was abandoned. Finally
in 1899 Argentina regained the Gold Standard at a new par rate of 2.2727 paper pesos per gold peso, using
the revaluation of gold as a mean to restore a fixed exchange rate regime.
         The influence of Gesell’s ideas on the importance of changing negative expectations to escape a
deflationary trap was recognized a long time ago by Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes. In his book
Stamp Scrip (1933), Fisher acknowledges Gesell’s innovative ideas on a fiduciary regime as follows:
“Medicine owes much to untrained minds, or at least to minds untrained in medicine. Even Pasteur, though
a trained scientist, was not a doctor; and the laryngoscope was perfected, some say actually invented, by a
great singing master, one Manuel Garcia, of Spain. Silvio Gesell, who died recently, was a German
businessman and quasi-economist. He lived in Argentina and wrote some of his many papers in the Spanish
language. In 1890, while in Argentina, he proposed essentially that particular substitute for money which
now bids fair to sweep this country [the United States] under the name of Stamp Scrip. Gesell before he
died, accumulated a considerable following abroad; but it took the tortures of a depression to bring about
any practical efforts to make use of his Stamp Scrip idea. There is much in Gesell’s philosophy to which,
as an economist, I cannot subscribe, especially his theory of interest; but Stamp Scrip, I believe, can, in the
present emergency, be made at least as useful an invention as Manuel Garcia’s laryngoscope.”18
         John Maynard Keynes went even further in recognizing Gesell’s influence in the General Theory
(193x): “The great puzzle of Effective Demand with which Malthus had wrestled vanished from economic
literature. You will not find it mentioned even once in the whole works of Marshall, Edgeworth and
Professor Pigou, from whose hands the classical theory has received its most mature imbodiment. It could
only live on furtively, below the surface, in the underworlds of Karl Marx, Silvio Gesell or Major
Douglas…”; then, in his Chapter Notes on Mercantilism, the Usury Laws, Stamped Money and Theories of
Under-consumption, Keynes remarked that “[i]t is convenient to mention at this point the strange, unduly
neglected prophet Silvio Gesell whose work contains flashes of deep insight….”; after this Keynes spent
about a dozen pages explaining Gesell’s specific contribution to the theory of money and interest.19
         Gesell was certainly influential in the 1899 decision to resume convertibility at a higher nominal
exchange, and he gained much attention for his critique of a fixed nominal quantity of money as a sub-

optimal monetary rule. Yet, interestingly enough, he is barely mentioned by the other main influential
intellectual figure in our story, Raúl Prebisch.
           Prebisch was not only the key policymaker and architect responsible for the creation of the Central
Bank in 1935, but, most importantly, he was also a most influential and respected economist of the day,
perhaps the only one who could challenge the prevailing mentalité, and conceive of a policy change to
avoid the severe consequences of deflation in line with Gesell’s ideas. Already in 1921, he had written a
brilliant article on the problems of the Argentine currency showing that he understood the costly effects of
deflation.20 During the de facto government of General Uriburu (1930–31), Raúl Prebisch was the
Undersecretary of Finance; but more significantly he was the creative figure of policymaking.
           A critical task for Prebisch was to persuade other policymakers to come around to his position.
Among the various protagonists, one crucial person was Federico Pinedo, a politician and economist who at
first viewed deviation from monetary orthodoxy with suspicion. In an interview years later, we find an
illuminating dialogue between Prebisch and Mateo Magariños where Prebisch explains how the change in
monetary regime came about:
         Prebisch: “I am going to give you an idea of how Federico Pinedo was converted to the idea of
    creating a Central Bank. As I have said, when the General Uriburu spoke about the convenience of
    studying the creation of a central bank, in the report I wrote, Pinedo, in a series of conferences,
    disputed the idea. And he did it in a harsh manner. At the time, I knew him very little. But during
    the world depression there was a situation, when I was the Undersecretary of the Treasury, a
    catastrophic situation. The banking system was on the verge of collapse and we decided—I had the
    idea—to invoke an old rediscounting law that was never applied. The law was approved during
    World War One, in the first week of panic that we experienced, and it allowed the Conversion
    Office to rediscount banking paper. We made it operational….we stated that the rediscount law
    was to be applied….Then Pinedo, who was in the opposition to the Provisional Government, in
    spite of having been a revolutionary, enrolled with the Partido Socialista Independiente….He came
    to see me, I have now a clear picture of that moment; he said: “Prebisch, what mistake are you
    going to make?” («¿Que barbaridad van a hacer?») He was agitated…so nervous that he did not
    want to sit down…I explained to him the critical situation of the Banco de la Nación. The Banco
    de la Nación was the institution which administered the Clearing House. The money that the Banco
    de la Nación had in the vaults was below the cash at the Clearing House. That tells you about the
    gravity of the situation.
         Q: In which period did this occur?
         Prebisch: This was in the year 1932—no, in the year ’31, in the depth of the world depression.
    I gave him a huge amount of confidential information….
         Q: And the issue was starting the project to create the Central Bank?
         Prebisch: No, no, no. It was putting in motion a rediscounting law to allow the Conversion
    Office to rediscount. And Pinedo believed that we would provoke inflation. I explained to him for
    two hours. I did not hide any secret....He asked me a few questions and he started to become more
    calm. After two hours standing up I said: “Ok, Doctor Pinedo, you now know how is the situation.


    20
         Prebisch (1922).

                                                   24
    What would you do if you were in my shoes in the cabinet of the Ministry of Finance?” And he had
    the loyalty of saying, and this is why I admired him so much: “the same thing that you are
    proposing”. He said nothing more. His criticism of the government ceased. For the first time he
    understood in the dramatic crisis that engulfed the country and the financial system. And he started
    to support the measures of the government…He convinced himself that there was no backtrack,
    that the Argentine monetary system based on the automatic exchange of gold for paper and paper
    for gold could not function. But this was in the year 1931. Then 1932 and 1933 elapsed and, when
    he was minister of Finance in 1934 he called me, and he asked me to draft the proposal for the
    creation of the Central Bank….21

          In short, led by Prebisch, a consensus was reached by the economic intelligentsia in Argentina in
which they clearly understood that the time had come to abandon the rigid constraints imposed by a
metallic monetary regime. As elsewhere, the intellectual battle to break the old regime was not easy because
of entrenched fears of lax monetary policy in the minds of people like Pinedo: “The then heterodox South
American monetary policies, which started around 1932, were in some ways a ‘relapse’ into past
inflationary propensities, a past which was meant to be exorcised by the adoption of gold standard
rules…indeed, memories of wild inflation under inconvertible paper during the late nineteenth century,
memories still fresh during 1929–1931, hampered and slowed down the adoption of more self-assured and
expansionist monetary policies” (Díaz Alejandro 1983, 18). But the late nineteenth century also offered
other lessons, and the change of regime built on the ideas of Gesell and others, and on public perceptions
informed by another deflationary spiral, that suffered in the 1890s crisis. No one was to perceive this as a
temporary political economy decision, but as a fundamental break from the past: but could it save the
Argentine economy?



Institutional Change: The Impact of Monetary Policy

In the discussion so far we have found strong prima facie evidence that if any policy actions mattered for
Argentina’s economic recovery from the Great Depression, it was most likely monetary policies and the
change of regime that were central. In this section we attempt to quantify the impact of these policies on the
evolution of the macroeconomy in the 1930s using standard econometric techniques.
          We first attempt to assess the link between monetary variables and nominally-denominated prices,
by examining the evolution of prices and exchange rates using a vector-error correction model subject to a
long-run PPP constraint. We show that monetary policy, when finally used, did have the potential to effect
transitory real devaluations to stimulate the home economy, a channel for recovery noted in Eichengreen
and Sachs (1985) and Campa (1990). However, the impact of such policies was small in the Argentine

                                                   25
case: counterfactuals show that even with an orthodox monetary policy the path of exchange rates and
prices would have been little different. This follows from the fact that Argentine sterilization operations,
although they offset some of the gold outflows, did not aggressively inflate the economy.
        We next attempt to examine another channel, via the credit markets, focusing on the real interest
rate effects of a change in monetary regime. This channel was studied by Romer (1992) for the United
States, and we employ a similar technique here, using the Mishkin (1992) method for forecasting interest
rates. Our results show a big change in 1931 in the path of real interest rates, and counterfactuals show
that absent any such change, the persistence of deflationary expectations would have assured much higher
real interest rates for several years, thus diminishing the chances of recovery. Thus the “Mundell effect”—
to use Temin’s (1989) terminology—was critical in the Argentine recovery: discarding the gold standard
convinced private agents that the risk of deflation was eliminated, and expectations changed accordingly. A
concluding analysis of the real side of the economy, focusing on consumption and investment (following
Romer 1992), shows these channels at work.


The Model

Our model of the impact of monetary policy is a three-equation dynamic econometric model of exchange
rates, prices, and interest rates. The system is estimated using OLS on annual data for the period 1884 to
1941, and is used for counterfactual analysis under alternative monetary policies in the 1930s. The
equations are:

where


        E = exchange rate in paper pesos per U.S. dollar;
        P = price level;
        M = money base (M0);
        P* = U.S. price level;

         q = ln (EP*/P) = log real exchange rate;
         i = nominal interest rate;
         r = real interest rate = i - ∆ ln P;
         Y = real output.


         Equations (1) and (2) model adjustments of the real exchange rate as being driven by two forces:
endogenous adjustment via the lags of E and P and the error correction term q; and exogenous adjustments
via forcing terms M and P*.22 Note that we impose a cointegrating vector that assumes PPP, so that q is the
relevant error correction term. We also allow monetary policy effects, to the extent that they are orthogonal
to q, and any serial correlation terms, to have an impact. This might be viewed as “independent”
components of monetary policy; for example, money innovations not, say, predicted via the price-specie-
flow rule (that is, via q). Since our sample is 1884 to 1941, the bulk of these years (excluding 1900–14 and
1927–29) are years of inconvertibility, and the assumption of complete exogeneity of money is more
reasonable. In principle, we could allow for lags in the polynomial lag coefficients of the vector bi(L) and
the scalar ci(L) and di(L), for i=1,2, but a step-down procedure over five lags found that only the first lags
were significant.23 Equation (3) is a standard Mishkin (1992) interest rate forecasting equation of the type
used by Romer (19xx) in her analysis of the U.S. Great Depression. It is used here in a similar form, with
three lags found significant in the polynomial b2(L) using a step down procedure. Table 4 shows the
estimated model.
         The estimated model looks reasonable. In equations (1) and (2), exchange rates and prices adjust in
accord with PPP as they react to the lagged real exchange rate. There is fast pass through in one period
from money to exchange rates (a coefficient of 0.25), but slower pass through to prices (a coefficient of
0.16), a common structure in open economy macromodels, reflecting fast adjustment in financial markets
but more nominal rigidities in the economy as a whole. Foreign prices pass through to domestic prices
quickly, as one would expect in a small open economy. With noninstantaneous adjustment, there is scope
for monetary policy to effect real devaluations. In equation (3) the real interest rate prediction is most
significantly affected by lagged money growth, and there is scope here for money expansions to drive down
real interest rates. Thus, we are now in a position to evaluate the path of the left-hand side variables under
alternative monetary regimes.


    22
       Here we follow the methodology of Horvath and Watson (1995), but we treat the U.S. price level as
exogenous to the Argentine economy, a not unreasonable assumption.
    23
       In addition, to model dynamics, we add a fourth updating identity:
    (4) ∆ log qt = ∆ log Et + ∆ log P*t–1– ∆ log P*t.

The Counterfactual

Did monetary policies under a new regime end the Argentine Great Depression? As far as having faith in
the gold standard, did Argentina need to lose that religion to start a recovery? And was it the conversion of
the Caja to a new religion that mattered most? It is important now to specify what the appropriate
counterfactual might be. The above questions contain an implicit counterfactual that needs to be examined:
essentially, had the monetary regime not changed, what would have happened? We can think of two cases
that could be considered.
        The basic counterfactual (CF1) examines what would have happened absent the expansion of
domestic credit begun by the Conversion Office in mid-1931. In the counterfactual, we assume that in all
other respects the monetary authority would have continued to act as it had from the end of convertibility in
1929: it would have worked passively in converting paper into gold at the parity rate. The sole movements
of gold would have continued to be the fiscal use of gold by the central government to service external debt,
so we do not admit any private gold flows. However, the sole change in the counterfactual is to no longer
allow the currency board to break the rules, and attempt to sterilize the gold outflows by rediscounting.

         In a second and less harsh counterfactual (CF2) we impose the same path for money, except that
we permit the authorities to revalue gold, as actually happened, in 1935. But we still permit no other forms
of monetary expansion after 1935, and leave changes in money base as being solely based on the the actual
path of gold and reserve stocks of the Central Bank. Thus, in CF1, we effectively imagine a world without
a Central Bank. In CF2, we effectively imagine a world without the Conversion Office rediscounts, but still
allowing the Central Bank to revalue gold.
         Both counterfactuals imply large shocks to the path of money relative to its actual path, as a glance
back at Table 1 confirms. From 1929 to 1934, M0 held constant at around 1,200 million pesos, but this
included substantial injections of domestic credit after 1931 by the Conversion Office to offset gold losses.
Gold stocks fell by almost half, from 954 million pesos (evaluated at parity) in 1929, to 561 million in
1934, but after 1931 domestic credit was expanded from 293 million pesos (its level since 1900, and
inherited from the pre-1900 fiduciary regime), and reached 610 million in 1934, almost exactly offsetting
the gold loss. Thus, in CF1 and CF2, the money supply would have been contracted by about 327 million
pesos in 1934, from 1,172 million pesos to 845 million. Both counterfactuals would have implied a
counterfactual decline in 1934 of about 28% in money base—a massive nominal shock.
         After 1935, the impacts would have been small, however, in CF2, since the revaluation in 1935
added almost a billion pesos to the gold backing, expanding it from 561 million paper pesos, to 1,354
million, as a result of the peso’s loss of more than half its value relative to the old parity of 2.27.
Arithmetically, this overnight “expansion” of gold automatically implied a reduction in the accounting
figure for domestic credit, even after the 1934–35 expansion of the money base by almost 500 million
pesos: the excess “new” gold cover allowed the Central Bank to create an apparent reduction in domestic
credit from 610 million pesos in December 1934 to just 293 million in December 1935 (See Table 1 and
Figure 4).24 Under CF1, conditions after 1935 would have been tougher: absent revaluation, the path of
reserves after 1935 would have been flat, still in 1940 at roughly the same level as 1935: there would never
have been a significant expansion of the gold stock and the money base to compensate for the almost one
third decline in money base after 1929.




    24
        In fact, money injection was not instantaneous, as can be seen from the monthly data, so, for the first couple
of months of the Central Bank’s existence domestic credit was actually negative—that is, gold and reserve backing
at the new parity exceeded the outstanding money base: backing was more than 100%. See Figure 4.

         Figure 6 shows the paths for prices, exchange rates, and interest rates in the two counterfactuals,
using the above estimated model. The results show movements in the various variables that accord with
intuition as regards the direction of change. However, it is the qualitative importance of the magnitude of
these changes that is of the essence here.25

Prices

The actual log price level (LP) showed continued declines in 1929–33, for a cumulative decline of a about
5%–10% in those years. The level then rose markedly throughout the rest of the 1930s, except for a sharp
deflation in the recession of 1938. The 1929 level was regained in 1935, and a further 20%–30% increase
was seen by 1940. The fitted series for prices from the model tracks the actual level very closely over the
entire period. In the counterfactuals it is clear that Argentina would have suffered a more severe and
extended deflation in the early 1930s. In both counterfactuals, with no rediscounting in 1931–34, the price
level would have fallen about 40% rather than a mere 5%–10%, a scenario which would have amplified
and prolonged deflationary expectations. In the CF2, prices barely regain their 1929 price level after 1935
even with the huge gold revaluation. This is not surprising, for although gold revaluation injected about 800
million pesos in 1935, almost double the gold outflow of 400 million in 1929–34 (see Table 1), the model
also incorporates a pass-through of foreign prices into domestic via PPP, and significant imported US
deflation could only just be offset by the revalution. Worse still would have been the outcome without a
revaluation: CF1 shows a persistent 10% decline in prices below the 1929 level, raising the question as to
whether deflationary expectations would have ever been erased in the 1930s under the old regime.

Exchange Rates

Actual exchange rates depreciated markedly after the end of convertibility in 1929, with a more than 50%
loss of value for the peso by 1935. This development seriously undermined the credibility of a resumption
at the prevailing par of 2.27, with two beneficial side effects. First, agents began to doubt the idea of
deflation as a future possibility, as it would have to had to be very severe to reestablish par. Second, the
large move in the exchange rate encouraged Prebisch to plan a revaluation of the Central Bank’s gold
stock, thus cementing expectations even more firmly after 1935. When par was unilateral adjusted from
2.27 to 4.96 in May 1935, there was no turning back (Figure 4). The fit of the exchange rate regression is
poorer (see LEHAT in Figure 6), but the counterfactuals show the expected effects (se LECF1 and


    25

the counterfactuals, dynamic forecast are used, where current fitted values are saved and used as future lagged
values.

                                                     32
LECF2). Absent the rediscounting, the exchange rate would have been 15%–20% stronger in 1931–34.
This should not be dismissed as trivial: the reversibility, via deflation, of a 15% depreciation is a lot more
plausible than the reversal of a 50% depreciation. Indeed, such movements in the paper-gold exchange rate
had been reversed in the 1920s to permit resumption in 1927 (see Figure 4). It is thus not clear whether, in
the counterfactual world, agents would have been sure of a permanent regime shift. Without the revaluation
of 1935, the scenario looks even worse: the mild depreciation persists into the late 1930s, and, with it, the
probability of possibility of a deflation to regain the old par, as in the 1920s. In contrast, the actual story
for the exchange rate makes clear the regime shift: once the paper-gold exchange rate had risen into the
range of 5 to 6, agents could be pretty sure that the government would not be embarking on a deflationary
attack to reactivate the old regime: the costs, political and economic, would have been too high, and the
action thus highly implausible. Instead, drawing on their own history, Argentines would see a parallel to the
resumption in 1900 after the inflation of the 1890s, when a sufficiently large devaluation of the paper peso
relative to gold (from 1.0 to 2.27) required a shift to a new parity to escape the deflation trap.26

Real Exchange Rates

For further comparison we take the above data on prices and exchange rates, and the U.S. price series, and
derive the path of log real exchange rates (Q). The real depreciation of 1929–31 is apparent, but the
reversion to PPP is also clear in the figure. Further, the impact of monetary policy as seen in the
counterfactual experiments appears weak. Certainly, absent the rediscounts, there would have been less real
depreciation after 1931, but only by 5%–10%. Similarly, after 1935, the real exchange rate would have
deviated little from its fitted value. We conclude that the real exchange rate channel was only a weak
conduit for the impact of Argentine monetary policy. This, in part, reflects the counterbalancing impacts of
foreign monetary policy in 1929–31. The much criticized tight policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve could,
according to this view, be seen as the dominant cause of depreciation of the peso relative to the dollar, as
compared to the relatively mild effects of Argentina’s moderate sterilization policy. Similarly, the real
exchange rate effects of Argentina’s policy might be expected to be small, as compared to the much bigger
effect of U.S. monetary policy on U.S. prices and exchange rates. In this view of the world, mistakes by the
U.S. monetary authority helped other countries recover because of their beggar-thyself (or enrich-thy-
neighbor) impact on real activity via the real exchange rate channel. So, does this imply that recovery was


    26
        Or in the international context of the 1920s and 1930s, agents could look overseas for comparisons in the
event that orthodox thinking should return: at 300–400 pesos a strategy akin to British deflation in the mid-1920s
was conceivable, if a reversal of course was to be contemplated. At over 500 to the dollar, agents would see the
situation as closer to the French scenario of the mid-1920s, with resumption at a new par or no resumption at all.

                                                    33
largely external in origin? And did Argentine policymakers have no real impact through their supposedly
radical change of regime? We think not. But if the real exchange rate effects of Argentine monetary policy
were weak, then we are forced to consider an alternative channel.

Interest Rates

Real interest rates (IREAL) were high in 1929–1931, at about 10%. Although nominal rates were much
lower (Table 1), ex post deflation and ex ante expected deflation contributed to high real rates.
IREALHAT, an estimate of ex ante real interest rates constructed using the Mishkin regression technique,
adds to this sense of a deflationary regime before 1931. Thereafter, real interest rates were lower and
frequently negative. The turning point was the start of rediscounts, as indicated by IREALCF1: absent this
action by the Conversion Office the real interest rate would have risen dramatically to 20%–30% in the
years 1931–34, largely as a result of worsening deflation (Figure 6(a)) and persistence in the forecasting
equation. Such painfully high real interest rates would have had, we think, devastating effects on real
activity, particularly investment, thus killing any chance of recovery. Of course, under CF2, a large
injection of money would still have ensued in 1935, from the gold revaluation plan, and, proportionately
this would have been much larger, as a fraction of the level of M0 in 1935, than in the actual case, absent
the rediscounts of 1931–34. Thus, in CF2, there is one very big change in money base in 1935, enough to
temporarily drive real interest rates very low for a year or two. Absent the revaluation, in CF1, this effect
disappears and real interest rates stay higher, although they do diminish finally in 1935–36 as a result of
temporary gold inflows (see Table 1).



Conclusions


The “Mundell Effect” and the Real Consequences of a Change in Regime

The work of economic historians such as Peter Temin, Barry Eichengreen, and Christina Romer has led to
a new consensus as to the role of the gold standard in fostering deflation and depression in the 1920s and
1930s, and the critical impact of monetary policies as a tool for recovery.27 Yet evidence is largely
restricted, at a detailed level, to the study of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other
countries in the core. Further research is now needed from scholars working on the economic history of
less-developed countries, as we investigate to what extent the same approach to theory and evidence can be




                                                  34
applied to the countries of the periphery that also experienced the World Depression. This will help us
understand the broad applicability of the model, and inform our view of economic history at the periphery,
and our study is one step in this direction.28
         We have presented a detailed macroeconomic picture of a peripheral economy in the Depression
years. The Argentine experience exhibits both similarities and contrasts with the events in the core
economies. We argue that Argentine macroeconomic policies in the 1930s did successfully avert a major
disaster by subverting, if only marginally, the prevailing orthodox mentalité inherited from earlier epochs.
Like the core economies, Argentina found itself with little room for maneuver in fiscal matters, a constraint
that was made even tighter by the need to service a large external debt in the face of negotiations with the
British over favorable trading terms. Fiscal orthodoxy was offset, however, by a bold change of monetary
regime, from metallic to fiduciary, in an effort to dislodge deflationary expectations. This plan was the
brainchild of Raúl Prebisch, and, coming far in advance of similar thinking in the core economies, was a
testament to his creativity and brilliance as an economist and policymaker, and his persuasive powers in
convincing powerful interests, and influential figures like Pinedo, to agree to the change he had in mind.
         Given the evidence from our model, we think the main impact of monetary policy change on
recovery was in the years 1931–34, when the collapse of output was reversed and recovery to the 1929
level of activity was secured. The channel was not via real depreciations due to nominal rigidities;
movements in Argentine monetary policy were very small relative to changes in foreign (U.S.) monetary
policy in this period. Nor was the channel the credit market, and lower nominal interest rates, the so-called
“Keynes” effect; after all, nominal rates were low and had little to fall before hitting their floor. Rather, the
channel was the elimination of deflationary expectations, or the so-called “Mundell” effect; after 1931, the
fear of deflation was gone, expectations changed as the monetary regime shifted, and the institutional
change began to look credible and permanent.
         Investigating the impact of monetary policies after 1933 in the United States, Romer (1992) found
a marked correlation between declines in real interest rates, and recovery in investment and consumption
activity. She saw this as confirmation of the transmission mechanism from monetary policy to recovery via
real interest rates. In the same fashion, we display in Figure 7 the same variables for the Argentine case.
Exactly the same pattern is apparent: after 1931 ex ante real interest rates fell, and, as discussed, all of this

investment began to recover, offering more evidence in favor of a “Mundell effect” interpretation.


Economic Ideas and Economic Policy

A remarkable distinction for the Argentine economy and policymakers in the 1930s was the speed with
which the deflation trap was spotted and corrective action taken to avert a calamitous economic collapse.
The actions of the Conversion Office in the Spring of 1931 came far in advance of heterodoxy in the core:
the regime switch predated the British departure from gold by a good six months, and U.S. interventions by
almost two years. Led by Prebisch, policymakers understood very early on in the Depression the need to
impose a change of regime to destroy negative expectations. This can be seen as a manifestation of
Sargent’s (1983) idea concerning the role of expectations and monetary regime changes. Sargent was
thinking of inflationary scenarios primarily, but Temin and Wigmore (1990) showed the relevance of the
same idea to the deflationary context of the 1930s. Associated with Mundell (1963), the deflation trap was
also emphasized by Fisher (1933) and Keynes (1935), each of whom credited its original exposition to the
obscure Argentine thinker Silvio Gesell.




Obstfeld and Taylor (1998). This work is perhaps more ambitious, in that we focus on a single case-study and
examine the structural details of monetary policy and transmission.

         Events in the history of thought and events in economic history were most clearly intertwined in the
Argentine experience. Gesell’s insight came in the economic crisis that followed an attempt to pursue rigid
metallic rules in the 1890s as a prelude to resumption at the 1881 parity. His ideas won the day, and thirty-
two years of gold standard orthodoxy by the Conversion Office could not diminish their relevance in times
of serious deflation. A major deflation was endured during World War One, as the Conversion Office stuck
to its rules, and, suspension aside, left the law of 1914 unused. But the experience was painful: the 1914–
19 crisis was the possibly the longest and deepest recession in Argentine history; social unrest and
economic suffering left a bitter memory. In this context, the next incipient deflation was not so easily
tolerated as the price for orthodoxy. Collective memory was drawn upon as the prospect of a repeat of the
recessions of the 1890s and 1914–19 loomed, and the penetrating ideas of Prebisch held sway as those of
Gesell had a generation before.
         Argentina was a peripheral player in the gold standard, and was arguably penalized for being
outside of the more credible core group (Bordo and Rockoff 1994). These penalties took the form of higher
country risk and reflected a perceived risk of suspension. But in crisis, the less rigid adherence to old
orthodoxy served Argentina well. Experience with a fiduciary regime, and a previous suspension, in the
1890s, provided a model of how economic recovery and the maintenance of par might be at odds. The


                                                  37
amendments to the rules of the Conversion Office in the 1914 law provided the formal mechanism for this
learning experience to be incorporated into the institutional structure as a tool for use by future technocrats
such as Prebisch.


Plus ça change…

In summing up, though, excessive optimism concerning the change of regime should be avoided in our
story, as surely such exuberance over the efficacy of monetary policy in the 1930s and 1940s was
followed, in the long run, by rather too much reliance on expansionary monetary policy in subsequent
Argentine history. The same could also be said of other Latin American countries that discovered the
temporary and deflation-specific benefits of monetary expansion in the 1930s (Díaz Alejandro 1983;
Campa 1990). Though monetary expansion had delivered rapid recovery from the Great depression,
policymakers later seemed unaware that there might be too much of a good thing. The repeated appeal to
monetary expansion in the postwar period delivered not improved macroeconomic performance, but ever
higher levels of inflation, culminating in hyperinflations in many countries, and a need for exactly the
opposite kind of regime shift a la Sargent (1983). The shift eventually came to Argentina in an all too
familiar form.
        In 1991 a return to a currency-board rule was instigated in Argentina, with much popular support,
after all patience had been exhausted with the previous sixty years of floating exchange rates and
persistent, often wild, inflations. The current Convertibility Law puts Argentina on a dollar-standard rule
very similar to, and in some ways stricter than, the gold-standard mechanism used at the Conversion Office
from 1900 to 1931. In search of the Belle Époque again, policymakers and the public turned back to the
same monetary regime that coexisted with the rapid rates of economic growth seen in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. And, apart from one tough recession, economic performance has been
impressive in the last few years. Though little else would be familiar, one might imagine that a visitor
arriving from the 1880s, or 1900s or 1920s, would feel very much at home with today’s dollar-peso rule.
Yet knowing as they did the pitfalls of a metallic regime, and the crises of the 1890s, 1910s, and 1930s,
one cannot be very sure that Silvio Gesell or Raúl Prebisch would so comfortably travel back to the future.
