                                           ABSTRACT

In the 25 years since Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) published their first article on human capital,
the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and the SNA have changed significantly.
The contribution of this paper is two-fold: Creation of a contemporary set of accounts which integrate
human capital measures into the latest comprehensive revision of the U.S. national income accounts
and an analysis of trends in human capital and national income account aggregates over the post-war
period.

The paper is a national income accounting paper with production and factor outlay, income, receipt
and expenditure, capital accumulation , and wealth accounts. All of these accounts are tied to the
NIPAaccounts, and supplemented with human capital estimates. A key feature of the human capital
accountsis presentation of human capital estimates in current and constant prices. The time period
coveredis 1949-84 and 1998-2009.

We update the human capital national income accounts and examine trends in the aggregate time
series.The results in the original Jorgenson and Fraumeni paper are for 1982 and the aggregate time
seriesare from 1949-1984. Subsequent research by Christian (2012) developed modified Jorgenson-
Fraumeni(J-F) human capital estimates from 1998 through 2009. Unfortunately there is a gap in
coverage. Nonetheless,a comparison of the aggregates and their trends between the earlier and later
period will be informative.The accounting tables in this new paper are for 2009, the latest base year
for the NIPA accounts.

                 The Accumulation of Human and Nonhuman Capital, Revisited

                   Barbara M. Fraumeni, Michael S. Christian, and Jon D. Samuels

Just over twenty-five years ago, Jorgenson and Fraumeni (J-F) published their first paper on
human capital (1989). This first paper emphasized the importance of human capital by
presenting human capital estimates embedded in a complete national income accounting system.
Since that time much has changed: the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs)
have been substantially revised and the average number of years of formal schooling completed
in the U.S. has increased by over fifty percent. In addition, increasing attention is being paid to
the topic of human capital. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: 1) to integrate the J-F human
capital accounts with an up-to-date and internally consistent system of national accounts, and 2)
to describe changes and trends in the aggregates over time, particularly those related to human
capital.

“Beyond GDP” is a catchword, popularized by the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, which
calls for innovation in economic accounts. Even before the final 2009 report was released,
commission activities influenced related efforts and resulted in a workshop on human capital in
Turin, Italy November 3-4th, 2008. At this event, jointly organized by the OECD and the
Fondazione Agnelli, Fraumeni (2008b) presented a paper which proposed a simplified approach
to estimating Jorgenson-Fraumeni (J-F) human capital. Subsequently, the OECD Human Capital
Project began with Gang Liu as the primary economist involved in estimating J-F-type human
capital for 16 countries using a simplified approach. With that project, the number of countries
with J-F human capital estimates increased from six to 18. Later, J-F estimates for Argentina
and China were independently constructed as well as new estimates for the United States,
bringing J-F country coverage to 20.1 Interest in human capital measurement continues to the
present, with a report on OECD practices (OECD, 2012), a UNECE Task Force (Statistics
Norway, 2014), and World Bank and UN reports on wealth (World Bank, 2010 and UNU-IHDP
and UNEP, 2014), which both featured human capital.

Figure 1 shows how average educational attainment has changed at the five year frequency
between 1950 and 2010 for three age groups: younger individuals aged 25-34, older individuals
aged 55-64, and a broader age category for those aged 15-74 which includes the majority of the

 The countries include: Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Great Britain, India, Israel, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Rumania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United
States. See Argentina (Coremberg, 2010), Australia (Wei, 2007, 2008), Canada (Gu and Wong, 2009), China (Li
and co-authors 2009b, 2010a, 2014 and annual reports beginning in 2009), India (Gundimeda, Sanyal, Sinha, and
Sukhdev, 2007), New Zealand (Le, Gibson, and Oxley, 2005), Norway (Liu and Greaker, 2009), Sweden (Ahlroth
and Bjorkland, 1997), the United States (Christian, 2009, 2010, 2014) and Mira and Liu (2010) and Liu for the
OECD human capital consortium countries (2011, 2014). O’Mahony and Stevens (2004) applied J-F
methodology to evaluate government provided education in Great Britain. As the references above indicate, for
several countries, OECD human capital project estimates exist as well as estimates constructed during the course of
other research projects.

groups averaged around 1.5 years (6.7 years for those aged 55-64, 8.5 years for those aged 15-
74, and 9.9 years for those aged 25-34). By 2010 average educational attainment is almost
identical across the three age groups, with the average for those aged 15-74 increasing from 8.5
to 13.2 years of formal schooling. The advances continued almost without abatement over the
whole period, except for the oldest group during the 1980-1990 period; however the pace of
these increases slowed after 2000. This paper traces through these changes in educational
attainment that occurred over the last 25 years to their effects on human capital via the lifetime
income approach.

An important component of this paper is to integrate human capital estimates with a system of
national accounts. Since the March 1986 data for the original 1989 paper was collected, six
comprehensive NIPA revisions have occurred. There have been many definition, classification,
source data, methodological, and presentation changes as a result of the revisions. Many were
concerned with prices or quality change, such as hedonic price indexes for computers and
implementation of chained Fisher ideal indexes. Other changes include the classification of
software and research and development as investment, separation of government expenditures
into consumption versus investment, measurement of implicit services provided by property and
casualty insurance and by commercial banks, and a complete revamping of the table presentation

of the accounts.3 In addition, the NIPAs changed to be in greater conformity with the System of
National Accounts.4

This paper includes results for 1948 to 1984, the years covered in the original paper, and from
1998 to 2009, the years covered in the most recent paper by Christian. Human capital related
estimates for 1948 to 1984 are identical to those in the original paper, but nonhuman estimates
are for all years are updated.5 6

Human Capital Accounts Methodology

The Jorgenson-Fraumeni model of human capital (Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1989, 1992b)
measures human capital using the lifetime income approach. It measures the stock of human
capital using an estimate of a population's lifetime earnings, current and future, in present
discounted value. Investment in human capital captures the impact of events that have a positive
impact on the human capital stock, such as births, formal education, and immigration.
Depreciation of human capital captures the impact of events that have a negative impact on the
human capital stock, such as deaths, aging, and emigration. Investment and depreciation--either
in total, or for a particular reason such as education--are valued by the extent to which they add
to or subtract from the human capital stock.

The lifetime income approach to measuring human capital (of which the Jorgenson-Fraumeni
model is the most well-known example) is a commonly used approach to measuring human
capital. Alternative approaches include the cost approach (Kendrick, 1976), which measures the
stock of human capital using the cost of producing it, and the indicators approach, which
measures human capital using indicators such as the average level of education, i.e. Barro and
Lee (2013a). The J-F human capital approach integrates within the same conceptual framework
as the national accounts.

The Jorgenson-Fraumeni model can be used to measure both a market and a nonmarket
component of human capital. The market component of human capital is valued using lifetime
market earnings. The nonmarket component is measured using an estimate of lifetime
nonmarket time spent in activities other than market work, schooling, or personal maintenance,
and valued using an opportunity cost equal to a tax-adjusted market wage. The Jorgenson-
Fraumeni model can also be used to measure human capital for an entire population (including
children), or for a component of that population such as employed people or people of working
age. Human capital for people of working age or for employed people is referred to as "active"
human capital.

  The updated nonhuman estimates are based on the May 28, 2014 NIPA tables.

  Estimates are not available for the middle period: 1985-1997. Constructing such estimates would require a multi-
year full-time project because of the many steps required to do so and changes in the data sources.

In the Jorgenson-Fraumeni model, the population is cross classified by age, sex, and education,
and average lifetime earnings is the present discounted value of earnings. Estimates in a given
year use average yearly earnings and school enrollment rates by age, sex, and education;
discounted earnings reflect mortality rates by age and sex, and an assumed discount rate and
skills-neutral income growth rate. Average yearly market earnings are set to post-tax labor
income by age, sex, and education. Average yearly nonmarket earnings are set to the value of
nonmarket time, defined as time not spent in market work, at school (assumed to be 1300 hours
per year for enrolled persons), or in personal maintenance (assumed to be 10 hours per day for all
persons). Nonmarket time is valued at the pre-tax market wage rate, multiplied by one minus the
marginal tax rate to reflect the opportunity cost of leisure or household production. Age is
topcoded at age 75, and levels of education reflect years of education from 0 (no education) to 18
(two years of graduate school or more).

The actual calculation of lifetime income begins at older ages, and then works its way back
through younger ages. The model splits a lifetime into five stages. From ages 0 to 4, people do
not attend school or earn income. From ages 5 to 13 (5 to 14 in the 1998-2009 results), people
do not earn income, but may attend school. From ages 14 to 34 (15 to 34 in the 1998-2009
results), people may earn income and/or attend school. The differences in the ages between the
phases in the earlier and later results reflects a change in the earliest age of labor income
recorded in Census data. From ages 35 to 74, people no longer attend school, but continue to
earn income. At age 75 or higher, people do not attend school or earn income.

For people age 75 and older, average lifetime earnings are assumed to be zero:

       iy,a,s,e = 0 if a = 75+

where iy,s,a,e is average lifetime income (market, nonmarket, or combined) in year y for people of
age a, sex s, and level of education e.

For ages 35 to 74, average lifetime earnings is equal to average current earnings, plus lifetime
earnings at the next age older, adjusted for survival, discounting, and income growth:

       iy,a,s,e = yiy,a,s,e + [(1+)-1(1+g)sry,a,s,e]iy,a+1,s,e if a = 35, 36, ...., 74

where yiy,a,s,e equals average yearly income (market or nonmarket) and sry,a,s,e equals the survival
rate in year y for people of age a, sex s, and level of education e;  equals the discount rate; and g
is the income growth rate. In the results presented here, the discount rate is set to 0.04, and the
income growth rate is set to 0.02 as in the 1989 accumulation paper. Survival rates differ by age
and sex, but are the same across levels of education within age and sex.

For ages 14 to 34 (15 to 34 in the 1998-2009 results), lifetime income estimates take into account
the probability of attending school:



4
        iy,a,s,e = yiy,a,s,e + senry,a,s,e[(1+)-1(1+g)sry,a,s,e+1]iy,a+1,s,e+1 + (1- senry,a,s,e)[(1+)-
1
  (1+g)sry,a,s,e]iy,a+1,s,e           if a = 14, 15, ..., 34

where senry,a+1,s,e is the school enrollment rate in year y of people of age a, sex s, and level of
education e.

For ages 5 to 13 (5 to 14 in the 1998-2009 results), people are too young to earn income, and so
yearly income is set to zero:

         iy,a,s,e = senry,a,s,e[(1+)-1(1+g)sry,a,s,e+1]iy,a+1,s,e+1 + (1- senry,a,s,e)[(1+)-1(1+g)sry,a,s,e]iy,a+1,s,e
         if a = 5, 6, ...., 13

and for ages 0 to 4, people are too young to attend school, so school enrollment rates are also set
to zero:

         iy,a,s,e = [(1+)-1(1+g)sry,a,s,e+1]iy,a+1,s,e                            if a = 0, 1, ...., 4

The stock of human capital in a given year is equal to the sum of lifetime income across a
population, weighted by population by age, sex, and education:

         hcy = sa e (py,a,s,e × iy,a,s,e)

where py,a,s,e is the population in year y of people of age a, sex s, and level of education e. Note
that this is computed using market, nonmarket, or combined lifetime income. It can also be
computed using the entire population, or using a subset of the population (for example, people of
working-age only).

Investment in human capital is measured using births, education, and (when available)
immigration. Investment from births is the impact of births (the arrival of persons age 0) on the
human capital stock, and is equal to

         biy = s (py,0,s,0 × iy,0,s,0)

Investment from education is the impact of education (people moving up from education level e
to education level e+1) on the human capital stock, and is equal to

         siy = sa e senry,a,s,e [py,a,s,e × (iy,a,s,e+1 - iy,a,s,e)]

The 1998-2009 results include an additional component of investment, residual net investment.
This is the impact of measured changes in the size and distribution of the population by sex, age,
and education that cannot be attributed to measured births, deaths, or schooling. These changes
exist for two reasons. The first is migration, which is not directly measured in the 1998-2009
results. The second is measurement error; in particular, the data on births, deaths, and
educational attainment do not line up exactly with population estimates from year to year. The
primary source of data for the 1998-2009 results are the March demographic and October school

5
enrollment supplements to the Current Population Survey, adjusted to match published national
aggregates for population, births, deaths, and enrollments, with survival rates from the Centers
for Disease Control.

To measure human capital in real terms, the population t (measured by age, sex, and education)
is treated as the quantity, and the lifetime income component (similarly measured by age, sex,
and education) is treated as the weight.7 The ratio of the nominal value to quantity index yield
the implicit price.

Overview of the Accounts

This paper updates the original “accumulation” paper accounts, which were a comprehensive set
of accounts that embedded human capital measures into modified NIPA accounts. The modified
NIPA accounts were based on Christensen-Jorgenson (C-J) national income accounts (1973),
which are summarized in Jorgenson (1980). Subsequently the C-J accounts were revised by a
number of researchers working with Jorgenson: Stiroh, Landefeld, and Samuels, among others.
The most recent and complete version of the modified NIPA accounts is described in Jorgenson
and Landefeld (2006, 2009, and 2010). However, only the original “accumulation” paper added
human capital measures to create “full” national account constructs based on the private
domestic and private national economies.8 A purpose of this paper is to provide a fully
integrated set of national accounts that includes human capital and is consistent with the concepts
included in the US NIPAs.

The following figure briefly summarizes the five J-F accumulation paper accounts which are
presented in more detail in a later section. Although the organization of the accounts is the same
as in the original “accumulation” accounts, many individual elements of these accounts are
revised to reflect the many national income accounting and tabular changes that have occurred
since the publication of the original paper. For comparison, the detailed accounting tables
presented later show data for 1982 (the base year in the original accumulation paper) and for
2009 (the current base year for the NIPA).

The complete accounting and integrated system with human capital measures in each account
includes a production account, incorporating data on output and input; an income and
expenditures account, giving data on income, expenditures, and saving; an accumulation
account, allocating saving to various types of capital formation, and a balance sheet, containing
data on private national wealth. The accumulation accounts are related to the wealth accounts
through the accounting identity between period-to-period changes in wealth and the sum of net
saving and the revaluation of assets.

  The System of National Accounts term “volume” refers to the same concept as “quantity” as used in this paper.
8
  The “new architecture” Jorgenson and Landefeld accounts (2006, 2009, and 2010) also include a foreign
transactions current account and a U.S international position account.

The production account is for the private domestic economy; the other accounts use private
national as the conceptual basis. The private domestic concept excludes the output and inputs of
the government sector. The receipts and expenditure account is based on the accounting identity
that the value of consumer receipts equals the value of outlays plus saving. Thus, compensation
of government employees appears on the receipts side of the income and expenditure account. In
general, the private national concept includes account relevant activities that occur in the United
States, but restricts included relevant activities to those made by (such as expenditures), received
by (such as income), or held by (such as wealth) private entities.

To give a sense of how relative magnitudes have changed over time, the figures 3 and 5-8
indicate the nominal dollar shares of the major components of the major aggregates included in
the accounts in 1982 and 2009.9

Changes in the nominal shares of full gross private domestic product (see figure 2) between 1982
and 2009 mainly reflect changes in the labor force participation rate of women. Time in
household production and leisure values time other than time in 1) sleep and maintenance
(assumed to be 10 hours per day and given a zero valuation), 2) formal schooling (assumed to be
1300 hours per year for any enrolled individual), and 3) market work (which varies depending
upon estimated hours). Time in household production and leisure is valued using the opportunity
cost market wage. Human investment depends on the impact of births (a population increase)
and formal schooling (increases in wages accrued to those with higher levels of education) on
lifetime income, which includes both market and nonmarket income. As figure 4 illustrates,
female labor force participation has almost doubled between 1948 and the end of the period,
from just over 30 percent to around 60 percent. With the increase in female market work time,
time spent and the corresponding nominal share of the value of time in household production and
leisure in full gross private domestic product has decreased. Also, investment in education has
risen between 1982 and 2009 with the higher educational attainment of both men and women,
but most notably for women.10 At the same time, the nominal share of the “Full” component
which is included in gross private domestic product has declined somewhat between 1982 and
2009.




9
  The “Full” aggregates include human capital accounts components.
10
   According to the Barro and Lee (2013b) estimates, in 2010 the percent of the total population aged 15 and above
that completed the tertiary level of education is almost identical for females and males (both to two significant
digits at 27 percent), however, females compared to males made the greatest gains in this category over the period
from 1980 to 2010. In 1980, the percent of the female population aged 15 and above that completed the tertiary
level of education was 14 percent; while for males it was 20 percent.

All of the major nominal subcomponents of gross private national income have increased by a
factor of between 4.2 and 4.7 times between 1982 and 2009. The major subcomponents include
private domestic outlay for labor services, private national labor income, nonmarket labor
income, full private national labor income, gross domestic private outlay for capital services, and
gross private national property income (see table 4). Gross private national property income (see
figure 3) has stayed almost a constant nominal share of the sum of labor and property income.
Note that nonmarket labor income includes both human investment and time in household
production and leisure, so the trade-off between these two components of nonmarket labor
income is masked in the aggregate shown in figure 3. The nominal share of the private (market)
component of labor income has decreased slightly with a corresponding increase in the
nonmarket component of labor income.

Overall the nominal share of capital formation in full private national consumer expenditures
(see figure 6) has risen between 1982 and 2009. Often analysts are concerned about the level of
private national capital formation, missing the important role that human capital formation has
played since the early to mid-eighties. The nominal share of gross private national human capital
formation in 1982 and full private national consumer outlays in 2009 are similar. The nominal
share of full private national consumer outlays in1982 and gross private national human capital
formation in 2009 are similar. The importance of including both human and private (nonhuman)
capital formation is highlighted by this figure.

Human capital saving is clearly the largest, and a growing component of full gross private
national saving (see figure 7). On average individuals have invested more in education since
1982. The increase in the average U.S. educational attainment is certainly in part a response to
the demand for more highly skilled workers, which has resulted in a wage premium paid to those
workers compared to those with fewer skills.11

It might be surprising that the nominal share of human wealth in full private national wealth has
decreased over the same period, given the increase in the nominal share of human capital saving
(see figure 8). This is likely due to the increase in depreciation as the baby-boomers approach
retirement (Colby and Ortman, 2014). The nominal share of depreciation in full gross saving rose
from 47 percent in 1982 to 80 percent in 2009 (see appendix table 19). The share of U.S.
resident population age 55 through age 64 rose from 9 percent in 1950, to 10 percent in 1980,
and to 12 percent in 2010.12 Private national human wealth is by far the largest component of full
private national wealth, accounting for over 90 percent of the nominal total in both years.

Accounts Presentation and Discussion

In this section, details of the accounts are presented in three ways with: 1) definitional tables for
1982 and 2009, 2) rates of growth tables for major aggregates by sub periods, and 3) contribution
tables for major aggregates by sub periods. The rates of growth tables show rates of growth from
1949-1984, 1949-1973, 1973-1984, 1998-2009, 1998-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2009. The
contributions tables, since contributions require lagged components, are for average
contributions from 1950-1984, 1950-1973, 1974-1984, 1999-2009, 1999-2000, 2001-2005, and
2006-2009. As the original accumulation paper used Thornqvist indices, so does this updated and
revised version.13 14 With Thornqvist indices, contributions are a weighted rate of growth, where
the weights are an average of the nominal dollar share in the previous period and the
contemporaneous period and the rate of growth is a logarithmic growth rate of the quantities
from the previous period to this period. The sub period breakpoints reflect economic conditions;
in the productivity literature it has been clearly documented that productivity shifted downward
post-1973; the period 1999-2000 corresponds to the end of the “IT Boom” period which began in
1995; and by 2006 the economy was headed towards the Great Recession (Jorgenson, Ho, and
Samuels, 2104). Tables corresponding to all time series tables in the original accumulation paper
are in the appendix; these time series tables are the data which underlie all figures and tables in
the body of the paper. Accordingly, this paper provides a complete basis for review and analysis
of the accounts presented herein which embed human capital related measures in a national
income accounting framework.

The first account (see table 1) is the production account.15 As in the “new architecture” accounts
(Jorgenson and Landefeld, 2006, 2009, and 2010), the core NIPA are modified in a number of
ways. In the product account to allow for integration with productivity accounts, property-type
taxes are included, but some other types of taxes such as primarily sales taxes, are not included.
Imputations for nonhuman capital services (see line 16 of the product account) add into gross
private domestic product several capital services that are not in NIPA GDP. These include those
for consumer durables and real estate held by institutions and producer durable equipment held
by institutions. The other imputation included in line 16 of the product account is for an addition
to real estate held by households capital services as it is undercounted in NIPA GDP. These
modifications are relatively minor in scale; as was already clearly seen in figure 3, the human
capital components dominate the production account.

For the sub periods that we consider, prices and quantities generally increase over time. For that
reason and because the sum of the price and quantity rates of growth must equal the nominal
dollar rate of growth, the rates of growth for quantities and prices are typically less than the rate

13
   Some of the sub components of the aggregates shown in this paper for the most recent period, 1998-2009, are
constructed using Fisher indices. However, all aggregates in paper tables are constructed using Thornqvist indices.
14
   The human capital account components are identical to those in the original accumulation paper, but other
components are revised over all periods to reflect changes and revisions in the NIPA.
15
   All table numbers in the account tables refer to NIPA table numbers unless otherwise specified.

of growth of nominal dollars.16 Because quantities per capita are divided by a population
denominator that is always growing throughout the period, the rate of growth of the quantity is
always greater than the rate of growth of the quantity per capita. Discussion will focus on the
price and quantity subcomponents of the nominal dollar rate of growth and on the quantities per
capita.

By sub periods, with one exception, the full product, full investment and full consumption price
rates of growth are always greater than the quantity rates of growth (see table 2).17 18 Both full
investment and full consumption encompass human capital related components; the former
includes human capital investment (births and education) and the latter includes time in
household production and leisure. Between the earlier period (1948-1984) and the later period
(1998-2009), the nominal share of full investment in full product becomes larger than the
nominal share of full consumption in full product (see appendix table 3). By sub periods, full
investment prices, which grow at a higher rate than full consumption prices in the earlier period,
grow at a lower rate than full consumption prices in the later period, with the exception of 1998-
2000. However, in all sub periods except for 1949-1973, full consumption quantities and
quantities per capita (shown in the constant prices per capita line) grow at a higher rate than full
investment quantities.19 However, in 1949-1973, the difference between the rates of growth is
only .001 percentage point. Full investment quantities per capita decrease in all sub periods
beginning in 1973 or after. Population growth averaged about 1 percent per year during that
time period. The quantity of human capital investment increase only slightly between 1973 and
1984 and actually decreased between 1998 and 2009 (see appendix table 2).20

By sub periods, full property outlay quantities and quantities per capita always grow at a much
faster rate than full labor outlay quantities and quantities per capita (see table 3). The decline in
quantities per capita in all of the later sub periods again reflects the slowdown in human capital
investment growth, which is included in full labor outlay. This decline is offset slightly by the

   United States national population grew at a rate of .0131 in 1949-1984, .0146 in 1949-1973, .0097 in 1973-1984,
.0915 in 1998-2009, .0216 in 1998-2000, .092 in 2000-2005, and .0093 in 2005-2009. The population figures from
2000-2009 are intercensul estimates, which means that the change between 1999 and 2000 is expected to be revised
eventually. The one year growth rate between 1999 and 2000 is .0341. Accordingly, all quantity per capita growth
estimates for 1998-2000 are likely biased downward. Subsequent sub period growth rates are also impacted, but to a
significantly lesser degree.

The first contribution figure (see figure 9) presents both sides of the production account as well
as the implied multifactor productivity growth that is consistent with full product output and
inputs.22 Even with human capital measures integrated into the account, as expected multifactor
productivity growth falls beginning in the 1974-1984 sub period, recovers strongly in 1999-2000,
but falls again, and even becomes negative, during the last period, 2006-2009, which includes the
Great Recession and the slow recovery. Except during the 1950-1973 sub period, the
contribution of full consumption to overall economic growth outweighs that of full investment.
Except during the 1999-2009 and 2001-2005 sub periods, the contribution of full labor to
economic growth outweighs that of full capital. The negative contribution of full labor in 2001-
2005, which dominates the 1999-2009 period, is due to the factor mentioned earlier: the
slowdown in human capital investment. Full capital contributes more to economic growth than
multifactor productivity growth in all periods.

The second account is the labor and property income account (see table 4). Human capital
components only enter into labor income. Figure 5 showed that there is very little change in the
nominal share of gross private national labor income in total income between 1982 and 2009 and
that nonmarket labor income represents almost 75 percent of total income. In this account, the
split of personal income taxes between labor and property income is imputed in the modified
NIPA set of accounts.

By sub period, full private national labor income growth demonstrates a typical pattern for a
labor aggregate, but there is no consistent growth pattern for gross private national property
income in the earlier sub periods (see table 5). For labor income, the growth in prices is
consistently greater than the growth in quantities and the growth in quantities is consistently
greater than the growth in quantities per capita as expected. The growth in property income
quantities is greater than growth in prices for only two of the seven sub periods: 1949-1984 and
1973-1984. The growth in prices for each of the three aggregates in all later period sub periods is
always less than the growth in prices in all of the earlier period sub periods.

The third account is the consumer receipts and expenditures account (see table 6). The aggregate
full gross private national saving includes human saving as well as nonhuman saving (see
appendix table 15 and line 10 of the Expenditures part of the account). The receipts part of the
account includes all human capital components listed in the Product account of table 1.
Consumer durables are excluded from expenditures as in the modified “new architecture”
accounts and these accounts as consumer durables are considered investment (see line 2 of the
Expenditures part of the account). Figure 6 showed that there is a very large increase in the
nominal share of gross private national human capital formation in full private national consumer
expenditures between 1982 and 2009.

By sub periods, price growth is almost always greater, and usually significantly higher, than
quantity growth in the expenditure component and in the consumer outlays and saving
subcomponents (see table 7). The only subcomponent and sub period for which quantity growth
is greater than price growth is the consumer outlays subcomponent for the 1998-2000 sub period.

The fourth account is the gross private national capital accumulation account (see table 8). This
account, as well as demonstrating how full gross private national saving is equal to gross private
national capital formation, derives net private national saving and change in private national
wealth (see the Saving part of table 8). Depreciation experienced the greatest relative change
between 1982 and 2009 in any of the sub components which show the relationship between gross
private national saving and change in private national wealth. The 2009 estimates for gross
private national saving, human capital saving, and full gross private national saving are all four
to six times the corresponding 1982 estimates, however the 2009 estimate for depreciation is
well over nine times the corresponding 1982 estimate. As previously noted, human capital
depreciation has risen significantly potentially as the result of the aging of the baby-boomer
population. Accordingly, the 2009 estimate for net private national saving is only just over two
times the corresponding 1982 estimate. As the 2009 estimate for revaluation, which is added to
net saving, is just over 1.5 times the 1982 estimate, the 2009 estimate for change in private
national wealth is between 1.5 and 2 times the 1982 estimate.

By sub periods, given the relative changes in the magnitudes, it is not surprising that the full net
saving quantity growth is negative for all sub periods except for 1949-1984 and 1949-1973 (see
table 9). If it were not for the strong growth in the 1949-1973 sub period, the 1949-1984 sub
period growth would also be negative. In the 2000-2005 sub period, even the full net saving
price growth is negative. With low rates of quantity growth for all components for all sub
periods beginning in 1998 or after, quantities per capita growth are all negative as well with one
exception: full depreciation in the 2005-2009 sub period.

Figure 10 shows negative contributions for net saving for all periods beginning in 1974 or after
as contributions are weighted quantity rates of growth. As full gross private saving is the
aggregate, depreciation has a positive contribution. However, this perspective changes when
looking at net saving, which is probably the more relevant aggregate. Depreciation contribution
is particularly large during the two sub periods when economic growth was lower: 1974-1984
and 2006-2009. During the 2006-2009 sub period, unemployment was high and labor force
participation declined, both factors reducing gross and net human saving, the latter due to human
depreciation increasing. The human saving quantity reached its maximum for the broader sub
period 1999-2005 in 2000, at the end of the “IT Boom” period (see appendix table 16).
Accordingly, it is not surprising that the contribution of human saving is a large negative during
the 2001-2005 sub period. In this sub period, the contribution of total saving is not appreciably
different from zero.

Figure 11 combines information from the income account of table 4, the full private consumer
outlays component of table 6, and the net private national saving component of table 8. In this
figure, growth in the level of living is the difference between growth rates of expenditures and
incomes. Total growth is the highest in the 1950-1973 sub period. Half of the subcomponents
experience a maximum contribution in this sub period: labor income, level of living, and net
saving. In all sub periods starting in 1973 or after, as just described, the contribution of net
saving is negative. The contribution of market consumption is the highest over all sub periods
in1999-2000 at the end of the “IT Boom” period, and continues to be an important contributor in
1999-2000 at the end of the “IT Boom” period, and continues to be an important contributor in
the 2001-2005 sub period before reaching its minimum during the 2006-2009 Great Recession
and slow recovery sub period. The level of living contribution is even negative during this last
sub period. The contribution of market consumption, which is the contribution of time in
household production and leisure, is lower in all sub periods beginning in 1999 than in all
previous sub periods.

The fifth, and last account, is for full private national wealth (see table 10). Using either nominal
shares or contributions to examine subcomponents of wealth, the magnitudes for human wealth
clearly dominate (see figures 8 and 12 and appendix table 22). The magnitudes of private
domestic tangible assets, which are clearly larger than the magnitudes of net claims on
governments and the rest-of-the world, are small compared to the magnitude for human wealth.
Tangible assets represent clearly less than 10 percent of full private national wealth.

By sub periods (see table 11), price growth is almost always greater than quantity growth. Both
exceptions are for nonhuman wealth. In the sub period 1949-1973, nonhuman wealth price and
quantity grow at a relatively strong rate (approximately between three and four percent), with
quantity growth being greater. In the sub period 2005-2009, the nonhuman wealth price
decreased at a very large rate. For human wealth, in the earlier period, 1949-1984, the difference
between the price rate of growth and the quantity rate of growth is over three and one-half
percentage points; in the later period, 1998-2009, this difference fell by over one percentage
points.

The final figure (see figure 12) shows the contribution of nonhuman versus human wealth to
growth in full private national wealth. The significant variation in growth in sub period 1950-
1973 compared to 1974-1984 can be attributed to the contribution of human wealth, which is
well over one percent in each of these sub periods. The contribution of human wealth to growth
in total wealth continued to be strong in all later sub periods, but it is always less than one
percent. As figure 1 illustrates, average educational attainment for those aged 15 through 74
increased at a rapid rate from 1950 to 1980, with the rate of increase substantially slowing from
1980 to 2010. In the earlier three sub periods and again in 2001-2005, nonhuman wealth
contributes .25 percentage points to growth in total wealth. Its contribution is less in 1999-2009,
1999-2000 and 2006-2009. The decrease in both the contribution of human and nonhuman

Conclusion

Without looking at a set of national accounts with integrated human capital components,
researchers, analysts, and policy-makers will have an incomplete picture of economic growth.
Major economic trends are very much evident in the results: the slowdown in the sub period
1974- 1984 relative to the sub period 1950-1984, the rebound in the sub period 1999-2000 at the
end of the “IT Boom” period, another slowdown in the sub period 2001-2005, followed by a
weak economy in the sub period 2006-2009. The benefit from integrating human capital
components most clearly comes from quantification of the impact of an end to the gains in
average educational attainment and female labor force participation and the greying of America.
Recently, in a number of countries including China and India, the average educational attainment
of the young aged 25 through 34 have substantially surpassed the average educational attainment
of the older aged 55 through 64.23 By contrast, in 2010 the average educational attainment of the
young in the United States is barely above the average educational attainment of older
individuals.24 A typical situation is for sub period price growth to be larger than quantity growth.
The contribution of net saving is negative in all sub periods beginning on or after 1974 and
depreciation more than doubled as a share of gross saving between 1949 and 2009 (see appendix
table 19).25 What does it mean in a world economy to have price growth to be larger than
quantity growth? How will the decrease in the contribution of human capital play out in the
future? Will the economies of many other countries, particularly emerging countries, continue to
catch up, and if so, at what pace? Does this mean that the United States government should be
encouraging policies to increase investment in human capital? The answers to these questions
are unknown, but they can best be explored using accounts which include human capital
components.

   For all years, 1998 through 2009, human depreciation is approximately 90 percent of total depreciation.
