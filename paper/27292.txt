                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze how regulatory constraints on household leverage--in the form of loan-to-income
and loan-to-value limits--affect residential mortgage credit and house prices as well as other
asset classes not directly targeted by the limits. Supervisory loan level data suggest that mortgage
credit is reallocated from low-to high-income borrowers and from urban to rural counties. This
reallocation weakens the feedback loop between credit and house prices and slows down house
price growth in "hot" housing markets. Consistent with constrained lenders adjusting their
portfolio choice, more-affected banks drive this reallocation and substitute their risk-taking into
holdings of securities and corporate credit.

1       Introduction
Policymakers have recently proposed and implemented macroprudential policies aimed at
limiting household leverage to slow down the feedback loop between credit and house prices.
The academic literature--by showing that build-ups of household leverage have historically
led to busts, lower output growth, and higher unemployment (Mian et al., 2017)--has high-
lighted the importance of these policies, adopted by more than 60 countries since 1990.
    In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the most widely used type of
macroprudential regulations, namely, policies that limit household leverage in the residential
mortgage market. Combining county level house price data, loan level data on residential
mortgages and credit to firms, as well as bank security level holdings, we study the introduc-
tion in 2015 of loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) limits for residential mortgages
issued by Irish banks.1 The policy was introduced in the aftermath of a dramatic boom-bust
cycle that led to a financial crisis that, in turn, forced the government to adopt a costly
bailout (Acharya et al., 2014).2 The lending limits affect 43% of the typical mortgage origi-
nation and are immediately effective after the announcement. The goal, in the words of at
the time central bank governor Patrick Honahan, was to "prevent another psychological loop
between credit and prices and credit" and "keep banks and borrowers safe."
    We document that whereas the lending limits affect a large share of the residential mort-
gage market, mortgage issuance keeps growing after the policy introduction as the market
"moves" to conform with the new limits. Our analysis of this reallocation provides three
main findings: (i) Mortgage credit is reallocated from low- to high-income borrowers and




    1
     Alam et al. (2019) collected data from 1990 to 2016 on macroprudential policies in 134 countries. LTV
and LTI limits have been adopted by 60 and 42 countries, respectively. LTV limits are the most widely used
tool in advanced economies. See Cerutti et al. (2017) for another cross-country database.
   2
     The household debt/GDP ratio increased from 55% to 101% from 2002 to 2007, followed by -10% GDP
growth and a +8% unemployment rate change over the next three years.


                                                    2
from counties where borrowers are close to the lending limits (typically urban areas) to coun-
ties where borrowers are more distant from the lending limits (typically rural areas); (ii)
this reallocation is effective in slowing down house price growth, and in turn, the feedback
loop between mortgage credit and house prices, in "hot" housing markets; and (iii) this
reallocation is consistent with a bank portfolio choice channel as banks more affected by the
limits drive the mortgage credit reallocation and increase their risk-taking in their holdings
of securities and credit to firms, two asset classes not targeted by the policy.
   Next, we describe these results in detail. First, we show that 43% of the mortgage issuance
in the year before the policy would have been affected if the rules had been in place during
this period. Nevertheless, the increase in "conforming" issuance offsets the collapse in the
issuance of those mortgages that exceed the newly imposed limits, leaving aggregate issuance
barely affected. However, not every mortgage is affected in the same way. In the cross-section
of counties, "hot" housing markets (typically urban counties) are closer to the limits than
"cool" housing markets (typically rural counties). In the cross-section of borrowers, high-
income borrowers are more distant from the limits than low-income borrowers. We show
that, after the policy introduction, residential mortgage issuance moves from hot to cool
housing markets and from low- to high-income borrowers. Following the methodology in
Mian et al. (2019), we compare estimated coefficients with and without county-time fixed
effects, which absorb the general equilibrium forces at the county level. This comparison
suggests that the policy weakened the sizable general equilibrium "loop between credit and
prices and credit" at work before the policy introduction.
   Second, we show that the evolution of house prices is consistent with the observed geo-
graphic credit reallocation. House price growth, around 14% year-on-year (YoY) and rapidly
increasing at the time of the policy announcement, stabilized below 10% post-regulation.
This evolution is driven by hot housing markets where house price growth, well above 20%
YoY and rapidly increasing at the time of announcement, collapsed to around 4% post-
regulation. As a result, the lending limits substantially reduced the geographical heterogene-

                                               3
ity in house price growth. House prices are also consistent with the reallocation across the
income distribution as the differential evolution of house price growth across counties is more
pronounced for larger properties, more likely to be purchased by high-income borrowers.
    Third, we show that our findings are consistent with a bank portfolio choice channel. Con-
sider an environment where banks solve their portfolio problem subject to a binding balance
sheet constraint (e.g., funding or regulatory capital constraint) and introduce the additional
mortgage lending limit constraint.3 According to this channel, following the introduction
of the lending limits, banks reallocate their portfolio and issue mortgages that would have
not otherwise been funded. We test this channel exploiting bank level heterogeneity. We
calculate the share of bank issuance that would have been affected if the limits had been in
place the year before the policy. After confirming that more-exposed banks drive the aggre-
gate reallocation, we find that more-exposed banks reduce their issuance to borrowers in the
bottom quintile of the income distribution by 10% and increase their issuance to borrowers
in the top quintile by 15%, controlling for local economic conditions and credit demand.
    We further confirm the role of banks by documenting (i) bank risk taking in asset classes
not targeted by the lending limits and (ii) the evolution of banks' risk exposure. First, we
analyze banks' holdings of securities and credit to firms, capturing, together with residential
mortgages, approximately 80% of banks' assets. We find that more-exposed banks increase
their holdings of high-yield securities more than less-exposed banks, relative to the pre-policy
period, controlling for stringent security-time and bank-time fixed effects. Similarly, we find
that more-exposed banks increase their corporate lending (higher volumes and lower rates),
targeting mostly risky borrowers. Second, we show that Irish banks' equity returns, usually




   3
     In our setting, residential mortgages are almost entirely issued by banks that hold them on balance sheet.
Irish banks are also likely constrained at this time as they hold a large stock of non-performing loans and
are adjusting their balance sheets to comply with new capital and liquidity regulations.

positively correlated with real estate returns, become insensitive to real estate and positively
correlated with non-financial firms' equity returns after the introduction of the lending limits.
    The rationale for macroprudential policies is based on the observation that agents over-
borrow in good times, not internalizing all the costs of their financing choice (Lorenzoni, 2008;
Bianchi, 2011; Bianchi and Mendoza, 2010, 2018). In the U.S., the increase in mortgage credit
contributed to the rapid appreciation of house prices (Favara and Imbs, 2015; Mian and Sufi,
2009, 2019; Adelino et al., 2015; Di Maggio and Kermani, 2017). Their collapse, channeled
through the balance sheets of households (Mian et al., 2013; Mian and Sufi, 2014; Hall,
2011; Eggertsson and Krugman, 2012; Jones et al., 2018) and intermediaries (Gertler and
Kiyotaki, 2011; He and Krishnamurthy, 2013; Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2014; Chodorow-
Reich, 2014), contributed, in turn, to the Great Recession.
    We contribute to the literature on macroprudential regulation aimed at limiting household
leverage, by (i) jointly analyzing mortgage credit, house prices, and--using the methodology
of Mian et al. (2019)--their feedback loop, and (ii) showing that lenders play an important
role in the transmission.4 A few other papers analyzing LTV/LTI limits find results consistent
with ours.5 DeFusco et al. (2020) show how the Dodd-Frank "Ability-to-Repay" rule (similar
to a LTI limit) successfully reduced borrower leverage, and Van Bekkum et al. (2019) show
LTV limits caused Dutch borrowers to increase their downpayments. Although they do not




   4
     See Aikman et al. (2019), Freixas et al. (2015), Claessens et al. (2013), Claessens (2015), and Gambacorta
and Murcia (forthcoming) for excellent overviews of macroprudential policies. Our paper is also related to
the literature, empirical (Aiyar et al., 2014; Jimenez et al., 2017; Gropp et al., 2019; Benetton, 2019; Benetton
et al., 2017; De Marco and Wieladek, 2015; Ayyagari et al., 2019) and theoretical (Landvoigt and Begenau,
2017; Elenev et al., 2018; Begenau, forthcoming; Kashyap et al., 2019; Malherbe and Bahaj, forthcoming),
on macroprudential policies (mostly capital requirements) aimed at limiting bank risk-taking. We use the
methodology in Sarto (2018) and Mian et al. (2019) to decompose the general equilibrium effect of the policy
in a partial equilibrium component and a general equilibrium multiplier.
   5
     Analyzing the policy of this paper, Kinghan et al. (2017) show LTV fell for first-time and subsequent-
time buyers. Compared with their paper, we focus on house prices and document a reallocation of mortgage
credit across the income and geographical distributions.

analyze the role of banks, Tzur-Ilan (2019) and Igan and Kang (2011) show borrowers move
away from hot housing markets, slowing down house prices in Israel and Korea, respectively.6
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the
setting. Section 3 documents the mortgage credit reallocation. Section 4 analyzes house
prices. Section 5 presents the bank portfolio choice channel. Section 6 discusses financial
stability. Section 7 concludes.



2       Setting and Data
Section 2.1 provides some background on the Irish residential mortgage market. Section 2.2
and Section 2.3 describe the macroprudential policy and our data.


2.1     Residential Mortgage Credit in Ireland

In the years leading up to 2000, Ireland experienced a period of steady economic growth
often interpreted as a healthy convergence of the "Celtic Tiger" with the rest of the European
Union. However, the surge in output from 2003 to 2007 was of a different type, fueled by
a construction boom financed through bank credit (Honohan, 2010). In Figure 1, we show
the issuance of residential mortgages (dashed line) from 2000 to 2016 and observe a stark
increase from 2002 to 2007. Issuance then collapsed and started increasing again in 2013.
House prices (solid line) followed a remarkably similar pattern.7




    6
     Auer and Ongena (2019) and Basten (forthcoming) show that capital buffers on Swiss residential lending
led to higher growth in commercial lending and shifted mortgages from less to more resilient banks, respec-
tively. Using Singaporean data, Agarwal et al. (2018) show that policies that impose limits on LTV cause
an increase in high-LTI issuance. These papers do not analyze house prices or banks' risk exposure.
   7
     In the online appendix, we show that the boom-bust cycle in the housing market has been more pro-
nounced in Ireland compared with the U.K., the euro area, and the U.S. around the same period. After the
bust, mortgage originations and house prices rebounded, mostly driven by "pent up" demand of households

    During the bust of 2007-10, prices declined sharply and construction activities collapsed.
The fall in quarterly Gross National Product (GNP) is estimated to be about 17%.8 In
addition to the sharp decrease in real estate prices, the increase in unemployment from 4.6%
in 2007 to 13.3% in 2010 left many households unable to service their debt. This increase
in non-performing mortgage credit led to losses for banks that consequently experienced
funding dry-ups.9 In September 2008, public funds had to be used to recapitalize almost
all large domestic credit-taking institutions, which needed further government assistance in




whose incomes were not affected by the crisis but avoided buying during the bust (the share of renters that
became first-time buyers had fallen to 2% in 2012 and then rose steadily up towards 7-8%). This increased
demand interacted with a weakened supply elasticity.
   8
     The Irish economic performance is better measured with GNP because GDP is inflated by profits of
international companies transferred to Ireland because of low corporate tax.
   9
     Almost all mortgages in Ireland are held on banks' balance sheets. No active securitization market exists.
Securitization is solely used to create collateral eligible to be pledged at the ECB and in certain recent cases
to transfer nonperforming exposures off banks' balance sheets. Risk transfer off banks' balance sheets is
not common. Refinancing mortgages are not part of our sample. They account for less than 15% of total
mortgage issuance during our sample period.

2.2      The February 2015 Mortgage Lending Limits

To avoid a recurrence of this boom-bust cycle, the central bank introduced new macropru-
dential rules. In the words of Patrick Honahan, at that time governor of the Central Bank
of Ireland, "What we are trying to prevent is another psychological loop between credit and
prices and credit. If we avoid that, we can keep banks safe, we can keep borrowers safe."
    The idea of introducing lending limits was first discussed in October 2014 and announced
and immediately implemented on February 9, 2015 (implementation date).10 In Table 1, we
provide an overview of the limits on LTV and LTI ratios on new originations of residential




  10
    The lending limits were first mentioned in a paper (Consultation Paper 87) published on October 7,
2014 to stimulate discussion and available on the Central Bank of Ireland website (link). The limits were
announced and implemented on February 9, 2015, with no limits being in place prior to this date. Mortgages
issued after February 9, 2015 could exceed the lending limits if approved before February 9, 2015.

mortgages. The LTI limit is 3.5. The LTV limit depends on the type of borrowers.11 Lending
for primary-dwelling housing (PDH) is limited to 80% LTV. For first-time buyers (FTBs),
a more generous LTV limit of 90% is imposed for houses up to e220,000. For any amount
exceeding e220,000, the excess amount over e220,000 faces a 80% LTV limit. The measures
impose a stricter threshold of 70% for buy-to-let (BTL) properties.12


2.3     Data

The core of our final data set is the result of combining loan level information on residential
mortgages and credit to firms, bank security level holdings, and county level house prices.
The loan level data and security register are proprietary data sets obtained from the Central
Bank of Ireland.
    First, we observe loan level data on the issuance of residential mortgages at a daily
frequency from January 2013 to June 2016. We observe all outstanding residential mortgages
by the most significant institutions that have to submit loan level data to the Central Bank of
Ireland.13 This sample covers more than 90% of the domestic market and consists of the five
largest banks. The data set also contains information on borrower income and demographics
(e.g., age, marital status) and mortgage type (e.g., first-time buyer, buy-to-let).




  11
     Given that banks have to use an independent valuation, house prices are unlikely to be manipulated.
Incomes are more prone to manipulation by loan officers and borrowers but this manipulation would work
against us, making it more difficult to find a reallocation across counties and across the income distribution.
  12
     First-time buyers are four percentage points or 30% less likely to default than subsequent-time buyers
in Ireland (Kelly et al., 2014). In addition to loans that are exempted from the rule, banks can issue loans
exceeding the limits to a small share of borrowers (see last column of the table). In November 2016, the
rules were relaxed, extending the LTV limit for FTBs to 90%. The analysis of this subsequent period goes
beyond the scope of this paper.
  13
     Irish banks that received a public bailout are required to report loan level data. The rest of the significant
mortgage issuers in Ireland submit loan level data following the encouragement from regulators and in
accordance with data submissions required by the ECB-SSM Comprehensive Assessment in 2013. More
information is available in the online appendix.


                                                        9
    Second, we observe loan level data on bank credit to firms at a semi-annual frequency
from June 2013 to June 2016. At the bank-firm-period level, we observe credit granted and
drawn and the rate charged by banks. We match this information with firm characteristics
such as the county of incorporation, industry, and size (very small/SME/large). We observe
the borrower rating assigned to each loan from internal rating models of each lender. The
Central Bank of Ireland internal mapping scales are used to classify each internal rating into
a consistent categorization between 1 and 6. It ranges from 1 (highest-quality borrower) to
5 (very risky borrower) for non-defaulted loans and equals 6 for defaulted loans. The data
have one main limitation. In contrast to most credit registries, our borrower identifier is
consistent within a bank over time but not across banks.
    Third, we observe bank security level holdings at a quarterly frequency from January
2011 to June 2016. At the security-bank-quarter level, we observe each security s identified
by an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) held by bank b at time t. We
match this information with security characteristics (e.g., yield) from Datastream.
    Fourth, at the bank-month level, we observe monthly balance sheet items from the Euro-
pean Central Bank Individual Balance Sheet Statistics (IBSI).
    Fifth, at the county-period level, we observe quarterly house prices from the Irish property
website Daft.ie. This data set is publicly available and regularly updated with quarterly
reports published on the website. The statistics are based on properties advertised on the
website for a given period. The average monthly sample size for sale properties is 5,000.
Indices are quality adjusted, holding the mix of characteristics constant.



3     Mortgage Credit Reallocation
In this section, we document four facts. In Section 3.1, we show that the lending limits
affect more than one third of the market but the originations of residential mortgages seem
almost unaffected by these limits. In Section 3.2, we show that borrowers are differentially

                                               10
exposed to the limits, with low-income borrowers and borrowers located in "hot" (mostly
urban) housing markets being more affected than high-income borrowers and borrowers
located in "cool" (mostly rural) housing markets. In Section 3.3, we show that after the
policy mortgage credit is reallocated from low- to high-income borrowers and from hot to
cool housing markets. In Section 3.4, we show that the policy was effective in weakening the
feedback loop between mortgage credit and house prices.


3.1     Evolution of Residential Mortgage Issuance

The lending limits affected a large fraction of the mortgage market as 43% of the volume of
residential mortgage issuance (35% of mortgages issued) from October 2013 to September
2014 would have been affected if the policy had been in place during that period. Out of
the total e1.6 billion in mortgages in our sample in that period, non-conforming (i.e., not
complying with the new rules) mortgages accounted for e0.7 billion. The LTV limits affected
the largest fraction of the market. LTV-non-conforming mortgages accounted for e0.5 billion
and LTI-non-conforming mortgages accounted for e0.3 billion. Moreover, approximately half
of the LTI-non-conforming mortgages were also LTV-non-conforming.14
   Whereas the lending limits affected more than one third of residential mortgage issuance,
mortgage originations seem almost unaffected by the policy. In the left panel of Figure 2,
we show the evolution of aggregate mortgage issuance from January 2013 to June 2016. We
find that mortgage credit growth--high since the beginning of 2014--did not collapse after
the implementation of the lending limits. This aggregate evidence suggests an increase in




  14
    2,797 LTV non-conforming mortgages and 1,467 LTI non-conforming mortgages were issued from October
2013 and September 2014. Only 665 mortgages worth e134 million were LTI non-conforming and LTV
conforming during the same period. The limits are more binding for second and subsequent time buyers and
buy-to-let buyers compared with first-time buyers.

the issuance of conforming mortgages might have compensated the mechanical reduction of
the issuance of non-conforming mortgages, as banks followed the new rules.15 In the right
panel, we show the evolution of originations of conforming (solid line) and non-conforming
(dashed line) mortgages and confirm the two time-series diverge starting in February 2015.


3.2     Exposure to the Lending Limits

We now show that borrowers are differentially exposed to the lending limits: (i) low-income
borrowers are more exposed than high-income borrowers and (ii) borrowers located in hot
housing markets, mostly urban counties, are more exposed than borrowers located in cool
housing markets, mostly rural counties.
   In Table 2, we show how borrowers across counties and across the income distribution




   15
      The non-conforming issuance is strictly positive after the policy implementation because the new rules
allow banks to exceed the limits for a limited fraction of their issuance. In the online appendix, we show
mortgage originations keep increasing even when weighted by LTV and LTI.

Table 2: Summary Statistics. This table shows household and loan characteristics by household income
quintile during the 12-month period before the first rumors about the policy (October 2013 to September

statistics for the subsample of counties with high (low) house price appreciation in the pre-policy period.

differ along observable characteristics. We divide households who obtain a mortgage in the
year prior to the policy in five quintiles based on their income (Q1 is the bottom quintile,
Q5 is the top quintile) and in borrowers located in hot housing markets (counties that
experienced a rapid house price appreciation before the policy, top panel) and cool housing
markets (counties that experienced a more moderate house price appreciation before the
policy, bottom panel). Across the income distribution, high-income borrowers tend to (i)
have lower LTV and LTI, (ii) be older and more married, and (iii) be less first-time buyers
than lower-income borrowers. The table also shows that the income distribution is positively
skewed as the average income of the top quintile is almost double the average income of the
fourth income quintile. Somewhat mechanically, the distance from the LTI limit increases
monotonically with income. This monotonicity does not apply to the distance from the LTV
limit as high-income borrowers tend to face stricter limits because they are often buy-to-let or
second- or subsequent-time buyers. Across the distribution of counties, borrowers located in
hot housing markets borrow more, have higher LTI and LTV, and purchase more expensive
properties compared with borrowers located in cool housing markets.
   To measure the distance of borrowers from the lending limits, we calculate what would
have been the distance from the limits for each borrower in the year before the policy,
assuming that the limits were in place during that period.16 We calculate the mean of this
borrower level distance at the income bucket-county level, where we group borrowers in 20
buckets (ventiles) based on the national income distribution. The thresholds of the income
buckets are adjusted monthly for wage inflation using OECD data. In sum, we obtain a
Distance variable that captures the exposure to the lending limits across the 26 counties




  16
    We proceed in three steps. First, we calculate the distance of each mortgage from its LTV and LTI limit
during the 12 months before the first rumors about the limits. If the mortgage exceeds one limit, we set its
distance equal to zero. Second, given the difference scale of LTI and LTV, we rescale these two distances to
have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Third, we calculate the minimum of these two limits.


                                                    14
and across the income distribution.
   In Figure 3, we show that the borrowers that are more exposed to the lending limits
tend to have a low income and tend to be located in hot housing markets, namely counties,
predominantly urban, that experienced a rapid house price appreciation before the policy.
On the x-axis, counties are size weighted (larger counties take up a larger interval on the axis)
and ordered based on their house price appreciation before the policy: cool housing markets
on the left and hot housing markets on the right. On the y-axis, borrowers are grouped
and ordered in 20 buckets based on their position in the income distribution: low-income
borrowers on the bottom and high-income borrowers on the top. A point in this heatmap
is an income bucket-county pair and darker colors indicate a lower distance from the limits.
Perhaps not surprisingly, we observe darker colors toward the bottom and the right of the
graph, suggesting that low-income borrowers and borrowers located in hot housing markets
are closer (more exposed) to the lending limits. This heterogeneity across counties is intuitive.
Borrowers located in counties that experienced a rapid house price appreciation before the
policy are more likely to borrow close to the to-be-imposed limits.17


3.3     Reallocation of Residential Mortgage Credit

We now document a mortgage credit reallocation from hot to cool housing markets and from
low-income to high-income borrowers around the policy implementation.
   Figure 4 is another heatmap where, for each income bucket-county pair, we show the
change in mortgage origination from the pre-policy period (February 2013 to January 2014)




  17
    In the online appendix, we show, in two additional versions of Figure 3, the distance from the LTI and
LTV limits, separately. In Figure A.1 in the appendix, we show that the most exposed counties are located
around the Dublin area. In the online appendix, we show that more exposed counties are more densely
populated and have more residents compared with less exposed counties.

Figure 4: Reallocation of Mortgage Credit. This figure shows the reallocation of mortgage credit
across counties and across the income distribution of borrowers. The x-axis shows counties ranked according
to the house price appreciation pre-policy (from 2012Q4 to 2014Q3). The space taken by each county on the
x-axis is proportional to its size (population). The y-axis shows borrowers ranked according to their position
in the income distribution (20 ventiles). Each point in the map indicates the change of mortgage issuance in
the post-period (February 2015 to January 2016) compared with the pre-period (February 2014 to January
2015). Darker colors indicate higher growth of issuance.

to the post-policy period (February 2014 to January 2015). Darker colors indicate high
credit growth. We observe darker colors on the left, toward the top, and especially in the
top-left corner. In sum, this figure documents that the growth in issuance after the policy
implementation has been driven by cool housing markets and high-income borrowers.18
   In Figure 5, we confirm that this reallocation takes place around the implementation of
the lending limits. The solid line corresponds to those borrowers that are closer to the lending
limits (lowest tercile of the distance distribution). The dashed red line indicates borrowers
that are more distant from the lending limits (highest tercile of the distance distribution). As
suggested by Table 2, low-distance borrowers tend to be low-income borrowers and located
in urban counties while high-distance borrowers tend to have a higher income and are pre-
dominantly located in rural counties. In the top panel, we observe that originations and loan
size are very similar for the two groups of borrowers before the policy introduction. After the
policy implementation, the evolution of originations and loan size flattens for low-distance
borrowers while keeps increasing for high-distance borrowers. In the bottom panel, we show
that LTI and LTV, both higher for low-distance borrowers in the pre-policy period, tend to
converge after the policy implementation.
   We confirm this reallocation estimating the following specification:


                 Ycht =  + P ostt × Distancech + Xcht + ct + ch + µht + cht                           (1)


where c is a county, t is a month, and h is a borrower income bucket, where we divide
borrowers into 20 income buckets. The sample includes 24 months and runs from February
2014 to January 2016. The key independent variable is the interaction term between a

    While there is anecdotal evidence of borrowers moving from Dublin to its commuting towns, the counties
with the largest change in mortgage credit are too far from large cities for its residents to commute.

P ost dummy equal to 1 from February 2015 to January 2016 (12-month period after the
policy implementation) and the (pre-policy) distance from the lending limits for each income
bucket-county pair, as defined in the previous subsection. We include as controls, in the
vector X , the share of originations to first-time buyers and to buy-to-let investors. Finally,
we saturate the specification with stringent fixed effects: county-time fixed effects capture
county time-varying heterogeneity (e.g., county-specific demand for credit), income bucket-
time fixed effects capture income bucket time-varying heterogeneity (e.g., income bucket-
specific demand for credit), and county-income bucket fixed effects to capture time-invariant
borrower and geographic characteristics.

Table 3: Reallocation of Mortgage Credit, Parametric Evidence. This table shows estimation
results from specification (1). The dependent variable is the logarithm of total mortgage volume, the loga-
rithm of the average loan size, the number of loans issued, the value-weighted LTV, and the value-weighted
LTI. Distance is the distance from the lending limits at the county-income bucket level described in Sec-
tion 3.2. All regressions include the share of originations to first-time buyers and to buy-to-let investors
at the county-time-income bucket level, county-time fixed effects, income bucket-time fixed effects, and in-

variables are the logarithm of mortgage issuance, the average loan size, and the number of
mortgages issued. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the distance from the
limits is associated with a 6.2% higher issuance and a 13.6% higher loan relative to the
pre-period. We do not find a statistical significant effect on the number of mortgages. We
also find, in columns (4) and (5), that a one standard deviation increase in the distance from
the limits is associated with a 4.13 percentage points higher LTV and a 0.14 percentage
points higher LTI relative to the pre-period. In sum, these estimation results confirm the
reallocation of mortgage credit from low- to high-income borrowers and from low- to high-
distance counties documented in the heatmap.19

    In Table A.1 and Table A.2, we show two alternative estimations of specification (1) where the distance
variable is at the income bucket and county level, respectively. In unreported tests, we confirm (i) that the
origination volume of conforming credit is positively correlated with the distance variable and (ii) that the
documented reallocation is at work for both first-time buyers and subsequent time buyers.

3.4    General Equilibrium Multipliers

In Table 3, we show that a higher distance from the limits is associated with an increase in
mortgage issuance after the policy introduction, capturing the partial equilibrium effect of
the policy on mortgage issuance. We now estimate the general equilibrium effect and relate
it to our partial equilibrium estimates.
   We employ the methodology of Sarto (2018) and Mian et al. (2019). The intuition behind
this approach is as follows. The estimated coefficient in (1) captures the partial equilibrium
effect of the policy. The county-time fixed effects absorb the general equilibrium effect at
the county level. For example, lower mortgage credit to hot housing markets might reduce
house prices, reducing the households' borrowing capacity. The resulting lower local demand
for mortgage credit might further reduce local house prices. The partial equilibrium effect of
the policy might be amplified by this feedback loop. By collapsing our specification at the
county-month level, the coefficients capture the general equilibrium effect of the policy. By
comparing these estimates with the estimates in (1), we decompose the general equilibrium
effect in its partial equilibrium component and a "general equilibrium multiplier."
   More specifically, we estimate the following specifications:

                  PE
  V olumecht =  + 1               PE
                     Distancech + 2  P ostt × Distancech + Xcht + ct + ht + cht           (2)
                  GE
   V olumect =  + 1              GE
                     Distancec + 2  P ostt × Distancec + Xct + t + ct                     (3)


The unit of observation in the familiar first specification is county-month-income bucket.
The unit of observation in the second specification is county-month. The superscripts P E
and GE refer to partial and general equilibrium, respectively. The county-time fixed effects
in the first specification capture the general equilibrium forces at work at the county level.
Hence, by comparing the estimated coefficients in the two specifications, we can decompose
the general equilibrium effect in (i) its partial equilibrium component and (ii) its general

                                                                                 GE
equilibrium multiplier before the policy was introduced. Similarly, by comparing 2  and
PE

    Table 4 shows the estimated coefficients. During the pre-policy period, the general equi-
librium effect is very large (-4.18), driven by hot housing markets. The general equilibrium
effect can be decomposed in its partial equilibrium component of 6% (-0.23/-4.18) and its


                                                      21
general equilibrium multiplier of 94%. Mian et al. (2019) find a 80% general equilibrium
multiplier during the 2002-05 boom in the US. Our larger multiplier is consistent with the
Irish setting, prone to extreme boom-bust episodes like the 2002-10 one. The estimated co-
efficients in the post-period show a weakened general equilibrium effect (0.32) and identical
general equilibrium effects in hot and cool housing markets.
    Taken together, these results suggest that the policy was effective in weakening the feed-
back loop "between credit and house prices and credit", using governor Honahan's own words.
This interpretation of the amplification mechanism at work in the pre-policy period is con-
sistent with the theory literature. As in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), higher mortgage credit
leads to higher housing demand and higher house prices. Higher house prices in turn relax
the collateral constraint of borrowers, allowing them to obtain a larger mortgage. Consistent
with this channel, in the next section we document that house price growth collapsed after
the policy introduction, driven by hot housing markets.



4     House Prices
In this section, we show the time-series evolution of house prices is consistent with the
mortgage credit reallocation documented in the previous section.
    First, we show non-parametric evidence. In the left panel of Figure 6, we show yearly
growth in house prices from January 2011 to June 2017. House price growth stopped in-
creasing at the time of the first rumors about the policy and then stabilized around 10%
after the implementation. In the online appendix, we show that survey data suggests that
households anticipated, at the time of the first rumors, a decline in house prices exactly
because of the soon-to-be announced limits. In the right panel, we plot house price growth
for high-distance or cool counties (solid line) and low-distance or hot (dashed line) counties.
Low-distance counties experienced a stark contraction of house price growth after the policy
implementation, whereas house price growth remained stable at the pre-policy level in high-

distance counties.20 In the online appendix, we show the slowdown in house price growth in
low-distance counties is driven by small properties, and the relative stability of house price
growth in high-distance counties is driven by large properties. This evidence is consistent
with the documented credit reallocation across counties and, to the extent that property size
is correlated with the income of the buyers, with the reallocation across the distribution of
borrowers' income.21
    Second, we show parametric evidence consistent with the mortgage credit reallocation
across counties and across the income distribution. In particular, we estimate the following




  20
     The housing supply is more elastic in high-distance than low-distance counties, potentially explaining why
house price growth did not increase in high-distance counties after the policy. Granted planning permissions
did not change in low-distance counties (66% in 2012Q4-2014Q4; 69% in 2014Q4-2016Q4) but substantially
increased in high-distance counties (-2% in 2012Q4-2014Q4; 81% in 2014Q4-2016Q4).
  21
     See Figure IA.9. Table 2 shows borrower income is strongly correlated with the price of the property
purchased. In the online appendix, we attempt to map the number of bedrooms to the income of buyers by
regressing the price of the residential property collateralizing the residential mortgage (credit registry data)
on property size-county level house price data. We find these loadings are consistent with high-income (low-
income) borrowers predominantly buying large (small) properties. Of course, this mapping is not perfect,
because, for example, high-income borrowers might buy a one-bedroom property to rent it out.

check whether the effect of the lending limits changes depending on the type of property. We
show the estimation results in Table 5. The county level estimation in column (1) confirms




  22
    The geographical breakdown of the house price data is more granular than the mortgage level data as
we observe house price data for each of the 22 Dublin postal districts. Given that we cannot compute the
distance from the lending limits at this more granular level, we assume the distance is constant within a
county. We then cluster our standard errors at the county level to take into account that standard errors
might be correlated within counties.

the positive correlation between changes in house price growth after the policy and county
level distance from the lending limits. In columns (2)-(5), we show the county-property
size level estimation. We confirm that house price growth increased more in high-distance
counties than in low-distance counties, and this different evolution is more pronounced for
larger properties. These results are consistent with the documented reallocation of mortgage
credit across counties and--to the extent that property size is correlated with the income of
the buyers--across the income distribution.
   Third, we show that, following the introduction of the lending limits, the geographical
distribution of house price growth became less fat-tailed. The left and right panels of Figure
7 show the distribution of house price growth across counties before and after the policy,
respectively. The distribution in the post-period is substantially less fat-tailed (standard
deviation from 0.11 to 0.05), suggesting that the lending limits also reduced the geographical
heterogeneity in house price growth. In the online appendix, we show that the tails were not
shrinking before the policy. Taken together our general equilibrium estimates in Section 3.4,
these results suggest that the policy was effective in cooling down the housing market and in
making housing market more homogeneous across counties and less prone to feedback loops.

5      Bank Credit Reallocation
In this section, we show the reallocation of mortgage credit from hot to cool housing markets
and from low- to high-income borrowers is consistent with a "bank portfolio choice" channel.
    According to this channel, the lending limits cause banks to reallocate their portfolio
to fund projects that would have not otherwise been funded.23 Consider an environment
where banks solve their portfolio problem subject to a binding balance sheet constraint (e.g.,
funding or regulatory capital constraint). Introduce in this setting, where banks cannot
fund all positive NPV projects, a new constraint that prevents banks from investing in a
specific asset (e.g., high-leverage mortgages). If this new constraint is also binding, banks
reallocate their portfolio to fund some positive NPV projects that were not funded before the
introduction of the new constraint.24 The bank portfolio choice channel critically relies on
the financial sector being constrained. Note that, in our setting, Irish banks are adjusting to
new capital and liquidity regulatory requirements and hold a large stock of non-performing
loans. Moreover, mortgages are almost entirely issued by banks that hold them on balance
sheet and there is no public support for the residential mortgage market.25 With the notable
exception of the US, many countries around the world only have a small securitization market
and do not provide a public support for the mortgage market.
    In Section 5.1, we show that the mortgage credit reallocation is driven by banks more
exposed to the policy. In Section 5.2, we show that banks, especially those highly exposed

     In the online appendix, we provide a formal characterization of banks' portfolio problem.
  24
     See Goel et al. (forthcoming) for a model of how banks allocate capital across their business units when
facing multiple constraints, including various regulatory ones. More generally, our results are consistent with
a model where bank capital is "scarce" and the marginal equity issuance costs are very steep. See Harris
et al. (2019) for a theoretical framework.
  25
     Non-performing loans are about one-quarter of the value of outstanding bank loans at the time of the
policy implementation. Irish banks returned to profitability in 2014 for the first time since 2008. See Central
Bank of Ireland (2014) for more details.



                                                      26
to the policy, increase their risk exposure in asset classes not targeted by the limits, namely
holdings of securities and credit to firms.


5.1    Mortgage Credit Reallocation

The bank portfolio choice channel has a clear cross-sectional prediction: Banks with a larger
fraction of non-conforming issuance in the pre-policy period drive the mortgage credit reallo-
cation compared with banks with less non-conforming issuance. Following this intuition, we
measure banks' differential exposure to the policy based on the importance of non-conforming
issuance relative to a bank's total mortgage issuance during the year before the first rumors
about the policy. In particular, for each bank b, we define
                              Sep14
                                 t=Oct13 Non-Conforming Mortgage Issuancebt
                Exposureb =         Sep14                                                  (6)
                                       t=Oct13 Total Mortgage Issuancebt


where the numerator is the sum of total non-conforming mortgage issuance between October
2013 and September 2014 and the denominator is the sum, over the same period, of total
mortgage issuance. Of course, banks' exposure is not randomly assigned. In Table 6, we
show banks' summary statistics for high-exposoure and low-exposure banks.
   We validate our measure in Figure 8, where we show the evolution of conforming mort-
gages issued by high-exposure banks (exposure above median, blue line) and low-exposure
banks (exposure below median, red line). The thin dashed lines show non-conforming mort-
gage issuance, collapsing for both groups of banks after the policy implementation. This
figure documents that high-exposure banks experience a greater drop in non-conforming
issuance and a greater increase in conforming issuance than low-exposure banks.
   Having shown non-parametric evidence of cross-sectional variation in bank credit real-
location, we estimate a triple difference-in-differences specification, obtained by adding the

exposed to the limits and changing their lending decision after the policy).

banks more exposed to the limits. The sum of the first two coefficients (1 + 2 ) being
very close to zero in columns (2)-(4) shows that banks maintained a similar loan size, LTV,
and LTI after the policy compared with the pre-policy period, suggesting that banks, while
conforming with the new limits, issued mortgages with similar characteristics to the mort-
gages they issued before the policy. However, the negative sum of the first two coefficients in
column (1) suggests banks were forced to partially reduce their mortgage issuance and were,
therefore, unable to completely "undo" the new limits. Finally, although rates are falling
for all borrowers during our sample period, the last column shows that more exposed banks
reduced mortgage rates more than less-exposed banks.26
   Table 3 and Table 7 suggest banks, especially those highly exposed to the policy, tried to
undo the limits by lending to borrowers more distant from the lending limits, namely, high-

     Irish banks do not offer mortgage rates based on the income of borrowers. Banks typically offer an
interest rate-LTV schedule, allowing borrowers to self-select into products. Banks have several ways to
influence the rates charged to clients, including offering more fixed- or non-fixed-rate mortgages.

income borrowers and borrowers located in high-distance counties. To further confirm this
interpretation, we estimate, in various subsamples of borrowers, the following specification:


                Ybcht =  + P ostt × Exposureb + Xb,t-1 + b + ct + ht + bcht                              (8)


where our unit of observation is bank b, county c, household income bucket h, and month
t. The partition of borrowers in income buckets, the sample period, the definitions of P ostt
and the Exposureb variables are unchanged. In addition to county-time, bank, and income
bucket-time fixed effects, we include lagged bank time-varying controls (logarithm of total
assets, equity capital ratio, and loans/total assets).
    We run our specification in subsamples based on borrower income quintiles. We show the
estimation results in Table 8 where each column corresponds to an income quintile. In Panel
A and Panel B, the dependent variables are total loan volume and mortgage size, respectively.
We find that more-exposed banks increase their loan issuance to high-income (Q5) borrowers

and reduce it to low-income (Q1) borrowers compared with less-exposed banks. The top-
income quintile borrowers also obtain larger loans than other quintiles after the policy. More
precisely, a one standard deviation higher Exposureb leads to a 10% decrease in issuance to
low-income (Q1) borrowers and to a 15% increase in issuance to high-income (Q5) borrowers.
These results are consistent with more-affected banks reallocating credit to richer households
that are further away from the limits and thus likely have more room to increase their LTV
and LTI, while still conforming with the limits.
   In Panel C, we consider the (volume-weighted) LTV as a dependent variable. We find that
more-exposed banks reduced their LTV compared with less-exposed banks in income quintiles
Q1 and Q2, consistent with the limits affecting these banks more and with low-income
households being more constrained. For households in the bottom income quintile, a one
standard deviation higher Exposureb implies a 6.6 percentage points lower LTV. However,
in the top-income quintile, more-affected banks increased their LTV compared with less-
exposed banks. Borrowing from banks with a one standard deviation higher Exposureb
leads to a 4.9 percentage points higher LTV in the top-income quintile. Hence, by issuing
larger loans to high-income households, banks can partially make up for the lost business
caused by the policy introduction. In Panel D, the independent variable is the (volume-
weighted) LTI. Similar to the finding for the LTV, we document a significant increase in
the LTI for high-income households borrowing from more-exposed banks. More precisely,
a one standard deviation higher Exposureb implies a 0.3 percentage points increase in the
loan-to-income ratio of high-income borrowers.27

    In the online appendix, we show non-parametric evidence consistent with exposed banks driving high-
income borrowers' LTV and LTI increase in the post-regulation period.

5.2     Other Asset Classes

In the previous sections, we have shown that, after the policy introduction, banks issued
mortgages with similar characteristics to the mortgages they previously issued, but partially
reduced their total mortgage issuance. In this section, we show that banks, consistent with
the bank portfolio choice channel, increased their risk-taking in their holdings of securities
and credit to firms, two types of assets not targeted by the policy. These results are also
consistent with the observation that banks were seeking hot housing markets in their pre-
policy mortgage lending.


5.2.1   Security Holdings

We use security level holdings data and examine whether banks changed their risk exposure
in this asset class. Following Davis and Haltiwanger (1992), we define the "net buys" of
security s by bank b from t - 1 to t as follows:

                                    Holdingss,b,t - Holdingss,b,t-1
                N etBuyss,b,t =                                          [-2, 2]          (9)
                                  0.5(Holdingss,b,t + Holdingss,b,t-1 )

where Holdings is the euro value of holdings. Compared with percentage changes, this
measure also captures final sales, corresponding to a value of -2, and initial purchases, cor-
responding to a value of 2.
   We exploit again the cross-sectional heterogeneity in bank exposure to the lending limits.
In particular, we estimate the following specification:


             N etBuyssbt =  + Exposureb × P ostt × Y ieldst + bt + st + sbt              (10)


where the unit of observation is security s, bank b, and quarter t (we observe security
level holdings at a quarterly frequency). The independent variable of interest is the triple
interaction term between bank exposure defined in (6), a P ost dummy equal to 1 in the

in (6), P ost is a dummy equal to 1 from 2015Q2 onwards, and Y ield is the yield of the security. Double-

post period, and the yield of the security. In our most conservative estimation, we include
bank-time and security-time fixed effects to capture time-varying bank heterogeneity and
time-varying security heterogeneity, respectively.
   We show estimation results in Table 9, where we progressively saturate the regression with
more stringent fixed effects. Column (4) includes all the pairs of two-way fixed effects. The
coefficient of interest, stable across specifications, indicates more-exposed banks increase their
holdings of risky securities compared with less-exposed banks after the policy implementation.
In columns (5) and (6), we distinguish between the buying and selling behavior of banks.
Buys are defined as the logarithm of the amount of security s bought by bank b at time t,
and zero otherwise. Similarly, Sells are defined as the logarithm of the amount of securities
sold. We find that more-exposed banks buy more and sell less high-yield securities than
less-exposed banks.

5.2.2   Credit to Firms

We now use the corporate loan level data and ask whether banks changed their credit supply
to firms. To this end, we adapt specification (8) and estimate the following specification:


               Ybclqt =  + P ostt × Exposureb + Xbt-1 + bc + clqt + bclqt                (11)


We measure the credit provided by bank b to firms in county c, industry l, of quality q
in semester t (we observe credit to firms at a biannual frequency). We group firms into
clusters based on their county, industry, and quality at time t and investigate the lending
behavior of banks to a cluster of firms (Acharya et al., 2018). We form clusters based on
county and industry because firms in a particular industry in a particular county share many
characteristics and are thus likely affected in a similar way by macroeconomic developments
that might influence credit demand. Note that because we do not have a unique firm identifier
across loans, we are unable to analyze credit extended to the same firm by different banks
(Khwaja and Mian, 2008). To determine the quality of a firm that receives a loan, we use
the ratings obtained by the Central Bank of Ireland that employs a rating scale from 1 (best)
to 5 (worst). These ratings come from the banks' internal models but are homogenized by
the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure the rating classes correspond to similar probabilities
of default. We divide firms into three quality buckets: high quality (rating 1-2), medium
quality (rating 3-4), and low quality/high risk (rating 5).
   The dependent variable is either the change in log (stock of) credit granted (V OLU M E )
or the change in the interest rate charged (RAT E ). Similar to the previous section, we
are interested in the coefficient of the interaction term between the P ost dummy and the
bank exposure to the policy. We include industry-county-quality-time fixed effects to control
for credit demand of firms and other variables that are shared by firms of similar quality
operating in the same county and industry. We also include bank-county fixed effects to
capture time-invariant bank-county heterogeneity (e.g., time-constant heterogeneity in the

Table 10: Bank Portfolio Reallocation, Credit to Firms. This table shows the estimation results
of specification (11). The unit of observation is bank-industry-county-quality-time. The sample runs at a
bi-annual frequency from 2013H1 to 2016H1. Exposure is defined in (6) and P ost is a dummy equal to 1
from 2015H1 to 2016H1. A risky loan has a rating equal to 5. The dependent variables are the change in log
(stock of) credit granted in Panel A and the (value weighted) change in the interest rate charged in Panel B.

geographical preference of banks).
    We show estimation results in Table 10. In Panels A and B, the dependent variable is
the change in volume of credit and change in interest rate charged, respectively. Column (1)
considers the full sample. The estimates document that more-exposed banks increase their
lending volume to firms and decrease the price of corporate loans more than less-exposed
banks. In a next step, we split our sample firms into risky (rating 5) and non-risky (rating
1-4) firms and re-run our specification (11) separately for these two groups of borrowers.
The estimation results in columns (2) and (3) show that although a credit expansion in the
corporate sector occurs for both risky and non-risky firms, the effect is economically and
statistically more pronounced for risky firms relative to the pre-period. A one standard
deviation higher Exposure leads to a 10 percentage points higher credit supply to firms
and a 20 percentage points higher credit supply to risky firms. These results are confirmed
in the last column of Panel A, where we employ a triple interaction of our bank exposure
variable with a P ost dummy and a dummy for whether the borrowing firms are risky. The
coefficient shows the increase in loan volume is mostly driven by an increase toward risky
firms. Similarly, in Panel B, we find the decrease in the cost of bank loans is mostly benefiting
risky firms.



6     Financial Stability
In the previous section, we have shown that the credit reallocation caused by the lending
limits is consistent with a bank portfolio choice channel. In this section, we analyze the
effect of the limits on banks' overall risk exposure to real estate, non-financial firms, and
government bonds.
    To this end, we analyze the correlation of bank equity returns with the equity returns
of portfolios that capture the performance of real estate firms, non-financial non-real estate
firms, and government bonds around the implementation of the lending limits. We obtain

of non-financial non-real estate stocks (to capture the non-financial private sector), and (iii)
the change in the 10-year Irish government bond yields (to capture holdings of securities).
In our baseline estimation, the sample period runs daily from November 9, 2014 to May 9,
2015 (three months around the implementation date) and the P ost variable is equal to one
starting from February 9, 2015.
    We show the estimation results in Table 11. The interaction coefficients suggest that
banks become less exposed to real estate and more exposed to the non-financial non-real
estate private sector following the introduction of the limits--consistent with the reallocation
documented in the previous section. In columns (2) and (3), we change the estimation period
to two months and four months around the implementation date, respectively. Our results
are robust. To further confirm our findings, we run a placebo test in the last two columns,
where the P ost dummy is equal to one in the three months after June 9, 2015 and June 9,
2014, respectively. The coefficients of interest are not significant, suggesting that our effects
are not present in times other than the treatment period.28



7      Conclusion
We provide a comprehensive micro-level analysis of the transmission of macroprudential
policies aimed at limiting household leverage in the residential mortgage market and, in
turn, reducing the feedback loop between credit and house prices. Combining loan level
data on residential mortgages, county level house prices, and detailed data on banks' other




  28
    In an unreported test, we run another placebo regression with the equity return of financial institutions
not subject to the limits (e.g., insurance companies and asset management firms) as a dependent variable.
The coefficients of interest are not significant, confirming that our effects are limited to those institutions
subject to the policy.


                                                     39
assets, we examine the February 2015 introduction of LTV and LTI limits in Ireland.
   The policy caused a substantial reallocation of mortgage credit. We document a reallo-
cation of mortgage credit from low- to high-income households and from hot, mostly urban,
housing markets to cool housing markets. This reallocation is effective in slowing down house
price growth, and in turn, the feedback loop between mortgage credit and house prices, in
hot housing markets. Consistent with constrained lenders adjusting their portfolio choice,
more-affected banks drive this reallocation and also increase their risk exposure in credit to
firms and holdings of securities, two assets not targeted by the limits.
   Our analysis of macroprudential regulation opens up a promising area for future research.
In particular, our results on bank asset allocation naturally call for the development of equi-
librium models to measure how macroprudential regulation affects welfare and the likelihood
of busts. Having documented how limits to household leverage affect bank portfolio choice
and house prices in a partial equilibrium framework, we provide a set of correlations and
suggested transmission mechanisms that these equilibrium models should take into account.

IA.1         Data Sources
The data on bank lending, including loan and borrower characteristics, is obtained from the
Central Bank of Ireland. In particular, the data on mortgages is obtained from the Loan Level
Data from the Central Bank of Ireland (Financial Stability Division) up to January 2015
and from the Monitoring Templates from the Central Bank of Ireland (Financial Stability
Division) from January 2015 to June 2016. The data on commercial lending is obtained
from the Central Bank of Ireland (Financial Stability Division). Bank quarterly security
holdings are from the Central Bank of Ireland (Statistics Division). Monthly bank balance
sheet variables are from the Individual Balance Sheet Items ECB survey. The county level
house prices are from www.daft.ie/report. The regional house prices are from Central
Statistics Office of Ireland.
   The loan level characteristics are (i) date of origination, (ii) amount outstanding (current
and at origination) (iii) interest rate and interest type (current and at origination), and (iv)
data on collateral (location, type, purpose, and value; all at origination). The borrower level
characteristics (measured at origination of the loan) include (i) the type of borrower (FTB,
SSB, BTL), (ii) age, marital status, occupation, and (iii) total household income.1

     For one of our banks, this income is missing from 2010 to 2014. As we expect heterogeneity in the
bank-borrower match across banks, we do not assume that income will be the same for similar borrowers
across banks. In particular, we use the period where we have the income data to construct a scalar that
measures how income of costumers of this specific bank behaves differently from all other borrowers. For
the period we do not have income data for this specific bank, we then take the average income of a similar
borrower in terms of loan- and borrower characteristics and multiply it with the scalar.

This figure shows the defaulted exposure of Irish banks from 2000 to 2012. The bars represent the loss of
the individual LTV Quintiles which are shown in an ascending order from left to right within each income
quintile. It is calculated by multiplying the default intensity for a bucket with the total original exposure
of the bank in that bucket. We create 25 buckets based on income and LTV quintiles where the former is
scaled according wage growth figures. Source: Central Bank of Ireland.

IA.4       Bank Portfolio Choice and Lending Limits
In this section, we develop a simple model of bank portfolio choice to show how the lending
limits affects bank portfolio choice. In our environment, a representative bank solves:

                                     3 (
                                                          i 2 )
                             maxxi          xi E(Ri ) -    x
                                     i=1
                                                          2 i
                            s.t.     x i  Ki              i = {1, 2, 3}
                                     3
                                           i xi  K4
                                     i=1


The bank chooses how much to invest in three assets xi , where i = {1, 2, 3}, subject to four
constraints. The first three constraints are lending limits that constrain each asset to be
less than a specific threshold. The last constraint is a balance sheet constraint where the
weighted sum (weights i ) of each asset is forced to be less than a threshold.
   In this environment, we compare the bank portfolio choice with and without lending
limits. In the economy with no lending limits, only the last constraint binds. In an economy
with lending limits, the constraint on asset 1 also binds, namely x1 = K1 .

Portfolio Choice with No Lending Limit Suppose only the last constraint binds. The
bank then chooses:

                E(R1 )(2 2
                         3 + 3 2 ) - 3 1 2 E(R2 ) - 2 1 3 E(R3 ) + K4 2 3 1

                E(R3 )(1 2
                         2 + 2 1 ) - 1 2 3 E(R2 ) - 2 1 3 E(R1 ) + K4 1 2 3
                               2

                                               IA.9
Portfolio Choice with a Lending Limit Suppose now that K1 < K1 such that the last
constraint and the first constraint, namely x1 = K1 , bind. The bank then chooses:

                        x1 = K1

                               3 2 (K4 - 1 K1 ) - 2 3 E(R3 ) + 2
                                                               3 E(R2 )
                        x2   =                  2      2
                                            3 2 + 2 3
                               2 3 (K4 - 1 K1 ) - 2 3 E(R2 ) + 2
                                                               2 E(R3 )
                        x3 =                    2      2
                                            3 2 + 2 3



Comparison We now want to compare the two portfolio choices. In particular, we ask
under what conditions the bank chooses to increase more its investment in x3 than its
investment in x2 in the presence of the lending limit on x1 compared with the portfolio choice
with no lending limit. More formally, we ask under what conditions x               
                                                                    3 - x3 > x2 - x2 . By
comparing the solutions above, we obtain that x               
                                               3 - x3 > x2 - x2 if and only if

                                             2   2
                                               >
                                             3   3

To develop some intuition, note that we can write the first order conditions with respect to
x2 and x3 in the problem with and without a lending limit as follows:

                       E(R2 ) - 2 x2 = 2 4            E(R3 ) - 3 x3 = 3 4

                      E(R2 ) - 2 x      
                                  2 = 2 4             E(R3 ) - 3 x      
                                                                  3 = 3 4


where 4 and 4 are the Lagrange multipliers for the last constraint in the case without and
with the lending limit, respectively. By combining these conditions, we obtain    2
                                                                                  2
                                                                                    (x     
                                                                                      2 - x2 )   =
3
3
  (x     
    3 - x3 ).   In general, (i) a smaller risk aversion i causes asset i to be more desirable and
(ii) a larger contribution i to the balance sheet constraint causes that asset i to be more
constrained in the optimal portfolio choice. When we move to the portfolio choice with a
lending limit, we analyze how x2 and x3 change following a de facto relaxation of the balance
