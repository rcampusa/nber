                                             ABSTRACT

A long-standing controversy is whether LBOs relieve managers from short-term pressures from public
shareholders, or whether LBO funds themselves are driven by short-term profit motives and sacrifice
long-term growth to boost short-term performance. We investigate 495 transactions with a focus on
one form of long-term activities, namely investments in innovation as measured by patenting activity.
We find no evidence that LBOs are associated with a decrease in these activities. Relying on standard
measures of patent quality, we find that patents granted to firms involved in private equity transactions
are more cited (a proxy for economic importance), show no significant shifts in the fundamental nature
of the research, and are more concentrated in the most important and prominent areas of companies'
innovative portfolios.

1. Introduction


       In his influential 1989 paper, “The Eclipse of the Public Corporation,” Michael

Jensen predicted that the leveraged buyout would emerge as the dominant corporate

organizational form. With its emphasis on corporate governance, concentrated ownership

and monitoring by active owners, strong managerial incentives, and efficient capital

structure, he argued that the buyout is superior to the public corporation with its dispersed

shareholders and weak governance. These features enable managers to make long-run

investments without catering to the market’s demands for steadily growing quarterly

profits, which Stein [1988] and others argue can lead firms to myopically sacrifice such

expenditures.


       These claims excited much debate in the subsequent years. Critics questioned the

extent to which private equity creates value, suggesting that funds’ profits are instead

driven by favorable tax treatment of corporate debt, inducing senior executives of

publicly traded firms to accept deals that go against the interests of the shareholders, or

abrogating explicit and implicit contracts with workers (e.g., Shleifer and Summers

[1988]). More specifically, they queried whether private equity-backed firms actually

take a longer-run perspective than their public peers, pointing to practices such as special

dividends and “quick flips”—that is, initial public offerings (IPOs) of firms soon after a

private equity investment—that enable private equity groups to extract fees and raise new

funds more quickly. Given their incentives to undertake and exit deals, private equity

funds may well promote policies that boost short-run performance at the expense of more

sustained long-term growth.


                                              2
       Ultimately, the nature of the changes in corporate time horizons associated with

private equity transactions is an empirical question. In this paper, we present evidence

about one form of long-run investment, namely changes in innovative investments around

the time of private equity transactions. This presents an attractive arena to examine these

issues for a number of reasons. R&D expenditures have typical features of long-run

investments. Their costs are expensed immediately, yet the benefits are unlikely to be

observed for several years: several studies of managerial “myopia” (e.g., Meulbroek, et

al. [1990]) have examined R&D expenditures for this reason. Second, an extensive body

of work about the economics of technological change documents that patenting activity

and the characteristics of patents reflect the quality and extent of firms’ innovations,

allowing us to measure firms’ innovative output rather than merely R&D expenditures.

Since not all research expenditures are well spent, and some critics of major corporations

(e.g., Jensen [1993]) suggest that many corporate research activities are wasteful and

yield a low return, changes in R&D expenditures are more difficult to interpret. While

the literature acknowledges that patents are not a perfect measures of innovation—for

example, many inventions are protected as trade secrets—the use of patents as a measure

of innovative activity is widely accepted. Moreover, unlike many other measures of

corporate activity, patents are observable for both public and privately-held firms, which

is important when studying private equity transactions.


       We examine the changes in patenting behavior of 495 firms with at least one

successful patent application filed in the period from three years before to five years after




                                              3
being part of a private equity transaction.1 Our main finding is that firms pursue more

influential innovations, as measured by patent citations, in the years following private

equity investments. Firms display no deterioration in their research, as measured either by

patent “originality” and “generality,” and the level of patenting does not appear to change

after these transactions. We find some evidence that the patent portfolios become more

focused in the years after private equity investments. The increase in patent quality is

greatest in the patent classes where the firm has been focused historically and in the

classes where the firm increases its patenting activity after the transaction. The patterns

are robust to a variety of specifications and controls. Collectively, these findings are

largely inconsistent with the hypothesis that private equity-backed firms sacrifice long-

run investments. Rather, private equity investments appear to be associated with a

beneficial refocusing of firms’ innovative portfolios.2


           One limitation is that we cannot formally distinguish whether private equity

investors cause these changes or selectively invest in firms that are ripe for an increase in

innovative activity. We do not have an instrumental variable to help us resolve the

causation question. However, our findings related to the timing of the changes and the



1
    Throughout this paper, when we refer to private equity transactions or investments, we are referring to
equity investments by professionally managed partnerships that are leveraged buyouts or other equity
investments with a substantial amount of associated indebtedness.
2
    One anecdote consistent with this finding is from a practitioner who described to us a major corporation
where scientists and engineers received badges identifying the number of patent filings they had made.
Having a platinum or gold badge—awarded only to the most prolific inventors—was very prestigious. One
can imagine the effect of this incentive scheme on the filing of infra-marginal patents.




                                                        4
predominantly “old economy” nature of the firms in our sample suggest that selection

plays a relatively minor role in our results. Nonetheless, this alternative interpretation

should be kept in mind below.


       There are two main related literatures. A number of studies consider the impact of

leverage, which is a prominent feature of private equity investments, on innovation.

These studies typically examine publicly traded firms with differing debt levels and reach

somewhat ambiguous conclusions. There is a clear association between greater leverage

and lower levels of R&D spending, as documented by Hall’s [1992] examination of over

1,200 manufacturing firms and Himmelberg and Petersen’s [1994] more targeted study of

170 small high-technology firms. However, the direction of causality is unclear. It is

difficult to determine whether debt leads to R&D reductions or if struggling firms simply

have more debt and less spending on innovation. Hao and Jaffe [1993], who carefully

grapple with this question, conclude that more debt reduces R&D spending only for the

very smallest firms. For larger firms, the causal relationship is ambiguous.


       A second set of papers examines the impact of leveraged buyouts on innovative

activity generally. Focusing on buyouts of manufacturing firms during the 1980s, Hall

[1990] looks at 76 public-to-private transactions, i.e., transactions where a publicly traded

firm is purchased and taken private. She finds that the impact of these transactions on

cumulative innovation is likely slight. While these firms represent four percent of

manufacturing employment in 1982, they only account for one percent of the R&D

spending. Lichtenberg and Siegel [1990] examine 43 LBOs during the 1980s where the

firms participate in the Bureau of the Census’s survey about research activities prior to


                                              5
and after the transaction. They find that these firms increase research spending after the

LBO, both on an absolute basis and relative to their peers.


           There are a several reasons to revisit the questions in the earlier studies. The

private equity industry is more substantial today than it was in the 1980s. This growth not

only means that we have a larger sample, but changes in the industry–such as the

increased competition between and greater operational orientation of private equity

groups–suggest that the earlier relationships may no longer hold. In addition, transactions

involving technology-intensive industries have become more common recently. It is also

desirable to look beyond public-to-private transactions, since these transactions represent

a fairly small fraction of the private equity universe.3 Finally, the computerization of

patent records in the past two decades has substantially enhanced our ability to measure

and study the impact on innovation.


           The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the construction of

the data-set. Section 3 reviews the methodology employed in the study. We present the

empirical analyses in Section 4. The final section concludes the paper and discusses

future work.




3
    Strömberg (2008) shows that public-to-private transactions account for roughly 6% of all private equity-
sponsored LBO activity in terms of numbers, and roughly 27% in terms of total enterprise value of firms
acquired. Moreover, R&D intensive industries such as Information Technology, Telecom, Medical
equipment, and Biotech account for roughly 14% of all LBO activity in 2000-2007 (both on an equal- and
value-weighted basis), compared to around 7% in the pre-1990 period.

2. The Sample


           To construct the dataset, we identify a comprehensive list of private equity

transactions and match the involved firms to U.S. patent records. This section describes

this process.


A. Identifying Private Equity Transactions

           To identify private equity investments, we start from the Capital IQ database.

Since 1999, Capital IQ has been specialized in tracking private equity deals on a world-

wide basis. Through extensive research, it attempts to “back fill” information about

investments prior to this period.4


           Our starting point is the universe of transactions in Capital IQ that closed between

January 1980 and December 2005. We eliminate two types of transactions. First, Capital

IQ contains some transactions by private equity groups that did not entail the use of

leverage. Capital IQ captures a considerable number of venture capital investments by

traditional venture funds, and many buyout groups made some venture capital

investments in the late 1990s. Hence, we eliminate transactions that are not classified in

the relevant categories (which involve the phrases “going private,” “leveraged buyout,”

“management buyout,” “platform,” or slight variants of these). Second, the data contain a

number of transactions that do not involve a financial sponsor (i.e., a private equity firm),


4
    Most data services tracking private equity investments were not established until the late 1990s. The most
geographically comprehensive exception, SDC VentureXpert, was primarily focused on capturing venture
capital investments until the mid-1990s.




                                                       7
and we eliminate these deals as well. While transactions in which a management team

takes a firm private using their own resources and/or bank debt are interesting, they are

not the focus of this study. We also remove investments by private equity groups in

companies that remain traded in public markets after the transaction (so called PIPEs).

After these eliminations, the data contain approximately eleven thousand transactions.


        We supplement the Capital IQ data with data from Dealogic, another data vendor.

The Dealogic data often contain more comprehensive information about the

characteristics of the transactions, such as the multiple of earnings paid and the capital

structure employed. It also frequently records information about alternative names of the

firms, add-on acquisitions, and exits, which are useful for matching the data to patent

records. Finally, we use a variety of databases, including Capital IQ, SDC VentureXpert,

and compilations of news stories, to identify the characteristics of the transactions and the

nature of the exits.


B. Capturing Patent Data

        We restrict our sample to firms with at least one successful patent application

from three years before the transaction to five year afterwards. We match the firms

involved in buyout transactions to their patenting records based on their name and

location. To do this, we employ the Harvard Business School (HBS) patent database.

The HBS data contain all electronic records of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office

(USPTO) through May 2007, but these records have been researched and consolidated,

which is important, since the names of assignees in the original USPTO database are

riddled with misspellings and inconsistencies. We search the HBS database for each of

                                              8
the firms, using both the original name and any alternative names from Dealogic. The

firms’ location is contained in Capital IQ, and the patent data contain the location of both

the inventor(s) and the entity to which the patent is assigned at the time of issue, which is

typically the inventor’s employer. There are ambiguous situations where the names are

similar, but not exactly identical, or where the location of the patentee differs from the

records of Capital IQ. In these cases, we research the potential matches, using historical

editions of the Directory of Corporate Affiliations, Hoover’s Directory, the Factiva

database of news stories, and web searches. An observation is only included when we are

confident of a match. In total, we identify 496 entities with at least one patent grant in

the period from the calendar year starting three years before to the calendar year starting

five years after the year of the private equity transaction.5


           The seemingly small number of patentees likely reflects two facts. First, in many

instances the companies are “old economy” firms in which intellectual property is less

central and which have a greater reliance on trade secrets or branding to protect

intellectual property. Second, the acceleration of private equity activity means that many

transactions are undertaken in 2004 and 2005. In cases of divisional buyouts, where new

firms are created, this leaves only a short time for observing any patenting activity. Even

if these new entities filed for patents, they are unlikely to be issued by May 2007, and we

only see patent applications that have been successful granted by the USPTO (not




5
    We follow the literature in focusing only on utility patents, rather than other awards, such as design or
reissue awards. Utility patents represent about 99% of all awards (Jaffe and Trajtenberg [2002]).




                                                         9
pending applications). An additional concern arises since more than one-quarter (2,440)

of the 8,938 patents we identify are assigned to Seagate Technologies. In contrast, the

second largest patentee accounts for less than 5% of the sample. Since Seagate would

dominate our sample, we do not include it in the analyses. Thus, our final sample consists

of 6,938 patents from 495 firms.


       In Table 1, Panel A, we first summarize the annual private equity investments and

exits. The transactions are concentrated in the second half of the 1990s and the first half

of the 2000s. This reflects both the increasing volume of transactions during these years

and the growing representation of technology firms, which have more patents. The

absence of transactions before January 1986 and after December 2005 reflects the

construction of the sample, which only includes buyout transactions completed during

this period. Exits, not surprisingly, lag the transactions by several years.


       Panel A also displays the timing of the patent applications and awards. Each

patent is associated with two dates: the application date and the grant date. The

application dates extend from 1983 (three years before the first private equity investment)

to 2006. No applications from 2007 appear because we only examine successful

applications that have already been granted by the USPTO. Moreover, the number of

awards falls sharply in 2007, because we only identify grants through May 2007. The

growth in private equity investments and patent grants is also illustrated in Figure 1.


       Panel B shows the distribution across types of transactions. Buyouts of corporate

divisions are most common, followed by private-to-private deals (investments in

independent unquoted entities), secondary deals (firms that were already owned by

                                             10
another a private equity investor), and public-to-private deals. These patterns mirror

private equity investments more generally, as does the preponderance of exits by trade

sales (i.e., acquisitions by non-financial buyers), revealed in Panel C (see also Strömberg

[2008]).


       Panel D presents the industry composition of firms and patents. Patents are

assigned to the primary industry of the parent, as reported by Capital IQ. In later

analyses, we use the patent-specific industry classification by the USPTO. Notably, no

single industry dominates and the sample contains a mixture of “old economy” (e.g., auto

parts and building products) and “new economy” (for instance, application software and

healthcare equipment) firms.


       Panel E shows the distribution of the lag between the patent applications and the

private equity transactions, and it illustrates one of the challenges faced by our

methodology. The patents we observe are disproportionately applied for in the years

before and immediately after the buyout. This reflects the “back-end loaded” nature of

the sample and the lags associated with the patent granting process. Obviously, we cannot

see successful patents filed five years after a buyout undertaken in 2005, and we do not

yet observe most of the patents filed five years after a buyout in 2000, since patents, on




                                             11
average, take more than 30 months to issue, with a substantial minority taking

considerably longer.6


           We capture a variety of information about the patent awards. Over the past two

decades, several quantitative measures of patent quality have become widely adopted

(Jaffe and Trajtenberg [2002]; Lanjouw, Pakes and Putnam [1998]). These measures rely

on the citations either to or by the patent to characterize the nature of the grant (also

called forward and backward citations). Citations are extremely important in patent

filings, since they serve as “property markers” delineating the scope of the granted

claims.


           Patents that are more cited are typically interpreted as having more impact or as

being more important than less cited patents. However, the distribution of citations is also

important. Patents that cite other patents in a broader array of technology classes are

often viewed as having more “originality.” Patents that are themselves cited by a more

technologically dispersed array of patents are viewed as having greater “generality.” Both




6
    Statistics available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/annual/2006/50304_table4.html (accessed
October 21, 2007). It is natural to ask why we only examine successful patent applications, rather than all
patent filings. Unfortunately, the USPTO did not publish information on applications for patents filed prior
to November 2000, and even these data are imperfect: not all applications in the U.S. are published and
information on unsuccessful applications is often removed from the database of applications.




                                                     12
“originality” and “generality” have been interpreted as measures of the fundamental

importance of the research being patented.7


           In addition to the truncation problem delineated above, we also face challenges

around divisional buyouts and cases where the target firm was subsequently acquired by

another corporation. In these instances, the firm’s patents may not be assigned to the

target but rather to the corporate parent. For instance, consider a divisional buyout. Many

of the patents applied for three years before the buyout are likely to be issued before the

private equity investment. In most instances, these will be assigned to the corporate

parent, and even some patents applied for by employees of the bought-out division that

are issued after the buyout may nonetheless be assigned to the corporate parent rather

than to the target corporation.


           While we are unable to comprehensively solve this problem, we can partially

address this issue. In unreported analyses, we repeat the analyses, capturing some, though

not all, of the additional patents associated with bought-out firms that are units of larger

concerns during part of the period during the period from three years before to five years

after the investment. We identify all patents assigned to the corporate parent prior to the

private equity investment or assigned to the target’s acquirer after the private equity



7
    Each patent is assigned to a primary (three-digit) patent class as well as a subclass using the USPTO’s
classification scheme. These classifications are important to the USPTO as they are used to search
subsequent awards. We follow the literature in computing these measures as one minus the Herfindahl
index of the primary patent class of the cited or citing patents. Thus, a higher measure of originality or
generality means that the patent is drawing on or being drawn upon by a more diverse array of awards.




                                                       13
investment that have the same assignee as one of the patents assigned to the target. We

believe that this criterion is conservative. It will lead us to some, though not all, of the

missing patents associated with the target, but identify few “false positives,” or patents

assigned to the parent that are not associated with the target. When we include these

supplemental patents in the analysis, the statistical and economic significance of the

results do not change materially.


3. Methodology


       We focus on the quality, size, and structure of the company’s patent portfolios.

These features are characterized in four ways. First, following the literature, we use the

citation count as a measure of the quality, or economic importance, of the patent. The

citation count is the number of times the patent has been cited by other patents in the

calendar year of the patent grant and the three subsequent years (we will refer to this

period below as a “three-year window”). In particular, we examine whether citation

counts change for patents granted before and after the transaction. Second, we examine

whether the nature of the patents change after the transactions, measured by the patents’

“originality” and “generality,” which are computed using the dispersion of the patents

that cite or are cited by the awarded patent. Moreover, we examine variations in the

propensity of firms to file for patent protection before and after private equity

investments. Finally, we explore whether firms alter their patent filing practices after the

transactions. In particular, we examine whether the changes in patent quality can be

explained by firms increasingly patenting in certain areas.




                                              14
       These patterns provide some indications of the impact of private equity

transactions on long-run investments. If indeed we observe a higher quality of patent

filings, and a more targeted allocation of innovative activity, the pattern would be

consistent with the arguments postulated by Jensen [1989, 1993] about the salutatory

effects of private equity transactions. If we find a decrease in these measures of

innovative activity, the results would be consistent with the more skeptical views of these

transactions.


4. Analysis


A. Measuring Patent Importance

       We begin by examining the quality of the patents in the sample. As noted above,

the most widely used measure in the literature is patent citations. Implementing this

measure requires deciding the number of years over which the citations are counted after

the patent is granted. There is a considerable amount of serial correlation in patent

citations, and patents that are highly cited in their first few years tend to be cited heavily

throughout. Moreover, since our sample is back-end loaded, we prefer a shorter window

to reduce the truncation of the sample at the end. Consequently, we use a three-year

period of citations to construct our citation counts variable, but the serial correlation




                                              15
means that little information is lost by ignoring later citations.8 We examine the

sensitivity of the results to this choice in Section 4C below.


           Table 2 presents the first comparison of patents filed for before and after the

transactions. The two panels treat patents filed in the calendar year of the private equity

investment differently. Focusing on Panel B, we observe that, on average, patents issued

before and in the year of the transactions are cited 1.99 times in the first three years after

they are granted. In contrast, patents issued after the transactions are cited 2.49 times over

the three years after the grant date, corresponding to a 25% increase in the number of

citations.


           These comparisons are instructive but coarse, since they are based on the raw

citation counts. Figures 2 and 3 plot the number of citations in the year of the patent grant

and the three years thereafter for each of the patents in the sample, as well as the average

number of citations for matching patents. These matching patents are defined as follows.

For each patent in the sample, we determine all U.S. patents granted in the same year and

assigned to the same USPTO technology class.9 We observe a clear increase in the

average number of citations for the patents granted to the private equity-backed firms. In


8
    In the USPTO data, patents are typically not cited prior to issuance. This reflects the fact that many
awards are not published prior to issuance and that the USPTO does not update its records of citations to
published patent applications to include the number of the ultimately granted patents. Thus, the grant date
is the beginning of the period when a patent can garner citations.
9
    Patents are assigned during the application process to one of approximately one thousand technology
classes, as well as a more detailed subclass. These classifications are important, since they are the primary
way in which the USPTO identifies other relevant patents during the examination process.




                                                        16
part, this may reflect the increasing importance of patents in later years, but it may also

reflect two other changes. As the pace of patenting world-wide accelerates, the frequency

of patent citations has increased. Furthermore, as private equity investments in high-

technology industries become more common, the representation of patents in

technologically dynamic industries has grown. Figure 3 captures these trends, and this

figure shows a clear increase in the average number of citations, as well as the dispersion

of citations, for the matching patents. Hence, it is important to control for the timing of

the patent grant and its technology class.


       To address this concern, Table 2 also reports the relative citation counts. These

are calculated as the number of citations in the calendar year of the grant and the three

calendar years thereafter (citation count) less the average number of citations during this

period to matching patents, which have the same grant year and primary USPTO class.

When comparing the relative citation counts, both the absolute and percentage increases

in the counts are as great as or greater than the increases for the raw, unadjusted citation

counts. For the measures of “originality” and “generality,” the economical and statistical

magnitudes are smaller when comparing the relative measures to the raw ones.


       To provide a more nuanced view of the changes in the patent citations, we turn to

a multivariate analysis. A natural starting point is the Poisson count model. The defining

property of this model is that, for each patent i, the individual citation events are

independently distributed over the three years following the grant of the patent with

intensity λi . This implies that the three-year citation count is distributed according to the

Poisson distribution


                                              17
                                                        exp(−λi )λi y
                                         Pr (Yi = y ) =                                                       (1)
                                                            y!


and the patent receives on average λi citations over the three years following the grant

date. To compare the citation intensities before and after the transactions, we estimate

the standard Poisson specification


                                                 ln ( λi ) = X i′β                                            (2)


Here Xi contains observed characteristics, including variables capturing whether the

application date is before of after the date of the transaction. Estimates are reported in

Table 3, but before discussing these estimates, a limitation of this model should be noted.

In the Poisson model, the citation intensity is a deterministic function of the observed

characteristics. However, there may be unobserved factors that affect the citation

intensity, and such factors would cause overdispersion of the citation counts relative to

the Poisson model (see Cameron and Trivedi [1998] and Hausman, Hall, and Griliches

[1984]).10 In our sample, when testing for overdispersion, the basic Poisson model is

consistently rejected. The Negative Binomial model is a generalization of the Poisson

model that addresses this problem. It includes an additional error term to capture

unobserved factors, and the distribution of the three-year citation count is a mixture of the




10
     Another potential source of overdispersion is a disproportionate number of patents with zero citations
(see Cameron and Trivedi [1998]). We repeat the analysis using zero-inflated Poisson and Negative
Binomial models and find results that are consistently slightly stronger than the reported results.




                                                        18
Poisson distribution and the distribution of this error term. Using this model, we estimate

the specification


                                         ln ( λi ) = X i′β + ε i                           (3)


where ε i is an i.i.d. random variable with mean zero.


       To control for changes in citation behavior and the industry composition of

companies in our sample, we control for the baseline citation intensities, using the

matching patents described above. This is implemented as follows. For each patent, we

calculate the average citation intensity of the matching patents as


                                         Total Citations
                             γi =                                                          (4)
                                    Number of Matching Patents


where Total Citations is the number of citations received by all matching USPTO patents

during the three years following their grant dates. For patent i, γ i gives the baseline

citation intensity. By including this baseline in the estimation, the estimates control for

technology- and year-specific variations in the citation patterns. Hence, we estimate the

Poisson and Negative Binomial specifications


                                      ln ( λi ) = X i′β + ln ( γ i )                       (5)


and


                                    ln ( λi ) = X i′β + ln ( γ i ) + ε i                   (6)




                                                    19
        To interpret the parameters in these specifications, note that when X i′β = 0 , the

citation intensity equals the baseline intensity for the matching group of patents. When

X i′β is greater (or smaller) than zero, the citation intensity is proportionally greater (or

smaller) than the intensity for the matched group. Finally, note that the reported

coefficients are incidence rates, reflecting the proportional effect of an increase in the

underlying characteristic. An incidence rate greater than one corresponds to a positive

coefficient and a positive effect of the characteristic on the intensity. For binary

variables, the reported incidence rate is the proportional increase in citation intensity

following an increase in the variable from zero to one.


        The results are reported in Table 3. In the first four regressions, the independent

variables are indicators for the individual years of the patent filing relative to the year of

the private equity transaction. In each case, applications in the second through fifth year

after the transaction are cited significantly more frequently. To illustrate, in the first

regression, the coefficient of 1.786 for patents applied for three years after the transaction

implies that these patents garner 78.6% more citations than those applied for in the year

of the transaction. Except for the first specification, the coefficients in the first three rows

are not significantly different from one. The coefficients may suggest a decline in citation

intensity from years -3 or -2 to the year of the transaction (year 0 is the base year, with a

coefficient normalized to one), but this decline is an order of magnitude smaller than the

subsequent increase and less significant. For the relative citation intensities, this initial

decline largely disappears, meaning that patents filed for before the transaction are cited

about as frequently as the patents in the matching group. However, except for the year


                                               20
immediately after the transaction, the coefficients for subsequent years are greater than

one and consistently significant, showing that patents filed after the private equity

investment are cited significantly more frequently than the patents in the matched group.

This pattern is found both for absolute and relative citation intensities, although it is

slightly more pronounced for the relative intensities that control for the timing and

industry composition of the patents.


       In the fifth and sixth columns of Table 3, we use a more parsimonious

specification, in which the dummy variable Post equals one, if the patent was applied for

in the first through fifth year after the private equity investment. Again, this coefficient is

substantially greater than one and statistically highly significant, confirming our finding

that citation count increase following private equity transactions.


       One concern is that buyout funds “cherry pick” companies and focus their

investments in companies with stronger innovation potential. In this case, our findings

may reflect this “selection” rather than the investors’ effect on the companies. While we

do not have an instrumental variable that would allow us to definitively resolve this issue,

we believe that this is a small concern for two reasons. As mentioned above, the majority

of the companies in our sample are “old economy” companies where innovation and

intellectual property are less central to their businesses. The innovation potential of these

companies is unlikely to be an important factor for the private equity funds when they

make investment decisions. Moreover, as observed in Table 3, the majority of the

increase in the citation rate comes in the second and third years after the transaction. Hall,

Griliches, and Hausman [1986] study the lag between R&D activities and patent


                                              21
applications and find that they move virtually simultaneously, suggesting that most of the

change in the patent quality does not take place until sometimes after the transaction,

making it less likely to having influenced the investors’ initial decision to undertake the

investment.


        The key results are robust to the use of fixed- and random-effects specifications,

as reported in Table 4. In particular, we find that in the four Poisson specifications (with

random and fixed effects, and the controls for individual years and the more

parsimonious specification with the post-investment dummy), the years after the private

equity investment are associated with consistently more significant patents. The

magnitudes of the coefficients do not change appreciably from those in Table 3. The

results are weaker but quantitatively similar when we employ the Negative Binomial

specification with fixed and random effects in columns five and six, due to the additional

flexibility of this model.


B. The Fundamental Nature of the Patents


        One possibility is that the patents awarded to the firms are more economically

important, but the firms are sacrificing more basic or fundamental research that will not

yield commercial benefits for some time going forward.


        We thus turn to examining the fundamental nature of the patents awarded to these

firms, using the measures of patent originality and generality described above. In Table 2,

we see that when we examine these measures, patents applied for after the private equity

investments are somewhat more general but less original than those applied for


                                             22
beforehand. Once we adjust for the average generality and originality of awards in the

same patent class and with the same grant year, these differences essentially disappear.


           A similar conclusion emerges from the regression analyses in Table 5. When we

run regressions akin to those in earlier tables (now employing an ordinary least squares

specification with patentee fixed effects), we find that the awards applied for after the

private equity investments are somewhat more general and less original.11 Once we use

the relative originality and generality by subtracting the averages for patents in the same

class and grant year as independent variables, the significance of these differences

essentially disappears. Thus, private equity investments do not seem to be associated with

a change in the fundamental nature of the (patented) research.


C. Robustness Checks of the Patent Quality Analyses

           In undertaking the analyses of patent quality, we needed to make a number of

assumptions. In this section, we summarize the results of unreported supplemental

analyses, where we relax these assumptions.


           One issue was posed by private equity investments where there was already an

existing investor. These investments are typically secondary buyouts, where one sponsor

buys out the stake of another. As a result, some patents may be double-counted: they may

be simultaneously prior to one transaction and after another. We repeat the analysis,



11
     The sample size is smaller in regressions examining generality because computing this measure requires
that patents are subsequently cited.




                                                      23
employing these patents only the first time they appear and then dropping them entirely.

The results are little changed.


        A second concern was posed by our measure of patent citations, which only uses

the citation count during the three years after the award. As mentioned above, the

number of citations to a given patent in each year is strongly serially correlated, so we

should identify the same patents as heavily cited ones whatever window we use. Using a

long window to identify citations enhances the accuracy of our identification of important

patents but reduces our sample size. We repeat the analysis, using citations through the

end of the second calendar year after the patent grant, as well as after the fourth year, and

the results are qualitatively similar.


        A third concern has to do with what we term “cherry picking” in divisional

buyouts. In particular, we worried that corporate parents, when they determine which

pending patent applications will be assigned to the private equity-backed firm at the time

of the buyout, will select only low quality patents: the best patents, even if very relevant

to the target firm, will be retained by the corporate parent. This tendency might lead to an

apparent increase in quality in the patents applied for after the award, while all we are

really seeing is an unbiased sample of the unit’s patents.


        We can partially address this concern by using the enhanced sample described

above. We also address this issue by rerunning the cross-tabulations and regressions

above while excluding the divisional buyouts from our sample. Since the buyouts in the

sub-sample are not “carved out” of firms, but involve the purchase of an entire



                                             24
corporation, this problem should not be present. The key results are little changed as a

result of this shift.


        Another robustness check is to examine the impact of the holding periods of the

private equity groups. If private equity groups only affect the companies in their

portfolios gradually, we might expect that firms that have been held by private equity

investors for longer periods would have a more dramatic increase in innovative output. In

unreported regressions analyzing patent citations, we find support for this hypothesis.

The pattern is no longer statistically significant, however, when we add firm fixed effects

to the specification.


D. Analysis of Level of Patenting

        In the last three tables, we move from examining the quality of individual patents

to looking at the mixture of the overall patenting activity generated in the years before

and after the private equity investments.


        A natural first question is how the level of patenting activity changes around the

time of a private equity investment. If the average number of successful patent filings

falls dramatically, our interpretation of the earlier finding that the importance of the

issued patents rises considerably might be quite different: it would suggest cutbacks of

unproductive innovative activities rather than repositioning of research from lower to

higher impact topics.


        The analysis of patenting prior to and after the private equity investment is

problematic, however, for several reasons. While we can adjust for the truncation


                                              25
associated with the timing of the patent applications (the fact that, in many cases, not all

patents in the five years after the private equity investments in our sample have been

applied for, much less awarded), it is very difficult to control for the assignment of

patents to corporate parents and the fact may of our companies are not stand-alone

entities in the years surrounding the transaction. As noted above, we will be able to see

some but not all of patents assigned to targets that were units of larger firms prior to

divisional buyouts or else were ultimately acquired by other concerns. When no patents

are observed in a year, it is difficult to say whether the company did not file for patents or

whether it was not operating as an independent entity. Consequently, we exclude

divisional buyouts for the analysis below. Moreover, we estimate specifications restricted

to buyouts taking place before 1999 and to companies that have patent filings in three

years before the transaction and five years after the transaction, suggesting that these

companies were independent entities during the entire period.


       Moreover, the analysis faces an identification problem. As observed previously,

the composition of firms and the citation patterns change during our sample period,

making time controls important. Ideally, the specification would also include individual

company fixed effects as well as separate indicators for the years surrounding the

transactions. However, this specification is not identified, since the company fixed effect

defines the event time, which, together with the indicator for the year surrounding the

event, uniquely determines the year. (See Berndt and Griliches [1993] and Hall,

Mairesse, and Turner [2007] for detailed analyses of this problem). There is no entirely

satisfactory solution. We circumvent this problem by replacing the individual indicators

for the years surrounding the event with a single “Post” dummy. This identifies the

                                             26
regression, but the identifying assumption is that the patenting levels are constant before

and after the transaction (i.e., the full transition takes place in the year of the transaction).

To verify the robustness of this assumption, we also report estimates of specifications

with a dummy that equals one from year two after the transaction (“Post Plus One”),

allowing for a more gradual effect. Note, that this identification problem is not a concern

for our analysis of citation counts, since we could use the citation rates for matching

patents to calculate the relative citation intensities, and in this way avoid including

individual year fixed effects.


        Despite these limitations, in Table 6 we undertake an analysis of the level of

patenting. An observation is a target firm-year pair: that is, for each transaction in 2000

and before, we use nine observations for each transaction, from three years prior to five

years after the transaction. (For transactions in subsequent years, we use smaller number

of observations, reflecting our inability to see patent filings made after 2005.) The

dependent variable is the number of ultimately successful patent filings made in the given

calendar year.


          The initial analysis, in the first two columns of Table 6, uses the entire sample.

These regressions, like all those reported in this table, include fixed effects for each year

and each firm to control for the differing propensity to patent. In these specifications, we

include a post dummy denoting observations after the buyout (or post plus one, as

explained above). The coefficients smaller than one on the post dummies suggest that

there is a decline in patenting activity following the buyouts.




                                               27
       We might worry, however, that this result is an artifact of our sample

construction: in particular, while we observe some successful patent filings in the final

years of the sample, there are likely to be many applications that were filed in these years

that had not been issued as of May 2007. (Recall the average patent pendency today is

about 30 months.) Because observations of patent filings in 2004 and 2005, where this

selection bias will be the worst, are disproportionately likely to be in the years after

private equity transactions, this effect may bias our counts of patent filings.


       We thus repeat the analyses restricting the sample in two ways. First, in columns

3 and 4, we limit the analysis to private equity investments prior to 1999. In these

regressions, effects due to not-yet-issued patent applications should be much less severe.

Again, we include both firm and year fixed effects. The trend reverses and we find

significant positive effects of buyouts on patenting activity.


       A remaining worry is that these results may be affected by some firms not being

stand-alone firms in the years before or after this transaction, even if the transaction itself

is not a divisional buyout. To ensure we have patenting information about the individual

firms in the years surrounding the transaction, specifications 5 and 6 condition on the

firm having received a patent both in the years three years before and five years after the

transaction: i.e., we require that the firm had received a patent both in Event Year -3 and

in Event Year +5. This reduces the concern that we do not observe patents for the firm in

the entire nine-year window. It also introduces a concern that companies that are stand-

alone entities before and remain stand-alone entities after the transaction are special in

other ways, which may affect our results as well. In the two reported specifications (and


                                              28
other unreported ones), we find that the post-buyout dummy is either weakly negative or

weakly positive.


       Taken together, the results do not suggest any clear change in the amount of

patenting. While our conclusions must be somewhat tentative due to the discussed

difficulties in measurement, questions of causation, and the remaining uncertainties, the

absence of a consistent pattern is evident.


E. Analysis of Patent Portfolios

       In the final section, we turn to considering the structure of the patent portfolios

constructed by these firms in the years before and after the private equity investments.

Since the previous section shows that the increase in patent importance is not driven by

private equity-backed firms reducing the number of filings, it is natural to wonder about

the dynamics behind the change in quality.


       The initial analysis is presented in the final line in Panel A of Table 2. We

compare the Herfindahl index, or concentration measure, of the patent classes in which

firms’ awards are assigned. In this comparison, we restrict the sample to the 70 firms

with at least four patent applications in the sample filed prior to the private equity

investment and at least four patents applied for afterwards, in order to ensure the

computed measures of concentration are meaningful. When we undertake this

comparison, we find that firms after private equity investments are likely to have more

concentrated patent portfolios than beforehand, but the p-value is just above the 10%

threshold.



                                              29
        We can gain some additional insights as to how these more concentrated

portfolios emerge from the cross-tabulations in Table 7. In this table, each patent is an

observation, and we examine citations in the years prior to and after the private equity

investment, similar to the analysis in Table 2. We now divide the patents, though, in two

ways. In Panel A, we divide the observations into those whose primary patent class

assignment was more or less well populated prior to the investments: more precisely,

whether the firm, in applications filed in the three years prior to the private equity

transaction, had above or below the median share of patenting in that primary patent

class. In Panel B, we divide the patents by whether the share of patenting in the primary

class increased or decreased after the private equity transaction.


        The cross-tabulations provide additional insights into the sources of the increase

in patent importance. First, we see from Panel A that awards in the firms’ focal

technologies—the areas where they had done a disproportionate amount of patenting

prior to the transaction—are more likely to increase in quality, whether raw or adjusted

patent counts are used. Panel B reveals that patent classes that experience an increase in

patenting share are also disproportionately where the increase in patent quality occurred.

These patterns are consistent with the private equity-backed firms focusing their

innovative investments in their core areas of strength and generating higher-impact patent

portfolios as a result.


        Consistent results emerge from Table 8, which presents Negative Binomial

regression analyses akin to that in the fifth and sixth columns of Table 3. We now add

controls for the share of patenting in the primary patent class prior to the private equity


                                              30
investment (in the first and second regressions) and for the change in the share of

patenting in that class from before to after the investment (in the third and fourth

regressions), as well as interactions between the patent measure and the dummy denoting

an award filed in the first through fifth years after the private equity investment. Because

the measures of patent shares may be misleading if there are just a handful of patents

assigned to a given firm, we undertake the analysis both using the entire sample (the first

and third columns) and only for patents of firms which had at least four patents prior to

the private equity investments and four after (the second and fourth columns).


       The significantly greater than one coefficient for the variable “Share of Firm's

Pre-Investment Patents in Class” suggest that patents in the firms’ “core” areas—the

areas where there was more patenting prior to the private equity investment—are

disproportionately likely to be more cited ones. Moreover, the interaction term is greater

than one. Not only are these patents more important, but their impact appears to increase

substantially after the private equity investment.


       The variable “Change in Firm’s Patent in Class Pre- and Post- Investment”

initially presents a more confusing picture. The coefficient is again greater than one—

areas where there is growth are more important ones—but the significance is only

marginal. In column 3, the interaction term is less than one, but when we restrict the

sample to those firms with four patents before and after the transaction (or similar cut-

offs), the interaction becomes greater than one and significant. Once we exclude firms

with only modest patenting activity, an increase in patenting is associated with a sharp

(and highly significant) boost in patent quality.


                                             31
        Thus, these analyses suggest that private equity-backed firms tend to focus their

patent filings. This focusing process is not indiscriminate, however, but tends to

concentrate on core technologies. Moreover, the very process of focusing seems to lead

the patents in these classes to have greater impact after the private equity investment.


5. Conclusions


        This paper examines the changes around the time of investments by private equity

groups on firms’ long-run investments, focusing on innovative activities. We examine

patents filed by 495 firms that received private equity backing between 1986 and 2005.

We find that patents of private equity-backed firms applied for in the years after the

investment are more frequently cited. These firms show no deterioration after the

investments in patent originality and generality, which proxy for the fundamental nature

of the research. The level of patenting does not appear to consistently change, and the

firms’ patent portfolios become more focused in the years after the private equity

investments. Breakdowns of the patenting patterns suggest that the areas where the firms

concentrate their patenting after the private equity investment, and the historical core

strengths of the firm, tend to be the areas where the increase in patent impact is

particularly great.


        We see three avenues for future research into the relationship of private equity

and innovation. While each will require additional data collection, they should deepen

our understanding of this important phenomenon: First, is sensitivity of innovative

activity to market changes less for private equity-backed firms? Financial economists

have argued that the public market can give misleading signals to firms regarding

                                             32
appropriate investments, but that managers nonetheless feel pressured to follow the

market’s lead (e.g., Baker, Stein, and Wurgler [2003]). If this argument is right, and

private equity investors provide insulation against these pressures, we might anticipate

that investments in innovation by private equity-backed firms would be less sensitive to

the shifts in market sentiment. To examine this, we will need to link the patent activity to

changes in financial and accounting performance.


       Second, do private equity-backed firms differ in their management of patent

portfolios? In the past decade, U.S. patentees have needed to pay renewal fees in order to

keep their patents active. Some large firms appear to have an automatic policy of

renewing patents, even if the bulk of patents have little value. It would be interesting to

observe if private equity-backed firms are less likely to renew patents, particularly lightly

cited ones, than the norm.


       Finally, how do sales of divisions affect innovation by the parent firms? Recent

research has suggested that firms that are more reliant on internal capital markets to

reallocate resources across divisions produce both a lesser number of innovations and

also less novel innovations (Seru [2007]). We can examine patenting not just by target

firms, but also of the corporate parents of these targets. Do the changes associated with

the sell-off of the target lead the (presumably more focused) parent firm to pursue a more

effective innovation strategy?

NOTE: The sample consists of 6398 patents awarded through May 2007 to 495 firms that received private
equity backing between 1986 and 2005. Citation counts are calculated for the subsample of 4207 patents
awarded before December 2004. Firms are only included in the sample if they applied for patents in the
period between three years before and five years after the private equity investment. The comparisons in
the table above are made at the individual patent level, except for the calculation of the Herfindahl index of
firms’ patent classes, which is done on the firm level. The latter calculations are only undertaken if the firm
had at least four patents applied for before and four patents applied for after the private equity investment.

NOTE: The sample consists of 4207 patents awarded through December 2004 to 495 firms that received
private equity backing between 1986 and 2005. Firms are only included in the sample if they applied for
patents in the period between three years before and five years after the private equity investment. The unit
of observation is each patent in the sample with at least three years to be cited. The dependent variable is
the number of citations received in the three years after the award. Reported coefficients are incidence
rates. A coefficient greater than one corresponds to a positive relationship between the explanatory variable
and the citation intensity.

NOTE: The sample consists of 6398 patents awarded through May 2007 to 495 firms that received private equity backing between 1980 and 2005.
Firms are only included in the sample if they applied for patents in the period between three years before and five years after the private equity
investment The unit of observation is each patent in the sample for which originality and generality can be computed. The dependent variables are the
originality and generality of the patents. Relative originality and generality are computed by subtracting the average originality and generality for
patents in the same year and class.

NOTE: The sample consists of 6398 patents awarded through May 2007 to 495 firms that received private equity backing between 1980 and 2005.
Firms are only included in the sample if they applied for patents in the period between three years before and five years after the private equity
investment The unit of observation is each patent in the sample for which originality and generality can be computed. The dependent variables are the
originality and generality of the patents. The table reports incidence rate ratios. Reported coefficients are incidence rates. A coefficient greater than one
corresponds to a positive relationship between the explanatory variable and the citation intensity.

NOTE: The sample consists of 6398 patents awarded through May 2007 to 495 firms that received private
equity backing between 1980 and 2005. Firms are only included in the sample if they applied for patents in
the period between three years before and five years after the private equity investment The comparisons in
the table above are made at the individual patent level. We divide the patents by whether the share of the
firm’s patents prior to the private equity investment in the given patent class was above or below the
median, and by whether the share of the firm’s patents in the class after the buyout was greater or less or
equal to that prior to the transaction.
