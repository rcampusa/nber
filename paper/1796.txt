         'bney in the Utility Function: IAn Errpirical Inpierrentation


                                   ABSTRTCT




     This paper studies household asset demands by allowing certain assets to

contribute directly to utility. It estimates the parameters of an aggregate

utility function which includes both consumption and liquidity services.

These liquidity services depend on the level of various asset stocks. We

apply these estimates to investigate the long- and short—run interest

elasticities of demand for money, time deposits, and Treasury bills. We also

examine the impact of open market operations on interest rates, and present

new estimates of the welfare cost of inflation.

     This paper studies households' demand for different assets by allowing

certain assets to contribute directly to household utility.1 We permit the

utility function to capture the "liquidity" services of money, certain time

deposits and even some government securities. Our approach yields estimates

of the utility function parameters which can be used to study the effects of a

variety of changes in asset returns. We investigate how asset holdings and

consumption react to both temporary and permanent changes in returns, and study

the effects of government financial policy.

     Our approach provides an integrated system of asset demands of the form

which Tobin and Brainard (1968) advocate for studying the effects of government

interventions in financial markets. It provides a tractable alternative to the

atheoretical equations which are commonly used to study the demand for money and

other assets. Those equations, which cannot be interpreted as the rational

response of any economic agent to changes in the economic environment, are

unlikely to remain stable when the supply of various non—monetary assets changes.

     Our approach to studying asset demands is somewhat controversial. Its

opponents argue that assets do not yield utility directly. They explain that

rate of return dominated assets such as money are held because they reduce

transactions costs, which should be modelled explicitly. Unfortunately,

explicit models with transactions costs are too restrictive to be useful in

analyzing aggregate data. Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956) assume that the

individual receives a constant income stream and faces a constant interest rate.

By assuming that the individual consumes at a constant rate, they derive the

optimal timing of financial transactions. If individuals are uniformly distri-

buted over the time of their last visit to their financial intermediary, then

aggregate money holdings are a function of the representative individual's aver-
                                     —2—


age holdings, which are given by the famous square-root formula.

     This approach suffers from a number of drawbacks. Even assuming that

consumption is constant, the optimal timing of individual transactions is

extremely hard to compute when interest rates and income vary stochastically.

Such a computation is well beyond the modern transactions-based models of

Jovanovic (1982), Grossman and Weiss (1983), Romer (1984), and Rotemberg

(1984).2 Moreover, the assumption of constant consumption cannot be justified

if the individual is maximizing utility from consumption unless the real rate of

return on money is equal to the discount rate. Thus, while Goldfeld (1973)

appeals to transactions-based models to justify his money demand regressions,

these models provide an unacceptable basis for empirical work.

     On the other hand, the objections to estimating the utility flow of

liquidity services seem to apply equally well to the estimation of the demand

for many durable goods. Like many durables, money is not utilized constantly,

but in bursts. Just like some durables, even money which is not used provides

some utility in the form of security. Whether or not money's services provide

utility in the same fashion as other goods is a moot point. Various consumer

goods provide different "types" of utility, and to single out money services as

a particular variety which is unworthy of inclusion in a consumer's utility

function seems arbitrary at best.

    A number of researchers including Barnett (1980,1983), Chetty (1969), Ewis

and Fisher (1984), and Rusted and Rush (1984) have attempted to estimate a

utility function for assets. Feige and Pierce (1977) survey this literature.

These attempts have encountered a number of difficulties. First, Chetty (1969)

and some of his followers fail to recognize that when a consumer chooses to hold

an asset with a relatively low rate of return, he will have to reduce his
                                      —3-


 consumption at some point. To evaluate this loss in consumption, it is

 necessary to specify and measure the consumer's marginal utility of
                                                                       consumption.
 A second problem, which affects all previous work, arises from the inherent

 uncertainty of the opportunity cost of money. The alternative to
                                                                    holding money
 or other assets which yield liquidity services is to hold assets with uncertain

 returns. Therefore, the opportunity cost of these assets is a random variable

 at the time when the consumer allocates his portfolio. This makes it

 inappropriate to model the consumer's portfolio allocation problem as one of

choosing expenditures (opportunity cost times quantity held) on different

assets.3 To avoid these problems we follow Hansen and Singleton (1982) and

estimate the parameters of a representative individual's utility function from

the first-order conditions of this individual's maximization problem.

     The paper is organized into five sections. The first outlines the

representative consumer model and explains the factors motivating our choice of

a parametric utility function. Section II describes our data and estimation

procedure. Estimation results are presented in the third section, and the

estimated parameters are used for comparative statics calculations in Section

IV. A brief conclusion evaluates our findings on the usefulness of the assets-

in-the—utility-function model, and suggests several directions for future work.


I.   The Theoretical Background

     We maintain the convenient fiction that movements in per capita consump-

tion, as well as real asset holdings, can be attributed to the optimizing

behavior of a rational representative consumer. He is infinite-lived, has

constant preferences, and derives utility by consuming and by holding assets.

In principle, it would be possible to allow a wide variety of different assets
                                                     —4-


to yield utility. We focus only on those which constitute a substantial

fraction of household wealth and have easily measured market values and rates of

return. This limits us to four asset classes: money, time deposits, short—term

marketable government debt, and corporate equity. Long-term debt holdings are

excluded because of difficulties in measuring their market value.

     We begin with a specification of preferences which is additively

separable across time, and then examine a case in which costs of adjusting

asset stocks violate this restriction. In the additively separable case, the

consumer's expected discounted utility at time t may be written

                     T-t     MT ST 6T
                                                                                                     (1)

                       T                        T

The expectations operator Et is conditional on information available at t; p

is a discount factor, assumed constant through time. The four arguments of

the period-by-period utility function are real consumption, CT, real money

holdings, MT/PT, real savings and time deposits, ST/PT, and real holdings of

short-term government debt, 6T'T Equity holdings, represented as

provide the numeraire asset in defining preferences.4 They are not a direct

source of utility. The utility function U(.) is concave and increasing in

consumption and all three asset stocks.

    The evolution of equity holdings is given by

        The Euler equation for consumption (EC) states that along an optimal path

the representative individual cannot raise his expected utility by foregoing one

Unit of consumption in period t, investing its value in equities, and

consuming the proceeds in period t+1. The utility cost of giving up a unit of

consumption in period t is au/act. The expected utility gain from reducing
                            au             Pt(l+rE)
                                                                                                                                 C

perturbation yields the first—order condition (EC). If several assets that

yield no utility are traded by the representative consumer, (EC) should also

hold with rE replaced by the return on any of these assets.

        Euler equation (M) specifies that utility cannot be increased by holding

one dollar less of money at time t, investing it in equities, and consuming

the proceeds at time t+1. The foregone utility associated with a one dollar

reduction in money holding is                                          •
                                                                            —). Switching       one dollar from money to

equities at t increases real wealth at ti-i by rEl since money yields no

nominal return while equity does. The expected gain in utility if these

higher proceeds are consumed in period ti-i.

                                                                                      is E[p.8             rE
                                                                                                       •
                                                                                                                 }.   Equating
                                                                                                ti-i       t+i
this to the foregone utility yields (M). Similarly, Euler equations (S) and

(0) equate the costs and benefits of transferring one dollar from Treasury bills
or savings deposits into equities for one period at time t.

     Given a specification of preferences, the budget constraint (i.e., the

condition that net worth does not become infinitely negative), and the

conditional distributions of all future prices and rates of return, we could

find the representative consumer's consumption and asset holdings at time t.

However, solving the consumer's problem analytically is almost impossible in all

but a few restrictive cases. We therefore follow previous authors in estimating

the parameters of U from equations (3) through (6).

     If expectational errors are the only source of error in our equations,

then our system of first order conditions can, by suitable linear combination,

be transformed into two stochastic and two nonstochastic equations.5 This

implies that the error covariance matrix for the system of equations which we

estimate could be singular. This problem does not arise if errors also result

from random shocks to preferences. For example, if the consumer's utility

function includes terms such as vMtMt and                              where the Mt and   are

stochastic, then the covariance matrix would be nonsingular.

     We assume that the representative consumer's preferences are given by:

            M
            _t ...!
                   S

where Lt is a liquidity aggregate given by

                           P4            S                     G
            Lt =   [oM(t)T         +
                                       o5()'   +

This utility function exhibits constant relative risk aversion in an aggregate

of consumption and liquidity services.6 This aggregate is Cobb-Douglas in

consumption and liquidity, ensuring that more consumption raises the marginal

utility of liquidity and vice versa. Our liquidity measure is a CES function of

 our three assets. Such functions have been pioneered
                                                                          by Chetty (1969) and used
 by Barnett (1980) and Husted and Rush (1984), among others.7 It must be pointed

 out that these preferences are quite restrictive. In
                                                                          particular, they impose
 homogeneity and require separability between leisure and other sources of

 utility. These restrictions will hopefully be relaxed in future work.

         With these preferences, equations (3) through (6) become:

We report estimates of the parameters {a,p,y,,óM,âSJ from these equations in

In this case, there is no transformation of the first order conditions which

equations assuming the functional form of U(.) is given by (9) and (10).


II. Data and Estimation

     We employ aggregate time series data on asset holdings by the household

sector. These data, computed each quarter by the Federal Reserve Board and

published in the Flow of Funds sector balance sheets, are available since the

first quarter of 1952. Our money variable, Mt. is the sum of demand deposits

and currency; S, is the total holding of time and savings deposits, and Gt is

the holding of short-term marketable government debt.11

     There are several problems with our data series on asset holdings. First,

household currency holdings are computed as a residual after subtracting

corporate currency holdings from the outstanding currency stock. Errors can

arise if currency has flowed abroad, since it will be allocated mistakenly to

the U.S. household sector. Despite this difficulty, these data have been used

in almost all previous investigations of money demand.

     A second problem which is less significant for money than for other assets
                                             -9-


is that the "household sector" includes households as well as personal trusts

and nonprofit institutions. These institutions probably hold little cash and a

small quantity of demand deposits, but their holdings of short-term Treasury

bills could be substantial. Personal trusts may be aggregated with the

households who are their beneficial owners. This argument is inappropriate for

nonprofit groups, however, and the resulting biases are unclear.

     Our measure of consumption, C, is seasonally-adjusted real personal

expenditures on nondurables from the National Income and Product Accounts. Our

choice of nondurable consumption raises further aggregation issues. Nondurables

are only a part of total consumption, excluding both the service flow from

durables and services which are purchased directly. We implicitly restrict the

utility function to be additively separable between nondurable and other

consumption. We deflate each of our asset stocks, as well as consumption

expenditure, by the personal nondurable consumption deflator and convert to a

per capita basis by dividing by the total population over age sixteen.

     We calculate quarterly equity returns (rEt) using data on both the dividend

yield and the level of the Standard and Poors' 500-Stock Composite Index. The

total pretax return is rE =           + d,   where dt is the dividend yield and   the

ex post rate of capital gains. The after-tax rate of return is rE =

           +              where Td is the dividend tax rate and Tg is the effective
(l_Td)dt       (l_Tg)9t
capital gains tax rate from Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux, and Poterba (1983).12

     Returns on T-bills and savings deposits are computed in a similar fashion.

The annual interest rates on these securities are reported each quarter in the

Federal Reserve Bulletin. We convert each to a quarterly return and then

multiply by (l_Td) to obtain the after-tax return.13 Yields on savings deposits

are available beginning in the first quarter of 1955; this determines the
                                         -10-


beginning of our estimation period.

     One difficulty with our return measures is that each asset aggregate in-

cludes a variety of assets with different rates of return. Demand deposits and

currency includes some interest-bearing NOW accounts, while time deposits

include both large time deposits at commercial banks, which may pay iriterest at

market rates, as well as those at savings and loan institutions.14

     We estimate the parameters                        by fitting the implied first

order conditions (EC), (M), (0), and (S) to the time series data using three

stage least squares. The residuals in our equations are, at least partially,

forecast errors uncorrelated with information available at t. The other

component of our residuals, the v's, are assumed to be i.i.d. and thus

uncorrelated with our instruments. We employ two different sets of

instruments. The first includes a constant term, two lagged values of the

real returns on equity, time deposits, and 1—bills, as well as the growth

rates in money, consumption, time deposits and T-bills. The second includes a

constant term, two lagged values of equity, savings deposit, and time deposit

returns, as well as two lagged values of consumption, money, time deposit, and

1-bill holdings. The second instrument set is unattractive because some of the

instruments may be nonstationary, but its advantage is that these instruments

are probably more correlated with the variables which appear in our equations.

For each system of equations, we report the minimized value of the objective

function, J, which Hansen and Singleton (1982) show to be a test statistic for

the validity of the overidentifying restrictions.

    We constrain our estimates of the utility function parameters in two ways.

First, we require that öM       and (l_ÔM_ô5) be positive by estimating a0 and
                                              2                     2
a1, where
                    2
              = cos (a0) and      =   [1 - cos (a0fl      1   -   cos (a1)]. Second, we

require     to be positive and between zero and one by defining          =              and
                                                                             cos2(a2)

         and   are obtained by standard asymptotic methods.


 III. Estimation Results

      Table 1 shows the results of estimating our systems of Euler equations

 for the case of time-additive preferences. We report four sets of estimates,

corresponding to each of the two instrument sets using both pre-tax and

post—tax returns. The estimates are remarkably stable across specifications.

All J—statistics are well within the ninety—five percent confidence bounds, so

we can never reject the validity of our over-identifying restrictions.

     The results provide strong support for the view that liquidity is a direct

source of utility. We estimate ,    the   share of expenditure which is devoted to

consumption, to be between .951 and .979. In three of the four equations we

reject the hypothesis that =1 at the .05 confidence level. This null

hypothesis corresponds to our included assets yielding no utility.

     Our estimate of y, the exponent in our CES liquidity aggregator function,

is .27 when we use our preferred instrument set and pre-tax returns, and .19

with post—tax returns. These estimates imply an elasticity of substitution

between assets, 1/(y—1), larger than that in Husted and Rush (1984) but smaller

than that in Chetty (1969). These point estimates argue against linear

aggregation of our three assets. However, y=1, the case in which linear

aggregation is appropriate, cannot be rejected. When we use Instrument Set II,

the estimates of y increase and make the y=1 case more plausible.

     Within our monetary aggregator, the coefficients on the various assets are

estimated with relatively large asymptotic standard errors)-5 The general

pattern which emerges from the point estimates -is     >    > 1ÔS&M•    If all

        parentheses. The .95 critical value of the J-statistic, which is
        distributed as x2(54) under the null hypothesis, is 72.4.

real asset stocks were of equal size, this would imply that the marginal

utility associated with another dollar of time deposits would exceed that

from another dollar of demand deposits or currency. However, it is essential

to recognize that at current asset levels, with time deposits five times

larger than demand deposits and currency, rather different conclusions emerge.

In 1981:4 our estimates from Column 1 imply that the marginal utility of money

is twice that of savings accounts and four times that of government securities.

The estimates in Column 3 imply even larger differences.

     Although we have allowed government securities to provide liquidity

services, our estimates do not suggest a major liquidity role for these assets.

When we reestimate our system imposing the constraint that    =          the value
                                                                  16M'
of our objective function deteriorates very little. Thus we cannot reject the

hypothesis that Treasury bills are not a direct source of utility. Yet, Mehra

and Prescott (1985) show that the riskiness of equities is not sufficient to

explain their high expected rate of return relative to T-bills. They use a

utility function like (7), imposing =1 so liquidity services play no role.

There are two ways of reconciling Mehra and Prescott's findings with ours.

First, it may be impossible to capture the rate of return dominance of equit+es

over 1—bills in our utility-based framework. For example, the correct model for

the utility services from T-bills may be different from (7). Second, the

rate-of-return dominance puzzle may only have arisen because they misspecificied

the aggregate utility function by excluding liquidity services.

    Our results also provide estimates of the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution, a, which has been the focus of many previous studies in the

representative consumer framework. Earlier estimates range between -.8 and

-6.0. Our estimates are at the edge of this range; they vary between -6.2 and
                                     -14-



-5.6. Moreover, they are estimated quite precisely with standard errors of

about .60.16 Our estimates of the discount factor, p. all exceed unity. This is

a feature common to many empirical papers of this type.17

     Table 2 reports four sets of estimates corresponding to preferences which

incorporate costs of adjusting asset stocks. To allow us to perform hypothesis

tests these estimates are obtained using the same estimates of the residual

covariance matrix as in Table 1. The differences between the J-statistics
                                              2(3) under the null hypothesis
reported here and in Table 1 are distributed x
that adjustment costs are unimportant. The pattern of coefficients

                does not change significantly when adjustment costs are

introduced. More importantly, however, we can never reject at the 95 level the

joint null hypothesis that all of the adjustment cost parameters are zero.

     More generally our results show a very small role for dynamics since lagged

variables appear uncorrelated with our residuals.18 This lack of dynamics is

puzzling in light of the pervasive differencing and quasidifferencing which is

typical in other studies of asset demand. It is possible that these lags in

others' studies capture expectations of returns and future consumption which

enter independently in our formulation.


IV. Comparative Statics

     Our parameter estimates can be used to study the effects of changes in

interest rates and inflation on consumption and asset holdings. To fully

characterize the consumer's responses to random shocks, we would need to find a

closed form solution to the stochastic control problem posed in Section I.

Since such solutions remain intractable, we concentrate on the effects of

various changes in deterministic environments, asking how the representative

consumer would respond to these changes if he maximized (1).

     We   consider both "short-run" and "long-run" comparative statics. The short

run responses are the responses of asset demands at t to changes in interest

rates from t to t+1. We analyze them by neglecting the effect of these changes

on choices after t+1. We also study how the vector of returns is affected by

changes in the supply of assets. Although these are equivalent exercises, the

latter is more useful for policy analysis. Our short run effects are similar in

spirit to those analyzed by Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985). Their

neglect of the effect of changes in interest rates at t on decisions at t+1 is

necessarily incorrect. However, it is likely to be a good approximation since

the changes in subsequent periods are mediated through changes in future wealth.

For consumers with long horizons future wealth is essentially unaffected by

changes -in current decision variables. The long-run responses are derived by

considering steady states with different interest rates. Across different

steady states consumption and asset holdings for a given level of wealth are

different. We study these differences holding lifetime wealth constant.

A.   Short-Run Responses

     We compute two types of short run responses. The first fixes consumption

at t, as well as all future choices.19 This is very much in the spirit of money

demand studies which hold the transactions variable fixed when computing

interest elasticities. The second short-run calculation allows consumption at

t to vary optimally, while fixing all choices in future periods. The implied

consumption responses are similar to those studied by Hansen and Singleton

(1982). However, intertemporal consumption decisions now depend on nominal as

well as real rates since nominal rates affect asset choices which affect the

marginal utility of consumption.

     For a given path of consumption, the demand for the three assets we

consider depends on the three differences between the return on equities and the
                                        —17—


return on the utility—bearing assets. These return differentials are denoted

UM =   rEP/P+l.    U5 =   (rE-rS)P/P+l,   and UG =
                                                     (rE-rG)P/P+l.     In the

short run we allow M, S and G to change in response to the U'S; we calculate the

effects by differentiating (M), (S) and (G).

       Table 3 (Part A) presents the results of this differentiation for our esti-

mates obtained in the specification without costs of adjustment using our first

set of instruments. We report the percent change in the assets held in the

fourth quarter of 1981 when the u's increase by one hundred basis points holding

constant asset stocks and consumption for the first quarter of 1982.20 The first

column can be interpreted as the effect of inflation in a world in which the

Fisher effect describes the behavior of all interest rates. Thus

(l+rE)P/P+l, (1+r5)P/P+1, and (l+r0)P/P1 are unaffected by inflation,
while rEP/P+l increases by approximately the increase in the inflation rate.

Such an increase in inflation reduces money holdings and promotes the use of

other liquid assets. Nonetheless, total liquidity falls substantially.

       The response of money to UM is the closest analogue in our model to "the's

interest elasticity of money demand since, if all nominal interest rates rise by

the same amount, only UM is affected. Indeed we find that our semielasticities

are between .6 and .8. Mankiw and Summers (1984) find similar values using con-

sumption as the transactions variable in an aggregate money demand equation.

The second and third columns of Table 3 (Part A) give the responses to changes

in the return premia of time deposits and 1-bills. As we move from money to

time deposits to T-bills, i.e. towards assets that yield less marginal liquidity

services, the own semielasticity with respect to the return premium increases.

In some sense, these assets are increasingly good substitutes for equity.

       Table 3 (Part B) shows the effect of changes in assets supplied to the

household sector on yield spreads. An increase in liquid asset supplies raises

their yields relative to that on equity. The biggest effect is on the own yield

spread; for example, an increase in money has the biggest depressing effect on

     As a result, increases in household money which the government finances by

buying back government bonds tend to depress UM and therefore nominal rates even

if money is exchanged for bonds on a one-to-one basis. In practice the money

multiplier exceeds one so the effect is even larger.

     Alternative measures of households' short-run responses to rate of return

movements can be obtained by letting consumption at t vary as well. These can

be obtained by differentiating all four first order conditions with respect to

decisions at t and returns from t to t+1. The results of this differentiation

are given in Table 4. The liquid assets respond to the nominal yield spreads in

much the same way they do when consumption is held constant. A one hundred

basis point increase in the real rate has only a mild depressing effect on

consumption due to our high estimate for the coefficient of relative risk

aversion. In turn, precisely because this coefficient is so large, the

reduction in consumption depresses instantaneous utility and raises

substantially the marginal utility provided by the Cobb-Douglas consumption-

liquidity aggregator. This, -in turn, raises the marginal utility of liquidity

and thus promotes a slight increase in liquid assets. Similarly, reductions in

liquid assets which are prompted by increases in the yield spreads lower

instantaneous utility, increasing the marginal utility of consumption. Savings

therefore rise when nominal yield spreads shrink or when inflation falls. This

finding suggests that anti-inflationary policies promote savings.

B. Long—Run Effects

changes in steady-state asset holdings and consumption. Long run elasticities

To find the long-run elasticities we differentiate (M), (G), (S), and (16).

         Table 5 reports the results of this differentiation for our data. We

assume that the consumption and asset holdings of the fourth quarter of 1981 are

steady state values, and that (l+rE)P/Pl remains at 1/p forever. However,

we let the u's jump to new steady state values and we consider the percent

change in C, M, S, and G as a result of a change in u by one hundred basis

points. The calculations show that consumption itself is relatively unaffected

by changes in yield spreads. The results also show that the responses of asset

holdings are basically the same as those in Table 3. Because consumption is

relatively unaffected by changes in yield spreads, there is little difference

between the marginal utility of asset holdings in Tables 3 and 5. Moreover, the

future variation in consumption and asset holdings is of relatively minor conse-

quence. These changes affect the current holdings only to the extent that they

affect the product of the yield spread and the future marginal utility of

consumption. Since the yield spreads are small, even relatively large changes

in the future marginal utility of consumption have only small current effects.

         We can use the first column of Table 5 to compute a measure of the welfare

costs of inflation. This column gives the response of C, S. I and G to

permanent inflation. By multiplying these changes by the marginal utilities of

 these variables we obtain an estimate of the instantaneous loss in utility. We

 then translate this loss in utility into the fall in consumption which would

 have produced the same loss. A one hundred basis point increase in inflation

 would lower utility by the same amount as a 0.4 percent fall in consumption.

 This estimate is insensitive to our choice of pre- or post-tax data.


V.    Conclusions

     We have presented a method of estimating consistent systems of asset demand

equations which permits analysis of a variety of government interventions in

asset markets. While reduced form evidence suggests that these interventions

change aggregate output, it does not clarify the mechanism by which they work.

The need for empirical measures of the effects of open market operations was the

original motivation for the estimation of structural money demand functions,

which were supposed to capture the aggregate LM curve.   However, in the presence

of many assets which are imperfect substitutes, more complete modelling of the

financial sector is needed. Our paper takes a step in that direction.

     Our analysis suffers from several shortcomings. These are primarily limi-

tations of our particular implementation of the assets—in—the—utility function

approach, and not difficulties with the approach in general. First, it is dif-

ficult to maintain that the marginal utility of one liquidity-producing asset is

independent of the holdings of other such assets. Yet, if many assets yield

these services in substitutable forms, the exclusion of some assets from the

analysis may bias conclusions about the importance of other assets.     Eventually,
our approach should therefore be extended to incorporate a broader range of

assets. This will present measurement problems with respect to both asset

stocks and rates of return especially for long term nominal assets, such as
                                     -24-



corporate bonds, with various maturities and risk characteristics.

     A second, and related issue, is that the menu of important assets changes

over time. Financial innovations, like the recent improvements in money-market

mutual funds, allow assets to be repackaged to yield different liquidity

services. Although our approach can in principle address these issues, this has

been left for future research. An important policy issue which our pre-1982

data probably cannot address is the extent to which the new popularity of money

market mutual funds has changed the power of open market operations.

    A third direction for future work concerns the utility flows which assets

provide. We have modelled assets' utility flows as a simple function of

the asset level. While this is similar to the traditional approach to modelling

the demand for consumer durables, recent studies have focused attention on the

actual service flows yielded by these durables. For example, air-conditioners

provide two services: they cool one's house, and they also yield the pleasure

of knowing one's house need never be hot. The former, at least, is subject to

measurement (Hausman, 1979). Similarly, the service flow from a liquid asset

depends on the transactions it simplifies, as well as the help it might have

provided had more transactions taken place. The former might be measurable.

This line of inquiry could potentially reconcile the view that these assets are

held because they give utility with transactions-based models.

 Sidrauski (1967) model is part of most economists' standard tool kit; it has
 been extended by Fischer (1979), Calvo (1979), and Obstfeld (1984,1985).

 2.   An alternative, much less explicit set of transactions cost models is quite
 similar to the assets-in-the-utility function approach. These models assume
 that liquid asset stocks reduce the amount of leisure spent transacting [see
 Saving (1971)]. Models of this type do not fully capture the structure of
 financial transactions costs since they neglect the discrete character of these
 transactions.

3.   This problem has also arisen in previous attempts to construct Divisia
monetary aggregates [see Barnett (1980, 1983)]. With standard nondurable goods,
the rate of growth of a Divisia quantity aggregate equals the inner product of
current expenditure shares and quantity growth rates. The expenditure on
liquidity services (and other durables), however, is unknown at the time the
services are purchased. This raises difficulties for Divisia aggregation which
should be addressed in future work.

4.   If all assets give utility directly, one could redefine Preferences to
exclude the asset which gives the least utility and attribute its utility to
future consumption.

5.    If r0 and     are known at t and there are no other errors, then (EC),
(M), (S) and (G) may be combined to obtain two nonstochastic equations:
au

   t
     — (1+r5.)— = r — — - (l+rG) — = r
               au
                  t
                        au
                          t
                            and
                                au
                                  t
                                              au
                                                 t
                                                        au
                                                        ---
                                                           t
                                                             which can be

combined to yield      -
                           —]rG   =       -         The first of these equations

requires that a consumer cannot raise his utility by reducing his holdings of
money by (l+rGt) dollars in period t, raising his holdings of Treasury bills by
one dollar to ensure that the original plan is still feasible, and consuming the
difference (r0) today. The second equation requires that a similar set of
asset swaps, performed this time with time deposits and money, cannot raise
utility. In practice, only      is known over short periods of time.

6.   Assuming that the theoretical concept of money corresponds to our measure
of liquidity, our utility function is identical to the one used in Fischer
(1979), Calvo (1979), and Obstfeld (1984, 1985).

7.   Chetty (1969) uses a more general functional form in which each asset is
allowed its own y. Since he focuses only on the instantaneous utility function,
he cannot identify the exponent of this CES aggregate.

8.   This may well be the implicit justification for the inclusion of
quasi-differences of assets in Barnett's (1980) utility function.

9.   If it is a matter of physically adjusting one's asset stock the nominal and
not the real magnitude is relevant. However, a better specification would
recognize the automatic changes in money caused by consumption expenditures.

10. With costs of adjustment it is difficult to follow the two-step budgeting
procedure used by Barnett (1980), because the marginal rate of substitution bet-
ween two assets at t depends on the expected levels on assets at t+1 which, in
turn, depend on assets at t.

11. The data for G are drawn from unpublished Federal Reserve Board tabulations
which are not available after 1982:2. We experimented with another measure of
short-term debt, computed as the sum of Treasury bill holdings, open market
paper, and money market mutual fund accounts, and found results similar to those
reported below.

12. We assume perfect loss-offset in the taxation of capital gains. Assuming
that the losses on equity could not have been offset against other taxable
income would induce only minor changes in our rate of return series.

13. Previous calculations of weighted-average marginal tax rates yield
different tax rates on dividends and interest income. In the spirit of the
representative consumer model, we recognize that for any taxpayer the two tax
rates must be equal. We therefore apply the dividend tax rate to all interest
and dividend income.

14. We use the commercial bank savings deposit rate to measure the rate of
return on time deposits.

15. These standard errors overstate the imprecision of our estimates because
they do not recognize that the 5's must lie between 0 and 1.

16. In Obstfeld (1985), a < 0 impies that anticipated disinflation leads to
the kind of capital inflows that have been experienced in the Southern cone,
rather than to capital outflows. In Obstfeld (1984), uniqueness of the
economy's rational expectations equilibrium requires that (1-a) <
condition is always satisfied by our estimates.
                                                                 /(1-).     This


17. The paper by Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985) is one example.

18. Durbin-Watson statistics calculated from our residuals ranged between 1.15
and 1.9. Their statistical properties in our estimation procedure are unknown,
but they may provide some evidence of dynamic misspecification.

19. If one estimates a static system of demand equations based on total
expenditure on liquid assets [as in Barnett (1980)], then one can only obtain
responses to interest rates holding these expenditures on liquidity constant.
This is a less appealing approximation to the consumer's action at t.

20. To actually differentiate these equations we must first modify them to make
them hold without error. To do this we compute the value of the u's which make
(II), (G) and (S) hold exactly. These can be interpreted as the expected returns
which rationalize actual subsequent consumption and asset holdings. Then we use
these u's instead of the actual u's.
