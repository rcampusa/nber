                                              ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the sustainability of large current account imbalances in the era when the Chinese
GDP growth rate and current account/GDP exceed 10%. We investigate the size distribution and the
durability of current account deficits during 1966-2005, and report the results of a simulation that relies
on the adding-up property of global current account balances. Excluding the US, we find that size
does matter: the length of current account deficit spells is negatively related to the relative size of the
countries' GDP. We conclude that the continuation of the fast growth rate of China, while maintaining
its large current account/GPD surpluses, would be constrained by the limited sustainability of the larger
current account deficits/GDP of countries that grow at a much slower rate. Consequently, short of
the emergence of a new "demander of last resort," the Chinese growth path would be challenged by
its own success.

1.    Introduction and overview

       The growing globalization of financial markets has led to a burgeoning debate about the
sustainability and the desirability of global imbalances. While the rush to reform in the early 1990s was
propagated by the hope that external financing would alleviate the scarcity of saving in developing
countries, the record of the last two decades indicates that this has not been the case. Financial
globalization has led to deeper financial diversification, a growing importance of foreign direct
investment, but to no significant increase in the net resources available to finance the growth of
developing countries. Intriguingly, faster growing emerging markets, on average, more than self
financed their growth, running overtime significant current account surpluses.1 Prime examples of this
trend are the East Asian emerging markets, where China accelerated its GDP growth from about 7% at
the end of the 1990s, to more than 10% in recent years, increasing its current account/GDP from about
2% to about 10% during that period, hoarding most of the recent surpluses in the form of international
reserves. The mirror image of the growing current account surplus of China has been the growing
current account deficit of the US, approaching about 7% of the US GDP in 2005.
      The above developments have led to contentious discussions regarding the desirability and
durability of these trends. The rosy view has been that these patterns reflect the superior capacity of the
US to provide financial intermediation relative to that of emerging markets, and the viability of
productive investment opportunities in the US at times when its saving rate has not matched its
investment demand. In these circumstances, the high saving rates of China, exceeding its investment
rates, conveniently finance the US excess demand for funds.2 A Panglossian view linked the Chinese
current account surplus and its hoarding of international reserves to China’s desire to promote export led
growth by undervaluation, where international reserves serve as collateral that secures the continuation
of FDI inflows. Accordingly, these imbalances reflect the differential comparative advantage of the
parties involved, and are consistent with an efficient allocation of global savings, where the

globalization of markets generates mutual gains for China, the US, and other involved parties.3
      A less buoyant interpretation pointed out that the East Asian saving glut has been partially driven
by “investment draught” – the sizable drop of investment there in the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis
of 1997-8. While these events allowed the US to finance its growing current account deficit at a
relatively low cost, it put in motion forces that overtime could destabilize the global economy, especially
if the US would overplay its ability to access cheap global credit. Accordingly, the sustainability of the
recent global imbalances is conditional on the willingness of the US to be the “demander of last resort” -
needed to accommodate the mercantilist drive of China, as well as the willingness of East Asia to hoard
international reserves and to maintain large net saving positions.4
        The purpose of our paper is to point out that, in evaluating the sustainability of recent trends, size
matters. A small country embarking on an export led growth, like China in 1980, can sustain it without
imposing negative ripple effects as long as its relative size remains small. However, the long run
success of the Chinese growth strategy put in motion forces that would curtail the sustainability of a
high GDP growth rate and a large current account surplus path. By now, China has reached a critical
mass of “an elephant running in a China store.” The continuation of the fast growth rate of China, while
maintaining large current account/GPD surpluses, would be conditional on the sustainability of larger
current account deficit/GDP of countries that grow at a much slower rate. We illustrate this point by
investigating the size distribution and the durability of current account deficits, and by a simulation that
relies on the adding-up property of current account balances, which, up to statistical discrepancies,
should sum-up to zero. We find that, with the exception of the US, the duration of spells of current
account deficits depend negatively on the relative size of a country, as measured by its GDP/World GDP.
The simulation suggests that the continuation of the present path of the Chinese GDP growth, exceeding
10% a year while sustaining a current account/GDP of 10 %, would require large increases in the current
account/GDP of large players, like the US.
        The above suggests that, short of the emergence of a new demander of last resort, one would
expect the unwinding of global imbalances in the coming years. This follows the observation that the
US is already facing the “stabilization blues.” The housing market weaknesses represent only one

indicator that, in due course, will reduce consumption and increase saving, curtailing US current account
deficits. Some of the adjustment has started: the current account deficit of the US peaked at about 7% in
the last quarter of 2005, approaching now about 5 %.5 The unwinding of global imbalances may be
facilitated by a gradual shift of China from export led growth, toward a balanced growth of internal
demand, a strategy that may be consistent with the continuation of Chinese employment and GDP
growth [see Feenstra and Hong (2007)]. The unwinding of the current account deficit of the US, the
growing pressure from Europe and the US regarding the Renminbi appreciation, and the greater tacit
protection from the EU and the US may provide a further impetus for Asian countries to switch towards
domestic demand policies.


2.    Implication of global budget constraints
      A fundamental consequence of the global budget constraint is that, up to statistical discrepancies,
the sum of all current account surpluses [ Cu. Aci ] in a common currency adds up to zero:

      (1)    ∑ Cu. Ac
             i
                           i   =0

      This adding up property may also be expressed as a weighted average of current account/GDP
ratios -- the current account/GDP of country i [ Cu. Aci / GDPi ] weighted by the global share of the GDP

of country i ( si = GDPi / ∑ GDPj ) should add up to zero, where all variables are measured in terms of
                                    j


common currency:


                         Cu. Aci
      (1’)       ∑s
                 i
                     i
                         GDPi
                                 = 0; si = GDPi / ∑ GDPj .
                                                  j




This adding up condition has an important implication. Suppose that China would keep its high GDP
growth rate of 10%, while maintaining a current account surplus of 10% for the next twenty years, while
all GDP of all the other countries’ [AOC] grow at their average growth rate during 1990-2005, at about

5
 The speed of this adjustment depends on the lag with which consumers are internalizing changes in their house
equity and in their financial portfolio valuation. The growing fiscal uncertainty in the US and the declining
appetite for US bonds by foreign Central Banks suggests the continuation of the weak dollar until the resolution
of the underlying uncertainties. The sub prime crisis also suggests that the alleged superior intermediation
capacity of the US overstated the evidence.
                                                          5

3%. The global budget constraint implies that this configuration is sustainable only if AOC would
increase overtime their current account deficit as needed, matching the growing global share of China’s
current account surplus. Specifically, denote the AOC and Chinese GDP at time zero by
GDPAOC ,0 and GDPC ,0 , respectively, and the current account/GDP ratio of AOC and China at time t by

cu AOC ,t , cuC ,t , respectively. Under the above assumptions [Chinese and AOC GDP’s growth rates of

10% and 3%, respectively, China will maintain current account surplus/GDP of 10%], (1) implies that


      (2)    0.1GDPC ,0 exp(0.1t ) + cu AOC ,t GDPAOC ,0 exp(0.03t ) = 0

Hence,
                                            GDPC ,0
      (3)    cu AOC ,t = −0.1exp(0.07t )             .
                                           GDPAOC ,0


The current account deficit/GDP of AOC would increase at a rate equal to the difference of China’s and
AOC’s GDP growth rates (0.1 - 0.03=0.07), and is proportionate to the Chinese current account
surplus/GDP ratio (0.1) times the initial relative scale of Chinese to AOC’s GDP ( GDPC ,0 / GDPAOC ,0 ).

Figure 1 projects the future current account deficit/GDP implied by equation (3) under several scenarios
regarding the behavior of AOC. The lowest curve corresponds to the case where, with the exception of
China, all countries will share equally the burden of the adjustment, hence GDPAOC ,0 / GDPWORLD ,0 is

about 0.95 [corresponding to the global GDP share of AOC in 2006, measured in current US dollar]. In
this scenario, the current account deficit/GDP of AOCs will double in ten years, from about 0.55% to
about 1.1%.
      The resultant scenario, however, depends crucially on the relative size of the block of AOC. To
grasp the issues at hand, Table 1 summarizes the average patterns of current account balances across
countries during 1990-2005.6 Note that about half of the global GDP is produced by countries that run
average current account deficits exceeding 0.5% during the last fifteen years. We presume that
countries that run current account surpluses or small deficits (below 0.5% of their GDP) for prolonged
periods do it by choice. Prolonged current account surpluses may reflect a social contract that opposes


6
 Interestingly, less than a quarter of all the countries run on average current account surpluses, yet they accounted
for more than 40% of the global GDP. The combined GDP share of the countries that run an average current
account deficit exceeding 2% was about 40% of the global GDP, and their growth rate about 3%.
                                                                                        6

significant net imports, or supports net export positions. In these circumstances, the adjustment to the
future Chinese current account surplus would be carried by countries whose combined global GDP share
is about 0.5. Specifically, note that a generalization of (3) for the case of a large number of countries is



      (4)   0.1GDPC ,0 exp(0.1t ) + ∑ cui ,t GDPi ,0 exp( gi t ) = 0 ;
                                                i ≠C




where gi is the GDP growth rate of country i. Equation (4) implies that, as long as the countries that run
current account surpluses are not switching to running deficits, aggregating all the countries that run
current account deficits into one block would understate the needed adjustment:



      (4’) 0.1GDPC ,0 exp(0.1t ) +                  ∑
                                                i ≠ C , cui < 0
                                                                  cui ,t GDPi ,0 exp( gi t ) < 0 .



Table 1 indicates that the average growth rate of the block of countries running current account deficits
in 1990-2005 was about 3%, thus


                                                                             GDPC ,0                                                GDPi ,0

The case where the current account adjustment is done by the AOCD block is portrayed in Figure 1 by
the bold curve, which understates the needed adjustment of the deficit block. To start, the average
                                                          7

current account/GDP deficit of the AOC block is about 1.1% [where the block is defined by the
countries that run current prolonged current account deficits, producing about half of the initial global
GDP]. Accommodating Chinese GDP growth and its current account surpluses of 10% would imply
that the current account deficit/GDP of the adjusting block will double within ten years, to about 2.2%.
Yet, as Table 1 illustrates, the GDP share of the countries that run current account/GDP deficits above
2% during the last fifteen years was about 0.38, well below the assumed share of 0.5. If the bulk of the
needed adjustment will be carried by this smaller block, it would imply that their current account
deficit/GDP would approach 3% within ten years, as is portrayed by the top curve in Figure 1.
         To get further insight about key players, we focus now on the distribution of the average current
account/ World GDP, dubbed “cursize,” of 151 countries during 1990-2005. Figure 2 provides the
histogram of “cursize.” Closer inspection of the histogram indicates pronounced asymmetry in the tails
of the size distribution. There are only six countries in the sample whose average current account
deficit exceeded 0.025% of the global GDP (US, UK, Mexico, Australia, Spain and Brazil). Out of
these countries, the US was the dominant “spender of last resort,” being the only country whose cursize
approached -1% of the global GDP (-0.86% to be precise). The US current account deficit/World GDP
dwarfed the deficits of each of the other 5 countries in the group by a factor exceeding 10, and the sum
of the current account deficits/World GDP of the UK, Mexico, Australia, Spain and Brazil was about
third of the US (-0.26% versus -0.86%). For more than half of the sample, 80 countries, their average
current account deficit/World GDP was smaller than 0.0025%. The combined current account deficit of
all these countries was about 0.06%, less than tenth of the US average current account deficit/World
GDP.
          On the flip side of the global current account balances, there were 10 countries whose average
current account surplus exceeded 0.025% of the global GDP. Japan was the only country whose relative
current account surplus approached 0.5% of the global GDP (it was 0.4%), followed by China, with a
relative current account surplus of about fifth of Japan’s (0.085%).7 These calculations, however, are
backward-looking, and thereby they tend to understate the future importance of China. These
considerations also suggest that the continuation of the recent patterns of the Chinese fast GDP growth
while running a large current account/GDP surplus depends critically on the willingness of some large
countries to increase their current account deficit/GDP at a dramatic rate. Figure 3a plots the association
between the average annual current account deficit/ WGDP (avgCAs) and the cumulative current

    The combined sum of the other 8 significant surplus countries was well below that of Japan, totaling 0.35%.

account/WGDP during each spell of deficits, Cum.CAs (= avgCAs*length of the deficit spell). Figure
3b plots the association between avgCA and the sum of Cum.CAs. These graphs are based on the data
of all current account deficit spells from our sample, 1966-2005 (429 episodes). Note the unique role of
the US -- most of the points associated with sizable current cumulative account deficits, exceeding 0.1 %
of World GDP, were run by the US, accounting for more than half of the global cumulative current
account deficits. To gain further insight, we turn now to an empirical analysis of the factors that
determine the duration of sizable current account deficits.


2.1   Duration analysis of current account deficits
        To start, we assembled the data about the duration of current account deficits of all countries,
subject to data availability during 1966-2005 (see data appendix for mote details about the sample). In
order to verify the degree to which size matters, we constructed a variable “Avg.GDPs,” measuring the
average ratio of a country’s GDP to world GDP (WGDP) during the current account deficit episode.
Next, we run life survival regressions (used to account for censoring issues) explaining the duration of
current account deficits on the relative size of a country. The results are reported in Table 2.
Intriguingly, we found that there is a robust negative association between size and the duration of deficits
for all countries excluding the US, but the association weakens considerably for all countries including
the US. These results continue to hold, controlling for the countries’ net external asset position/GDP in
the starting year of a current account episode [Ini.EWN], and the average growth rate of a country’s real
GDP (Avg.GDPg). Interestingly, a higher net external asset position/GDP is associated with shorter
spells of current account deficits, possibly reflecting self insurance and a more conservative management
of demand policies.


2.2     Current account size and GDP growth
        Table 3 reports the association between the current account/GDP and economic growth.
Excluding 5 episodes of small countries experiencing collapsing GDP growth (below – 50%) or very
large current account deficits (exceeding – 70%), we find a robust positive association between
economic growth and current account/GDP.8 Table 4 reports the association between economic growth

  The exclusion of small outliers is done because these countries are too small to impact the path of global
imbalances, which is the focus of our interest. Yet, the pathological patterns of these outliers, some driven by
wars, are strong enough to impact the significance of some of the coefficients in our regressions.

and current account/GDP, reporting a similar positive association. These tables validate the finding that
faster growth is associated, on average, with higher current account/GDP. The tables also suggest the
possibility of a two-way feedback between growth and the current account. As we are not dealing with
the direction of causality, we focus on the positive implications of these results regarding the
sustainability of Chinese high growth while maintaining a high current account surplus. These findings
reinforce the challenge posed by the growing current account surplus run by high growing countries, as
they would require overtime higher current account/GDP deficits run by slower growing countries,
deficits that tend to be unattainable for most. Thus, short of the emergence of “new demander of last
resort” replacing the US, the Chinese growth path would be challenged by the limited appetite for
prolonged current account deficits of most countries.



3.      Concluding remarks
        The results reported in the paper are consistent with the notion that, with the exception of the US,
larger countries run shorter spells of current account deficits. It suggests that even after the collapse of
the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. enjoyed global economic hegemony, enabling it to run large and
long spells of current account deficits. Yet, as was frequently suggested by critics of the US policy in
recent years, the gains from economic hegemony would be eroded if the leading country overplays its
privileged position. Arguably, this explained the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and may
explain the future unwinding of the recent patterns of global imbalances.

Note: 1. Numbers in parenthesis are standard errors in OLS regression. , and stand for 10%, 5% and 1%
         significant level respectively.
      2. GDP per capita is measured by 10,000 US dollar (base year=2000)
      3. Small countries means population smaller than 0.5 million or GDP size is smaller than 0.01% of WGDP.
      4. All regressions exclude 5 outliers associated with small countries, whose current account/GDP was below
         – 70%, or GDP growth rate was below – 50% (Kuwait 1991, Equatorial Guinea 1995, 1996; Rwanda 1994,
         and Kiribati 1980)
