                                          ABSTRACT

Charging full requirements customers for distribution network services using the traditional cents
per kilowatt-hour (KWh) price creates economic incentives for consumers to invest in distributed
generation technologies, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics, despite the fact that marginal cost of
grid-supplied electricity is lower. This paper first assesses the economic efficiency properties of
this approach to transmission and distribution network pricing and whether current approach to
distribution network pricing implies that full-requirement customers cross-subsidize distributed
solar customers. Using data on quarterly residential distribution network prices and distributed
solar installations from California’s three largest investor-owned utilities I find that larger
amounts of distributed solar capacity and more geographically concentrated solar capacity predict
higher distribution network prices and average distribution network costs. This result continues
to hold even after controlling for average distribution network costs for the utility, Using these
econometric model estimates, I find that 2/3 of the increase in residential distribution network
prices for each of the three utilities between 2003 and 2016 can attributed to the growth
distributed solar capacity. The paper then investigates the extent of the legal obligation that
distributed solar generation customers have to pay for sunk costs of investments in the
transmission and distribution networks. The paper closes with a description of an alternative
approach to distribution network pricing that is likely to increase the economic signals for
efficient electricity consumption and the incentive for cost effective installation of distributed
solar generation capacity.

1. Introduction

       The falling cost of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and generous solar

support mechanisms in many states have led to a rapid increase in the amount of solar capacity

installed by residential customers in these regions. The retail price a household pays for the

last unit of grid-supplied electricity consumed is another important driver of the decision to

install a rooftop solar system because it is the cost avoided from consuming a kilowatt-hour

(KWh) from the distributed solar system. This retail price is typically significantly above the

marginal cost of providing that KWh, because historically state regulators set the average

retail electricity price equal to the vertically-integrated utility’s average total cost of

generating, transmitting, distributing, and retailing electricity.

       In regions of the United States with formal wholesale electricity markets, such as

the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the PJM Interconnection, the New

England ISO, and New York ISO, state public utilities commissions (PUCs) continue to

recover the vast majority of the costs of the transmission and distribution networks and the

cost of serving regulated retail customers through per unit charges that are substantially larger

than the marginal cost of providing these services. The resulting retail prices for grid-supplied

electricity increase the attractiveness of installing a rooftop solar system.

       A number of PUCs have further increased the magnitude of the difference between

the retail price for the last unit consumed and the marginal cost of supplying this KWh for

high-demand users by charging retail customers according to increasing block price

schedules. For example, the three largest investor-owned utilities in California all charge

residential consumers according to steeply increasing block price schedules. Borenstein

(2015) argues that for Pacific Gas and Electric—the utility with the largest number of

distributed solar residential customers in the United States—the financial incentive to
                                                  3
adopt distributed solar during his sample period is due as much to California’s increasing

block rates as it is to the 30 percent federal tax credit for a distributed solar installation.

        In the language of interconnection pricing, retail electricity prices that recover fixed

and sunk costs through a per unit KWh charge encourage inefficient bypass in the sense that

residential customers find it privately profitable to install a distributed solar system because

the levelized cost (net of the government support received by the household) of electricity

from their distributed solar system is less than the retail price, but not less than the marginal

cost (to the consumer) of an additional KWh of grid-supplied electricity. Consequently,

although it is privately profitable for the consumer to install the distributed solar system

(ignoring the cost of the government support provided to the household to purchase the

solar system), it is socially inefficient for this investment to occur because it is cheaper

to supply this customer with wholesale energy from the grid rather than pay for the cost of

the distributed solar system. In the former vertically-integrated geographic monopoly regime,

this approach to retail pricing did not lead to inefficient bypass because customers effectively

only had the choice to consume grid-supplied electricity or not consume grid-supplied

electricity. The option to install a distributed solar system was not available.

        Retail electricity prices that recover fixed and sunk costs on a per KWh basis when

customers have the option to install distributed solar capacity has created what many

electric utilities argue is an unsustainable dynamic where high marginal prices for grid-

supplied electricity encourage customers to install distributed solar PV systems, which then

requires the regulator to set higher retail prices to recover the same fixed and sunk costs

from a smaller volume of sales of grid-supplied electricity. This higher retail price

encourages more customers to install distributed solar PV systems, which then requires

higher retail prices if the utility is going to recover these sunk and fixed costs.
                                                   4
            The significantly larger monthly bills for grid-suppled electricity by distributed solar

 customers under the existing retail tariffs before versus after they install a rooftop solar system

 have caused many utilities to claim that these customers are cross-subsidized by full-

 requirements customers. This is often referred to as a “cost-shift” from the utility’s

 distributed solar customers to its full requirements customers. Solar installers often counter

 these claims by arguing that distributed solar installations allow utilities to reduce their

 distribution network costs because a declining share of the electricity households consume is

 supplied from the grid. Solar installers also claim that this fact implies rooftop solar customers

 make much less use of the distribution grid and should therefore pay for less of the fixed and

 sunk costs. Utilities counter that they made sunk investments in the distribution grid to serve

 all customers and should therefore receive full cost recovery from all customers. There is an

 ongoing debate to resolve these issues in a number of states with significant distributed solar

 potential such as Arizona, California and Nevada.

            This paper contributes to this debate by providing: (1) a theoretical foundation to

 address the cost-shift debate, (2) empirical evidence on the claims made by utilities and solar

 installers about the impact of solar installations on distribution network costs and prices, (3)

 description of the legal risks these issues create for utilities, and (4) a framework for more

 efficient pricing to recover to the costs of the transmission and distribution network.1

            The economic theory of multi-product cost functions is used to argue that full-

 requirements customers are unlikely to be cross-subsidizing customers with distributed

 solar systems even under the existing tariffs for grid-supplied electricity because the vast



        1
          Throughout the paper, distribution network cost refers to the fixed and variable cost of the distribution
network, or in the language of the regulatory process, the distribution network revenue requirement as determined
by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Distribution network price is the price set by the CPUC to
recover the distribution network revenue requirement.
                                                          5
majority of distribution network costs are sunk. The major source of economic inefficiency

from the existing transmission and distribution-pricing scheme is that it encourages

inefficient levels of the electricity consumption and the inefficient decisions by consumers

to bypass grid-supplied electricity.

        I then examine the empirical validity of the claim that distributed solar installations

reduce distribution network costs using panel data on quarterly utility-level residential

distribution network prices, utility-level quarterly installed distribution network-level solar PV

capacity, annual utility-level distribution network regulated costs (revenue requirements), and

annual utility-level electricity demand for California’s three large investor-owned utilities. I

estimate an econometric model of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)

distribution network price-setting process to quantify the extent to which increases in solar PV

capacity in a utility’s distribution network predict higher residential distribution network prices.

        I find that even after the accounting for the mechanical effect that more distributed solar

PV capacity reduces the total withdrawals of grid-supplied electricity and therefore requires an

increase the residential distribution price, more solar capacity in the distribution network

predicts significantly higher distribution network prices. I find that the vast majority of the

almost 100 percent increase in average residential distribution network prices between 2003

and 2017 for each of the three utilities can be explained by increases in the installation of

distributed solar PV capacity. I then repeat this analysis using the annual distribution network

regulated average cost for each utility as the dependent variable and find that increases in the

amount distributed solar capacity in the utility’s service territory predicts a higher average

distribution network cost for the utility. Combing this residential distribution price data with

the annual distribution network average cost data, I find that residential distribution network

prices are higher in utility distribution networks with more solar capacity even after controlling
                                                  6
the annual average cost of the distribution network. These results are exactly counter to the

claims of solar PV suppliers about the impact of solar PV installations on distribution costs and

prices. Moreover, they are consistent with state regulators placing a greater share of the burden

of the recovery of the fixed cost of the distribution network on residential consumers in utility

service territories with more distributed solar capacity.

       I then consider the legal question of whether utilities will be allowed to recover the

costs of the transmission and distribution network from distributed solar PV customers that

claim not to use these networks at all or as much as they did before installing rooftop solar

capacity. Resolution of this legal question is particularly urgent for utilities experiencing rapid

growth in the amount of distributed solar capacity given the relationship I find between

distribution network prices and costs and amount of solar PV capacity installed in that utility’s

distribution network. There are legal precedents in favor both sides of this debate, which

provides a strong case for these utilities addressing this issue with their public utilities

commissions as soon as possible.

       Finally, I develop a simple economic model that provides a mechanism for increasing

the efficiency of distribution network pricing and reduces the incentive for both inefficient

consumption of grid-supplied electricity and inefficient decisions to install distributed solar

systems. This model is first applied to the case that customers have interval meters capable

of recording their consumption on an hourly basis. I then consider an extension to the case

that customers have meters that can only read their monthly consumption. The paper closes

with a brief discussion of how the insights from this simple model can be operationalized

in an actual regulatory price-setting process to improve the efficiency of retail electricity

pricing in regions with significant distributed solar resources.



                                                  7
    2. The Theory of Multi-Output Production Applied to Electric Utility Costing

           To understand of the inefficiency of the existing approach to retail electricity pricing

    and to provide essential input into the model used to derive more efficient of retail

    tariffs, I rely on the economic concept of a multiproduct cost function, C(q1,q2….,qN), where

    qk is the amount of electricity withdrawn from the grid by customer k and N is the total

    number of customers served. For each value of (q1,q2….,qN)′, the N-dimensional vector of

    the monthly consumption of each customer served by the utility, the function C(q1,q2….,qN)

    gives the utility’s total cost of providing this vector of outputs. Under the regularity conditions

    on the utility’s technology set described in Panzar (1989) this function is differentiable in all

    of the arguments.2

          The marginal cost of providing customer k with an additional KWh of grid-supplied

electricity is the increase in the value of C(q1,q2….,qN) associated with a one unit change in qk

keeping the output levels of all other customers constant. Mathematically, the marginal cost

                                                                                       భ   మ   ಿ
of serving customer k at output vector (q1,q2….,qN)ꞌ is equal to                                   . During virtually all
                                                                                           ೖ


hours of the year, this marginal cost is slightly higher than the hourly wholesale price at the point

of withdrawal from the transmission grid that connects that customer to their distribution grid.

The cost is higher than the wholesale price because of distribution network losses between

the point of injection to the customer’s distribution network and the customer’s dwelling where

the energy is consumed.3 However, during hours when the capacity constraints on the

distribution network are close to binding, the marginal cost of customer k withdrawing an

technologically feasible to produce from the input vector x.
3
  According to the United States Energy Information Administration annual transmission and distribution network losses average
about 6 percent of the total electricity produced nationally. (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3)

                                                                8
additional KWh can be substantially larger than the relevant hourly locational marginal price

of wholesale electricity. In addition, because marginal losses scale with the square of the flow

on the distribution line, the marginal loss factor for customer k is larger the greater is the flow

on the distribution line to that customer.

         The next cost concept is the incremental cost of qk, which is equal to difference

 between the value of C(q1,q2….,qN) and the value of C(q1,q2….,qk-1,0,qk+1,…,qN), or the

 amount that total costs are reduced as a result not selling anything to customer k.

 Mathematically, this is equal to IC(qk|Q-k) = C(q1,q2….,qN) – C(q1,q2….,qk-1,0,qk+1,…,qN),

 where Q-k = (q1,q2….,qk-1,qk+1,…,qN).        Dividing IC(qk|Q-k) by qk yields the average

 incremental cost of qk, AIC(qk|Q-k) = IC(qk|Q-k)/qk, which is also small, because the fixed

 costs of the installed generation capacity, transmission and distribution grid, metering and

 billing systems must be incurred to serve the remaining customers. Therefore, these costs

 are not eliminated by setting customer k’s consumption to zero. One reason for the

 difference between the marginal cost of qk and AIC(qk|Q-k) is the existence of fixed costs

 associated with providing service to customer k, such as the cost to connect the customer

 to the grid (although most of these costs are directly charged to the customer at the time they

 connect) and the monthly fixed cost of metering and billing the customer. If the marginal

 cost of serving customer k varies with the value of the qk then the marginal cost of serving

 customer k at output level qk given Q-k can differ from AIC(qk|Q-k). For the reasons discussed

 above, it is extremely unlikely that the incremental cost of providing qk units of electricity

 exceeds customer k’s monthly bill, even if customer k has a distributed solar system.

         The final cost concept is the stand-alone cost of qk. This is equal to SAC(qk) =

 C(0,0….,0,qk,0,…,0), which is equal to the total cost of providing qk units to just customer k

 and nothing to all other customers. Dividing SAC(qk) by qk yields the stand-alone average cost

                                                  9
of qk which much greater than average incremental cost of qk, because the stand-alone

average cost contains all of the fixed costs of the generation, transmission, distribution, and

retailing segments as well as the monthly fixed cost of providing service to customer k.

       It is profitable for the utility to serve a customer if the incremental cost of serving that

customer is less than the revenue the firm earns by providing service to that customer.

Because of the substantial fixed costs of providing grid-supplied electricity to any customer,

such as the sunk cost of the transmission and distribution network, it is possible for a utility

to find it unilaterally profitable to serve each of its customers, but not earn sufficient

revenues to cover its total costs. Specifically, given its existing tariff and existing vector

of monthly outputs, (q1,q2….,qN)′, the utility could find itself in the position of wanting to

continue to provide service to each of its customers, even though the total revenues received

from these customers is considerably less than the total cost of producing this vector of

outputs.

       As Faulhaber (1975) explains, as long as all groups of customers are paying more in

revenues for their consumption than the incremental cost of serving that group of consumers

and none of the groups of customers are paying more than the stand-alone cost of serving that

group of customers, there are no cross-subsidies between customers. The first constraint

implies that all possible groups of customers are making a nonzero contribution to the fixed cost

recovery of the firm. The second constraint implies that each of the possible subsets of

customers do not have an incentive to start their own firm to supply the service instead of taking

service from the incumbent monopoly. Under a vector of prices that satisfies these constraints,

the utility may not recover enough revenues from all of its customers to cover its total

production costs. However, if the prices charged to each customer are such that firm recovers

its total revenues from supplying these customers, then the revenues earned by the firm selling

                                                 10
from sales to each of the possible groups of customers is greater than the incremental cost of

supplying this group of customers.

       To apply these concepts to retail electricity pricing, consider the case of a utility that

was formerly recovering its total cost of production that now has a number of customers

install distributed solar systems. Under the existing tariff these distributed solar customers

are still paying more in revenue to the utility than the incremental cost of providing them

with this reduced amount of grid-supplied electricity. However, because their consumption

of grid-supplied electricity has fallen they are making less of a contribution to fixed cost

recovery than they were as full-requirement customers.

       This logic implies that it is highly unlikely that distributed solar customers are

receiving cross-subsidies from full-requirements customers in the sense of Faulhaber (1975).

Clearly, distributed solar customers are now making less of a contribution to fixed cost

recovery as a result of their decision to incur the expense of investing in distributed solar

capacity under the existing retail tariff.   The fixed-cost recovery problem created by a

customer investing in a distributed solar system is no different from the fixed-cost

recovery problem created by a customer reducing their monthly consumption of grid-

supplied electricity as a result of an energy efficiency investment or simply becoming more

aware of their electricity consumption. In all of these cases, the utility is still recovering at

least the incremental cost of serving these customers under the existing tariff, but the

customer’s total contribution to fixed cost recovery is lower.

       Although cross-subsidies between full-requirements and distributed solar customer

are very unlikely to exist under the current retail pricing regime, as Faulhaber (1975)

notes, a subsidy-free price structure is not necessarily welfare maximizing. As discussed

earlier, the existing pricing regime create incentives for inefficient consumption of electricity
                                                 11
and inefficient bypass of grid-supplied electricity because the prices a customer pays for grid

supplied electricity so far above the marginal cost of grid supplied electricity (excluding

unpriced environmental externalities).

3. Impact of Solar Installations on Distribution Networks Prices and Costs

       This section assesses the impact of increases in distributed solar capacity in a utility

service territory on residential distribution network prices and regulated distribution network

costs using data from the three large investor-owned utilities in California—Pacific Gas and

Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas and Electric

(SDG&E). This assessment is based on a simple model of the CPUC distribution network price-

setting process.

3.1.    Economic Model of CPUC Price-Setting Process

       The CPUC process first determines the revenue requirement for the utility based on a

test year output level. The revenue requirement is the utility’s annual costs that the CPUC

allows the utility to recover from its customers through the prices charged. The other input to

the price-setting process is the test year output level, which is a forecast of the utility’s annual

demand during the time period covered by the price. The utility’s revenue requirement divided

by this forecast of demand gives the average price the utility is allowed to charge.

       The utility’s annual revenue requirement can and often does change several times within

the year in response to regulatory decisions made by the CPUC. When this occurs, the CPUC

will change the price the utility is allow to charge. Each time a price set by the CPUC is changed,

a new tariff sheet is issued by the CPUC giving this price and the date that it becomes effective.

       I model the residential distribution network price-setting process as follows. Let Fiy

equal the revenue requirement for the residential sector for utility i in year y and QRFiy equal

the forecast of demand for utility i and year y for the residential sector. Because prices can be
                                                  12
 revised numerous time during the year, I assume that the quarterly value of the utility’s annual

 residential distribution network revenue requirement is equal to FRiq = (FRiy )exp(εiq), where εiq

 is unobserved shock to utility i’s annual revenue requirement in quarter q. I assume that the εiq

 are independent, identically distributed random variables with finite first and second moments

 for each utility.

         According to this simple model, utility i’s residential distribution price in quarter q, is

 equal to PRiq = (FRiy )exp(εiq)/QRFiy. Taking logarithms of both sides of this equation yields:

                                    ln(PRiq) = ln(FRiy) - ln(QRFiy) + εiq                         (1)

To assess the impact of the amount distributed solar capacity in utility i’s service territory on

residential distribution network prices, I create the following variables. Let CIiq equal the

cumulative megawatts (MWs) of distributed solar installed in utility i’s territory as of the start of

                                       ೥೜
quarter q. Define CONCiq =                  , where CIzq is the cumulative MWs of distributed solar
                                        ೥


capacity installed in zip code z of utility i’s service territory as of the start of quarter q, HHz is

the number of households in zip code z in utility i’s service territory, and Z(i) is the number of

zip codes in utility i’s service territory. CONCiq is larger for given number of MWs in utility i’s

service territory if these MWs are concentrated in a small number of zip codes. To estimate the

impact of solar installations in the utility’s service territory and the geographic concentration of

these solar installations on distribution prices, I estimate the following equation:

                     ln(PRiq) = αiy + βln(QRFiy) + δln(CIiq) + γln(CIiq)ln(CONCiq) + ηiq,         (2)

where the αiy are utility-year fixed effects and the ηiq are assumed to be independent, identically

distributed mean zero and variance          random variables. Operationalizing this model requires

an estimate of QRFiy, the forecast of utility i’s residential demand during year i.




                                                     13
        For each of the utility’s I estimate a univariate time series model using QRiy, the annual

residential demand for utility i and year y, using data from 1990 to 2016 and then use the one-

step ahead forecast of Qiy as the value of QFiy. For each utility, the model ln(Qiy) = μi + ln(Qiy-1)

+ υiy is sufficient to produce a time series model such that the null hypothesis that the υiy are a

white noise sequence cannot be rejected. I then compute QRFiy = (QRiy-1)exp( +                    , where

   is the estimate of μi and        is the estimate of the variance of υiy constructed the residuals of

this regression.

        This simple model for the distribution network price setting process has a number of

testable restrictions and implications for the parameters of equation (2). First restricting equation

(2) to satisfy the theory in equation (1), implies β = -1, δ = 0, and γ = 0. In addition,

(FRyi)E(exp(εiq)) = exp(αyi)E(exp(ηiq)), which implies that FRyi = exp(αyi)E(exp(ηiq))/E(exp(εiq)),

so that exp(αyi) estimates FRyi up to an unknown scale factor, E(exp(ηiq))/E(exp(εiq)).

        The second model I estimate relates the logarithm of the annual average revenue

requirement of utility i and year y to ln(QFiy) and ln(CIiy) and ln(CIiy)ln(CONCiy). QFiy, the

forecast of utility i’s demand in year y, is computed from Qiy, the total demand of utility i in year

y, following the same procedure as described above to derive QRFiy from QRiy. To compute the

annual average distribution revenue requirement for utility i in year y, let RRiy equal the annual

distribution revenue requirement for utility i in year y. Define ARiy = RRiy/QFiy as the annual

average distribution revenue requirement for utility i in year y. I estimate

                     ln(ARiy) = λi + τy + βln(QFiy) + δln(CIiy) + γln(CIiy)ln(CONCiy) + ηiq,           (3)

where CIiy equals the cumulative megawatts (MWs) of distributed solar installed in utility i’s

territory as of the start of year y, λi is a utility fixed effect, and τy is a year-of-sample fixed effect.

                    ೥೤
CONCiy =                 , where CIzy is the cumulative MWs of distributed solar installed in zip code

z of utility i’s service territory as of the start of year y. This model assesses whether the utility

i’s average regulated distribution cost is responsive to changes in installed solar capacity and the

distribution of this capacity in its service territory.

        The final model I estimate assesses whether increases in installed solar capacity predict

increases in residential distribution prices after controlling for the level of the annual average

utility-level revenue requirement. I estimate the equation:

                    ln(PRiq) = αi + φln(ARiy) + δln(CIiq) + γln(CIiq)ln(CONCiq) + ηiq,            (4)

where the αi are utility fixed effects.     If δ > 0 and γ > 0, then residential distribution prices

increase in response to more distributed solar capacity in the utility’s service territory and if this

solar capacity is more geographically concentrated in the zip codes in the utility’s service

territory even after controlling for the utility’s average distribution network revenue requirement.

 3.2.     Data Sources

        The data used to estimate these models comes from variety of sources. The tariffs sheet

 for the three investor-owned utilities are the source for the quarterly value of the residential

 distribution price. This is the distribution price for the standard residential tariff: (1) the E-1

 Tariff for Pacific Gas and Electric, (2) the Schedule D Tariff for Southern California Edison,

 and (3) the Schedule DR Tariff for San Diego Gas and Electric. These prices often change

 several times during the year.

        For each utility and each quarter between quarter 1 of 2003 to quarter 4 to 2016, the

 residential distribution network tariff that was in force at the start of the quarter according to

 the tariff document is assigned to that quarter of the sample. For much of this sample period

 the residential distribution network for each utility was priced according to an increasing block

 price schedule. These increasing block price schedules are converted to a single weighted

 average residential distribution price for the quarter using the climate-region-weighted tier
                                                     15
weights for each investor-owned utility computed in Table A2 of Borenstein (2011). For each

utility residential distribution tariff, I apply the climate region weighted average weight for

consumption on that tier times the value of the distribution price for that tier and sum these

products over all tiers in the increasing block distribution network price schedule to arrive at

quarterly residential distribution price, Piq.

          The annual demand in gigawatt-hours (GWh) for electricity by residential consumers of

investor-owned utility i in year y, QRiy, and the aggregate demand in (GWh) served by this

utility in the same year, Qiy, from 1990 to 2016 are available from the California Energy

Consumption Database.4 Figures 1 to 3 plot the values from Qiy for Pacific Gas and Electricity,

Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric, respectively. Plots for three

utilities share several common features. First, steady load growth between 1990 and 1998, with

a drop in 1998 and 1999 and a substantial uptick in 2000 consistent with a loss of customers to

direct access in 1998 and 1999 and subsequent return of these customers during electricity crisis

in 2000. The other feature is the significant slowdown in load growth from 2006 onward,

consistent with the start of the California Solar Initiative which provided more than $2 billion

in declining dollar-per-kilowatt-installed subsidies for rooftop solar systems between 2006 and

2016. The plots of QRiy for each utility have these same patterns.

      The quarterly values of cumulative MWs of distributed solar capacity installed in each

zip code of each utility service territory are available from the Currently Interconnected Data

Set from the Go Solar California web-site.5 This data is used to construct the CIiq and CIiy

variables. Figure 4 plots the values of CIiq for each utility from quarter 1 2003 to quarter 4 of

2016. Although it is difficult determine from Figure 4, there is small amount of distributed

 solar capacity in each utility‘s service territory as on the start of the sample period. Data on the

 number of households in each California zip code, HHz, is obtained from the 2010 US Census.

 This data is combined with the Go Solar California data to construct the CONCiq and CONCiy

 variables.

        The annual total distribution network revenue requirement for utility i in year y, RRiy,

 from 2006 to 2016 is available from Table 1.6 of the California Electric and Gas Utility Cost

 Report: Public Utilities Code Section 913 Annual Report to the Governor and Legislature

 available from the CPUC. Before that date, information on the annual distribution network

 revenue requirement for each utility is available from CPUC Advice Letters that summarize the

 periodic changes in the distribution network revenue requirements and distribution network

 prices.

 3.3.      Empirical Results

           The empirical results are based on quarterly data from 2003 to 2016 and annual data

 from 2006 to 2016. The start date for the quarterly data was chosen to coincide the start of the

 California’s renewable energy effort. The state’s renewables portfolio standard (RPS) started

 in 2003, and this also initiated widespread discussion of distributed solar PV capacity as a source

 of electricity for residential consumers. The start date for the annual revenue requirement data

 coincided with the start of the California Solar Initiative noted above. However, the primary

 driver of this start date was the difficulty in obtaining data before this data.

        Table 1 reports the results of estimating

                                  ln(QRiy) = μi + ln(QRiy-1) + υiy

for each utility using annual data from 1990 to 2016. The ordinary least squares estimate of μi

and the estimated standard error for this parameter estimate are reported for each utility along

with the estimated value of the variance of υiy. For all three utilities, the null hypothesis that μi
                                                    17
= 0 cannot be rejected. Each column of the table also reports the value of the Box-Pierce Q-

statistic that tests the null hypothesis that the υiy are not autocorrelated up to lag J=11 and J=6.

In all cases the P-value associated with this test statistic is substantially less than 0.05, which

implies that 0.05 size test of this null hypothesis would not be rejected.     Table 2 reports the

results of repeating this same procedure for utility-level demand, Qiy.

       Table 3 presents the results of estimating

                 ln(PRiq) = αiy + βln(QFiy) + δln(CIiq) + γln(CIiq)ln(CONCiq) + ηiq.            (2’)

A number of results are worth noting. First, a 0.05 test of the null hypothesis that β = -1 cannot

be rejected. Second, the estimates of δ and γ are both positive and large relative to their standard

error. This result is consistent with residential distribution prices increasing faster in utility

service territories and after quarters with more cumulative solar MWs and more concentrated

deployment of these distributed solar MWs.

       Figures 5 to 7 plot the normalized values of the annual residential distribution network

cost FPiy = exp(αiy)/exp(αiy*) for y* = 2006 implied by our model of residential distribution

network pricing for each utility.   These values of FPiy are plotted along with the normalized

value of the annual distribution revenue requirement for each utility RRiy/RRiy* for y* = 2006.

The trends in these two annual time series for each utility are remarkably similar, except for

Pacific Gas and Electric from 2011 to 2014, which provide further support for the validity of our

model of the regulatory price-setting process.

       Table 4 presents the results of estimating

                 ln(ARiy) = λi + τy + βln(QFiy) + δln(CIiy) + γln(CIiy)ln(CONCiy) + ηiq,        (3’)

 using annual data from 2006 to 2016. Once again, the estimate of β is not statistically different

 from -1 and δ and γ are both positive. The estimate of δ is significantly smaller in magnitude

 than the corresponding the estimate from equation (1) and the estimate of γ is not statistically
                                                    18
 different from zero. Nevertheless, these results indicate that after controlling for year-of-sample

 and utility fixed-effects, higher levels of cumulative MWs of solar installs are associated with

 higher average utility-level distribution costs.

       Table 5 reports the results of estimating

                   ln(Piq) = αi + φln(ARiy) + δln(CIiq) + γln(CIiq)ln(CONCiq) + ηiq,            (4’)

 The estimates of δ and γ are both positive. The estimate of δ is smaller in magnitude than the

 corresponding the estimate from equation (1) and the estimate of γ is not statistically different

 from zero. Nevertheless, this result implies that even after controlling for the regulated average

 cost of the distribution network, increases in solar installations implies higher distribution

 network prices.

       The regression results for models (2), (3) and (4) suggest the following conclusions about

the impact of distributed solar installations on both distribution network costs and residential

distribution network prices. First, the results of estimating model (2) support the conclusion that

more solar installations lead to higher residential distribution prices and even higher residential

distribution network prices for utilities where these solar installations are more geographically

concentrated.    Second, the model (3) results imply that the same conclusion applies to the

average utility-wide regulated distribution cost, but the magnitude of these effects are smaller

and they are less precisely estimated. This result could be due to the smaller sample of annual

data used to estimate this regression. Third, the model (4) results support the conclusion that

after controlling for the level of the average regulated distribution network cost, more solar

installations and a greater geographic concentration of these installations leads to higher

residential distribution prices. The above results are consistent with more solar installations

increasing total distribution network costs. They are also are consistent with the view that the



                                                    19
amount of these costs that the CPUC allocates to residential customers also increases with the

amount of distributed solar capacity.

       The results of estimating our model of the residential distribution network price-setting

process embodied in equation (2) can be used to compute a counterfactual distribution network

price path that keeps the amount of distribution solar capacity at the quarter 1 of 2003 level. This

counterfactual price can be computed by multiplying each quarterly residential distribution

network price by exp(- δln(CIiq/CIiq*) – γ[ln(CIiq)ln(CONCiq) - ln(CIiq*)ln(CONCiq*)]) for q*

equal to quarter 1 of 2003 using the values of δ and γ obtained from estimating equation (2). For

each of the three utilities, Figures 8 to 10 plot the actual average quarterly distribution network

price and the counterfactual quarterly distribution network price that removes the impact of

distributed solar capacity installed after quarter 1 of 2003. For each utility, roughly 2/3 of the

average distribution network price increase between quarter 1 of 2003 and quarter 4 of 2016 can

be attributed to the adoption of distributed solar capacity.

 4. Legal Case for Utility to Recover Sunk Costs

         There are a variety of reasons why a regulated utility that invests in the long-lived

 capital equipment necessary to provide service to consumers may not recover these sunk

 costs. Hempling (2015) provides seven examples of a regulated entity that was denied sunk

 cost recovery by the courts. Several of these legal decisions appear to be applicable to

 case of distributed solar investments.

         All of these decisions are related to the basic legal principle in regulatory rate-

 making that a utility is only allowed the opportunity to recover its costs if the capital employed

 is “used and useful” and the “prudently operated.” The utility is not guaranteed to recover

 these costs without regard to these two conditions.



                                                   20
             The standard argument used by the utilities to justify their claims of cost recovery

    is the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution which states in part, “[N]or shall private property

    be taken for public use, without just compensation.” Hempling (2015) notes that Justice

    Brandeis clarified what this clause meant for a regulated utility as, “The thing devoted by the

    investor to the public use is not specific property, tangible and intangible, but capital embarked

    in the enterprise. Upon the capital so invested the Federal Constitution guarantees to the utility

    the opportunity to earn a fair return.” (p. 2)

             Hempling (2015) goes on to emphasize that the courts have determined that

    “utility investors enjoy no constitutional guarantee of stranded cost recovery.” (p. 2).

    Consequently, one way to justify that the utility’s shareholders bearing the brunt of the

    revenue shortfalls relative to total costs of production is that competition from distributed

    solar has led to the partial obsolescence of the transmission and distribution grid, which has

    significantly reduced the revenues the utility is likely to earn from grid-supplied electricity.

    Therefore, the utility’s investors now own a less valuable asset in the same sense that the

    owners of the Market Street Railway in San Francisco that operated streetcars and buses in

    the city owned a less valuable asset as a result of competition from municipal transportation

    companies and other modes of transportation.6 The court upheld the Railway Commission’s

    decision to set a lower price for Market Street Railway’s services, which in turn produced a

    lower rate of return on its sunk costs. Hempling (2015) notes that “the Court explained that

    the Constitution has no sympathy for a company whose services are no longer needed.”

             Building on this decision, an argument for full cost recovery would be that the

    intermittent nature of distribution solar generation is sufficiently great that the full capacity

                                                                21
of the existing transmission and distribution grid is necessary to serve both distributed

solar and full requirements customers. Specifically, it is sometimes the case that the

distributed solar systems     are not producing any electricity and the transmission and

distribution grid is utilized at the same rate as would be the case in the absence of any

distributed solar investments. However, the argument that transmission and distribution

networks have the same annual peak utilization rates as they did without any distributed

solar investments may be increasingly difficult to make as the share of distributed solar

capacity increases and the diversity of distributed solar locations increases.

        These opposing arguments suggest that the ultimate allocation of the sunk costs of the

transmission and distribution grid will involve some of these costs being recovered from

utility shareholders. The above logic also suggests that the longer this regulatory decision

is delayed the greater is the likelihood that more of these sunk costs will be recovered from

utility shareholders, because more households are installing distributed solar systems over

time.    Moreover, as the results in Section 3 demonstrate, the longer utilities that are

experiencing significant increases in distributed solar capacity delay the resolution of this

question the larger are the distribution network costs at risk for under-recovery.

5. Toward More Efficient Retail Tariff Design

        This section presents a simple economic model that suggests several pathways for

increasing the efficiency of retail electricity pricing. I first consider the case that customers

have meters that can record their consumption on an hourly basis in order to match the

frequency that the marginal cost of retail electricity changes. Then I consider the case that

customers only have mechanical meters that are typically read on a monthly basis.

        Let C(h) equal the marginal cost of retail electricity facing the customer during hour

of the year h, for h=1,2,…,H, where H is the total number of hours in the year. Under all but
                                                 22
 extreme system conditions, to a first approximation, C(h) is equal to the hourly wholesale price

 at the customer’s distribution network location times one plus the marginal distribution loss

 factor for delivery to the customer’s premises. Let the customer’s hourly demand curve for

 electricity be Q(h) = A(h) – P(h)/θ(h), where Q(h) is the customer’s demand in hour h, P(h)

 is the customer’s marginal price in hour h, and A(h) is the customer’s willingness to pay

 for the first unit of consumption in hour h, or alternatively the customer’s demand for

 electricity at P(h) = 0, and θ(h) is the slope of the customer’s inverse demand curve during hour

 h, i.e., − θ(h) = dP/dQ.

        Suppose that C(h), A (h), and θ(h) are random variables with compact support and

 joint density, f(C,A,θ). The support of C(h) is [CL,CH] and [AL,AH] where 0 < CL < CH < ∞,

 0 < AL < AH < ∞, and AL > CH. The last inequality imposes the reasonable assumption that

 it is socially optimal for the customer to always consume a positive quantity of electricity

 during every hour of the year. Assume that θ(h) also has compact support, [θL,θH], where 0

 < θL < θH < ∞.

        Economically efficient pricing implies that the hourly retail price of electricity should

 be set equal to the hourly marginal cost of grid supplied electricity, so that P(h) = C(h).

 Using the logic of two-part tariff pricing, the maximum fixed charge that the consumer would

 be willing to pay for grid-supplied electricity during this hour is area below the demand

 curve above the hourly price, C(h). This is the shaded area in Figure 11 and is equal

 ½θ(h)(A(h) – C(h)/θ(h))2.

       Suppose that before setting the fixed charge for the year or month, the regulator only

knows that the realizations of (A(h),C(h),θ(h))′ for all hours of the year are independent,

identically distributed draws from f(C,A,θ). Figure 12 shows the value of hourly consumer

surplus (CS) for the extreme case that A(h) = AL and C(h) = P(h) = CH. The hourly value of

                                                  23
consumer surplus is extremely small, which implies a small maximum hourly fixed fee. Figure

13 shows the other extreme of A(h) = AH and C(h) = P(h) = CL, and the hourly value of

consumer surplus is extremely large, which allows a very large hourly fixed fee.

         Suppose that the consumer is risk neutral with respect to his electricity expenditures and

 will remain connected to the grid for the year if the expected annual fixed charge is less than

 the expected value of the annual consumer surplus obtained from consuming at P(h) = C(h) each

 hour of the year. Note that ½θ(h)(A(h) – C(h)/θ(h))2 can be written as ½θ(h)*(Q(h))2 where

 Q(h) is the quantity demanded during hour h. Taking the expectation of ½θ(h)*(Q(h))2 yields

            Expected Hourly Willingness to Pay = ½ [ Cov(θ(h),Q(h)2) + E(θ(h))E(Q(h)2)]. (5)

 This results implies that customers with an hourly demand that is positively correlated with the

 absolute value of the slope of their hourly inverse demand curve, customers with a large

 expected value of the slope of their hourly demand curve and customers with a large expected

 value of the square of their demand (or equivalently a large variance and mean of their demand)

 have the largest willingness to pay to purchase their electricity each hour at a price equal to

 C(h).

         Assuming θ(h) = 1 for hours of the year, there is an even more straightforward way to

 compute each customer’s annual fixed charge:

          Expected Hourly Willingness to Pay = ½ [E(Q(h)2)] = ½[Var(Q(h)) + (E(Q(h))2]. (6)

 If FRRiy is the fixed cost component of the distribution network revenue requirement, the CPUC

 could use historical hourly data for the past year to compute

   Estimated Expected Hourly WTP for customer k = EEHWTP(k) =

 where customer k’s consumption in hour h of the previous year is Q(h,k). The annual fixed

 charge for customer k of utility i for year y is then equal to


                                                   24
                                                         ೔೤       ೖ
                                          F(k,i,y) =   ಼              .                         (7)
                                                       ೖసభ        ೖ


This fixed charge could be equally divided across months of the year or tailored to the

customer’s monthly demand throughout the year. Each time the CPUC updates the revenue

requirement, it could also update F(k,i,y) for each customer. Each year it could also update

EEHWTP(k) for each customer.

      This approach to assigning fixed cost recovery should not differ between distributed solar

and full requirements customers, because it accounts for both the benefits and costs a distributed

solar installation provides to the customer.     Specifically, distributed solar would allow the

customer to have a low value for E(Q(h)), its average hourly consumption. However, it is likely

that a distributed solar customer would have a significantly larger value of Var(Q(h)) than a full

requirements customer with the same value of E(Q(h)) because of the intermittency in

distributed solar energy production.     By this logic, it is unclear if a customer would have a

larger value of F(k,i,y) as a full requirements or distributed solar customer. However, because

the distribution network pricing mechanism allows the customer to withdraw electricity from

the grid at hourly marginal cost, it would eliminate the incentive for inefficient bypass of the

grid-supplied electricity at an unsubsidized price for a distributed solar installation. It would

also provide a strong incentive for distributed solar customers to install storage devices to reduce

the variance of their hourly withdraws from the grid and thereby reduce their annual fixed

charge.

          The expression for the EEHWTP can also be broken down according to the moments of

the joint distribution of A(h) and C(h) as:

    EEHWTP = ½ [Var(A(h)) – 2(Cov(A(h),C(h))) + Var(C(h))] + [E(A(h)) - E(C(h))]2.




                                                  25
This implies that customers with a large variance in their hourly baseline (zero price) demands

and a large variance in the hourly marginal cost of grid-supplied electric have a higher WTP pay

to purchase grid-supplied electricity at C(h). One reason for a higher variance in the marginal

cost of grid-supplied electricity is that during some hours the customer’s consumption of

electricity results in binding constraints in the distribution network, which produces an extremely

large marginal distribution loss factor for their deliveries of grid-supplied energy. Customers

with a larger expected consumption, E(Q(h)) = [E(A(h)) – E(C(h))] also have a higher expected

willingness to pay. Customers with demands that are more highly correlated with the marginal

cost of grid supplied electricity have a lower willingness to pay. Because higher wholesale

prices tend to occur during high system demand periods, one interpretation of this result

is that customers whose demands are more highly correlated with the system demand have a

lower willingness to pay to consume at C(h).

         The above discussion has focused on the case of customers with interval meters that can

 record their consumption on an hourly basis. For the case that the customer only has a

 mechanical meter, suppose the customer can only be charged a price for their consumption

 each hour of the year equal to the expected marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity, E(C(h)).

 Under these conditions, the hourly value of the consumer’s willingness to pay is equal to

 ½(A(h) – E[C(h)])2. By the above logic:

          Expected Hourly WTP = ½ E((Q(h)2) = ½ [Var(A(h)) + [E(A(h) – E(C(h))]2.               (8)

 However, because hourly data is not available for customers without interval meters, other

 methods must be employed to proxy for the variables used to compute an estimate of the

 Expected Hourly WTP for each customer. An approach similar to load profiling can be used

 to compute this estimate for each customer. Specifically, for a test sample of customers with

 interval meters which are typically used to compute hourly load profiles, the CPUC can

                                                  26
compute values of EEHWTP(k) for these customers and then have an algorithm for assigning

values of EEHWTP(k) to each customer based on this algorithm based on observable

characteristics of the customer and then this value of EEHWTP(k) can be used to compute

F(k,i,y) for that customer.

       This model also helps illustrates the inefficiency of pricing mechanisms such as a

monthly demand charge that assesses on $/KW charge on a customer’s peak demand during

the month. Unless the hour the demand charge is assessed coincides with the hour when

the marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity is highest, there is no economic efficiency

reason for charging a customer a higher price during the hour in the month that its

demand is highest. Depending on a customer’s pattern of demand throughout the month, the

customer could incur a demand charge which significantly increases the customer’s marginal

price of electricity when the marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity is extremely low.

Consequently, there is no economic efficiency rationale for a demand charge, if the customer’s

hourly demands are uncorrelated with the hourly marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity.

There is, however, a limited efficiency argument for demand charges if customer’s hourly

demands are positively correlated with the marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity, but

this argument can be easily refuted if the hourly marginal price of electricity is set equal

to marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity.

6. Concluding Comments

       If current technological and social trends continue, the share of United States

electricity consumption provided by distributed solar generation capacity is likely to continue

to increase. According to our distribution network pricing model parameter estimates, this will

lead to increasing distribution network costs and prices to residential customers. If current

residential distribution network tariffs remain in place, utilities will find it increasingly
                                                 27
difficult to recover the costs of their distribution networks, even if the revenues they receive

from supplying distributed solar and full-requirements customers exceeds the incremental

cost to both customers. Moreover, the legal precedents for the recovery of sunk investments

by regulated entities imply that electric utilities would be well-served to seek a resolution to

the cost recovery issue as soon as possible.     Further delay will increase these distribution

network costs (as more customers install distribution solar systems) and increase the

likelihood that a greater share of these sunk costs must be recovered from utility shareholders.

          For customers with interval meters, which is the vast majority of customers in

regions     with significant solar resources such as California and Arizona, there is a

straightforward approach to increasing the economic efficiency of retail electricity pricing

and reducing the incentive for inefficient bypass of grid-supplied electricity. If the hourly

retail price were set equal to the hourly marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity,

then the remainder of the utility's costs to be recovered could be obtained through

customer-specific monthly charges that depend on the expected value of the square of the

household’s hourly consumption. Setting default retail electricity prices in this manner would

also provide strong incentives for customers to install on-site storage devices and other

mechanisms for shifting their consumption away from high-priced hours.
