Young people with private health insurance sometimes transition to the public health insurance safety
net after they get sick, but popular sources of cross-sectional data obscure how frequently these transitions
occur. We use longitudinal data on almost all hospital visits in New York from 1995 to 2011. We show
that young privately insured individuals with diagnoses that require more hospital visits in subsequent
years are more likely to transition to public insurance. If we ignore the longitudinal transitions in our
data, we obscure over 80% of the value of public health insurance to the young and privately insured.

1   Introduction

The current private health insurance system does not offer full long-term protection against financial
risk, with most contracts lasting for only one year. If a young privately insured person gets a very
severe illness in a given year, his private health insurance generally protects him against large
financial losses in that year. However, he could lose private coverage in subsequent years for a
variety of reasons. For example, he could face a lifetime limit on benefits, he could become so
sick that he loses his job and his employer-sponsored coverage, or his premiums could increase so
much that he can no longer afford to pay them. Several economists have acknowledged that the
private health insurance system does not offer long-term financial protection for the nonelderly, and
they have proposed approaches to address it through the design and regulation of private health
insurance contracts (see Cochrane (1995) and Pauly et al. (1995)). In this paper, we consider public
health insurance as an alternative approach to fill gaps in the current system. We focus on how
public health insurance acts as a “safety net” that reduces financial risk for individuals who start
out young and privately insured.
    Previous literature has not quantified how many young privately insured individuals transition
to public health insurance over periods of several years, and it has not quantified the value of
public insurance for this population. Instead, the literature focuses on the value of the safety net
to individuals who have already been “caught” by it (see Barcellos and Jacobson (2014), Khwaja
(2010), Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) on Medicare; Engelhardt and Gruber (2011) on Medicare
Part D; and recent work by Finkelstein et al. (2014) on Medicaid). These papers compare individuals
with public insurance to those without public insurance. However, they do not consider that even
individuals who are not covered by public insurance might value their potential access to it in the
future. This limitation arises in part because the literature generally only uses cross-sectional data.
    The main contribution of our paper is that we use longitudinal data on almost all hospital visits
in the state of New York from 1995 to 2011 to inform the value of public health insurance as a
safety net for the young and privately insured. Using our longitudinal data, we examine transitions
in hospital spending and health insurance among young individuals with private health insurance.
We show that individuals with diagnoses that require multiple future hospital visits have costs that
are highly correlated over time, and they are more likely to gain public health insurance. This
descriptive analysis provides motivation for the value of public health insurance to the young and
privately insured. Then, using our data as the main input, we estimate the value of public health
insurance to this population. We find that we miss over 80 percent of the value of insurance if we do
not take longitudinal transitions into account. Even when longitudinal data are available but the
panel length is short and the sample size is small, as in the widely-used Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey (MEPS), standard calculations continue to miss most of the value of insurance. Intuitively,
small datasets with short panel lengths offer limited information about observations in the tails of
the distribution, which drive the value of insurance.
    Our insights on the value of insurance complement those in other literatures that examine costs
associated with expansions in public health insurance. In their seminal paper, Cutler and Gruber


                                                  2
(1996), estimate the extent to which expansions in public health insurance “crowd out” private health
insurance at the time of public health insurance expansions. However, their data do not allow them
to measure “crowd out” that occurs years, sometimes decades, later. Furthermore, their paper and
many papers that build on it generally cast “crowd out” in a negative light. Similarly, a large
theoretical and empirical literature shows that the public health insurance safety net could depress
saving (see Hubbard et al. (1995), Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006) and De Nardi et al. (2010)). From
an individual’s perspective, these savings reductions may reflect the value of the potential “crowd
out” of private health insurance that we estimate.
    In Section 2, we present stylized facts from our data that motivate the value of public health
insurance to the young and privately insured. In Section 3 we discuss the framework that has been
used in the literature to estimate the value of health insurance, and we extend it to incorporate
several periods. In Section 4, we discuss how we incorporate all of the individual-level longitudinal
profiles observed in our data into our empirical framework. In Section 5, we present results from our
framework, and we compare the value of health insurance obtained using longitudinal data to the
value that would be obtained with cross-sectional data. We discuss the implications of our results
and conclude in Section 6.


2   Stylized Facts

We present stylized facts that rely on the longitudinal nature of our data to motivate the value
of public health insurance as a safety net for the young and privately insured. Our main data
are restricted use data from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS),
which contain data on almost all inpatient discharges in the state of New York from 1995 to 2011.
We supplement these data with data from other sources to construct a balanced panel designed to
represent all individuals in the state of New York from 1995 to 2011. We focus on individuals who
were ages 25-34 in 1995 to isolate young but working-age individuals. We further restrict our sample
to individuals with private insurance in 1995; thus, our main “private-in-1995" sample consists of
young individuals for whom public health insurance has value only as a potential safety net. In our
initial analysis, we also exclude individuals who subsequently go uninsured because their exclusion
simplifies the value of the public health insurance safety net and helps to build intuition. However,
we include individuals who subsequently go uninsured in our preferred results. We provide further
details on our data in Appendix A.
    Using our data, we want to follow those individuals who are likely drive the value of the public
health insurance safety net: individuals with persistent medical costs across multiple years. We
perform a simple exercise to isolate those individuals. For individuals with at least one hospital
visit in 1995, we determine the primary diagnosis for their most costly hospital visit. We then
calculate the number of subsequent years for which visitors with that diagnosis in 1995 appear in
the sample. We prefer a count of the number of subsequent years instead of the subsequent number
of years with a given diagnosis in case some diagnoses manifest themselves as other diagnoses over
time. We rank diagnoses according to this metric and classify diagnoses in the top 3% of this ranking


                                                 3
as “persistent DX” using 3 digit codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). We
then group individuals whose primary 1995 diagnosis is a “persistent DX” into the category “1995
Visit, Persistent DX.” We group all other individuals with a 1995 hospital visit into the category
“1995 Visit, Other DX.” 1
       Table 1 lists the most common persistent diagnoses in our sample. The full set includes over 90
diagnoses, but the table depicts only those for which there are 30 or more individuals in our data
with a 1995 diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease is the diagnosis for which we observe the highest
rate of return to the hospital in subsequent years. In the 16 subsequent years we observe through
2011, among the individuals in our data with a primary diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in 1995,
the average number of subsequent years with hospital visits through 2011 is 4.9. Other diagnoses,
such as hereditary anemia and cystic fibrosis, also portend a high number of subsequent years of
hospital visits. These visits do not all occur in the years immediately following 1995, so five years
of panel data would not capture all of them. Figure 1 follows various outcomes for individuals with
persistent diagnoses and all other diagnoses longitudinally over the entire length of our panel.

        Probability of Inpatient Visit                                The subfigure in the upper left of Figure 1 verifies that we
have mechanically selected persistent diagnoses for which a large percentage of individuals show up
in the hospital in subsequent years. Together, the persistent diagnosis and other diagnosis categories
include all individuals in our sample who visit the hospital in 1995. Although individuals must have
a hospital visit in 1995 to be classified into either diagnosis category, individuals with persistent
diagnoses are much more likely to have hospital visits in subsequent years. Among individuals
with persistent diagnoses, 24.3% have a subsequent visit the following year in 1996, 12.6% have a
subsequent visit five years later in 2001, and 8.4% have a subsequent visit in 2011, the final year of
our data. As shown in the dashed line, the rate of subsequent visits is lower for individuals with
other diagnoses.2

        Inpatient Costs                            Since our framework for valuing public health insurance will be based on
costs and not visits, we verify that the visit patterns that we observe in each group translate
  2
    The spike in the “1995 Visit, Other DX” category in 1997 is due to second pregnancies. This spike disappears
when we exclude deliveries and other pregnancy-related diagnoses from the data.




                                                                                  5
into similar patterns for costs.3 In the bottom left subfigure, we show mean inpatient costs after
imposing a $30,000 maximum to annual costs.4 As shown, the cost patterns do mirror the visit
patterns. Cumulative mean costs are $58,656 for individuals with persistent diagnoses and $12,672
for individuals with other diagnoses.

       Probability of Public Insurance           All of the individuals in our sample begin with private
health insurance in 1995, so the probability of having public health insurance must weakly increase
relative to 1995 for all groups, as individuals switch to having public coverage. The top right
subfigure of Figure 1 shows that individuals with persistent diagnoses are much more likely than
individuals with other diagnoses to switch to public health insurance in subsequent years. Roughly
17.9% of individuals with persistent diagnoses in 1995 have public coverage by 2011, as compared
to approximately 3.7% of individuals with other diagnoses.

       Public Insurance Inpatient Costs             In the final subfigure of Figure 1, having shown that
individuals with persistent diagnoses have higher average costs and a higher probability of switching
to public coverage than individuals with less persistent diagnoses, we show that these individuals also
have higher average costs paid for by public insurance in each year. Across the entire time period,
cumulative mean public insurance inpatient costs are $3,750 in the entire sample. Cumulative mean
public costs are $20,098 for individuals with persistent diagnoses and $1,560 for individuals with
other diagnoses. This subfigure is on the same scale as the subfigure beside it that depicts total
inpatient costs, emphasizing that individuals who are privately insured in 1995 but appear at the
hospital with a diagnosis that will result in persistent medical costs in future years end up having
a large share of their future bills paid by public health insurance.

  These stylized facts motivate the value of public health insurance as a safety net. Few other data
sources could produce stylized facts like these because few other data sources track the medical
spending and insurance coverage of nonelderly individuals over periods of greater than 10 years.
Even those few sources that do follow the same individuals for more than 10 years do not capture
the transitions from private to public coverage necessary to elucidate the longitudinal value of
public health insurance to the privately insured. For example, claims data from firms often track
individuals for many years, but these data only track individuals if they remain covered through
the same firm. Thus, individual coverage transitions are unobservable in these sources of firm data,
likely eliminating data on precisely those individuals with the highest realized valuations of the
public health insurance safety net. Similarly, Medicare claims data follow individuals longitudinally
for many years, but only when they are covered by public health insurance, leading crucial coverage
transitions to be unobservable. The widely-used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) follows
nonelderly individuals longitudinally, but only for 2.5 years. Using the framework for valuing health
   3
     We observe hospital list prices rather than costs in our data, but we use the standard practice to deflate list
prices into costs, as we discuss in Appendix A.
   4
     We report average costs over all individuals in each cohort — even those who have died.

insurance that we develop below and our 17-year-long panel of data, we show that 2.5 year is not
long enough to capture the vast majority of the longitudinal value of the public health insurance
safety net to the young and privately insured.


3       Framework for Valuing Public Health Insurance as a Safety Net for the Privately
        Insured

To determine an individual’s willingness to pay for health insurance, all papers in the literature
use some variant of the following simple indifference condition, which gives expected utility in the
presence of insurance on the left and expected utility in the counterfactual absence of insurance on
the right:

                    N                                   N
                  1 X hPT                i          1 X P T        0
                                                                                
                      u     I
                         t=1 t − cit (M )   − ρ α   =     u     I
                                                             t=1 t − cit (M ) α   .                            (1)
                  N                                   N
                     i=1                                                     i=1

        This equation determines ρ, the value that an individual is willing to pay to retain the world
with health insurance. There are T time periods t and N individuals i, each of whom has an
actual out of pocket cost profile of {cit }Tt=1 in the presence of health insurance and a counterfactual
                                       0
out of pocket cost profile {cit }Tt=1 in the absence of health insurance. To allow for discounts to
the insured and uninsured, costs are bounded above by M in each period. The utility-maximizing
individual knows the distribution of longitudinal cost profiles with certainty; however, she does
not know which realization will be hers (she does not know which i ∈ {1, . . . , N } she will be).
The individual calculates her expected utility according to the utility function u(x|α), under the
assumption that each realization i is equally likely, where α is a risk aversion parameter. All
uncertainty in consumption occurs through uncertainty in out of pocket costs. The term It gives
the individual’s income in period t, and she knows her income profile {It }Tt=1 with certainty. If utility
takes on the constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) functional form, where u(x|α) = 1 − e−αx , It
drops out of the equation,5 and a closed form solution exists for ρ as follows:

                                                            PN         PT     0       !
                                                                   α( t=1 cit (M ))
                                                             i=1 e
                                                      ln    PN α(PT c (M ))
                                                             i=1 e
                                                                      t=1 it
                                                 ρ=                                                            (2)

        As we demonstrate using data, for any nonzero level of risk aversion, this framework can yield
drastically different values for the willingness pay to avoid the world without health insurance,
ρ, depending on whether the actual cost profiles are obtained from cross-sectional or longitudinal

data. To perform the comparison, we compare three special cases of ρ, as shown in Table 2. We
first characterize the risk-neutral value of insurance. Next, given nonzero risk aversion, we compare
the cross-sectional value of insurance to the longitudinal value of insurance.

   Risk-neutral Value of Insurance, λ First, consider the special case in which agents are
not risk averse. In this special case, as we show, it does not matter if the cost profiles are derived
from cross-sectional or longitudinal data. All of the other parameters in Equation 2, M , T , and N
can take on their full range of values for discounts, time periods, and sample sizes, respectively. We
refer to the resulting value of ρ as λ. Taking the limit of Equation 2 as the risk aversion parameter
α approaches zero, the willingness to pay for insurance is simply the difference in average costs
between the world with insurance and the world without insurance:
                                       PN PT         0             PN PT
                                          i=1   t=1 cit (M )        i=1    t=1 cit (M )
                         λ = lim ρ =                           −                          .             (3)
                             α→0                N                          N
   This special case makes intuitive sense. Individuals with no risk aversion only care about the
average cost in the world with health insurance relative to the average cost in the world without
health insurance. In the case where the world with health insurance is a world where all insurance
is public health insurance, for which individuals pay no premium, and the world without health
insurance is a world with the same cost distribution but no health insurance, λ is simply aver-
age spending covered by public health insurance. In this special case, agents value public health
insurance simply because it is a transfer; not because it protects them from risk.

   Cross-sectional Value of Insurance, φ Next, consider the case where agents are risk
averse, so α > 0, and the other parameters M , T , and N take on their full range of values. The
value of health insurance ρ in this special case φ includes a risk premium over and above the risk-
neutral value of insurance λ. Under this scenario, we suppose only cross-sectional data are available.
Thus, in each period t ∈ {1, . . . , T }, an agent draws an index it ∈ {1, . . . , N } and is assigned the
                                                                       0
corresponding costs in that period (cit in the actual world and cit in the counterfactual world), where
each it ∈ {1, . . . , N } is equally likely for each period t. (In the longitudinal case that we consider
next, an agent draws a single index i ∈ {1, . . . , N } and is assigned the corresponding cost profile that
                                                                                                    0
gives actual and counterfactual costs in all T periods — {cit }Tt=1 in the actual world and {cit }Tt=1


                                                         8
in the counterfactual world.) In this cross-sectional case, agents know the distribution of costs with
and without insurance in each period, but they do not know the distribution of longitudinal cost
profiles. Most studies stop here in calculating the value of insurance, using only one period of data
(T = t = 1).

   Longitudinal Value of Insurance, γ           For the general case in which we have longitudinal
data that allow costs to be correlated across multiple periods, we refer to the resulting value of ρ
as γ. Fixing the distribution of costs in the worlds with and without insurance in each period, if
costs are not correlated at all over time, then γ will be equal to φ. However, if costs are correlated
over time, then γ will likely be much larger than φ. Intuitively, the risk that agents face is greater
if cost shocks are correlated over multiple periods; therefore, willingness to pay for insurance will
be greater if cost shocks are correlated over multiple periods.
   The size of the longitudinal value of insurance γ relative to the cross-sectional value of insurance
φ is the main empirical question that we seek to answer in this paper. Specifically, we are interested
in how large the full value of insurance is when we take into account the correlation of shocks over
time, relative to how large it is when we do not take into account the correlation of shocks over
time. We parameterize this concept in the following ratio:

                                               γ−φ
                                                   ,
                                                γ

holding M , T , and N constant. This ratio gives the fraction of the value of insurance that is
unaccounted for if we do not use longitudinal data.
   The main contribution of this paper is in the use of the longitudinal data. However, the gen-
eralization of the simple framework to incorporate longitudinal data advances the literature in a
subtle but critical way. Consider the related simple framework employed by Handel, Hendel, and
Whinston (2013) who use longitudinal data to examine the tradeoff between adverse selection and
reclassification risk. In their framework, assuming CARA utility, the following indifference condition
determines the willingness to pay for insurance, µ:

                      N T                           N T
                    1 XX                          1 XX         0
                          u(I − cit (M ) − µ|α) =       u(I − cit (M )|α).                         (4)
                    N                             N
                       i=1 t=1                           i=1 t=1

   Relative to the framework that we use in Equation 1, utility is additively separable across
time (both summation terms are outside of the utility function), and income I does not vary with
time. We demonstrate that in our data used as repeated cross-sections, for a plausible range of the
risk aversion parameter α, the cross-sectional value of insurance from our framework φ is almost
exactly the same as the alternative cross-sectional value of insurance µ given by the alternative
framework in Equation 4. (They are not exactly the same because our framework is a nonlinear
utility function of the expectation over time, and the alternative framework is the expectation over
time of a nonlinear utility function.) However, with longitudinal data, both frameworks give very
different values because the framework given by Equation 4 does not allow risk to be correlated over


                                                  9
time. In each period, under Equation 4, agents effectively take an independent draw from the cost
distribution in that period, such that longitudinal data yields the same value of µ as repeated cross-
sectional data. (To see this, note that in this framework, taking expected utility across time and
then across individuals is mathematically equivalent to taking expected utility across individuals
and then across time). Thus, it is crucial to our analysis that we use a framework such as the
framework given by Equation 1, which allows longitudinal data to yield different estimates from
cross-sectional data.


4   Empirical Implementation of Framework for Valuing Public Health Insurance as a
    Safety Net for the Privately Insured

We develop an empirical implementation of the framework introduced in Equation 1 to estimate
the value of public health insurance using our data. Table 2 shows the data and parameters that we
need to solve for each of the special cases of the value of health insurance ρ via Equation 2. We begin
by specifying the actual out of pocket cost profile {kit }Tt=1 for every individual i in our data. To do
so, we first obtain to the total (beneficiary plus insurer) cost profile {cit }Tt=1 for each individual i
from the data, with corresponding coverage information. In each period t, an individual i can be
privately insured, which we denote with the dummy variable rit ; publicly insured by the “safety net,”
which we denote with the dummy variable sit ; or uninsured, which occurs when (1 − rit − sit ) = 1.
Because our data contain no information on out of pocket costs, we translate total costs cit into out
of pocket costs kit via a simple formula:


                             cit = rit ∗ πt + (1 − rit − sit ) ∗ min (kit , M )                      (5)

    As shown by the formula in Equation 5, we assume that out of pocket costs are equal to zero for
publicly insured individuals; costs are equal to the premium, πt , for privately insured individuals;
and as shown, the premium is equal to the average cost of the privately insured after discounts.
For uninsured individuals, costs are equal to the minimum of the total cost kit and the maximum
cost before discounts M . In our main sample, there are no uninsured individuals, so Equation 5
simplifies to cit = rit ∗ πt , but we retain the full notation for use with data that include uninsured
individuals.
    For every individual i in our data, we also need to specify the counterfactual out of pocket cost
profile {c0it }Tt=1 that would occur were the public health insurance safety net dismantled. It would not
be realistic to assume that all individuals with public health insurance would go uninsured, especially
since we focus on individuals who begin with private health insurance in 1995. It is likely that only
some of them would go uninsured, while others would gain private health insurance. To consider
this more realistic case, which does not artificially inflate the value of public health insurance, we

                                                    10
use a logit model to predict which individuals would go uninsured and which individuals would
obtain private health insurance upon the dissolution of the safety net. The logit model gives us
                                                      0
a probability of private health insurance rit for each person i in each period t.6 Accordingly, we
define the cost profile for individual i in the world without the public health insurance safety net,

    Private health insurance premiums in this counterfactual world πt reflect the average costs of
individuals enrolled. We assume no moral hazard, so that costs before discounts, kit , are the same in
both the world with public health insurance and the world without. This assumption is motivated
by data limitations, but it is likely to be a reasonable assumption for inpatient care.
                                                                                 0
    Next, we derive “cross-sectional” cost profiles {cit }Tt=1 and {cit }Tt=1 from our longitudinal data.
                                                                    0
In each period t, we randomly draw costs cit and cit (with their associated insurance types) from
the observed and counterfactual distributions, respectively. This procedure removes all longitudinal
elements from each individual’s cost profile in the worlds with and without public health insurance.
Importantly, it also ensures that average costs paid by public health insurance are exactly the same
in the cross-sectional and longitudinal profiles such that the risk neutral value of insurance is the
same for both profiles.
    One additional consideration is whether individuals have private information about the set of
cost profiles from which they will draw. In our baseline scenario, since we have already restricted
our sample to individuals who are young and privately insured, we assume that individuals have
no private information that would further narrow the distribution of cost profiles that they expect.
Each individual knows the full distribution of cost profiles, and she believes at the time that the
value of insurance is calculated that she is equally likely to realize any of them. To incorporate
private information, we can allow individuals to consider themselves a part of a smaller group Gj
within the population N , of size Nj , and they expect only the cost profiles within that group. For
example, individuals can expect only the cost profiles of women. When calculating the value of
insurance, we obtain a separate willingness to pay for health insurance ρj for each group, according
the following modified indifference condition:

                 1 X hPT             i            1 X PT     0
                                                                          
                    u   t=1 −cit (M )   − ρ j α   =    u  t=1 −cit (M ) α   .                                  (7)
                 Nj                                 Nj
                     i∈Gj                                               i∈Gj

    In this scenario, we still assume that the premiums are calculated based on the full population
  6
    Our model makes predictions based on the age, sex, race, ethnicity, and county of individuals who appear in the
SPARCS data. In periods in which an individual does not appear in the data, we apply the probabilities from the
most recent year in which she did appear.


                                                               11
— private information affects the willingness to pay for insurance but not its actual cost.7 Private
information is valuable insofar as it predicts cost. We consider the robustness of our results to an
extreme form of private information - private information that the individual will have a hospital
visit in the first year of the sample that will require a great deal of subsequent treatment, putting
the individual into the “1995 Visit, Persistent DX" category considered in Section 2. We show that
even this extreme form of private information does not alter our main results. Therefore, in our
baseline scenario, facing the common issue that it is difficult to know what private information
individuals have (see Abaluck and Gruber (2011) and Handel (2013)), we assume that individuals
have no private information but that they know the full distribution.
    We also assume that individuals know that they could die during the period. They know that
if they die, they will not incur any hospital costs and that they will not pay any more premiums.
By 2011, approximately 2.5% of individuals in our sample are deceased. In practice, this is a small
enough share of the sample that alternative treatments of death have little impact on the results.
    Finally, to estimate the three special cases of the value of public health insurance ρ described
in Table 2, following Equation 1, we need to specify values of the parameters for the risk aversion
parameter, α, the number of time periods T , maximum costs before discounts M , and the number of
individuals in the pool N . For each of these parameters, we report results for a wide range of values,
rather than relying on a single calibrated value. We are particularly interested in the robustness
of (γ − φ)/γ, the value of public insurance accounting for the correlation of health costs over time,
relative to the value of public insurance without accounting for the correlation of health costs over
time.


5   Results and Robustness

We begin by calculating the risk-neutral value of insurance λ, given baseline parameter values:
maximum annual costs M = $30, 000; the number of years T = 17 (the full number of years in our
sample), and N = 1, 689, 078 (the full number of individuals in the our sample). The risk-neutral
value of insurance, which sets α = 0 following Table 2, is $2,633, which is equal to the average costs
paid by public insurance over the time period, as discussed in Section 2.
    The longitudinal and cross-sectional values of insurance include this amount plus a risk premium,
which depends on the risk aversion parameter α. We specify a baseline value of α = 0.0002,
and we examine robustness from 0 (the risk neutral case) to 0.0004, which is the median risk
parameter estimated by Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2013).8 As shown in Figure 2, at α = 0,
the longitudinal value of insurance is equal to the risk-neutral value of insurance, average public
   7
     Changing the premiums such that they only reflect individuals in each private information group would not be
realistic because it would require individuals in each group to pool only with each other. Community rating laws in
New York state would have hindered such pooling during our period of interest.
   8
     Since Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2013) focus on annual costs and utility, rather than combined costs and
utility over a 17 year period, the costs in that paper are much smaller than the cumulative costs that we consider.
The appropriate magnitudes of α are inversely related to the magnitudes of the losses in question. Since we are
dealing with very large losses relative to Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2013), 0.0004 should be a reasonable upper
bound.

costs. As risk aversion increases, the longitudinal value of insurance increases smoothly from $4,580
at α = 0.0001 to $42,794 at our baseline value α = 0.0002 to $64,349 at α = 0.0003 to $75,612 at
the maximum that we consider α = 0.0004. At our baseline value, the representative individual is
willing to pay $42,794 to retain the public health insurance safety net before uncertainty is realized.

   To give more context to our baseline estimate, we compare it to the cross-sectional value of
insurance φ obtained with the same baseline parameter values. Figure 4 shows how the cross-
sectional value of insurance φ varies with the risk aversion parameter. It varies from $2,633 when
α = 0 (the risk neutral case) to $2,865 at our baseline value of α = 0.0002 to $3,795 at our maximum
value of α = 0.0004. For comparison, we also report the cross-sectional value of insurance µ obtained
via Equation 4. As shown, the values are almost identical over the entire range with µ = $2, 847
at our baseline value, only $18 less than φ. However, Equation 4 yields the same exact value with
longitudinal data as it does with cross-sectional data. In contrast, in our framework, given by
Equation 1, the longitudinal value of insurance γ = $42, 794 is much larger than the cross-sectional
value of insurance φ = $2, 995. At our baseline value of α, the fraction of the longitudinal value of
health insurance that is not captured by the cross-sectional value of health insurance, (γ − φ)/γ, is
93%.
   Although we have shown that the levels of the cross-sectional and longitudinal value of health
insurance vary considerably with the risk aversion parameter α, the fraction of the longitudinal value
of health insurance that is not captured by the cross-sectional value of health insurance, (γ − φ)/γ,
is much more robust. We focus on this ratio as our main result, and we gauge its robustness to
variation in all aspects of the model. We consider robustness of this ratio to the risk aversion
parameter α, to maximum annual cost M , to the number of years T , and to the sample size N . We
then further consider robustness to private information and to the inclusion of individuals who go

uninsured.

   Robustness to Risk Aversion Parameter, α In each subfigure of Figure 3, we report
the risk neutral value of insurance λ as a fraction of the longitudinal value of insurance γ in the
lightest shade, which is superimposed on the cross-sectional value of insurance φ as a fraction of
the longitudinal value of insurance γ in the darkest shade. The remaining shade at the top reflects
the portion of γ that is not captured in the other two parameters. Along the bottom axis, we vary
the risk aversion parameter α, and we report the corresponding value of the longitudinal value of
insurance γ along the top axis. We emphasize our main ratio of interest at our baseline parameter
values (γ − φ)/γ by reporting the value with overlaid text.
   As shown in the top left subfigure of Figure 3, even though willingness to pay for the public
health insurance safety net continues to grow in absolute terms as the risk aversion parameter α
increases, as soon as α reaches the middle of our range, the portion of the willingness to pay due to
longitudinal risk, (γ − φ)/γ, levels out at around 93% of the total willingness to pay. Therefore, for
a very large range of α, willingness to pay for public insurance that only considers cross-sectional
data severely understates willingness to pay for public insurance.

   Robustness to Maximum Annual Costs, M                   Relative to α, which governs risk aversion,
we expect the other three parameters, M , T , and N to be ancillary parameters. Nonetheless, we
examine whether our results are sensitive to them. The bottom left subfigure 3 shows robustness
to maximum costs after discounts, M . We vary M from $10,000 through our baseline of $30,000 to
$100,000. At the smallest values of M , the longitudinal value of insurance φ and the cross-sectional
value of insurance γ are only a little larger than the risk neutral value of insurance λ. This occurs
because in the absence of extreme values, risk decreases, as does willingness to pay for insurance,
which reflects expected public cost more than it reflects a risk premium. However, starting at about
M = 30, 000, the proportion of willingness to pay due to risk starts to be fairly robust, motivating
our choice of $30,000 as our baseline value of M .
   It is also interesting to note that at high values of M , the cross-sectional value of insurance
reflected in φ/γ becomes larger relative to the risk neutral value of insurance, reflected in λ/γ
because costs in each period have higher variability, even though their mean does not change much.
However, φ/γ and λ/γ are still a small fraction of γ, suggesting that empirically, the longitudinal
value of health insurance γ stems from people with moderate costs who visit the hospital regularly,
rather than by people with high costs and infrequent visits.

   Robustness to Number of Years, T             In the upper right subfigure of Figure 3, we examine
robustness to T , the number of years of data used, starting with 1995, from two years to the full
17 available years. We do not show robustness to one year of data because everyone in our sample
knows that he will have private health insurance in 1995, so the value of public health insurance in
that year is zero. As shown, after about 8 years, our main ratio of interest (γ − φ)/γ is extremely
robust to number of years in the sample. Therefore, we use the full 17 years as our baseline value
of T so that we use as much data as possible.
   However, the results are not very robust to longitudinal data that uses fewer than eight years.
Therefore, estimates of willingness to pay for insurance that use shorter periods of longitudinal data,
such as the MEPS, which follows respondents for 2.5 years, will severely understate willingness to pay
for the public health insurance safety net. Because shorter periods underestimate the importance
of longitudinal risk, the impact of cross-sectional risk on the willingness to pay for public health
insurance becomes more evident in these short periods. In results not shown, we examine robustness
to different specifications of T , starting in years later than 1995, and the same general patterns hold.

   Robustness to Sample Size, N             Finally, in the bottom right subfigure of Figure 3, we
examine the robustness of our results to sample size. In general, willingness to pay is quite robust
to sample size, so we use our full sample of 1,689,078 as our baseline sample size to avoid throwing
away information. As shown, a 10% sample is sufficient to get a very accurate distribution, and
even a 1% is informative. However, sample sizes under 1% reflect drastically lower risk components
of willingness to pay (likely due to the omission of tails of the distribution). As mentioned earlier,
if we restrict the MEPS in a similar manner to our sample, we are left with a sample size that is
approximately 0.3% the size of our data. Results at that sample size give highly variable estimates


                                                   15
of the longitudinal value of health insurance — a sample of 100 random draws of 0.3% of our data
(about the size of the MEPS) yields a range of values of (γ − φ)/γ from 8.2% to 95.7%. It should
also be noted that these results are at the MEPS sample size, assuming that the MEPS has 17 years
of longitudinal data. As discussed above, limiting T to the actual 2.5 years of data in the MEPS
obscures even more of the willingness to pay for public insurance.

   Robustness to Private Information on Persistent Diagnoses                   Our main specification
assumes that everyone believes that she could have the same realized costs as anyone in the sample.
In reality, we might think that individuals have private information about the cross-sectional and
longitudinal distributions from which they will draw. To evaluate whether this private information
has a meaningful impact on willingness to pay for the public health insurance safety net, we return
to our diagnosis intensity cohorts (from Section 2) and consider the extreme case where we assume
that the people who will enter the hospital in 1995 with the most persistent diagnoses know that
they will enter the hospital with the most persistent diagnoses, forming a group Gj for calculation
of the value of health insurance via Equation 7. We divide the full sample into two other groups:
people who know that they will have other inpatient diagnoses in 1995 and people who know that
they will not visit the hospital in 1995. Mechanically, we evaluate willingness to pay among these
subgroups, while retaining the premiums from the overall sample.
   Figure 4 shows how individuals value public insurance, knowing their diagnosis group. The top
panel shows the robustness of willingness to pay to α for individuals who know that they will be in
the “1995 Visit, Persistent DX” group, the middle panel shows the same figure for those who know
that they will be in the “1995 Visit, Other DX” group, and the bottom panel shows the same figure
for those who know that they will be in the “No 1995 Visit” group.
   Unsurprisingly, the most striking difference across the persistence categories is the longitudinal
value of public health insurance γ shown along the top axis. The longitudinal value of public health
insurance γ is larger for those individuals with persistent diagnoses than it is for those individuals
in the “1995 Visit, Other DX” category. The “No 1995 Visit” category, where there is no diagnosis
in 1995, serves as a comparator category. It should closely resemble our main specification, as most
individuals (91.0%) do not visit the hospital in 1995, and thus they have no private information.
Indeed, we find nearly identical results in that group as we do in our main specification.
   At low levels of the risk aversion parameter α, the persistent diagnosis group is the group with
the largest longitudinal value of insurance γ, as shown along the top axis of each subfigure. However,
a high levels of the risk aversion parameter α, “No 1995 Visit” group has the largest longitudinal
value of insurance. To understand what drives this change, we note that the risk neutral value of
insurance λ (the leftmost value of γ shown) is only slightly higher for the individuals with persistent
diagnoses than it is for individual with no 1995 visit. As discussed above, the risk neutral value of
insurance is simply the average costs ever paid by public health insurance. (Those costs are lowest
in the “1995 Visit, Other DX” group, likely because of reversion to the mean after 1995 costs are paid
by private health insurance). However, the dispersion of costs ever paid by public health insurance
is larger among the “No 1995 Visit” group than it is in the persistent diagnosis group. Therefore, at

higher levels of risk aversion, the group with private information about their persistent diagnoses
has a lower valuation of public insurance than individuals with no private information.
   Even though the levels of the longitudinal value of health insurance γ differ across groups with
differing amounts of private information, our general finding that cross sectional-data obscures a
substantial fraction of the value of insurance holds. The fraction of longitudinal value of public
health insurance that is obscured by cross-sectional data (γ − φ)/γ is 89%, among individuals with
persistent diagnoses in 1995. Individuals with other inpatient diagnoses in 1995 have a ratio of
90%. We find quantitatively similar results if we use 2%, 1%, and 0.1% thresholds in lieu of the
3% threshold that we use to determine which diagnoses are persistent. Accordingly, we conclude
that it is not constructive to explore other heterogeneity in private information, as persistence in
diagnoses is an extreme form of private information, and it does not alter our main finding.

   Robustness to Including Uninsured           We began by excluding individuals who ever go unin-
sured from our private in 1995 sample because they make the willingness to pay for the public health
insurance safety net less straightforward — individuals are less willing to pay for a safety net that
has holes. Now that we have shown how willingness to pay varies when the safety net does not
have holes, we add the uninsured back into the analysis, aiming to give a more realistic picture of
the willingness to pay for the public health insurance safety net in the current environment. This
larger sample includes an additional 134,750 individuals who are uninsured for some point during
the period from 1996-2011, for a total balanced cohort population of 1,823,828
   Figure 5 shows the same analysis as Figure 3, but it includes individuals who ever go uninsured.
As shown in the numbers at the top of each subfigure, the longitudinal value of public health
insurance is lower in dollar terms (as it should be) when we allow that public health insurance
leaves some individuals uninsured. At our baseline parameter values, γ is $42,794 when we do not
include the uninsured, and it is $14,907 when we do. However, the fraction of the longitudinal
value of the public health insurance safety net that is not captured with cross-sectional data is only
slightly smaller, and it is still very robust across a wide range of parameter values. We find that at
α = 0.0002, (γ − φ)/γ is equal to 81%, which is about 10% lower than the result using our primary
“private-in-1995 sample."
   The patterns evident in the subfigures that include the uninsured population are not quite
as smooth as those for our main specification. The main phenomenon that drives the irregular
patterns is that the longitudinal value of insurance γ and the cross-sectional value of insurance φ
do not always increase monotonically with the risk aversion parameter α as they do in our primary
sample. One manifestation of this non-monotonicity is that the longitudinal and cross-sectional
values of insurance are not necessarily greater than the risk neutral value of insurance λ (though
they are never significantly less than λ in the relevant range of α). To understand this phenomenon,
it is useful to consider the limit of the value of insurance ρ, expressed in Equation 2, as the risk
aversion parameter α approaches infinity. The limiting value is equal to the difference between the
maximum cost in the counterfactual world and the maximum cost in the actual world:

    Equation 8 demonstrates that it is theoretically possible for the longitudinal value of insurance
ρ to be equal to zero even if the risk neutral value of insurance λ is positive. Intuitively, this is
because the world with insurance leaves some individuals uninsured, reducing the willingness to pay
for public insurance. Before any uncertainty is realized, the infinitely risk averse individual sees the
tradeoff between the actual world and the counterfactual world pessimistically, and so he imagines
the downside of being the person with the most costly health profile in each world, and considers
the tradeoff between the two worlds under the assumption that he draws the short straw in either
scenario. Importantly, willingness to pay in the case of extreme risk aversion is not the result of
aversion to experiencing the biggest change in cost between the actual and counterfactual worlds
based on a single health and insurance profile, but rather is driven by a risk-averse assessment of
the set of cost profiles that exist in each world. If the individual with the highest costs will have
the same costs in both worlds, then the infinitely risk averse individual has no willingness to pay
for the safety net.


                                                                             19
    This intuition is important to keep in mind when considering the longitudinal value of insurance
γ as it varies with the risk aversion parameter in the top left subfigure of Figure 5. If the individual
with the highest cumulative costs by the end of the sample is always privately insured, then willing-
ness to pay for public health insurance approaches zero as the risk aversion parameter α approaches
infinity. Similarly, if the individual with the highest cumulative costs by the end of the sample is
uninsured in some periods regardless of the presence of the safety net, then willingness to pay for
public health insurance also approaches zero as the risk aversion parameter α approaches infinity.
Thus, willingness to pay when taking risk aversion into account can actually be less than the risk
neutral value of insurance (γ or φ can be less than λ).
    As shown in the other subfigures of Figure 5, the fraction of longitudinal value of health insurance
that is obscured by cross-sectional data (γ − φ)/γ does not always vary smoothly. This is simply
another manifestation of the intuition that we have developed by taking the limit of the value of
public health insurance as the risk aversion parameter α increases. Even at our baseline value
of the risk aversion paramter α, the value of public health insurance depends on the tails of the
distribution, and the tails change as we vary the sample and the maximum annual cost. The discrete
jumps evident in the lower right subfigure of Figure 5 occur because as we increase the sample size
N , most of the individuals we add fall in the interior of the distribution, having a smooth impact
on the valuation of insurance. However, when we add an individual to the sample that changes the
tail of the distribution, the value of insurance changes discretely.
    Because of the nuance involved in understanding the framework when we allow individuals to go
uninsured in the world with the public health insurance safety net, we introduced the uninsured after
building up intuition in the simpler case. However, consider the results that include the uninsured
to be our primary results. At the baseline values of our parameters, in the sample that includes
the uninsured, the longitudinal value of insurance of $14,907 is much lower than the longitudinal
value of insurance of $42,794 obtained in the restricted sample. However, whether we include the
uninsured or not, we still miss a substantial fraction of the value of the public health insurance
safety net if we focus on cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal data. Across a wide range of
parameters, using cross-sectional data in lieu of longitudinal data obscures over 80% of the value of
public health insurance to the young and privately insured.


6   Conclusion

The expansion of Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act will expand the public health
insurance safety net in many states. This expansion in public health insurance will not only affect
individuals who are currently uninsured, but also it will serve as a safety net for individuals who
currently have private coverage. Past estimates have fallen short in capturing the value of public
health insurance as a safety net because they have used cross-sectional data to obtain their estimates.
Such data sets fail to capture the fact that some individuals’ medical costs are highly correlated over
time, thereby increasing financial risk and the value of public health insurance that mitigates such
risk. Furthermore, the size of most cross-sectional datasets used in the literature is small, offering


                                                  20
a limited picture of events that occur in the tail of the distribution and drive risk.
   We employ a longitudinal data set that includes nearly all hospital visits in the state of New
York from 1995 to 2011 to estimate the value that the young and privately insured derive from
public health insurance. We consider individuals who are privately insured in 1995 but whose
health insurance coverage may change over time. In 1995, public health insurance serves only as
a potential safety net that mitigates future financial risk. We show that the individuals who have
diagnoses in 1995 that are likely to require hospital care in future years are more likely to transition
to public health insurance. We find that using cross-sectional data in lieu of longitudinal data
obscures over 80% of the value of public health insurance to the young and privately insured.
   This paper demonstrates that it is important to collect and analyze longitudinal data to un-
derstand the risk-protective value of health insurance. Our empirical analysis shows that patterns
visible in longitudinal data that are not visible in cross-sectional data are economically important.
Given this finding, models of the risk-protective value of health insurance should allow for correla-
tions in coverage and costs across time. Beyond elucidating the value of the public health insurance
safety net, this paper helps to explain why individuals value regulations that guarantee renewability
of private health insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions — the empirical results show that
the longitudinal value of health insurance coverage is much greater than the sum of its cross-sectional
parts.

A    Data

Our main data are restricted use data from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative
System (SPARCS), which contain data on almost all inpatient discharges in New York state from
1995 to 2011 — a period of 17 years. SPARCS data include all inpatient discharges from all Article
28 licensed hospitals, defined as general hospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic treatment centers.
To examine the completeness of the SPARCS data, we compare it to New York state hospital counts
from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, as compiled by the Kaiser Family
Foundation (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011). We plot the number of hospitals from both sources
in Figure A1. There are approximately 225 to 250 hospitals in the SPARCS data in each year
from 1995 to 2011. The figure shows that our data include more hospitals in each year than AHA
reports because the AHA Annual Survey only includes “community hospitals,” a smaller subset of
all hospitals.

    Combining the SPARCS data with other sources, we construct a balanced panel designed to
represent all individuals in the state of New York from 1995 to 2011 who were ages 25-64 in 1995.
We focus on individuals ages 25-34 in 1995 to isolate individuals who are young but working-age.
We further restrict our sample to allow us to focus on young individuals for whom public health
insurance has value only as a potential safety net. Our main sample, the “private in 1995 sample,”
includes all individuals ages 25-34 in 1995 with private coverage in 1995. This balanced sample
includes annual insurance coverage and spending for 1,689,078 individuals for 17 years, 1,199,245
of whom appear in a hospital at some point in our data. We give an overview of how we construct
our data here, and we provide full detail in the data appendix.9 .
    To create our balanced panel, we first create an observation in every year of our sample period
for every individual ages 25–64 in 1995 who appears in our SPARCS data in any year. Since we
only observe individuals in the years in which they show up in a hospital, this step ensures that we

have a balanced panel for the individuals who ever appear. However, many individuals never show
up in a hospital during our sample period. Therefore, we create observations for the remaining
individuals who were ages 25–64 in 1995 and living in New York state, according to New York state
population totals and death rates taken from the Current Population Survey (CPS). We obtained
special restricted-access linkage of our SPARCS data to state Vital Statistics data; we therefore
observe deaths, even if they occur outside of the hospital.
   Next, we assign inpatient costs and insurance coverage within our balanced panel. Assuming
that we observe all inpatient costs in the state of New York, costs are equal to what we observe
in the data and equal to zero otherwise. We observe hospital charges (list prices) rather than
costs in SPARCS. However, we follow standard practice and calculate costs by deflating observed
charges by the cost-to-charge ratio reported to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
for each hospital-year. We implement this process at the individual-discharge-year level prior to
aggregating the data to the individual-year level to account for variation in the cost-to-charge ratio
across hospitals. We further deflate hospital costs by the CPI-U so that we always express costs in
2012 dollars.
   Finally, we define an upper bound for annual individual costs of M = $30, 000 (in $2012) to
account for the ability of insurers and individuals to negotiate discounts with hospitals in the event of
exorbitant medical costs. We use the same upper bound for all individuals in all periods, regardless
of insurance status. Approximately 0.4% percent of individuals in our private in 1995 sample exceed
this upper bound in each year. We examine robustness to this assumption and find that the main
results hold for a wide range of values of M .
   The main selection issue in our data is that we do not observe if and when individuals exit the
state of New York during our sample period. As long as individuals do not differentially move out of
the state of New York after a health event, attrition is much less likely to be a problem in our data
than it is in other data sets. Furthermore, attrition will bias us against finding a larger longitudinal
value of insurance relative to the value of insurance that we find in repeated cross-sections.
   An additional caveat is that results based on data from the state of New York might not gener-
alize to other states. During the entire period of our sample, New York had strict regulations in its
individual health insurance market (the market for health insurance purchased directly through in-
surers). Since before the start of our sample in 1993, it has had “community rating” regulations that
limit premium variation across beneficiaries and “guaranteed issue” regulations that require insurer
to offer insurance to all applicants. These regulations have been established nationally by the ACA
in 2014, such that results from New York might be of general interest. However, our analysis covers
all forms of health insurance, of which individual health insurance is only a small part, currently
covering less than 2% of individual in the state of New York (Kowalski, 2014). Results from New
York might not generalize for other reasons, which would be hard to separate empirically. However,
we compare our data to data from nationally-representative surveys to gauge its external validity.

   Inpatient Cost Comparison to the MEPS                  We compare inpatient costs in our data to
inpatient costs in the MEPS. Within the private in 1995 sample, average annual costs after imposing

M are $489, ranging from a low of $416 in 1996 to a high of $569 in 2011. As exhibited in Figure
A2, the pattern of costs over time follows a very similar trajectory in both MEPS and SPARCS
from 1996 (the first year of the MEPS) onward. In MEPS, average annual inpatient costs are $549,
ranging from a low of $449 in 1997 to a high of $656 in 2005. However, due to the substantially
smaller sample size, the MEPS statistics are less stable over time than the SPARCS statistics,
as shown by the 95% confidence intervals calculated within the MEPS. For example, in the 2011
MEPS survey, there are only 4,499 individuals who were between the ages of 25 and 34 in 1995,
which means the MEPS is approximately 0.3% as large as our SPARCS sample.10 We do not
report confidence intervals for the SPARCS data because they are not weighted — they include
the universe of individuals that meet the sample inclusion criteria. Among only those members of
the private in 1995 sample that visit the hospital, average annual costs after imposing M is $8,028.
The comparable figure in the MEPS is $10,029; however, again, due to the small sample size in the
MEPS, this estimate is not as precise as the SPARCS estimate.

    A major concern with our SPARCS data is that we only observe inpatient costs. From the
MEPS data, we see that inpatient costs constitute a fairly large share of total costs over the period.
The ratio of inpatient costs to the sum of inpatient and outpatient costs, ranges from a high of 73%
in 2000 to a low of 58% in 2009, generally declining throughout the period. We restrict our analysis
to inpatient costs because we are not aware of any other data, including the MEPS, which would
allow us to observe longitudinal patterns in outpatient costs for a similar population for 17 years.

    Insurance Coverage Comparison to the CPS                             We divide health insurance coverage into
three categories: private, public, and uninsured. Public health insurance includes Medicaid coverage,
Medicare coverage, and other types of public coverage. It is straightforward to assign insurance
  10
     To be as consistent as possible with our SPARCS private-in-1995 sample, we restrict our MEPS sample to
individuals who were ages 25-34 in 1995 and privately insured in the current year. In addition, we deflate cost data
in the MEPS by the CPI-U so that all costs are in 2012 dollars and apply M as an upper bound to individual costs
in any given period.



                                                           25
coverage for people that we observe in the hospital — we simply assign the observed coverage for
the given year (if we observe multiple coverage types within the same year, we assign coverage to
be the first observed type of coverage for that year). For individuals that we do not observe in the
hospital in 1995, we randomly assign insurance coverage so that our distribution of insurance types
reflects the CPS coverage estimates for our age cohorts of interest in New York in 1995. In remaining
periods for which we do not observe coverage, we assign coverage to be the same type as assigned
previously. Although this methodology under-counts changes in coverage in our data, the only
coverage changes that we do not observe are for individuals who have zero inpatient hospital costs
in the corresponding year. Therefore, we capture the most important changes in health insurance
coverage because we observe health insurance coverage for all individuals who visit the hospital.
      Figure A3 shows how coverage ranges from the CPS11 (top left) and from the SPARCS data
alone (top right) combine to achieve coverage in our private-in-1995 sample (bottom). In the CPS,
most individuals have private insurance, and the rate of private insurance remains fairly stable
across the period but varies somewhat from year-to-year, from a minimum of 61% in 1996 to a
maximum of 71% in 2007. The rate of public insurance also remains quite stable, but increases
gradually over the period. The lowest rate of public insurance is 9.7% in 2000, and the highest is
17.8% in 2011. The rate of uninsurance declines somewhat throughout the period. The highest rate
of uninsurance is 25.8% in 1996, and the lowest is 13.6% in 2007.
      We see similar insurance rates in SPARCS, though we observe somewhat higher rates of public
insurance and lower rates of private insurance and uninsurance. These differences are not surprising,
given that we are observing only inpatient hospital visitors, and inpatient hospital visitors will be
more likely to have coverage if there is adverse selection into insurance. The fact that public
insurance rates are higher within the SPARCS inpatient population than within the population as
a whole motivates our interest in public insurance as a safety net for the very sick.
      The bottom graph shows coverage in the private-in-1995 sample. Per our focus, 100% of this
sample has private coverage in 1995, but some members of the sample gain public coverage over time
and others die. In our private-in-1995 sample, we exclude individuals who ever become uninsured
because doing so simplifies the intuition behind our calculations. After we build up the intuition and
the main results, we add individuals who ever become uninsured to the private-in-1995 sample to
construct our preferred sample in Section 5. As shown, the proportion of the private-in-1995 sample
that has public coverage grows throughout the period, motivating the role of public health insurance
as a safety net for this population. As shown in Figure A3, by 2011, 2.5% are deceased and 14.8%
are publicly insured. Although the rate of public health insurance in the private-in-1995 sample is
not as large as the rate of public health insurance in the full CPS population, which includes those
who started out with public health insurance or uninsured, we can see that a significant portion of
individuals with public health insurance come from the ranks of the previously privately insured.
      We utilize the longitudinal nature of our private-in-1995 sample in determining the longitudinal
value of public insurance. For comparative purposes, we can obscure the longitudinal nature of
our private-in-1995 sample by simply omitting the longitudinal identifiers. Such cross-sectional
 11
      CPS estimates are simple (unweighted) two-year moving averages of the previous year with the current year.

data constructed from our data can then offer a cleaner comparison between our data and cross-
sectional survey data such as the CPS, because it holds features like sample size constant. Cross-
sectional data derived from our longitudinal data are arguably superior to traditional cross-sectional
surveys in the sense that our data “samples” the same individuals each year, thereby controlling
for demographic variables in each year. Our cross-sectional data also only “samples” individuals
who had private insurance in 1995, thereby providing more information than a true cross-sectional
survey. Nevertheless, we show that it still offers a very limited picture of the value of public health
insurance as a safety net relative to our full longitudinal data.
