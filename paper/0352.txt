          Time Preference and International Lending and Borrowing
                   in an Overlapping Generations Model

                                  ABSTRACT

      Two economies, each represented by a Diamond-type overlapping generations
model, are joined together.     Capital formation and welfare are compared under
autarky and openness.   Most of the analysis concentrates on the case where
the two countries only differ in their pure rates of time preference.       The
following propositions are established:
1.   If the rate of population growth is positive, the country with the higher
     value of consumption while young has a current account deficit in the
     steady state.
2.   The country with the higher pure rate of time preference has a steady-
     state current account deficit.
3.   If the model is stable, the common open economy steady-state capital-labor
     ratio lies between the two autarky capital-labor ratios'.
4.   Outside the steady state, the country with the higher pure rate of time
     preference will not necessarily be the one to run a current account deficit.
5.   The welfare of the old generation alive when the two autarkic countries join
     in open economy is unaffected by this international economic integration.
     The welfare of the young generation in the country with the high pure rate
     of time preference is lower under openness than under autarky, while in the
     country with the low pure rate of time preference it is higher.
6.   The stationary utility level of the country with the high pure rate of time
     preference is always higher under openness than under autarky.      The effect
     of openness on the stationary utility level of the low pure rate of time
     preference country is ambiguous.   If it is higher, openness can be said to
     constitute a potentially pareto-superior regime for the low pure rate of
     time preference country.   Because of the short-run welfare l~~s it incurs
     after international economic integration, the open economy is not pareto-
     superior to the closed economy for the high pure rate of time preference
     country.

                      in an Overlapping Generations Model


1.   Introduction

      In its most abstract form the pure theory of international trade

demonstrates that the reason for exchange across national boundaries is

the same as for any kind of exchange:     gains can be realized by the con-

tracting parties that would otherwise have been unobtainable.         To isolate

the underlying determinants of these potential gains, the trading economies

are evaluated in a hypothetical autarky       or pre-trade situation.     If the

relative prices of tradeable goods differ across countries in the hypo-

thetical autarky     situation, there is prima facie evidence of potential

gains from international comrnodityarbitrage and, to the extent that

technology and internal factor mobility permit, from reallocation of re-

sources and specialization in production.

     Differences in relative prices between countries in the absence of

trade can be attributed to six     factors:   differences in technology,

differences in factor endowments, differences in tastes, differences in

scale, differences in market structuring (monopoly, unionization of labor

markets, etc.) and differences in taxes, subsidies and other man-made

wedges between buyers' and sellers' prices.

     This paper ignores all determinants of trade other than taste dif-

ferences.     The particular taste parameter whose effect on the pattern

of trade will be analyzed is the pure rate of time preference.          To isolate

the contribution of this parameter, the formal model will have but one

homogeneous physical output, produced in both countries with an identical

technology.     The model is non-trivial because two commodities with identical

physical characteristics available at different points in time are distinct
                                           -2-


economic goods.         In such a one-commodity world, international trade is

always mirrored by international lending or borrowing:           ~here   can be inter-

national trade in commodities if and only if there is international lend-

ing and borrowing.         Thus the model incorporates costless international

mobility of output (consumption and real capital) and of financial capital.

Labor is assumed to be immobile between countries.         Section 2 reproduces

some results on the one-country overlapping generations model first developed

by Diamond [1965].         This model describes the autarky      situation of the two

countries.         Section 3 analyzes the open, integrated world eeonomy.

            In a recent paper Findlay [1978] has approached the problem of inter-
national trade, time preference and interest equalization from an

"Austrian" viewpoint.         This paper can be taken as a neoclassical comple-

ment to Findlay's analysis.

2.      The Autarchy Equilibrium

            The world economy consists of two countries, the "home" country and

the "foreign" country, identical in every respect except in taste.              Each

country is represented by competitive output and        fact~r   markets, two

overlapping generations, and an identical, well-behaved constant returns

to scale production function f.

        Individu'ls within a given country are identical, within and across

generations.              People live for two periods, work in the first period of their
lives and retire in the second.                   Labour supply is inelastic.      Tbeindividual's
optimization problem is given in equations (1), (2) and (3).                       The utility

of lifetime consumption is maximized subject to the lifetime budget con-
straint (2).              The conditions on u ensure that the budget constraint will

and Ct.         Equations (4) and (5) state that the labour market and capital
rental market are competitive.                   The capital stock at the beginning of period
t+l equals the value'of the saving in period t.                     This economy-wide capital
Wirkl!t equilibrium condition is given in equation (6).                    Real capital is
thl! only store of value.                 All saving in period t is performed by the
toUns m.mbers             of guer.tion t.        The old dissave previously accumulated

We'lth.        The COndition' On f ensure that k t will be positive.

       When we consider the consequences of different pure rates of time
preference the utility function u(c~, C~) will be specialized to the
following additively separable form:

(8)           u ( c 1t ' c 2)
                           t

Here    ~    is the (constant) pure rate of time preference.               More generally,
the pure rate of time preference is the marginal rate of substitution be-
tween       consumption'~hen           young and consumption when old, when equal amounts
are consumed in 1:)oth periods, minus one.                   It can be a function of the level
of consumption:

Steady-state equilibrium

          The steady state or long-run equilibrium is that sequence of momentary

equilibria in which the lifetime per capita consumption profile remains

constant from generation to generation.                It can be characterized by the

following set of equations.

that represent the stationary decentralized (or competitive) consumption

possibility locus.

These two equations can be solved for c                                      as a function of c .

For the Cobb-Douglas production function f(k) = k ; 0 < a < 1, the stationary

decentralized consumption possibility locus has the shape of OF in Figure 2. 1 /

                        Tois is certainly the case for the Cobb-Douglas production

function but need not be true for alternative, otherwise well-behaved

neoclassical production functions.                            It is e.g., quite possible for OF,

       r1um.-                   The potential inefficiency due to overaccumulation reflects

the dual role of capital in the model.                               Capital serves as an input in the

production function and as the unique store of value through which private

agents can transfer resources from their productive early years into retire-

ment.           It would indeed be surprising i f this double task could be discharged

efficiently by a single medium.

        The potential inefficiency can be interpreted as an externality.                              The

perceived private market rate of transformation between consumption while

young and consumption while old differs from the actual social rate of

transformation which is a function of the aggregate private saving decision.

The slope of the short run and long run perceived private transformation

locus is, from the private budget constraint (2).

short-run perceived private transformation locus have the same slope as

the actual social transformation locus.                          Our assumptions on the utility

function rule out such a corner solution.                          The social terms of trade
            1            2

terms of trade.          An increase in c~ will, given the inherited capital-

labor ratio k , lower k + .                        This will raise the marginal product of capital

be the case if         ~k[kfl(k)]          <   -1.      It would require a very low elasticity of

substitution between capital and labor for the short-run social transforma-

tion locus to be upward sloping.                         With a Cobb-Douglas ,production function

e.g., the short-run social transformation locus is downward sloping with

 A possible configuration of short-run and long-run transformation loci is

 represented in Figure 3.       An equilibrium such as E represents a steady-
                                                        1
 state capital-labor ratio below the golden rule.                  This cannot be characterized

 as inefficient because of (temporary) sacrifices in consumption that would

 be required to reach a higher capital-labor ratio.


 Stability

        Substituting (lOa) into (6) and using (4) and (5) we obtain a first-

 order difference equation in k          that describes the evolution of the model
                                    t
 from arbitrary initial conditions:




                                                 dk t + l
 The model will be locally stable when                       < 1   i. e., when
                                                  dk
                                                      t

                w                     r



 The interpretation of (24) is that an increase in k will lead to excess

 supply in the capital market.          It does not stimulate saving to such an

 extent that excess demand results.         Note that the assumption that goods
                     1
 are normal (0 < c       < 1) and the assumption that an increase in the interest

     Propositions 2 and 3 immediately imply the following:


Proposition 4:         Consider two economies, identical in all respects except

the pure rate of time preference which is higher for the home country than

for the foreign country.                Starting from any common initial capital-labor

ratio at t      =   to' the capital-labor ratio of the high time preference country

will be below that of the low time                  preference country for all t >              to.

     Proposition 4 tells us something about the behavior of the two economies

were they to start from the same initial condition.                             Itmight still seem pos-

sible that if the high pure rate of time preference country were to start

off with an initial capital-labor ratio, k   , sufficiently above the initial

country, k, is less than the steady-state capital-labor ratio of the low

After the two paths cross for the first time, they never cross again be-

and an increase in the interest rate lowers consumption in period 1.

3.    The Two-Country Equilibrium

        The two countries that will be linked together in an international

commodity market and an international capital market are identical in all

respects, except for the pure rate of time preference.                                     The home country

is assumed to have a higher rate of pure time preference than the foreign

country.     For the home country we adopt the notation developed for the

autarchic economy.          All variables associated with the foreign country are

distinguished by a bar above the relevant variable.                                     Comparing the two

countries we have:


(25a)       v      v

(25c)       n = n

                                          -14-

Output can be moved c03tless1y between the two countries.

        In this "pure absorption" mode1-
                                              6/ international trade and international

lending and borrowing (international capital mobility) are part and parcel

of the same transaction.           In a one commodity model the only way to pay for

an extra unit of output today is with a promise of future output.               Each

trade balance transaction has to involve credit.            There can be no current

quid-pro-quo.          We make the convenient assumption of perfect international

mobility of financial capital:            ownership claims to domestic and foreign

real capital are perfect substitutes in private portfolios in both
countries.          This means that interest rates will be equalized in the world

economy:


(26)        r
                t
                    = r t for all t.

There is a single world capital market.            With international capital mobility

it is essential to distinguish between the capital stock used in production

in the home country, K , and the value of claims on real capital, domestic
                      t
or foreign, owned by domestic residents, At'             In the national income

accounts the corresponding distinction is between            dom~stic   income or pro-

duct and national income or product.             Location and ownership of physical

capital no longer coincide.            From interest equalization and identical,

linear homogeneous production functions it follows that capital-labor

ratios and wage rates are equal in the two countries.

          The interpretation of this stability condition is the same as in the closed

          economy case.            In the current model a higher value of k should be associated

          with excess supply in the world capital market.                     Again, the assumptions of

          normal goods and a non-negative effect on saving of an increase in the

          interest rate do not suffice to establish stability.                     Note that when tastes

          are identical the model reduces to the closed economy.                      p~l    international

          trade and international borrowing and lending is due to taste differences.


          The balance of payments accounts

                  In a two-country world it suffices to analyze the balance of payments

          accounts of one of the countries.                   Without loss of generality I focus on

          the horne country.

As there is no official settlements balance, the current account surplus

(deficit) of a country is identically equal to its capital account deficit

(surplus) .

        The balance of trade surplus is the excess of domestic product over

domestic absorption.     Domestic absorption is the sum of consumption and

domestic capital formation.

The current account surplus is the excess of national product over domestic

absorption.    National product equals domestic product plus net foreign in-

vestment income.     If At is the wealth of the home country at the beginning

of period t, net claims on the rest of the world are At - K and net foreign

National wealth can, and with different pure rates of time preference will

differ from the value of the domestic capit.al stock because of -the scope

for international borrowing and lending.          There is n presumption that a

nation consisting of people with high rates of time preference will tend

to be a net foreign borrower.                             The truth of this presumption will be in-

vestigated in what follows.

        The current account surplus of the home country is given by:

Equivalently, the current account surplus can be viewed as the net foreign

Each economic agent "lives \olithin his means" i.n the sense that the present

discounted value of lifetime resources (period 1 labor income) equals the

present discounted value of lifetime consumption.                        Still except when tastes

are identical or population is stationary, one country will be steadily

accumulating claims on the other.

     We next establish the following three propositions about the steady-

state equilibrium of the world economy.


Proposition 6:            The country whose residents have a higher value of con-

sumption when young, will run a steady-state current account deficit.

                                                    I                   -1
                                                                w-c                            1        -1
Proof:     From (50) we know that a         = w-c
                                              l+n       and a - 1+n                   Thus c        > c

implies a < -a.          Rewrite (47) as a - k + a - k           = O.        Therefore a - k =

-(a -    k) < O.         The current account surplus is n(a - k) < O.                      This propo-

sition unlike the following two, does not depend on the additive1y separable

specification of the utility function.


Proposition 7:           The country with the higher pure rate of time preference

has a steady-state current account deficit.


Proof:     From Proposition 6 we know that it suffices to show that p > p
            1       -1
implies c       >   c.     This was shown in Proposition 1.


Proposition 8:           The common steady-state open econo9Y capital-labor ratio

lies between the two autarky            capital-labor ratios if the model is stable
under autarky.
Proof:     Let k * be the common open economy capital-labor ratio,                                  ~   the au-

tarky domestic capital-labor ratio and k                    the autarky foreign capital-
                                                        F
labor ratio.        We again assume that p > p.              For brevity we write steady-
                                                1                -1          -                 1     -]
state consumption in period 1 as c (k, p) and c (k, p), with c , c:..:
                                                                                               (J       0

From the fact that consumption in period 1 is an increasing function of
                            -1     -    1   1               -1                        1

Assume that k* is below the lower of the two autarky                                              capital-labor ratios,

k .      In the autarky         case, at a value of k below                                 ~   such as k*, there

would be excess demand (i.e., excess saving) in the capital market--if

the model is stable.             A fortiori there would be excess demand if,                                  i~    the

home country capital market equilibrium condition, cl(k*, p) is replaced

by the smaller world-average level of consumption t(Cl(k*, p) + cl(k*,                                                pÂ»).
Thus capital market equilibrium requires k*                                           >~.    By exactly analogous

reasoning, it is established that k* < k .

       While (51) and (52) must be satisfied in a full stationary equilibrium

of the world economy, they are not a complete characterization of the sta-

tionary decentralized consumption possibility locus.                Residents of each coun-

try must satisfy their         budg~t   constraints indiVidually and not merely on

average, acr.oss both countries as in (52).              In Figure 4, the indifference

curve of each country is tangent to the common world capital market line.

debt to the foreign country grows at the natural rate of growth.               As we have

drawn it,    ~ is at a capital-labor ratio below the golden rule, i.e.
r > n.     The home country therefore runs a trade balance surplus.             If the

equilibrium had been beyond E* , the home country would still run a current

account deficit but with n > r it would now also run a trade balance

deficit.     The    autarky equilibrium for the home country is at E~T, at a

capital-labor ratio below the common post-trade capital-labor ratio.                  The
autarky     equilibriurfi for the foreign country is at ENT ' at a capital-labor

Non-steady-state behavior

       The behavior of the two-country model outside the steady state is

not much more complicated than its steady-state behavior.               There is only

one state variable--the capital-labor ratio.              Provided the model is stable,

convergence to the steady-state equilibrium will therefore be monotonic.

The current account and trade account surpluses in period t can also be

expressed as a function of k t- l'         Consider the current account surplus of

current account deficit throughout the non-steady state adjustment process,

the way it does in the steady state?                       Corresponding to (53) is the current

account surplus equation for the foreign country:

(56")


         The current account deficit equals the excess of domestic capital for-

mation over national saving.                           This holds for both countries.             With perfect

international capital mobility k                                is the same in both countries in each

period.              Domestic capital formation will therefore be the same in the two

countries.              The home country will therefore run a current account deficit

lent to (56").                 While with p >              p,   each generation in the home country saves

less than the corresponding generation in the foreign country, national

saving in the home country need not be less in any given period than

national saving in the foreign country.                                      National saving is the sum of

saving by the young and dissaving by the old.                                      In the home country the

young save less hut as a consequence the old dissave less.                                      Consider the

simple example in which the young in the home country save a constant

fraction n of their lnhnr income and the young in the foreign country

save     a       COllsUlllt    fr,lClion n; ()         ~    n,n < 1; 11             The home country will then

run a current account deficit provided the total amount of income going to
labor is not declining.          This can be seen as follows.    With the constant

proportional sav':'ng assumption total. home c01}ntry saving SH minus total




this requires L       w    >   L _ w _ .   If total labor   in~ome   declines, the
                  t    t        t l t l
dissaving of the old will, at constant savings rates out of labor income,

not be matched by the saving of the young.           The country with the higher

savings rate out of labor income will therefore, summing over the young

and the old, be dissaving faster than the country with the lower savings

rate.     Identifying the higher savings rate with a lower pure rate of

time preference, the country with the lower pure rate of time preference

will be running a current account deficit.           In the steady state the (in general

 endogenous) constant savings rate in the home country is lower than in

the foreign country and labor income grows at the natural rate of growth

n.   Outside the steady state labor income may well decline during the ad-

justment process, especially if the initial capital-labor ratio is above

the steady-state capital-labor ratio.          The adjustment process then involves

a monotonic decline in k which would hurt labor's share, especially if

the elasticity of substitution is low.          Note that it is not necessary for

the approach to the steady-state current account deficit to be monotonic.

The home country could alternate between periods of deficits and surpluses

although ultimately it will run a deficit.


Scale differences

        The model can be generalized in a straightforward manner to include

scale differences.         For a steady state to exist, the rates of population

growth in the two countries must be the same, but the scale of the two

countries, as measured by the size of their populations,L                 and L       need not
                                                                      t           t
be the same.    A restatement of the model with allowance for unequal popu-
lations involves minimal changes.            All of equations (28) - (33) are re-

tained.       The world capital market equilibrium condition (34)
                    1            -1 -
becomes:       (wt-Ct)L t + (wt-ct)L t   = Kt + l   + Kt + 1 .             With a common rate of

growth of population, n, the ratio of L                     to L         will be constant, say
                                                    t              t
at L/E.       The world capital market equilibrium condition can now be written
    10/
as--

(57)                                                                                        = kt+l(l+n)

The lifetime budget constraint of the representative or average world con-

sumer can be obtained from the budget constraints of the consumers in

the two countries, (29) and (31).          This yields:

and lending can be complemented in a natural way by the analysis of the

the gains or losses from participation j.n the world economy, welfare in

welfare of the generations alive at the moment that the two countries are

integrated and the long-run effects will be considered.


Short-run effects

        The two countries evolve under autarky up to and including period

t-l.     In period t the two national capital markew are integrated into a

world capital market.       It does not matter whether this change of regime

is anticipated or unanticipated.       In period t there are two generations

alive:     the old, born in t-1, and the young, born in t.          Financial inte-

gration does not in any way affect the opportunity set of the old genera-

tion.     Its members consume the savings made in t-1 plus accumulated in-

terest.       The interest rate faced by the generation born in t-l is the

relevant autarky rate, r
                             H for the home country and r F for the foreign

country.       It is predetermined when the change to the open economy takes

place.     The welfare of the old generations is therefore unaffected by

the integration into the world economy.

        The wage rate faced by the generation born in period t is also pre-

determined in t and independent of the change of      regi~e        in that period.

Young residents of the home country face a wage rate

while in the foreign country the wage rate is:

Thus the welfare of the younger generation of the home country under

openness, relative to what it would have been under continued autarky,

will improve if the common world interest rate r + is greater than the

tion of the home country (with the high pure Â·rate of time preference) will

suffer a welfare loss as a result of integration into the world economy

while the young generation of the foreign country enjoys a welfare gain.

The argument assumes that at the time of integration, t, the capital-

labor ratio of the home country is not above the capital-labor ratio of

the foreign country.        This will always be the case if either the two

countries started off from the same initial condition (Proposition 4)

or, from arbitrary initial conditions, the system had been evolving

under autarky for a sufficiently long period of time (Propositions 2, 3

and 5).

     The impact effect of participation in the world economy on welfare is

therefore unambiguous.        The opportunity sets of the retired citizens of

both countries alive at the moment of the transition are unaffected.              Their

welfare is the same as under continued autarky,            The utility of the young

in the high time preference country is lowered, while the utility of the

young in the low time preference country is raised.            The economic intui-

tion is clear,        Under autarky the low time preference country will have

a higher real wage and a lower interest rate.            During the period that the two

countries are integrated into a world economy, the young citizens of the

low time preference country inherit a high real wage from the autarky

phase,   The interest rate at which they can transfer resources into re-

tirement is higher than under autarky, however,            There has been an out-

flow of capital from the low time preference, low interest country to the

high time preference, high interest country, and the common world rate of

interest lies between the two interest rates that would have prevailed

under continued autarky,       The budget constraint of the      IQW   time preference

country's young generation pivots up, that of the high time preference

country's young generation pivots down.

                     continued autarky.                 The opposite holds for the low time preference coun-

                     try.      This pattern is repeated in every following period.                                  Thus the effect

                     on welfare is ambiguous, as is evident from the budget constraints drawn

                     in Figures 6.a and 6.b.


                     Long-run effects

                              It is not possible, except in special cases, to make unambiguous wel-

                     fare comparisons by comparing steady-state utility levels--the ranking of

                     the stationary utility levels may not be the same as the ranking of the

                     utility levels achieved during the transition from one steady state to

                     another.         Nevertheless, the stationary utility levels achieved under

                     autarky and openness are of interest.                              They are analyzed next.        There are

                     several cases to consider, illustrated in Figure 7a-g.                                    In Figure 7a the

                     autarky capital-labor ratios of both countries are in the inefficient

                     region, above the golden rule capital-labor ratio.                                  The autarky equi-

                     librium of the home country is at E~T, that of the foreign country at

                     E~ (Proposition 5).                    The golden rule capital-labor ratio is at E*.
                                                                                                               T

                     capital-labor ratio is between the two closed economy capital-labor

                     ratios (Proposition 8).                    Overaccumulation (relative to the golden rule)

                     is reduced in the foreign country, increased in the home country.                                     Be-

                     cause the slope of the autarky budget constraint of the hon:e country is

                     steeper than the slope of the open economy budget constraint, and be-

                     cause of the strict convexity of the indifference curves, the stationary
                                            -31-


    level of utility for the home country (the high pure rate of time pref-

    erence country) is always strictly greater under openness than under

    autarky.   This has to be balanced against the short-run losses incurred

    'when the transition occurs.         In Figure 7aÂ» these short-term losses are

    reflected in the need of       th~   home country to raise the steady-state

    capital-labor ratio from E~T to~.              In Figure 7a the stationary utility

    level of the foreign country is less under openness than under autarky.

    Since the foreign country experiences a short-run welfare gain when
    the two countries are integrated into the world economy, one cannot

    argue that openness makes the foreign country unambiguously worse off.

    Figure 7b shows that it is possible for the stationary utility level of

    the foreign country to be higher under openness than under autarky.
                                                                 NT      T
    Since the foreign country decumulates capital from E              to EWÂ» it can be

    said that in Figure 7b the foreign country experiences a potential pareto-

    improvement as a result of openness.

         In Figure 7c both countries have autarky equilibria at capital-labor

. ratios below the golden rule value.              The stationary utility level of the

i   home country under openness (at ET ) is always higher than under autarky
                                     H
         NT
    (at E ).   HoweverÂ» the home country r.eeds to accumulate capital from
         H
    ~T to ~ and will incur utility losses during the adjustment to the new
    steady state.   The stationary utility level of the foreign country unaer

    opennessÂ» at E~ is be.low that under autarky at E~T.           It decumulates from

    E~T to ~ and enjoys a short-run welfare gain during the transition.
    Figure 7d shows that when both countries have autarky equilibria below

    the golden ruleÂ» the stationary utility level of the foreign country may

    be higher under openness than under autarky.

         The. argument   do(~s   not change qualitatively vlhen the autarLy    t~<;,tlilibria


    of the two countries "straddle" the golden rule, with the foreign country's
                                    -32-


autarky capital-labor ratio above, and the home country's autarky capital-

labor ratio    below the golden rule capital-labor ratio.     ~igures   7e, f

and g illustrate three possible outcomes.     [It does not matter on which

side of the golden rule the open economy world equilibrium falls.]        In

all cases, the stationary utility level of the home country is greater

under openness.     This then has to be weighted against the short-run

losses incurred during the transition.     The foreign countr.y gains in the

short run and may have a lower (Figure 7e) or a higher (Figures 7f and 7g)

stationary level of utility.     Figure 7g illustrates the very special case

in which the world equilibrium is at the golden rule.

      An important clue to these welfare comparisons is provided by the
fact that international trade and financial mobility do not expand the

consumption possibility set of the "average" world consumer under openness

beyond that available to the individual countries under autarky.        OF in

Figures 4 and 7 is the stationary, decentralized consumption possibility

locus for each of the countries under autarky and for the integrated

world economy.     The same applies in the short run:   there are no poten-

tial gains in production from specialization.     The only difference that

openness makes is that a world-wide capital market is substituted for

two national capital markets.     The equilibrium in this world-wide capital

market will be an average of the two autarky equilibria in the national

capital markets.


4..   Conclusion

      Diamond I S overlapping generat:!.ons model is extended to a two-country

world.    A number of results are obtained.   lbe country whose residents

consu~e   more in the first period of their. lives (at a given wage rate

and interest rate) has a steady-state current account deficit if the rate

of population growth is positive.     The country with the higher pure rate
                                     -33-

of time preference has a steady-state current account deficit.           The

common stationary open economy capitcl-Iabor ratio lies between the two

autarky capital-labor ratios, with t.he lower         autarky capitnl-1abor ratio

associated with the country whose residents have the higher pure rate of

time preference.     Outside the steady     state~   the country with the higher

pure rate of time preference will not necessarily be the oae to run a

current account deficit.     The welfare of the old generation alive when the

two autarkic countries join in open economy is unaffected by this inter-

national econOmic integration.       The welfare of the young generation in the

country with the high pure rate of time preference is lower under openness

thanÂ· under autarky, while in the country with the low pure rate of time

preference it is higher.     The stationary utility level of the country with

the high pure rate of time preference is always higher under openness than

under autarky.     The effect of openness on the stati.onary utility level of

the low pure rate of time preference country is ambiguous.          If it is higher,

openness can be said to constitute a potentially pareto-superior regime for

the low pure rate of time preference country.          Because of the short-run

welfare loss it incurs after international economic integration, the open

economy is not pareto-superior to the closed economy for the high pure

rate of time preference country.

     The open economy version of the overlapping generations model can be

extended in a number of directions.         Within the context of the one-commodity

model, budgetary and financial policy can be studied; this includes public

sector lending and    borrowing~   taxation of wage and property income, social

security, etc.     The two-commodity structure of the Heckscher-Ohlin model

can be grafted onto the overlapping generations framework.          This allows

potential gains from trade througll specialization in production.         If one

of the goods is a capital    good~   the distinction betw0cn international

                          mobility of financial capital--international lending and borrowing--and

                           international trade in capital goods becoules important.                                One could have

                          either or both.                                  The two-commodity structure permits the analysis of

                           tariffs, quotas and other trade policies, familiar from the static

                          Heckscher-Ohlin model, in addition to the financial and budgetary policies

                           that can be studied in the one-commodity overlapping generations model.

                          Finally, uncertainty can be introduced into the model--most easily into

                           the two-commodity version.                                Without futures markets for commodities, house-'

                          holds have to make labor supply and saving decisions while young, wi.thout

                          knowing the future spot prices of commodities with certainty.                                  The scope

                           for further developments appears to be considerable.

a well-established part of the "Yale blackboard tradition" when I came to

Yale as a graduate student in 1971.                           James Tobin suggests that David Cass
