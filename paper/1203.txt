                    A Simple Account of the Behavior
                       of Long—Term Interest Rates



                               ABSTRACT


     Recent empirical research on the term structure of interest rates

has shown that the long—term interest rate is well described by a

distributed lag on short—term interest rates, but does not conform to

the expectations theory of the term structure. It has been suggested that

the long rate "overreacts" to the short rate. This paper presents a

unified taxonomy of risk premia, or deviations from the expectations

theory. This enables the hypothesis of overreaction to be formally stated.

it is shown that, if anything, the long rate has underreacted to the

short rate. However, the independent movement of the long rate is

primarily responsible for the failure of the expectations theory.

I.   Introduction.


     To a first approximation, long-term interest rates behave like

short-term interest rates.   For example, the yields on twenty year

Treasury bonds and on one month Treasury bills tend to peak and to

bottom out together. Thus people often speak of 'the level of inter-

est rates" without specifying maturity.

     The spread between long rates and short rates tends to be unusu-

ally small or even negative when short rates are high relative to the

experience of the last few years. Modigliani and Sutch showed that

the relation between long and short rates can be well described by ex-

pressing the long rate as a five-year distributed lag of short rates,

with the coefficients summing to about one and with substantial weight

on the current short rate. Recent experience upholds this characteri-

zation except that the distributed lag has become shorter (Ando and

Kennickell). Equivalently, the spread between long and short rates is

well explained by current and lagged short rates, with approximately

equal and opposite coefficients on the current rate and the sum of

lagged rates. (See table 1, row 1).

     This moving average relation could be consistent with the simple

expectations theory of the term structure, if investors look to the

recent past to form expectations about future interest rates. Whether

such expectations are rational depends on the time series properties

of short-term interest rates. Depending on the policy regime and its

implications for the movements of short rates, the observed distribut-

ed lag might correspond to a rational expectations theory of the term

structure, or a theory of overreaction or underreaction of long rates



                               —1—
to short rates, relative to the predictions of the rational expecta-

tions model. Experimental psychologists, such as Tversky and Kahne-

man, claim to have shown that people tend to overreact in their expec-

tations to evidence which seems superficially to be relevant, even af-

ter experience should have convinced them otherwise. This suggests

that there might be policy regimes where the long rate overreacts to

temporary movements in short rates. Of course, any such "overreac-

tion't might also be reconciled with the theory of finance if certain

covariances change with the short rate.

     A look at the data suggests an abrupt policy shift starting with

the Fed's new operating procedures in October 1979. We concentrate

here on the policy regime which prevailed between the 1951 Treasury

accord and 1979. Modigliani and Shiller claimed that for the early

part of the period the observed distributed lag was approximately con-

sistent with the time series properties of the short rate given a sim-

ple expectations model, and Sargent was unable to reject this hypothe-

sis with a likelihood ratio test in a vector autoregression. However,

more recent work has cast doubt on the notion that the simple rational

expectations model of the term structure is adequate even as a first

approximation to the behavior of interest rates. It was shown by

Shiller that when long-term interest rates are unusually high relative

to short rates they then tend to fall rather than rise as predicted by

the expectations theory.    Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz showed

that when six-month bill rates are higher than three-month bill rates

there is no tendency for the three-month bill rate to rise subsequent-

ly. Hansen and Sargent were able to reject the rational expectations




                                -2—
theory at the 0.5% level with a likelihood ratio test on postwar U.S.

data when an additional restriction involving the current long-term

interest rate was added to Sargent's earlier formulation.

    These results might be summarized as finding that the behavior of

long-term interest rates is dominated by a "risk premium" which is so

variable as to swamp out expectations in determining the slope of the

term structure. The phrase "risk premium" has been defined in various

ways in the term structure literature. We turn next to a discussion

which will clarify the relations among these definitions. This en-

ables us to state more formally the hypotheses that long rates over-

react or underreact to short rates, and it provides a framework in

which we characterize interest rate behavior.

II. "Well-Tempered" Definitions of Risk Premia.


    We make use here of approximations to holding-period yields and

forward rates which are obtained by linearizing the exact expressions

around the coupon rate on a long-term bond. These approximations were

developed by Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz who also investigated

their accuracy. Such preliminary linearization is essential if risk

premia are to be defined in a coherent way, that is so that Jensen's

Inequality problems do not make their interrelationships extremely

complicated. The analogy with the reconciliation of different keys in

music leads us to call our system a "well-tempered" one.

     We chose our definitions to facilitate comparison with bond

yields as commonly quoted. Bonds issued with less than a year to ma-

turity commonly carry no coupons, but longer term bonds generally pay

coupons which bring their sale price near par. It is natural then to

define the five year ahead ten year forward rate, for example, as the

yield on a ten year coupon bond to be purchased at par five years

hence. Such an asset can be constructed today as a portfolio of bonds

with maturities up to fifteen years. Similarly, the five year holding

return on a fifteen year bond is the yield to maturity on buying the

fifteen year bond, receiving its coupons, and selling it five years

hence (when it is a ten year bond). The fifteen year holding yield on

a five year bond is the yield to maturity on an investment in three

consecutive five year coupon bonds, reinvesting principal (i.e. roll-

ing over the five year bonds) but receiving coupons.

     The linear approximation to the j-period holding yield on an i-

period bond IS:

        is    the "duration" of an i-period bond selling at par with coupon

as defined originally by Macaulay. Duration is intended as a better

measure than maturity of how "long" a bond is. It takes account of

the fact that bonds with coupons derive much of their value from pay-

ments which are made earlier than maturity. Thus for bonds with cou-

pons, D0 =               0, D+ 1-D=g1, so D.<i for 1>1. For pure discount bonds,
R0 and duration and maturity are the same.

written either as differences between expected holding returns and

       Secondly, we can rearrange equation (3) so that it expresses the

j-period bond rate as a weighted average of forward rates of maturity

                            j




       Finally, we can rearrange equation (1) so that it expresses the

j-period bond rate at time t as a function of the i-period holding re-

turn on a j-period bond and the (j-i)-period bond rate at time t+i.

By recursive substitution, we obtain the following expression:


          (i,j)                      (j—i)/i                                (j—ki,i)

                                                                   )E 4)

       A natural interpretation of the notion that long rates overreact

to short rates is that long bonds are a 'good investment" when the

short rate is high.         In other words, the returns on long bonds over

some holding period tend to be higher than those predicted by the ex-

pectations theory when the short rate is high: the holding period or

rolling risk premium is positively correlated with the short rate.1 In



1
    Mankiw and Summers interpreted overreaction as the hypothesis that
    the long rate behaves according to the expectations model for a bond
    of shorter duration. This definition is consistent with ours, in
    that if long rates overreact in Mankiw and Summers' sense, and if
    the time series process for short rates is stationary, then the
    holding period risk premium is positively related to the short rate.
    The reverse is not necessarily true, however. We note that incor-
    rect duration, whether too short or too long, could never explain
    the observation that the slope of the term structure gives wrong
    signals about the future path of interest rates.

the next section we examine the relation between the one month excess

holding return on a twenty year bond, and the one month Treasury bill

rate. We do not calculate the twenty year excess return on a twenty

year bond, which includes the rolling risk premium, since we have only

just over twenty years of data. However, we study the rolling risk

premium indirectly by conducting an ARIMA analysis of the one month

bill rate.

III. The Behavior of Risk Premia.


     We can estimate     by regressing the excess return         -


on variables in the information set at t. The excess return is just

(D/D._1) times the forward-spot rate difference f1J)_ RJ1 so
equivalent results are obtained with this dependent variable.

     Kessel ran regressions of forward-spot rate differences at the

short end of the term structure on the short interest rate, and con-

cluded that the forward rate premium was positively related to the

short yield. Such a correlation could be taken to mean that long in-

terest rates overreact to short rates. However, our work with more

recent data shows that the effect of the short rate is, if anything.

negative (table 1, row 2). But the short rate has very little expl-

natory power; it is rather the spread between long and short rates

(table 1, row 3) which explains excess holding returns. This is a re-

flection of the perverse behavior of the slope of the term structure

in predicting future interest rates.2

     There has been an uptrend in interest rates since Kesse])s sam-

ple. This suggests an alternative overreaction or underreaction hy-

pothesis that risk premia may be explained in terms of the difference

between the short rate and a moving average or distributed lag of

short rates. In fact, our results so far would seem to suggest just

this, for by row 1 of table 1 the long-short spread which explains ex-

cess returns is itself well described as a distributed lag on short




2 We note here the curious fact that excess returns of common stock
  over short debt also bear a significant positive relation to the
  long-short spread (Campbell). This observation suggests that risk
  premia on different assets move together.

rates. The coefficients lead us to expect that the risk premium is

high when the short rate is low relative to recent experience. Never-

theless, when the excess return is regressed directly on current and

lagged short rates (table 1 row 4), the point estimates are statisti-

cally insignificant. This evidence is not inconsistent with rational

forecasting in the 1955-79 period. We note however that when the sam-

ple is extended to the end of 1982 the coefficient on the current

short rate becomes negative and significant at the 9% level, while the

sum of the lag coefficients is positive and significant at the 7% lev-

el. This could be taken to imply that long rates have underreacted to

short rates.3

     Another way to examine this issue is to conduct an ARIMA analysis

of the behavior of short rates. Shiller's volatility analysis sug-

gested that nonstatioriarity of interest rates might be necessary to

justify the behavior of long rates; we assumed this conclusion and

used monthly data over the period 1955-79 to estimate an ARIMA (1,1,1)

process for the 1-month bill rate. This specification has the impor-

tant advantage of being time consistent, that is independent of the

measurement interval. It implies that the long-short spread under the

rational expectations theory of the term structure should be a func-

tion of current and lagged short rates, with the influence of lagged

short rates declining geometrically at a rate equal to the MA parame-

ter, and with the sum of the coefficients on lagged short rates equal

to the negative of the coefficient on the current short rate. We

found that the likelihood function was very flat, but was maximized by



  We observe a similar underreaction in postwar British data (Shiller,
  data set 5).

 the rational expectations model implies that the coefficients in table

 1, row 1 should be -0.47 and +0.47 respectively, with a very slow de-

 cay within the distributed lag. The Modigliani-sutch distributed lag

 is roughly consistent with this, but has a more highly negative coef-

 ficient on the current short rate. This suggests that the rolling

risk premium tends to be high when the short rate is low relative to

its recent history.

     When the short rate and its distributed lag are included in a re-

gression together with the long-short spread (row 5 of table 1), we

find that both become significant, and the coefficient on the spread

triples. The fitted values in this regression look something like a

multiple of the residuals from row 1, suggesting that the significance

of the current and lagged short rates is due to the regression's try-

ing to purge the long-short spread of the component which is explained

by current and lagged short rates. When the fitted value and residual

from row 1 are included separately, only the residual is significant

(table 1 row 6). It is also the residual which in the 1955-79 sample

accounts for the violation, noted by Shiller, of variance restrictions

on holding period yields. When the sample is extended to 1982, how-

ever, both the fitted value and the residual explain excess holding

returns and violate the variance restrictions.

     We see then that holding period and rolling risk premia have if

anything been negatively related to short rates, suggesting that long

rates if anything have underreacted to short rates. If long rates had

been a distributed lag on short rates, with a somewhat larger coeffi-




                              —   11   —
cient on the current short rate and smaller coefficients on lagged

short rates, then excess holding returns on long bonds would have been

less predictable than they in fact were. But this sort of underreac-

tion was not primarily responsible for the failure of the expectations

theory of the term structure. The independent movement of the long

rate also violated the restrictions of the theory.     In the 1955-79

period, it was that smaller part of the spread between long and short

rates which was not explained by current and lagged short rates that

caused excess volatility in holding period yields and destroyed the

predictive power of the term structure.

    Salomon Brothers' Analytical Record of Yields and Yield Spreads gives
point sampled Treasury bill rates and bond yields monthly from 1950:1 to the
present.

    The 20—year bond yield has been quoted at the first of each month since
1959:1, while the 1—month Treasury bill rate has been quoted at the first of
the month since 1964:1. Before these dates, rates were quoted at the middle
of each month.

    First of month Treasury bill rates are available from the Treasury Bulletin.

    The data used in the paper are aligned as follows:

    Treasury bill rate: 1950:2 — 1958:12 middle of previous month (Salomon Brothers)
                        1959:1 — 1963:12 first of month (Treasury)
                        1964:1 — 1982:12 first of month (Salomon Brothers)

    Treasury bond rate: 1950:2 — 1958:12 middle of previous month (Salomon Brothers)
                        1959:1 — 1982:12 first of month (Salomon Brothers)

The transition from mid—month to first of month data does not distort the calculated
holding period yield except in 1958:12.

    Treasury bill rates were converted from discount basis to bond—equivalent yield
basis using the formula
                        R(1) = D/(1—D/l200), where D is the discount rate.

    Holding period yields were calculated using a duration for 20 year bonds of
152.5 months, or approximately 12½ years.
