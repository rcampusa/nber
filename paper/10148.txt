The Effect of Word of Mouth on Sales: Online Book Reviews

JEL No. L1, L8, M3

                                           ABSTRACT

We examine the effect of consumer reviews on relative sales of books on Amazon.com and

BarnesandNoble.com. We find that 1) reviews are overwhelmingly positive at both sites, but there

are more reviews and longer reviews at Amazon.com, 2) an improvement in a book's reviews leads

to an increase in relative sales at that site, and 3) the impact of 1-star reviews is greater than the

impact of 5-star reviews. The results suggest that new forms of customer communication on the

Internet have an important impact on customer behavior.

1. Introduction

Online user reviews have become an important source of information to consumers,

substituting and complementing other forms of word of mouth communication about the

quality of various products. Consequently, many managers believe that a Web site needs to

provide community content in order to build brand loyalty. (See, for example, McWilliams

(2000) or Fingar, Kumar, and Sharma (2000)). Despite this widespread belief, to our

knowledge, there is no literature documenting that community content plays any role in

consumer decision-making. Such a finding, it seems, is a necessary prerequisite for content

provision to be a profitable strategy.



There are many reasonable arguments as to why making investments in providing such

content could potentially be a poor strategy. First, it is not clear why users would bother to

take the time to provide reviews for which they are not in any way compensated. Second,

even if user reviews are provided, rival retailers can free ride on them; there is nothing to

stop a consumer from utilizing the information provided by one website to inform

purchases made elsewhere. Third, by providing user reviews, a site cedes control over the

information displayed; unfavorable reviews created by either legitimate users or by biased

interested parties may depress sales. Note that this may be less of a threat to a retailer that

sells many different brands as opposed to a manufacturer. Similarly, since authors and

publishers can freely proliferate favorable reviews for their own books, positive reviews may

not be credible and may not function to stimulate sales.1 Last, online user reviews may not

be useful, and may not stimulate sales due to the sample selection bias that is inherent in an

1 See Mayzlin (2003) for a theoretical treatment of recommendation systems where firms can anonymously
post reviews.



                                                                                                         3
amateur review process. That is, a consumer only chooses to read a book or watch a movie

if she perceives that there is a high probability that she will enjoy the experience. In the

presence of consumer heterogeneity, this implies that the pool of reviewers will have a

positive bias in their evaluation compared to the general population. Thus, positive reviews

may simply be discounted by potential buyers.2



In this study, we characterize patterns of reviewer behavior, and examine the effect of

consumer reviews on firms’ sales patterns. In particular, we use publicly available data from

the two leading online booksellers, Amazon.com (Amazon) and BN.comandNoble.com

(BN.com), to construct measures of each firm’s sales of individual books. Both BN.com

and Amazon allow for customers to post reviews on the site. However, Amazon’s

investments in “collaborative” consumer content have been more extensive and much-

imitated by other Internet retailers. By focusing on the differences between the two sites’

sales of the same books, we examine the relationship between the customer reviews at each

site and firm sales, controlling for other drivers of book sales.



There has been a long-held belief in marketing3 that word of mouth drives sales. Indeed,

this work contributes to the broader literature on the link between customer word of mouth

and sales, which has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, researchers have

used word of mouth to explain the adoption of high-yield varieties of seeds among farmers

(Foster and Rosenzweig (1995)), the adoption of tetracycline among physicians (Coleman

(1966)), as well as evolution of the ratings of new TV shows (Godes and Mayzlin (2003)).

2 In a very different context, Resnick and Zeckhauser (2002) find that 99% of the feedback ratings on
ebay.com are positive.
3 Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955) cited word of mouth as an important source of information for certain purchase
decisions.



                                                                                                         4
However, these studies have an important limitation in that they do not determine the

direction of causality between word of mouth and product sales. For example, Foster and

Rosenzweig (1995) infer that word of mouth was influential from the pattern of adoption:

their method does not allow for establishing the direction of causality.            Godes and Mayzlin

(2003) demonstrate that TV shows with more dispersed conversations experience higher

future ratings. However, the authors cannot rule out that the quality of the shows is driving

both the conversations and the ratings. In general, the studies that have tracked sales and

word of mouth over time suffer from an inability to rule out the alternative hypothesis that

word of mouth may simply be correlated with total sales.



Theoretically, causality may work in either direction. For example, in herding models such

as Banerjee (1992) and Bikhchandani et al. (1991), relatively small differences in signals

received by the customers who initially sample the product may have lasting long-range

consequences on the success or failure of a product – the early trials drive total sales. In

their model, then, word of mouth is an important driver of sales. Alternatively, it may be a

(noisy) signal of over-all performance since a product’s quality is revealed with time or,

perhaps, it may be correlated with an omitted variable, such as a successful advertising

campaign. In this sense, word of mouth is an early measure of a product’s success but not

necessarily its driver.4 For example, Van den Bulte and Lilien (2001) re-analyze Coleman’s

data to demonstrate that word of mouth influence on tetracycline adoption was over-

estimated in the original study due to a lack of control for the marketing efforts of the drug

companies.

4 For example, Eliashberg and Shugan (1997) show that critical acclaim seems to serve as an early indicator
of a movie’s over-all box office success.



                                                                                                          5
In this study, we are better positioned to establish the causality between word of mouth and

sales by comparing the sales and changes in sales of a given book across the two booksellers.

Consider a highly publicized and anticipated book release, such as Harry Potter and the Order of

the Phoenix, the fifth book in the popular Harry Potter series. We would not be surprised to

find both high sales of this book and numerous positive reviews posted online. Clearly, we

would not want to interpret the reviews as “causing” the sales of the book. However, the

“traditional” methodologies employed in the prior literature would be to examine the sales

of this book and the online reviews either through time, or in comparison to other books.

These methodologies would suggest a positive relationship between customer reviews and

book sales, but this relationship would not necessarily be causal in this case.



In our methodology, we examine the relationship between market shares and customer

reviews for a given book across the two sites. By focusing on the differences between the market

share of the book at the two sites, we are able to control for shocks to word of mouth and to

sales that are common to both booksellers and, instead, focus on the idiosyncratic shocks

alone. Consider a book that is generally well-reviewed and well liked. If a cranky consumer

posts a negative review of that book on Amazon, but doesn’t post that review on BN.com,

will the market share of the book at Amazon fall relative to the market share of the book at

BN.com?5 This “ideal experiment” is the basis of our empirical strategy.                   Of course, data

limitations force our analysis to differ somewhat from the ideal experiment, as we discuss

later. However, we observe the same books, their customer reviews, and a proxy for each

5 Here, we define market share of a book as the sales of that book relative to the sales of all other books on
that website. Of course, Amazon’s total sales are greater than total sales at BN.com. However, we can say
that a book is “more popular” at Amazon if it is the 5th most popular book at Amazon and the 10th most
popular book at BN.com.



                                                                                                                 6
book’s market share at each site. Our large database of books also allows us to control for

other important factors that might affect the relative market share of a particular book across

sites, such as differences across the sites in the price of the book or differences in the speed

with which the book has been promised to be shipped. Furthermore, in order to partially

rule out the hypothesis that the differences in word of mouth across sites are driven by

unobservable underlying differences in the two populations, we show that the two sites are

very similar in terms of customer preferences and reviewer behavior across broad categories

of books in our sample. Finally, as an additional robustness check on the direction of

causality, we obtain a second time point of data and examine the difference in the change in

reviews and change in sales across sites.



Our user review data contains a star rating provided by the reviewer as well as a text

description. In this paper, we focus our analysis on the star ratings. In fact, operationally,

the star ratings provide an excellent opportunity to measure the valence of comments

without analyzing the comments themselves, a very difficult task as demonstrated in Godes

and Mayzlin (2003). We examine the incremental sales effects of having reviews for a

particular book versus not having reviews and also the differential sales effects of positive

and negative reviews.



Briefly, our results highlight some interesting characteristics of reviewer behavior. Reviews

tend to be very positive on average, especially at BN.com. Under various specifications, we

show that, if a particular book has more reviews and higher-starred reviews at one site, that

book will tend to have a higher market share at that site. Our results on review lengths




                                                                                                 7
suggest that consumers actually read and respond to written reviews, not merely the average

star summary statistic. Finally, we show that the results are robust to time series

specifications designed to explore the reverse causality hypothesis. Our paper also

contributes to the growing literature examining the economics of bookselling online. Recent

contributions to this literature include Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000), Clay et. al. (2001), and

Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003a, 2003b).



The rest of the paper is organized as following. In Section 2, we describe the data. In

Section 3, we describe the methodology and present results on the distribution of reviews

and sales across sites, providing further insight into the reviewing process. In Section 4, we

discuss in more detail the model specification. In Section 5, we present our empirical

analysis of the effect of word of mouth reviews on product sales. In Section 6, we present

some of the limitations of our data set and obtain additional data in order to rule out

arguments of reverse causality. In Section 7, we conclude.


2. Data

Our data consists of individual book characteristics and user review data that were collected

from the public Web sites of Amazon and BN.com. The goal was to generate a

representative sample of sites’ sales. Since we do not have access to this proprietary data, we

approximate a random sample of sales in the following way. First, we collect a random

sample of books released. In order to maximize the probability that a book would be

available on both Amazon and BN.com and Noble, we focus on a set of relatively recent

books: titles that were released in the last five years. One shortcoming of a random sample

of published books is that it overweighs books that have very few sales. One possible bias



                                                                                                 8
inherent in over-sampling these small titles is that word of mouth may be especially

influential on the sales of these books, since there is little a prior awareness of these titles.

Thus, in addition, we also extract a sample that consists of books that appeared at least once

on a bestseller list. Hence, the sample was generated from two sources:

    1) A random sample of books selected from a catalog “Global Books in Print” that

        were published in 1998-2002. (See Appendix for description of algorithm to

        generate the sample).

    2) Publisher’s Weekly bestseller lists: titles that appeared in the lists from 1/14/1991 to

        11/11/2002.



Since a given book can be released in many different formats (such as hardback, paperback,

etc), we use data from Bowker’s Global Books in Print.com to obtain a listing of all possible

English-language format releases of a given book. We discarded digital and audio format

releases. Fortunately, each title-format combination has a unique International Standard

Book Number (ISBN), assigned under the auspices of the International ISBN Agency in

Berlin. Though it may not be apparent to the casual user, both Amazon and BN.com and

Noble.com use the ISBN numbers to organize the cataloguing of books on their web sites.



Over a two-day period in May of 2003, we searched the two Web sites to extract a body of

data for each of the ISBN numbers in our sample.7 Our extraction included: the title,

author, publisher, release date, and format type of the book. We also gathered information

on the price charged for the book at each website, the promised time until the book would

ship, and data for the most recent 500 reviews of the book posted on the website (we

7 The data on Amazon was collected on 5/6/2003 and the data on BN.com and Noble was collected on
5/7/2003.


                                                                                                    9
extracted the number of stars assigned, the date the review was posted, and the full text of

the review).      Most books have far fewer than 500 reviews, but for those with more than

500 reviews, we also extracted the total number of reviews posted, as well as the average

number of stars assigned overall.



Last, both BN.com and Amazon provide a “sales rank” for each book on the site. These

sales ranks reflect the total sales of that book at that site relative to the sales of other books

at that site. Note that books with higher sales are associated with lower ranks.8 Chevalier and

Goolsbee (2003a) report that Amazon claims that for books in the top 10,000 ranks, the

rankings are based on the last 24 hours and updated hourly. For books ranked 10,001-

100,000, the ranks are updated once per day. For books ranked greater than 100,000, the

sales ranks are updated once per month (Amazon, 2000). Based on this system then, books

that have not been purchased in the past month would not be ranked. Many hundreds of

thousands of books, however, have a rank but almost certainly have less than one sale per

month. Italie (2001) claims that for these rarely purchased books, Amazon bases the rank

on the total sales since Amazon's inception. BN.com claims to update all the rankings daily

(BN.com, 2000).9 Thus, with the exception of the books that have very high ranks (low

sales) on Amazon, the rankings represent a current snapshot of sales.



Amazon and BN.com provide identical reviews for all of the different formats of a given

title. Since we do not want the dataset to include duplicate information, we examine sales

8 In this study, we refer to higher-ranked books as books with higher numerical values of ranks or lower
sales. This differs from every-day usage, where, for example, the “highest-ranked” sports team is ranked
number 1.
9 Since BN.com provides rankings on tens of thousands of books that average far less than one sale per day,
this statement cannot be completely accurate. They would not provide us any more detail on their ranking
system (despite repeated requests).


                                                                                                              10
and reviews only for the most popular ISBN (format) within a title. We then exclude from

our analysis those books for which the most popular ISBN (format) within the title is

different at Amazon and BN.com. That is, if the hardcover is the better seller at Amazon

and the paperback is the better seller at BN.com, we exclude the book from our sample.

This creates a sample of 2505 ISBN codes. Since we are not aggregating across books, we

can use the sales ranks as is in our analysis, and discuss the impact of reviews on sales ranks

directly. However, an extension of the methodology described in Chevalier and Goolsbee

(2003a) and Schnapp and Allwine (2001) will allow us to also calibrate the sales rank

relationships into total sales relationships.   Any such calibration will be “back of the

envelope”, but will give us an opportunity to understand very approximate magnitudes.



We only include in our sample those books that are listed as “available” at both sites.

Finally, we are forced to address the problem that BN.com only provides sales ranks for

approximately 650,000 books and address the issue of “stale ranks” on Amazon. There are

books at BN.com that are available for purchase but for which the rank is “too high” (sales

are too low) to be disclosed. Amazon does not censor their sales ranks and they appear to

range upwards of one million.     If we were to use as our sample all books with prices and

ranks at both sites, our sample would contain a large number of books that are relatively

popular at BN.com, and relatively unpopular at Amazon. However, books that are relatively

popular at Amazon and relatively unpopular at BN.com would not appear in the sample, as

they have been censored out by BN.com’s rank reporting strategy.              To address this

asymmetry, we remove those books with ranks above 650,000 at Amazon.                     More

importantly, removing these books serves to remove books for which the ranks are updated

very infrequently. As we argued earlier, for books with very high ranks, the ranks no longer



                                                                                            11
represent a snapshot of current sales. Due to this, the sales could have preceded the posting

of reviews on the site, in which case we would want to avoid concluding that customer

reviews had any causal relationship to sales. The final sample contains 2394 observations,

1093 of which have reviews posted at both sites.



Table 2 presents the summary statistics for our data. The average sales ranks and the

average prices in the sample are very similar across the two sites. Most of the books have a

promised delivery of 24 hours (96% at Amazon and 88% at BN.com). However, Amazon

and BN.com use other shipping categories such as “usually ships in 2-3 days” or “Special

order: usually ships in 1-2 weeks.” The two notable differences across the two sites are: 1)

BN.com prices are significantly higher (as can be shown in a paired t-test),10 2) Amazon has

more reviews than BN.com.



3. The Reviewing Process and the Distribution of Reviews

In this section, we provide information about the characteristics of reviews and compare the

differences in preferences for different categories of books across the two sites.



Table 3 presents the cumulative distribution function on the number of reviews across the

two sites. As is expected from the summary information, BN.com has a much higher

fraction of books with zero reviews compared to Amazon (54.22% versus 12.61%). The

median of the distribution on the number of reviews on Amazon is 11. However, both sites

contain a few books with an enormous number of reviews. Interestingly, the two most

reviewed books at each site were part of the “Harry Potter” series (by J.K. Rowling): Harry

10 While BN.com is currently more expensive than Amazon.com, this has not always been true historically.
See Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003a), for example.



                                                                                                      12
Potter and the Goblet of Fire with 4457 reviews on Amazon, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of

Azkaban with 956 reviews on BN.com.



It is interesting to compare the frequency with which reviews are posted on Amazon and

BN.com to review frequencies in other contexts.           For example, Resnick and Zeckhauser

(2003) find that over half of buyers on Ebay.com provide some feedback on a completed

transaction. In contrast to Ebay, where a transactor can post feedback once and only once

per completed transaction, the number of reviews at Amazon and BN.com may, in principle,

be unrelated to those sites’ past sales of the books. Customers who purchased a book

elsewhere could post a review, and it is fairly simple for customers to post multiple reviews

of a book. Nonetheless, these data suggest that review posting is, relative to feedback

provision at Ebay, quite rare. For example, Amazon reported that its cumulative pre-orders

of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire totaled 350,000 one minute before the book’s release in July of

2000. It continued to be on the USA Today national top-ten bestseller list for the next two

and half years, so it is likely that Amazon sold many more copies of the book after its

release. The 4457 reviews of the book posted on the site, then, are very small in comparison

to the site’s overall sales of the book.



Next, we present the results on the distribution of star ratings in our sample, conditioning on

a book having non-zero reviews on both sites. As Table 4 demonstrates, the average star

ratings on both sites are quite high. It is interesting to compare the distribution of reviews in

this paper to the distributions found in other contexts.              For example, Resnick and

Zeckhauser (2003) find that 48.3% of buyers on Ebay.com provide no feedback on

transactions, 51.2% provide positive feedback, and only 0.5% provide negative or neutral



                                                                                                   13
feedback. In this sense, the reviews in this paper have a lot more variance in ratings than the

feedback on Ebay.com. There are a number of reasons that can be used to explain this

difference, including the fact that on Ebay both sellers and buyers rate each other, which can

result in an incentive to post positive reviews by the buyer that are in turn reciprocated by

the seller. Godes and Mayzlin (2003) find that in their sample of online conversations about

TV shows, within the sub-sample where conversations could be described as either negative

or positive, about 70% of posts were in fact positive. Thus, in all three settings, despite a

predominance of positive reviews, there is some variance on the valence of reviews.



In addition, the reviews on BN.com are significantly more positive than the reviews on

Amazon. An implication of this may be that consumers may be more skeptical when

reading a 5-star review on BN.com, compared to a 5-star review on Amazon, which would

imply that in our estimation we should account differentially for the effect of star ratings on

the two sites. However, despite this general upwards bias, a significant number of reviews

have 1 – 3 stars.



Beyond the ratings given by the reviewers, there might be additional information contained

in the message text. Unfortunately, reading the reviews is an extremely costly task, and the

measures obtained are very noisy as is shown by Godes and Mayzlin (2003). However, one

relatively cost-effective measure of the review text is the length (total number of typed

characters) contained in the review. A priori, it is not completely clear how to interpret this

measure. One possibility is that a longer review represents more effort on the part of the

reviewer. Another possibility is that a longer explanation is required to support a “mixed”

review. We find partial support for the latter interpretation: Table 5 shows that, at both



                                                                                              14
sites, 1-star and 5-star reviews are much shorter than 2-star, 3-star, and 4-star reviews.

Another pattern that emerges is that Amazon reviewers post longer reviews at all star levels

than do their peers at Bn.com. This can be due to several reasons, such as Amazon’s efforts

to elicit more nuanced reviews from its consumers.



4. Model Specification

Consider a book i that is sold on Amazon and BN.com. The book’s sales rank on a site is a

function of a book fixed effect (which may include either off-line promotion, the quality of

the book, or the popularity of the author) as well as other factors. That is,

        ln(rank Ai) = ν i + α Aln(PAi) + γAln(PBi) + XΓA + S Π A + ε Ai                  (1)

        ln(rank Bi) = ν i + α Bln(PBi) + γBln(PAi) + XΓB + S Π B + ε Bi                  (2)

where rank denotes the sales rank, the superscripts A and B refer to Amazon and BN.com

respectively and the subscript i indexes the book title. P denotes price. X denotes the vector

of review variables from both sites: we allow Amazon reviews to affect BN.com’s

customers and BN.com’s reviews to affect Amazon’s customers. S is a vector of dummy

variables summarizing the shipping times promised by each website for each book. For each

book, S has a 1 for the promised ship time category at Amazon and a 1 for the promised

ship time category for that book at BN.com.



Note that we would expect the unobservable book fixed effect, ν i, to be correlated with the

review variables. Thus, omitting this effect would bias the coefficients on the review

variables. In order to eliminate ν i , we estimate (1) – (2) in Section 5,

        ln(rank Ai) – ln(rank Bi) = β Aln(PAi) + βBln(PBi) + XΓ + SΠ + ε i               (3)




                                                                                               15
Because S is exhaustive of all of the shipping time categories, we do not include a constant

term in the regression. In the interest of space, we don’t present the parameters of Π in the

tables in Section 5.



To ensure that (3) is identified, we need to make the following assumptions:

        A1) The universe of books offered at the two sites is the same.

        A2) The two sites draw from the same population of consumers.

        A3) The reviews generated on a site are more likely to impact that site’s customers.

        A4) There is variance in consumer reviews across the two sites.

Assumption (A1) ensures that comparison in ranks across the two sites is meaningful. To

examine the reasonableness of A1, we examined the availability of books at BN.com that

were unavailable at Amazon and vice versa. We found that, in a sample of 20,228 ISBNs

(the starting point for the sample in this paper), 9577 were unavailable at Amazon.com and

9301 were unavailable at BN.com. Of these, 7912 were unavailable at both sites. Books that

were unavailable at BN.com but available at Amazon.com had an average Amazon.com

ranking of 817,551, indicating very low sales, low enough to be censored out of our

specifications below.



Assumption (A4) appears to hold in our sample. In our sample of 2394 books, the

correlation between a book’s average star on the two sites is relatively low: 0.329 (see Table

7).   We have no mechanism for proving that (A3) holds. Indeed, there is some evidence

that reviews do exert influence beyond the site on which the reviews are posted. For

example, the success of a recently released best-seller “DaVinci Code” was attributed partly




                                                                                             16
to an endorsement by a prolific Amazon reviewer: Francis McInerney.11 However, if

reviews had an equal impact on both sites’ customers, the effect of reviews would cancel out

in Equation (3): we would observe no effect of reviews on rank difference. In this sense, to

the extent that (A3) fails to hold, our measures of the relationship between reviews and sales

at a particular site are an underestimate of the true influence on reviews on sales.



Finally, demonstrating that (A2) holds is crucial for identifying Equation (3). That is,

suppose that BN.com customers prefer fiction to non-fiction, while Amazon customers

have opposite preferences. We would observe higher ratings and higher market shares for

fiction books on Amazon, and higher ratings and higher market shares for non-fiction books

and BN.com. However, the inferred link between ratings and sales would be essentially due

to differences in preferences across the users of the two sites.



In terms of the equations above, suppose that (1) and (2) also contain a book-site fixed

effect that is correlated with the review variables:

         ln(rank Ai) =µiA + ν i + α Aln(PAi) + γAln(PBi) + XΓA + S Π A + ε Ai                   (4)

         ln(rank Bi) = µiB + ν i + α Bln(PBi) + γBln(PAi) + XΓB + S Π B + ε Bi                  (5)

In this case, these effects would not cancel out in (as in 3) and their omission would bias the

coefficients on review variables:

         ln(rank Ai) – ln(rank Bi) = µiA − µiB + β Aln(PAi) + β Bln(PBi) + XΓ + SΠ + ε i        (6)

To eliminate µiA − µiB , we need to obtain another time point of data and to difference (6)

across time. This is our strategy in Section 6, where we relax (A2) and estimate:

11 Paumgarten, N. “No. 1 Fan Dep’t Acknowledged,” www.newyorker.com, Issue of 2003-05-05, posted
2003-04-28.
13 In fact, each book may contain up to 6 subjects. We used first subject only in this study.



                                                                                                      17
        ∆[ln(rank Ai) – ln(rank Bi)] = β A ∆ln(PAi) + β B ∆ ln(PBi) + ∆XΓ + ∆SΠ + ε i   (7)



However, for most of the paper, we assume that (A2) holds. There is considerable evidence

to suggest that, in fact, this is a reasonable assumption. Below we demonstrate that the two

sites appear to have similar reviewer and purchasing preferences.            As a first cut, the

correlation between log ranks of individual book titles across the two sites is very high, 0.825

for the 2394 books in the sample. In addition, to address the issue of different subject

preferences, we collect data on book subjects. The book’s subject is in most cases classified

using the system provided by Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) and is

available on Bowker’s Global Books in Print.com.13 In cases where the BISAC subject was

not available, we used the subject classification on Amazon. Further, using the original

sample of 6429 titles, we aggregated the subjects into broader categories. The complete

classification is available in the Appendix.



In Columns 2 and 3 of Table 6, we present the results of normalized mean ratings for each

category. The normalized mean rating for category j at site k is defined as the (mean star

rating for books in category j at site k – overall mean star rating across books at site

k)/overall standard deviation of star ratings for books at site k. In constructing this measure,

we use only the sample of books that have non-zero number of reviews at both sites.



Reviewing patterns for different categories of books are remarkably similar across sites. In

particular, we find that the signs for normalized mean ratings are identical for all categories,

and the magnitudes are similar across the two sites for most categories. On both sites, for

example, juvenile fiction is the highest rated category. That is, reviews posted for books in


                                                                                              18
the juvenile fiction category are typically very positive on both sites. On both sites, the least

liked books are in the “serious non-fiction” category.



Finally, we also show that the sales within a category are similar across the two sites. That is,

for each individual book in the sample we can assign a number 1-4 based on the quartile in

which it falls in the distribution of Amazon log rank (we can perform the same procedure

based on BN.com log rank). Column 4 of Table 6 presents the percentage of books (by

category) for which the Amazon log rank quartile and BN.com quartile match.                    The

percentage of match exceeds 70% for all categories. This, along with similarity of reviewer

preferences, demonstrates a lack of obvious differences in purchasing preferences across the

users of the two sites.   Thus, given the evidence of similarity of consumers across sites, we

proceed in Section 5, assuming that (A2) holds.




5. The effect of reviews on sales

In this section, we examine the relationship between a book’s customer reviews and its sales

rank across sites:

        ln(rank Ai) – ln(rank Bi) = β Aln(PAi) + βBln(PBi) + XΓ + SΠ + ε i               (3)



Table 7 presents the correlation matrix for the full sample of 2394 observations. Table 9

presents the estimation results for this sample. Column one of Table 9 presents the results

for a regression in which no review variables are included, only prices at both sites and the

shipping dummies. The price coefficients reflect a combination of own- and cross-price

elasticities at both sites. The price coefficient for Amazon is positive and statistically


                                                                                               19
significant, suggesting that, when prices rise, sales ranks at Amazon become larger, that is,

sales fall. The price coefficient is negative for BN.com. This is as expected; recall that the

left hand side variable is ln(rank) at Amazon minus ln(rank) at BN.com. Again, when prices

rise at BN.com, sales ranks become larger, that is, sales fall at BN.com relative to Amazon.

The absolute value of the price coefficient is larger at BN.com, suggesting that sales ranks

respond more to prices at BN.com than at Amazon. This is consistent with the findings in

Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003a) that demand is more elastic at BN.com than Amazon.



For approximate magnitude measures, we refer to Schnapp and Allwine (2001). They have

proprietary data from a single publisher from May of 2001 relating that publisher’s sales at

Amazon to that publisher’s sales ranks. They fit the sales-ranks relationship for a subsample

of the publisher’s titles as:

ln(salesAMZN) = 9.61 – 0.78 ln(rank AMZN)

While they do not provide R-squareds or other measures of fit, the scatterplots they supply

suggest that the fit is very good and suggests no obvious objection to the underlying

distributional assumption. Since this dates from 2001, we scale up their sales estimates by

24%, the growth in Amazon’s North American sales in the two years intervening between

the time of our sample and the time of their sample. BN.com does not report data to

publishers in a way that allows them to make such a comparison. We assume that the basic

shape of the rank to sales relationship is the same at BN.com as it is at Amazon, but that it is

scaled down to reflect the fact that BN.com’s total sales equal about 15% of Amazon’s

North American sales.




                                                                                             20
Using the relationship between ranks and sales, we construct an example will give a general

sense of the magnitudes of the price elasticities. Consider a book whose other characteristics

led to a sales rank of 500 at both Amazon with a price of $10 at both sites. Increasing the

price at Amazon to $12 would be predicted to change the difference in the log ranks at both

sites to 0.28 , as for example would occur if the rank at Amazon moved to 580 and the rank

at BN.com moved to 437. What does that mean for sales? The calibrations described above

that extend the results from Schnapp and Allwine (2001), suggest that, in the example above,

Amazon’s sales of the book would fall from approximately 145 per week to 129 per week,

while BN.com’s sales would rise from approximately 21 units per week to 24.



Column 2 includes measures of the total number of reviews for each book. The variables

include the natural log of the total number of reviews at Amazon and the natural log of the

total number of reviews at BN. These are set to zero when the number of reviews equals

zero. We also include dummies, one that takes the value one when a title at Amazon has no

reviews (and zero otherwise) and one that takes the value one when BN.com has no reviews

(and zero otherwise). These results suggest that ranks are lower (sales higher) at Amazon

when Amazon has more reviews, and that ranks are lower (sales higher) at BN.com when

BN.com has more reviews. This is consistent with evidence from a different data sample in

Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003b). The magnitudes are non-trivial. Consider a book with no

reviews at either site whose price and other characteristics would suggest a sales rank of 500

at both sites. The posting of an additional 3 reviews at Amazon, if it didn’t alter the sales

rank at BN.com, would be expected to lower the sales rank to number 327, implying

incremental sales of approximately 57 books per week.




                                                                                                21
It is important to consider how to judge these results in the presence of possible endogeneity

bias. To consider this, it is important to recall that the sales ranks represent “current” sales,

while the reviews are largely older.   Fewer than 2% of the reviews in our sample were

written during the previous two months. Thus, the reviews predate the measured sales

temporally.   In unreported results, we recalculate all results in the paper using only data

from reviews that are more than 2 months old. This leads to almost numerically identical

results. However, the results could be an artifact of an endogeneity bias if there are

differences in preferences across the BN.com user population and the Amazon user

population. Our analysis of reviewing behavior does not expose such differences in

preferences, but nonetheless, concerns may remain. We argue that our “average star” results

below are less vulnerable to endogeneity concerns than the “number of reviews”

specifications, and, further, that the time-series results in Section 6 will help allay

endogeneity concerns.



The specification in Column 2, however, might be somewhat misleading in that obviously,

not all reviews are created equal. As the summary data in Section 3 showed, reviews are, on

average quite enthusiastic, with at least half of the reviews being 5 stars on both sites. Thus,

by including the number of reviews in Column 2, but omitting their content, we are

implicitly measuring the effect, on average, of new favorable reviews being posted. Column

3 of Table 9 improves upon this specification, by including the average star value of the

book’s customer reviews at each site in the regression. Note that the sign of the coefficient

on the Amazon no reviews dummy changes between Column 2 and Column 3. This is due

to the inclusion of average star value in Column 3. The coefficient on the no reviews

dummy must be interpreted keeping in mind that a book that gets its first review also



                                                                                               22
experiences a change in its average star rating (from zero to a positive number). Suppose

that a book has no reviews on either site. If it gets one Amazon review with 1, 2 or 3 stars,

its rank on Amazon will rise (sales fall), assuming that its rank on BN.com stays constant. If,

on the other hand, it gets a positive review: 4 or 5 stars, its rank on Amazon will fall (sales

rise). As expected, for both sites, the coefficients for the average star value suggest that sales

improve when books are rated more highly, but the effect is statistically insignificant for

BN.com. To illustrate the magnitude of the effects, consider a book with four 5-star

reviews at both Amazon and BN.com and a rank of 500 at both sites. Now imagine that

one of the 5 star reviews at Amazon were changed to a 1-star review. The coefficients imply

that, if BN.com’s ranking of the book were unchanged by this review change, the rank at

Amazon would be expected to fall to 603, an estimated change in sales of about 20 books

per week.



Column 4 focuses on a different way of measuring review valence. The fraction of reviews

that are 1 star reviews and the fraction of reviews that are 5 star reviews are included for

each site. As expected, the coefficients suggest that 5 star reviews improve sales and 1 star

reviews hurt sales in a statistically significant way at Amazon. The coefficient for 1 star

reviews for BN.com is of the expected sign and statistically significant at the 6 percent level.

However, the coefficient for 5 star reviews is almost zero but of the “wrong” sign.

Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the 1 star reviews have large coefficients in absolute

value, relative to the 5 star reviews, indicating that the relatively rare 1 star reviews carry a lot

of weight with consumers. This result also makes sense when one considers the credibility

of 1-star and 5-star reviews. After all, the author or other interested party may “hype” his or




                                                                                                  23
her own book by publishing glowing reviews on these websites.14 While the author can post

a large number of meaningless 5 star reviews cheaply, he or she cannot prevent others from

posting 1-star reviews.15



The robustness of the estimates in Table 9 is further examined in Table 10 (the pairwise

correlations are presented in Table 8 for this sample). In particular, in Table 10 we examine

only the subsample of 1093 books that have at least one review on each site. We drop the

“no review” variables, but measure the impact of number of reviews and star rankings for

this subsample. The results are similar to those presented above. However, the coefficient

magnitudes and significance levels for the variables measuring star rankings are somewhat

larger, emphasizing the importance of having higher star rankings for this subsample.



Finally, we examine the relationship between review lengths and sales. To do this, we repeat

the specification in Table 11, including the natural log of the average length of all of the

reviews for each book at each site. The coefficient is positive and statistically significant at

Amazon, negative and insignificant at Bn.com. This suggests, controlling for the star rating

of the book, longer reviews depress the site’s relative share. We check the robustness of this

result by replacing the average star measures with the fraction of 1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star

and 5 star reviews. We find these results quite robust.



There are (at least) two possible interpretations of this result. The first, which we view as the

less likely, is that encouraging longer, more useful, more nuanced reviews is in fact harmful

14 For one well-publicized example in economics, see Morin (2003).
15 One could argue that posting 1 star reviews of competing books could be a reasonable strategy for an
author. We acknowledge that this may be true, although it is not at all clear that two books on the same
subject, for example, are substitutes rather than complements.



                                                                                                           24
to sales. More likely, however, is that, within each site, the length of the review is correlated

with the enthusiasm of the review in ways that are not captured by the star measures. For

example, even within the realm of the statistically dominant 5 star reviews, there could be

differing degrees of enthusiasm. That is, some “read like” 4.5 star reviews, while some read

more like 5-star reviews. The ones that read like 4.5 star reviews might on average be longer

since they are more likely to be mixed – to mention the negative as well as positive aspects

of the book. We find some evidence for this in our data. Consider the subsample of 1093

books with at least one review at both sites. Within that group, consider the subsample of 5

star reviews. The average length of these 5 star reviews at Amazon is 796 characters for

books whose average Amazon star rating is 4 or greater, and is 849 characters for books

whose average Amazon rating is less than 4. Similarly, the average review length at Bn.com

is 491 for 5 star reviews for a book for which the average rating is 4 or greater, and 672 for 5

star reviews for a book for which the average rating is less than 4. Assuming that the

books with the lower average ratings have the “less enthusiastic” 5 star reviews, this at least

suggests that even within the 5-star category, review length is correlated with the reviewer’s

level of enthusiasm for the book. Regardless of the interpretation of the length results, the

results do seem to suggest that customers read and respond to the review content at each

site. However, longer reviews do not necessarily stimulate sales.


6. The effect of changes in reviews on change in sales

As discussed earlier, omitted book-site fixed effects could bias the results above. Such a

situation could arise if, for example, the customer populations at the sites differed in their

reviewing and purchasing preferences, or, if editorial reviews posted at one site but not the

other led consumers to both post more positive reviews and to buy more books. In this



                                                                                                 25
section address these concerns by obtaining additional data and utilizing a “differences in

differences” specification. The “differences in differences” specification below should

further lessen such concerns, as we argue in Section 4.



We collect review data for May 8 – July 8, 2003, and the ranks, prices, and shipping data as

posted on Aug 8, 200316 for the sample of 2394 books analyzed in the previous Section.

The specification we estimate is:

∆[ln(rank Ai) – ln(rank Bi)] = β A ∆ln(PAi) + β B ∆ ln(PBi) + ∆XΓ + ∆SΠ + ε i                 (7)

The differenced data controls for editorial content posted on one site but not the other, as

long as the editorial content is the same at both time points. Indeed, we do not expect that

there would be a lot of changes in editorial content over time since most professional

reviews appear either right before or soon after a book is published. Thus, differencing the

data across time should largely eliminate the impact of editorial reviews.

Finally, as we argued in Section 4, this specification eliminates a book-site “fixed effect.”

This specification would not eliminate time-variant population differences, but large effects

of this sort seem unlikely since the difference between the two data points is just three

months.



Out of the sample of 2394 books, only 2091 books were available at both sites in the second

period and contained rank information at both sites. In the two months under

consideration, new reviews were posted for 766 titles at Amazon and for 324 titles at


16 That is, ∆ln(PB for book i )= ln(PB posted in August for book i )- ln(PB posted in May for book i), while
∆ln(Number of reviewsB on Amazon for book i)= ln(Number of reviewsB in July for book i)- ln(Number of
reviewsB in May for book i ).
The one month gap between the last review data collected and the rank data collected was to eliminate the
possibility that the sales that possibly generated the reviews were included in the dependent measure.



                                                                                                               26
BN.com. There are only 276 titles that contained new reviews at both sites. In this set of

276, an average of 8.88 reviews was posted on Amazon (with an average star of 3.87) and an

average of 3.94 reviews was posted on BN.com (with an average star of 4.40). Thus, one

limitation of our analysis (which biases against significance) is that we have relatively little

new reviewing activity.



The results of the estimation are presented in Table 12. Columns 1 and 2 present estimation

results that include differences in average stars and number of reviews for the whole sample

of 2091 books and the sample of 276 books that had reviews at both sites. Columns 3 and 4

present results that include differences in fraction of 1-stars and 5-stars for these two

samples respectively. We can compare Columns 1 and 3 of Table 12 to Table 9 (Columns 3

and 4 respectively), and Columns 2 and 4 of Table 12 to Table 10 (Columns 3 and 4

respectively). As we can see, the magnitudes on price elasticities in Table 12 are lower than

in the previous tables. This may be due to relatively little variance in prices over time. In

contrast, most of the coefficients on review variables are actually higher in magnitude, even

though some are no longer significant.



Qualitatively, most of the results of the previous Section are replicated. Thus, an increase in

average star on Amazon over time results in higher relative share of the book on Amazon

over time (one month after the reviews under consideration have been posted). Similarly,

the opposite holds for change in average star on BN.com. The results for fraction of 5-stars

and 1-stars are also consistent with this intuition. We again find evidence that 1-star reviews

have a bigger impact than 5-star reviews on the same site. As expected, a n increase in the

difference in the number of reviews on Amazon over time is associated with a greater



                                                                                                   27
relative share of the book an Amazon over time. The only exception we find is for the

difference in number of reviews on BN.com over time. The coefficient is, surprisingly, of

the wrong sign (albeit, it is only significant in Column 4). However, it is important to notice

that the difference in the change in the number of reviews at Amazon and the change in the

number of reviews at BN.com continues to be negative. Thus an increase in the number of

reviews at Amazon relative to BN.com continues to improve sales at Amazon relative to

BN.com. Separately identifying the coefficients for the change in the number of reviews at

Amazon and the change in the number of reviews at BN.com may simply be impossible

given the limited number of new reviews in the sample.



7. Conclusion

We analyze reviewing practices at Amazon and BN.com. We find that customer reviews

tend to be very positive at both sites, that they are more detailed at Amazon, and that the

relative popularity of different types of books is very similar across sites. Our regression

estimates suggest that the relative market share of a book across the two sites is related to

differences across the sites in the number of reviews for the book and in differences across

the sites in the average star ranking of the reviews.



This evidence suggests that customer word-of-mouth has a causal impact on consumer

purchasing behavior at two Internet retail sites.   We believe that this has not been shown

before. That customer content impacts sales is certainly a prerequisite for differences in

customer content quality to have any impact on differences in revenues or profitability

across retailers. Our evidence however, stops short of showing that the retailer profits from

providing such content. For example, there is nothing in our evidence that shows that


                                                                                                28
customer reviews do not merely move sales around across books within a site. Since

Amazon has many more reviewers than rivals, its reviews are on average quite lengthy, and

its reviews are on average quite positive, it seems plausible to at least speculate that the total

number of books sold at Amazon is higher than it would have been absent the provision of

customer review features. Further, and more interestingly, our results show that customers

certainly behave as if the fit between customer and book is improved by using reviews to

screen purchases. One interesting extension to this research would be to examine whether

improving a customer’s satisfaction with his or her purchases affects subsequent customer

loyalty.
