                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper, we provide direct evidence on the behavior of markups in the retail sector across
space and time. Markups are measured using gross margins. We consider three levels of
aggregation: the retail sector as a whole, the firm level, and the product level. We find that: (1)
markups are relatively stable over time and mildly procyclical; (2) there is large regional
dispersion in markups; (3) there is positive cross- sectional correlation between local income and
local markups; and (4) differences in markups across regions are explained by differences in
assortment, not by deviations from uniform pricing. We propose an endogenous assortment
model consistent with these facts.

1         Introduction

Are markups procyclical, acyclical or countercyclical? The answer to this question is impor-
tant for evaluating macroeconomic models. Most empirical studies of the cyclical properties
of markups use structural approaches that rely on assumptions about production functions
and market structure.1 The literature, reviewed in depth by Nekarda and Ramey (2013), is
divided in its conclusions, in part because different studies resort to different assumptions.

        In this paper, we provide direct empirical evidence on the cyclical properties of markups
based on gross margins for the retail industry. We focus on the retail sector because its
predominant variable cost, the cost of goods sold, can be used as a proxy for marginal cost.2
Moreover, estimates of the frequency of price changes and other statistics based on retail
prices have often been used to evaluate the importance of nominal rigidities and to calibrate
macroeconomic models.3

        We study markups at three levels of aggregation: the retail sector as a whole, the firm
level, and the product level. The product-level analysis is based on scanner data from two
large retailers, one based in the U.S. and the other in Canada. These scanner data sets have
three important advantages. First, they include the price of every transaction, instead of the
average price across transactions. Second, they contain the replacement cost of every item,
which is a good proxy for marginal cost. Third, the data includes stores located in different
regions, which allows us to compute regional markups. We use these data data to study the
regional distribution of markups as well as the response of markups to local business cycle
conditions.4

      For example, Bils (1987), Hall (1988), Galeotti and Schiantarelli (1998), Rotemberg and Woodford
(1999), Bils and Kahn (2000), Kryvtsov and Midrigan (2012), Nekarda and Ramey (2013), Karabarbounis
(2014), Kim (2015), and Bils, Klenow and Malin (2017) infer the cyclicality of markups from the cyclicality
of the cost shares of labor and other inputs. Hall (2014) bases his analysis on the cyclicality of advertising
expenses. Collard-Wexler and Loecker (2015) infer the cyclical properties of markups using their estimates
of the production function.
    2
      See Eichenbaum, Jaimovich and Rebelo (2011) for a discussion of the conditions under which the cost of
goods sold is a good proxy for marginal cost. De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) use gross margins to estimate
long-term trends in markups.
    3
      Bils and Klenow (2004), a seminal paper in the micro price literature, uses retail prices from the consumer
price index to study the importance of nominal rigidities. See Klenow and and Malin (2011) for a review of
the micro price literature.
    4
      Our approach to estimating local business-cycle effects is similar to that used by Stroebel and Vavra
(2018), Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Hong (2015), and Beraja, Hurst and Ospina (2019). These authors
study how prices respond to local business-cycle conditions in order to draw inference about the effect of
monetary policy on aggregate fluctuations.


                                                       1
      Our main empirical finding is that gross margins are relatively stable over time and
acyclical or mildly procyclical. In contrast, sales and net operating margins are quite volatile
and strongly procyclical. These results are consistent across all three levels of aggregation:
for the aggregate retail sector, at the firm level, and at the product level. Our product-level
evidence suggests that the marginal replacement cost of goods sold is relatively stable.

      We also find that the response of gross margins to monetary policy shocks and oil shocks
is not statistically different from zero. In contrast, the response of net operating margins to
these shocks is negative and statistically significant.

      The relative stability of gross markups over time contrasts sharply with the large regional
dispersion in gross markups implied by our scanner data sets. This regional dispersion is
driven by differences in prices not by differences in marginal costs. We find that regions with
higher incomes and more expensive houses tend to buy goods with higher markups. These
higher markups are not driven by less intense competition. Instead, they reflect differences
in assortment rather than regional differences in markups charged for the same item. In
other words, high-income regions pay higher markups on an assortment of goods that is
different from the assortment offered and sold in low-income regions. Items sold in both
high- and low-income regions generally have uniform prices.5 Our regional evidence suggests
that permanent shocks might result in permanent changes in assortment and markups.

      Our empirical evidence sheds light on the plausibility of different macroeconomic mod-
els. Consider first models with flexible retail prices. Our evidence favors the standard
Dixit-Stiglitz model which implies that markups are acyclical. In contrast, models that im-
ply countercyclical markups, such as Ravn, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe (2008)’s deep-habit
model and Jaimovich and Floetotto (2008)’s entry and exit model, are inconsistent with our
evidence.

      Models with sticky prices at the retail level and procyclical marginal costs (e.g. Woodford
(2003), Golosov and Lucas (2007) and Midrigan (2011)) imply countercyclical markups that
are inconsistent with our evidence.

      In contrast, models with sticky prices at the retail level and acyclical marginal costs
(e.g. in Nakamura and Steinsson (2010), Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Hong (2015) and
Pasten, Schoenle and Weber (2016)) and models with prices and wage rigidities at the
  5
      Our evidence on uniform pricing is consistent with the results of Della Vigna and Gentzkow (2017).

                                                      2
manufacturing level (e.g. Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), Christiano, Eichenbaum and
Evans (2005) and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2015)) imply acyclical markups
that are consistent with our evidence.

    Search models where agents use time to search for prices generate procyclical markups
since workers search less in expansions when the wage is high (see e.g. Alessandria (2009)).
When this procyclicality is not pronounced, these models are consistent with our evidence.

    Existing macroeconomic models are generally inconsistent with the regional correlation
between markups and income that we document. The trade models proposed by Fajgelbaum,
Grossman and Helpman (2011) and Bertoletti and Etro (2017), which feature non-homothetic
preferences, are consistent with this regional correlation.

    We present an endogenous assortment model that draws on insights by Fajgelbaum,
Grossman and Helpman (2011) and is consistent with both our time-series and regional
evidence. Our model has the following properties: (1) markups are relatively stable over
time and mildly procyclical; (2) there is large regional dispersion in markups; (3) there
is a positive cross-sectional correlation between local income and local markups; and (4)
differences in markups across regions are explained by differences in assortment, not by
deviations from uniform pricing.

    In sum, we provide direct empirical evidence on the behavior of markups, as well as a
theory that is consistent with our findings.

    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data we use. Section 3 contains
our empirical findings. Section 4 discusses the implications of these findings for business cycle
and trade models. This section also presents an endogenous assortment model consistent
with our empirical evidence. Section 5 concludes.


2     Data

Our analysis focuses on the retail sector, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of aggregate
employment. We use three data sets. The first, obtained from Compustat, includes quarterly
panel data on sales, costs of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses, and net profits
for retail firms for the period from 1979 to 2014 . Our sample has 1,735 retail firms. In the


                                               3
Appendix, we show that the sales growth rates from the Compustat data for the retail sector
track closely the sales growth rates implied by the U.S. Census Retail survey data.

       Using Compustat data, we construct two margins for each firm f in quarter t:

                                         Salesf t − (Cost of goods sold)f t
                   (Gross margin)f t =                                      ,                          (1)
                                                      Salesf t

                                        Salesf t − (Cost of goods sold)f t − (Other expenses)f t
(Net operating profit margin)f t =                                                               ,
                                                                 Salesf t
                                                                                             (2)
                                                             (Other expenses)f t
                                      = (Gross margin)f t −                      .
                                                                  Salesf t
Other expenses include overhead expenses, rent, labor costs, and capital and property de-
preciation. For retail firms, these expenses are predominately fixed or quasi-fixed costs.

       Our second data source is a scanner data set from a large retailer that operates more
than 100 stores in different U.S. states. This retailer sells products in the grocery, health
and beauty, and general merchandise categories. We have weekly observations on quantities
sold, retail and wholesale prices for each item in each of the retailer’s stores. An item is a
good, defined by its stock keeping unit code (SKU) in a particular store. In total, we have
roughly 3.6 million SKU-store pairs across 79 product categories. Our sample period begins
in the 1st quarter of 2006 and ends in the 3rd quarter of 2009, so it includes the recession
that started in the 4th quarter of 2007 and ended in the 2nd quarter of 2009.

       Our third data source is a scanner data set from a large retailer that operates close to 1000
stores across different Canadian provinces. This retailer sells products in 41 product groups,
including clothing and footwear, toys, books, videos, sporting and camping equipment. We
have weekly observations on quantities sold, retail and wholesale prices for 15.6 million item-
store pairs. The sample begins in the 1st quarter of 2016 and ends in the 4th quarter of
2018, a period during which the Canadian economy experienced a modest expansion.

       Our scanner data sets have two key features that distinguish them from a number of other
scanner data sets.6 First, they contain the price of every transaction instead of the average
price across transactions. Second, the cost data measures the replacement cost, which is a
   6
    Data from this retailer have been used in other studies, including Anderson, Malin, Nakamura, Simester,
and Steinsson (2016), Anderson, Jaimovich and Simester (2015) and McShane et al. (2016).


                                                    4
good proxy for marginal cost. Moreover, the marginal cost is available at the store level,
rather than as a national average. This property allows us to compute the markup above
marginal cost for each item and store at each point in time.

      Using these two scanner data sets, we construct the gross margin for each item, i, at
store s, in county k, at time t:
                                                 Priceiskt − (Replacement cost)iskt
                    (Gross margin)iskt =                                            .              (3)
                                                              Priceiskt
Since the real GDP data we use to measure economic activity is available quarterly, we
construct gross margins at a quarterly frequency by expenditure-weighting weekly gross
margins.

      We define the growth rate of the gross margin from t − 1 to t for the subset of products
that are in stock at time t and t − 1 as:
                              P P
                                     s     i∈Ii,t−1,t   ωiskt−1 × Gross marginiskt
                       gkt ≡ P P                                                       ,
                                 s       j∈Ij,t−1,t   ωjskt−1 × Gross marginjsk,t−1

where
                                               Cost of goods soldisk,t−1
                             ωisk,t−1 =                                    .
                                             Total cost of goods soldk,t−1
and the cost of goods sold of an item is its replacement cost times quantity sold.

      We compute the chained gross margin as
                                                        t
                                                        Y
                           Gross marginkt =                   gkd × Gross margink0 ,
                                                        d=1

where Gross margink0 denotes the weighted-average of the gross margin in region k in period
0 computed using the cost of goods sold as weights. We use this measure of the gross margin,
whose construction resembles the Laspeyres index, to study the margin cyclicality generated
by changes in the margins of individual items. This measure abstracts from changes in
margin resulting from product substitution between time t − 1 and t.7

      We also use data on the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and estimates of monetary
policy and oil price shocks. The monetary-policy shocks are identified from high-frequency
Federal Funds futures data.8 Oil-price shocks are identified using the approach proposed by

shocks in the Appendix.


3     Business cycle properties

This section documents the cyclical properties of gross margins, operating margins, sales,
and cost of goods sold. We discuss the comovement and volatility of these series for the
aggregate retail sector, at the firm level, and at the product level.


3.1    Aggregate retail sector evidence

We construct aggregate measures of our variables for the retail sector using aggregate sales
and aggregate costs. Table 1 summarizes the elasticity of different variables with respect to
real GDP. This elasticity is estimated by regressing the year-on-year logarithmic difference
of each variable on the year-on-year logarithmic difference of real GDP.

    We see that gross margins are roughly acyclical or mildly procyclical. In contrast, sales
and cost of goods sold are highly procyclical. These properties suggest that firms are not
changing markups in response to business-cycle fluctuations. Rather, the business cycle
affects primarily their quantities sold and the cost charged by suppliers, which is why sales
and cost of goods sold are highly procyclical.

    Table 2 shows that gross margins are relatively stable when compared to other variables.
At a quarterly frequency, operating profit margins are 3.4 times more volatile than gross
margins, while sales and costs are roughly 2.6 times more volatile than gross margins. The
high volatility of operating profit margins compared to the volatility of gross margins suggests
that fixed costs might be an important driver of profitability. Figure 1, which depicts the
log-differences from the prior year of gross margins and operating margins, illustrates the
different volatility of these two variables.


3.2    Firm-level evidence

To study the cyclical properties of the firm-level variables, we regress each variable on the
year-on-year log-difference in real GDP using firm fixed effects. Our firm fixed effects takes

                                                 6
out any permanent differences across firms, including differences in the degree of vertical
integration between the retail and manufacturing operations.

       Table 3 reports our elasticity estimates. The elasticity of the gross margin is small and
statistically insignificant, while the elasticities of operating profits, sales and cost of goods
sold are positive and statistically significant. Consistent with the aggregate evidence, the
firm-level evidence suggests that business cycles primarily affect costs and quantities sold,
rather than gross margins.

       To study the volatility of a given variable at the firm level, we estimate the standard
deviation of this variable for each firm and then compute the average of this statistic across
firms. We report our results in Table 4. Operating profit margin is the most volatile variable
in our sample while gross margin is the least volatile.

       Finally, we study the conditional response of the gross margin and the operating profit
margin to high-frequency monetary-policy shocks and oil-price shocks.9 We estimate this
response by running the following regression separately for the gross margin and the net
operating profit margin:


                                              X
                           ∆ ln mit = β0 +         βk t−k + λq(t) + λr + ηit ,
                                               k

where ∆ ln mit is the year-on-year log-difference in the margin of firm i at time t. The
variable t−k is the aggregate shock at time t − k. The variables λq(t) , λr , and λi are fixed
effects for the calendar quarter, recession, and firm.

       Figure 2 depicts the implied impulse response functions. We see that the response of the
gross margin is statistically insignificant for both monetary and oil-price shocks. In contrast,
net operating profit margins fall in a statistically significant manner in response to both
shocks.

       Collectively, these results are at odds with the properties of simple New-Keynesian mod-
els, which generally predict that gross margins rise in response to monetary shocks and fall
in response to oil-price shocks. Monetary shocks are contractionary, so they produce a fall in
marginal costs. Since prices are relatively stable, the gross margin rises. Oil-price shocks are
   9
    Our scanner data does not contain enough time periods to allow us to estimate the conditional response
of the gross margin to shocks.


                                                    7
also contractionary, but they produce a rise in marginal costs and a fall in the gross margin.
In our data, the gross margin does not respond to either monetary or oil-price shocks.


3.3       Product-level evidence

There are two potential sources of measurement error associated with our aggregate data for
the retail sector. First, gross margins are constructed using average costs instead of marginal
costs. Second, changes in inventories affect the cost of goods sold and can potentially affect
the cyclical properties of our empirical measure of the gross margin.10 We now report
results that are free of these two sources of measurement error. Our analysis is based on
scanner data from two large retailers, one based in the U.S. and the other in Canada.
These data include transaction prices and replacement costs at the item level. Using this
information, we compute gross margins for every product in every store. We aggregate the
weekly observations to construct quarterly data.


3.4       Results for U.S. scanner data

We use our U.S. product-level data to show that the gross margins based on the cost of
goods sold used in the previous subsections are a good proxy for gross margins based on the
marginal replacement cost. We find that the correlation between the two measures of gross
margins is 0.96.

       Figure 3 shows how the U.S. retailer reacted to the onset of the 2009 recession. This
figure plots the distribution in the level of markup and in the year-on-year log difference
in sales and number of unique items for the periods 2006-07 and 2008-09. Each data point
in the distribution is a region-quarter observation. For confidentiality reasons, we do not
report the level of the average gross margin. In constructing Figure 3, we normalize the
gross margins by subtracting the average gross margin for the period 2006-07 from the gross
margins for 2006-07 and 2008-09. As a result, the normalized average gross margin for the
period 2006-07 is zero.

       We see that the regional distribution of the level of gross margins remained relatively
stable with a small shift to the left. In contrast, the distribution of year-on-year log difference
  10
    In Appendix A2, we present a version of our analysis where we adjust the cost of goods sold for changes in
inventories. We still find that the elasticity of gross margins with respect to GDP is statistically insignificant.

in sales is more skewed in the Great Recession than in the 2006-07 period.11 The distribution
of the number of unique items in each store shifted to the left. In other words, lower sales
are associated a smaller assortment and stable gross margins.

       Table 5 reports the average, median, 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution of
the three variables in Figure 3 for the expansion and recession periods. The gross-margin
moments are similar across the two periods.12 In contrast, the sales and number of item
moments are all lower in the recession period.

       To go beyond these unconditional moments, we now compute the elasticity of the variables
of interest with respect to the local rate of unemployment and local real house prices.13
Our approach is similar to that of Stroebel and Vavra (2018). We estimate the following
regression:
                         ∆ log marginsmt = β0 + β1 ∆ log(Zt ) + γXmt + εmt ,                               (4)

where m denotes the region and the variables are yearly log-differences. We consider two
possible alternative explanatory variables, Zt : the local unemployment rate, and house prices
instrumented with the housing supply elasticity proposed by Saiz (2010).14 Since the Saiz
(2010) instrument is static, for the regression specification that includes house prices we
consider the difference between the period 2005-2006 and 2007-08. For the regression spec-
ification that includes the unemployment rate, the regression is estimated at the quarterly
frequency and includes region fixed effects. The vector Xm is a set of controls including local
area income, racial composition, median age, manufacturing industry share of employment,
and share of college-educated workers.

       Table 6 reports our results. The elasticity of the gross margin is statistically insignificant
with respect to unemployment and it is positive and statistically significant with respect to
local house prices. The price and replacement cost elasticities are also statistically insignif-
  11
     This result is consistent with Bloom, Guvenen and Salgao (2015)’ finding that sales growth becomes
skewed during recessions.
  12
     For confidentiality reasons, we do not report the average gross margin, only the difference in the average
gross margin across the expansion and recession period.

     We thank Emi Nakamura for sharing with us data on unemployment for the regions included in our
scanner data.

     This instrument uses information on the geography of a metropolitan area to measure the ease with
which new housing can be constructed. The index assigns a high elasticity of housing supply to areas with
a flat topology and without many water bodies, such as lakes and oceans. In low-elasticity areas, it is more
difficult for the housing supply to respond to demand shocks, so these shocks producie larger movements in
house prices.


                                                      9
icant at a 5 percent confidence level. The elasticity of sales is statistically significant for
both the unemployment rate and local house prices, indicating that sales rise during periods
when the local economy booms. Finally, the number of unique items carried in the store is
procyclical; its elasticity is statistically significant at a 1 percent confidence level.

       Table 7 shows the standard deviation of year-on-year logarithmic changes in different
variables. We see that markups, prices and cost of goods sold are relatively stable. In
contrast, sales and the number of unique items in store’s assortment are quite volatile.


3.5       Results for Canadian scanner data

We run regression (4) using the Canadian unemployment rate as an explanatory variable
and region fixed effects, where a region is defined as a Census metropolitan area.15 Table
8 reports our results. Recall that our data covers a period in which Canada experienced a
moderate expansion. Quarterly real GDP growth rates ranged from 0.06 to 1.08 percent.
While there is not much variation in aggregate rates theres is regional variation in growth
rates. Our point estimates indicate that gross margins are slightly procyclical but the gross-
margin elasticity is insignificant at 5 percent significance level. We also find evidence that
sales are strongly procyclical and statistically significant at a 10 percent level. These results
obtained for a different country, set of goods, and cyclical period are broadly similar to those
obtained for the U.S.

       One advantage of the Canadian data is that changes in oil prices generate substantial
regional variation in economic activity.16 An unexpected rise in oil prices is a negative supply
shock for all regions and a positive demand shock for oil-producing regions. In Table 8 we
report estimates of β2 obtained by running the following regression:

               ∆ log marginsmt = β0 + β1 ∆ log(Zt ) + β2 ∆ log(Zt )Im + γXmt + εmt ,

where Im is equal to one if the region is a major oil producer and zero otherwise. We think
of the coefficient β2 as isolating the positive demand shock to oil-producing regions. We find
that the gross markup acyclical while sales and number of items sold are procyclical.
  15
     The Saiz (2010) instrument is not available for Canada, so we cannot run a version of regression (4)
using house prices as an explanatory variable.
  16
     Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador are highly dependent on oil production.



                                                   10
   Table 9 shows the standard deviation of year-on-year logarithmic changes in different
variables. As with our U.S. data set, we see that markups, prices and cost of goods sold are
relatively stable. In contrast, sales and the number of unique items in store’s assortment are
quite volatile.


3.6    Trends in retail markups

Our analysis so far has been focused on business-cycle properties, so our empirical work is
based on log-differences in markups. We now briefly examine the trends in markups present
in our data. Figure 5 displays the time series for the average gross margin in the retail sector.
We see that this margin has increased by roughly two percentage points in the mid 1980s
and increased again by three percentage points from about the mid 1990s onward. These
increases are consistent with the trends documented by De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017).
However, the trends in our data are much smaller than those estimated by De Loecker and
Eeckhout (2017) who use a structural approach. Our results are consistent Karabarbounis
and Neiman (2018) and Traina (2018) who find small long-run trends in markups.


3.7    Summary

In this section, we study the cyclical properties of the retail sector at three levels of aggre-
gation: the sector, firm and product level. Our main findings for sector and firm data are
as follows. Gross retail margins are stable over the business cycle and mildly procyclical. In
contrast, sales, cost of goods sold, and net operating profits are highly procyclical. The high
volatility of net operating costs is suggestive of the presence of large fixed costs. Operating
profit margins are much more volatile than gross margins which suggests the presence of
fixed costs.

   The evidence at the product level for our large U.S. retailer indicates that the firm reacted
to the 2009 recession primarily by reducing the number of unique items in its assortment.
Gross margins remained relatively stable, falling slightly. The evidence at the product level
for our large Canadian retailer is consistent with the notion that gross margins are acyclical
or mildly procyclical and that sales are strongly procyclical.




                                               11
4     Cross-sectional properties

We can use our scanner data to study the distribution of the level of gross margins across
regions. Figure 3 shows that the distribution of gross margins is relatively similar in the
Great Recession and in the expansion that preceeded it. Each data point in the distribution
is a region-quarter observation. The mean of the distribution is somewhat higher in the
expansion period, which is consistent with the notion that margins are slightly procyclical.
The same figure shows that there is a large regional dispersion in the markups charged by
our large retailer in both the expansion and the recession period.

    We can decompose the overall variance in the gross margins into a time-series and a
regional component. We denote by vmt the gross margin of region m at time t, computed
as a sales-weighted average of all items in stores located in this region. The variance of vmt
can be written as:
                     1   XX
       var (vmt ) =           (vmt − v)2
                   TM − 1 t m
                     1   XX
                 =            (vmt − vt + vt − v)2
                   TM − 1 t m
                   1 X m (vmt − vt )2          (vt − v)2
                       P               P P
                 ≈                    + t m              + 2cov(vmt − vt , vt − v),
                   T t | M{z− 1 } | T M{z− 1 }
                              vart (vm )            var(vt )


where T is the total number of time periods and M is the total number of regions. The
variable vt is the average gross margin across all regions at time t, computed as a sales-
weighted average of all items in all stores. The variable v is the average of vt across time.
The variables T1 t vart (vm ) and var (vt ) represent the average regional and time-series
                P

variance of gross margins, respectively. The variable cov(vmt − vt , vt − v) is the covariance
between the time-series and the regional component.
                                                                        1
                                                                            P
    Table 10 reports our results. The regional variance in markups,     T    t   vart (vm ), is 0.26
while the time-series variation, var(vt ), is 0.04. The covariance term, cov(vmt − vt , vt − v),
is −0.0015. This decomposition suggests that most of the variation in markups comes from
the cross section, not from the time series.

    To study the source of regional variation in markups, we start with the following equation
for the variance of markups across different markets conditional on period t, vart (vm ):

                                               12
                                                                             !
                                                                   X
                                vart (vm ) = vart                      vjm wjm .              (5)
                                                                   j

Here, vjm is the markup of product j in market m and wjm is the sales of product j in market
m as a fraction of total sales in market m.

   Expanding the terms on the right-hand side of equation (5), we obtain:

                                                    interaction term


   The first term on the right-hand side of this equation measures the importance of differ-
ences in gross margins for the same item. This term is zero when there is uniform pricing,
i.e. prices for the same product are identical across regions. The second term measures
the importance of differences in assortment holding fixed the gross margin across regions.
This term is zero when all regions have the same assortment composition. The third term
measures the importance of the interaction between differences in assortment and differences
in gross margins.

   Table 11 reports the average over time of the components of this decomposition for the
U.S. (panel A) and Canada (panel B). The first column of panels A and B reports results
obtained using all items, including items sold in only some of the regions. In both panels,
we find that the predominant driver of regional differences in gross margins are differences
in assortment composition across regions. In contrast, regional differences in the markups
of the same items account for very little of the regional variation in gross margins. In other
words, when the same item is available in different regions our retailers use roughly uniform
pricing.

   For robustness, we use our U.S. data to produced results obtained by restricting the

                                                              13
sample to items sold in all regions.17 We report these results in the second column of panel
A. Here, the regional variation results from regional differences in consumer baskets. The
results obtained using this restricted sample are similar to those obtained using the full
sample.

       Column 1 of Table 11 shows that gross margins in our U.S. data are positively correlated
with measures of income or wealth. These measures include the logarithm of household
income and the logarithm of median house value. In contrast, gross margins are uncorrelated
with a measure of competition (the Herfindahl index) and a proxy for higher transportation
costs (a dummy variable that takes the value one for counties classified by the census as
rural).

       We find that there is indeed a positive cross-sectional correlation between local income
and local gross margins. But these differences in gross margins across regions are explained by
differences in assortment, not by deviations from uniform pricing. Our findings are consistent
with recent work by Neiman and Vavra (2018) that shows that households concentrate
their spending on different goods. We add to their results by providing direct evidence on
differences in markups and assortment across regions.

       Column 2 of Table 11 shows that gross margins in our Canadian data are also positively
correlated with measures of income or wealth. These measures include the logarithm of
household income and the logarithm of median house value.


5        Macroeconomic and trade models

In this section, we evaluate several business cycle and trade models in light of our evidence.
We then present an endogenous assortment model that is broadly consistent with our time-
series and cross-section evidence.


5.1       Business cycle models

As discussed in the introduction, our evidence favor models that generate acyclical or weakly
procyclical retail markups. This class of models includes the standard Dixit-Stiglitz model
  17
    We do not compute the results for a sample of items sold in every market in Canada because the number
of these items is relatively small.

                                                   14
which has flexible prices at the retail level. It also includes models with acyclical marginal
costs and sticky prices at the retail level (e.g. in Nakamura and Steinsson (2010), Coibion,
Gorodnichenko and Hong (2015) and Pasten, Schoenle and Weber (2016)) and models with
prices and wage rigidities at the manufacturing level (e.g. Erceg, Henderson, and Levin
(2000), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Tra-
bandt (2015)). However, none of these models are consistent with our finding that markups
and income are correlated in the cross section.


5.2     Trade models

Trade models with non-homothetic preferences generate a positive correlation between markups
and income. Bertoletti and Etro (2017) consider a version of the Dixit-Stiglitz model of
monopolistic competition with a non-homothetic aggregator. Fajgelbaum, Grossman and
Helpman (2011) propose a model with non-homothetic preferences in which households con-
sume an homogeneous good and a single unit of a differentiated good. Households choose the
quantity of the homogeneous good and the quality of the differentiated good. We discuss the
properties of these two models in turn. Both models are static so income and consumption
expenditures coincide.


5.2.1   The Bertoletti and Etro model

Bertoletti and Etro (2017) write the household’s indirect utility function as:
                                      Z n
                                          µ(pi /Y )di,
                                        0

where pi denotes the price of differentiated good i and Y represents income. The authors
show that when µ(.) takes an exponential form,

                                µ(pi /Y ) = exp [−τ (pi /Y )] ,

the markup of price over marginal cost (c) is given by:
                                        pi    Y
                                           =1+ .
                                        c     τc
When µ(.) takes an addilog form,


                                              15
                                µ(pi /Y ) = [a − (pi /Y )]1+γ ,

the markup of price over marginal cost (c) is given by:
                                      pi   γ + a(Y /c)
                                         =             .
                                      c       1+γ

   Consistent with our time-series evidence, as long as the cyclicality of income and marginal
costs is similar, markups are roughly acyclical. The model is also consistent with our cross-
sectional evidence. Suppose that marginal costs are similar across regions but there is dis-
persion in income levels. Then, higher income regions pay higher markups.

   However, this model is inconsistent with the nature of the regional variation in markups
present in our data. Our evidence suggests that markups vary with income or wealth because
rich and poor regions buy different assortments. In contrast, the Bertoletti and Etro (2017)
model implies that regions with different levels of income have different markups for the
same item.


5.2.2   The Fajgelbaum, Grossman and Helpman model

The model proposed by Fajgelbaum, Grossman and Helpman (2011) is fully consistent with
our cross-sectional evidence under the assumption that there is less substitutability between
brands of higher quality than between brands of lower quality. Under this assumption, the
model implies that regions with higher income pay higher markups but consume higher
quality items. So variations in markups are driven by differences in assortment, just like in
our scanner data.

   Unfortunately, the Fajgelbaum, Grossman and Helpman (2011) model is inconsistent
with our time-series evidence. The markup over marginal cost (ci ) for an item of quality qi
and brand j is:
                                       pij        θi
                                           =1+          ,
                                        ci       q i ci
where θi is the dissimilarity parameter. This formula implies that, when marginal costs are
procyclical, the model generates countercyclical markups for each item i.

   A version of the Fajgelbaum, Grossman and Helpman with sticky wages might be con-
sistent with both the time-series and cross-sectional evidence. But such a model would

                                              16
have complex borrowing and lending across agents that would greatly reduce its tractability.
Instead of exploring such a model, we consider a version of the Dixit-Stiglitz model that
embodies a central insight from Fajgelbaum, Grossman and Helpman (2011): higher quality
consumption bundles are made of less substitutable components.


5.3       An endogenous assortment model

We consider a model in which the assortment of goods available to the consumers is endoge-
nous. In equilibrium, producers who sell in higher-income regions offer consumers higher-
quality goods that have higher markups.

       Our economy is populated by a representative household who maximizes its lifetime
utility given by:
                                   ∞
                                   X
                                         βt log Ctα Zt1−α + θt log(1 − Nt ) .
                                                                         
                          U = E0                                                                  (6)
                                   t=0
The symbol E0 denotes the expectation conditional on the information set available at time
zero. The variables Nt and Zt denote hours worked and consumption of an homogenous
good, respectively. The variable θt represents a shock to the labor supply.

       A consumption bundle Ct with quality qt is a composite built with an assortment of nt
differentiated goods combined according to a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator:
                                        Z nt           v(qt )
                                      γ        1/v(qt )
                               C t = qt       xiqt di           ,
                                                0

where xiqt is the quantity consumed of variety i with quality q at time t. We assume that
v(qt ) is an increasing function of qt . So, as in Fajgelbaum, Grossman and Helpman (2011),
higher-quality consumption bundles are produced with an assortment of more differentiated
inputs.

       For tractability, we consider the simple case in which v(qt ) is a linear function, so vt is
equal to the quality of the inputs (vt = qt ) and the consumption aggregator is given by:

We assume that γ > 1 which implies that, other things equal, households prefer higher
quality baskets.18 We also assume that there’s a minimum consumption size for each variety.
  18
    See Faber and Fally (2018) and Jaimovich, Rebelo, Wong, and Zhang (2019) for evidence that higher-
income households consume higher-quality goods.

                                                    17
For convenience, we normalize this minimum size to one:

                                                    xivt ≥ 1.

In the absence of a minimum consumption size, households would want to consume infinites-
imal amounts of goods with infinite quality.

    We can solve the household’s problem in two steps. The first step is to find the efficient
consumption of varieties, minimizing total expenditure, for a given level of Ct , C̄t :

Households choose the quality of the consumption bundle, qt , and the amount consumed of
each individual variety with quality qt , xivt . The first-order condition for the optimal choice
of xivt is:
                                                    ν /(1−νt )
                                       xivt     pivt t
                                            =                    .
                                       xjvt     pjvt
The elasticity of substitution between any two varieties is −νt /(1 − νt ) ≥ 0. An increase in
v reduces the elasticity of substitution, so goods are less substitutable. As vt goes to ∞, the
elasticity converges to one which corresponds to the Cobb-Douglas case.

    The optimal allocation of the differentiated consumption goods satisfies the condition,


                                          γ/vt           (vt −1)/vt (1−vt )/νt
                                 pivt = νt         Pt C t          xivt        .

Here, Pt is the price index associated with the bundle Ct :

    The second step in solving the household’s problem is to maximize lifetime utility subject
to the household’s budget constraint. The household’s income, Yt , is given by the sum of
labor income and firm profits:                                   Z     nt
                                      Y t = w t Nt +                        πit di.
                                                                   0




                                                         18
The household budget constraint is:
                                          Z    nt
                                   Yt =             xivt pivt di + Zt .
                                           0
We choose the homogeneous good as the numeraire, so its price is one. The first-order
conditions for this problem are:
                                      θ             wt
                                           = (1 − α) ,
                                   1 − Nt           Zt
                                     Pt Ct = αYt ,
                                          Zt = (1 − α)Yt .


Production Each intermediate good of quality vt is produced with labor:

                                    xivt = At (1 + g)t Nivt ,

where At is a stationary shock to productivity and g is the long-run growth rate of produc-
tivity.

    The monopolist of variety i supplies the level of quality, vt , demanded by consumers. Its
problem is to maximize profits given by:
                                              wt
                             πit = pivt xivt −        xivt − Ψ,                      (8)
                                          At (1 + g)t
where Ψ denotes a fixed cost denominated in units of the homogeneous good that the firm
must incur in every period of operation.

    The optimal price is given by the usual markup equation:


                                                         wt
                                      pivt = νt                  .
                                                     At (1 + g)t

Producers of the homogeneous good The homogeneous good is produced by compet-
itive producers using labor and the following production function:

                                      YtZ = (1 + g)t Nzt .

We assume that there is a continuum of measure one of homogeneous-good producers. The
problem of the representative producer is to maximize:

                                                        
                                                   wt
                                   πzt = Zt 1 −            .
                                                (1 + g)t

                                                     19
Real income It is useful to define real income, Ỹt , measured in terms of the consumption
basket of differentiated and homogeneous goods purchased by the households:


                                                      Yt
                                            Ỹt =         .                               (9)
                                                      Ptα
Recall that α is the share of the bundle of differentiated goods in household expenditure.


Equilibrium In equilibrium, households maximize their utility, (6), taking the wage rate
and prices as given. Monopolists maximize profits taking the wage rate, the aggregate
consumption bundle, Ct , and the aggregate price of the bundle of consumption varieties, Pt ,
as given. Producers of the homogeneous good maximize profits, taking prices as given. The
labor market clears:                       Z    nt
                                   Nzt +             Nivt di = Nt .
                                            0
The market for the homogeneous good clears:

                                       YtZ = Zt + nt Ψ.


   The market for differentiated goods clears. Using the household budget constraint, we
can rewrite Ct in a symmetric equilibrium as:

                                    Ct = νtγ−1 nvt t −1 αYt At .

Since γ > 1, the household’s utility is monotonically increasing in vt . The value of xvt is
given by:
                                                     αAt Yt
                                         xvt =              .                           (10)
                                                      vt nt

   Since utility is increasing in vt , the constraint xvt ≥ 1 is binding. Setting xvt = 1 in
equation (10), we obtain the optimal value of vt :
                                                     αAt Yt
                                          νt =              .                           (11)
                                                      nt

   The following proposition, proved in the Appendix, summarizes the properties of the
equilibrium.




                                                     20
Proposition 1. The equilibrium of this economy is described by the following equations:

                     wt = (1 + g)t ,
                           (1 + gt )t
                     Yt =             ,
                            1 + θt
                              αAt (1 + gt )t
                     nt =                       ,
                           (1 + ΨAt ) (1 + θt )
                    xivt = 1,
                    pivt = Ψ + 1/At ,
                              1
                     Nt =         ,
                           1 + θt
                      νt = 1 + ΨAt .

                                                                    
                     Ỹt =                            (1 + g)
                              (1 + ΨAt )(1−γ)α 1 + θt

Real income, Ỹt , is an increasing function of At and a decreasing function of θt .


   To study the model’s steady-state properties, suppose that At and θt are constant. The
price of each differentiated good, hours worked and the markup are also constant. Real
wages, household income measured in units of the homogeneous good, and the number of
firms producing differentiated goods grow at a constant rate g.

   Real income measured in terms of the consumption basket, Ỹt , grows at a gross rate
of (1 + g)1+αΨAt . The reason this gross rate is higher than 1 + g is as follows. Equation
(7) shows that the price index for differentiated goods is proportional to n1−v
                                                                            t   which, in
equilibrium, equals n−ΨA
                     t
                         t
                           . The number of firms grows at a gross rate 1 + g, increasing
variety and changing the effective price of the basket of differentiated goods at a gross rate
(1 + g)−ΨAt . Since differentiated goods have a weight of α in the overall consumer basket,
growth in variety results in a fall in the basket price and a rise in real income of (1 + g)αΨAt .

   When the fixed cost Ψ is zero, the equilibrium value of vt is one. In this case, differentiated
goods are perfect substitutes so the net markup is zero–price equals marginal cost.


Model implications To assess the model’s regional implications, we compare regions that
have different productivity levels and thus different levels of real income. Higher productivity
regions have higher markups and a higher number of varieties available. This implication is


                                               21
consistent with the finding we report on Section 4: gross margins and the number of varieties
are positively correlated with income. Another potential source of cross-sectional variation
is differences in the fixed cost, Ψ. Regions with higher fixed costs have higher markups than
regions with low fixed costs.

       To assess the model’s cyclical properties, we consider the effects of temporary shocks to
productivity and labor supply. Consider first the effect of an increase in At . Households
increase the quality of the varieties they consume and, as a result, the markup for differ-
entiated goods increases.19 Profits would rise if the number of firms stayed constant. In
equilibrium, the number of firms rises until profits are zero so that the free entry-condition
is satisfied.20

       The elasticity of the markup with respect to productivity is:


                                           dvt     AΨ dAt
                                               =          .
                                            v    1 + AΨ A
This elasticity approaches zero as the fixed cost Ψ approaches zero. For low values of Ψ the
model implies that markups are mildly procyclical. Permanent increases in At would give
rise to permanent changes in markups such as those displayed in Figure 5.

       Now consider an increase in θt . This shock leads to a fall in the supply of labor, in
real income, and in the number of firms that produce differentiated goods. But the markup
remains constant.

       In sum, the model implies that markups are mildly procyclical. They do not respond to
labor supply shocks and are procyclical with respect to changes in productivity. The model
is consistent with dispersion in markups across regions. Regions with higher incomes driven
by higher productivity choose higher quality goods and pay higher markups.

       A natural way to introduce nominal rigidities in this model would be to assume that
wages are sticky and that each firm has to pay a cost to change the quality of the goods
it produces. During recessions it might be optimal for the firm to keep quality constant.
This sticky assortment is likely to amplify the effect of recessions by limiting the extent to
  19
     See Bils and Klenow (2001) for evidence that quality demand is strongly correlated with household
income.
  20
     A secular rise in At produces a secular increase in the markup that is consistent with the findings of De
Loecker and Eeckout (2017).


                                                     22
which households can reduce the quality of what they buy.21 In the time series, we would
observe stability in assortment, price and gross margins. In the cross section, we would
observe differences in assortment and in markups resulting from the fact that cross sectional
differences in income are large and permanent.


6       Conclusion

We provide direct evidence on the behavior of markups in the retail sector across space and
time. Gross margins are relatively stable over time and mildly procyclical. There is large
regional dispersion of gross margins. Rich regions pay higher markups than poor regions.
This difference in markups reflects primarily differences in assortment across rich and poor
regions.

      We study an endogenous assortment model that is consistent with these basic facts. This
model embodies a central insight from the trade model proposed by Fajgelbaum, Grossman
and Helpman (2011): higher quality consumption bundles are made of less substitutable
components.

A      Appendix

A.1     Monetary policy and oil shocks

In section 3.2, we study the conditional response of firms’ gross and net operating margins
to high-frequency monetary policy shocks and oil-price shocks. This appendix discusses how
these shocks are identified.

    Monetary policy shocks are identified using high-frequency data on the Federal Funds
futures contracts. This approach has been used by Kuttner (2001), Cochrane and Piazessi

                                            27
(2002), Nakamura and Steinsson (2018), Gorodnichenko and Weber (2015), and others. The
future rate reflects the market expectations of the average effective Federal Funds rate during
that month. It therefore provides a market-based measure of the anticipated path of the
Federal Funds rate.

   A current period monetary policy shock is defined as:
                                        D     0         0
                                                             
                                t =       f ft+4+ − f ft−4−                                 (12)
                                       D−t
                                                             0
where t is the time when the FOMC issues an announcement, f ft+4+ is the Federal Funds

                                 0
futures rate shortly after t, f ft−4− is the Federal Funds futures rate just before t, and D is


the number of days in the month. The D/(D − t) term adjusts for the fact that the Federal
Funds futures settle on the average effective overnight Federal Funds rate.

   We consider a 60-minute time window around the announcement that starts 4− = 15
minutes before the announcement. Examining a narrow window around the announcement
ensures that the only relevant shock during that time period (if any) is the monetary policy
shock. Following Cochrane and Piazessi (2002) and others, we aggregate up the identified
shocks to obtain a quarterly measure of the monetary policy shock.

   Oil-price shocks are identified using the approach proposed by Ramey and Vine (2010),
updated to the recent period. We estimate a VAR system with monthly data

                                       Yt = A(L)Yt−1 + Ut .

The vector Yt includes the following variables (in order): nominal price of oil, the CPI,
nominal wages of private production workers, industrial production, civilian hours, and the
federal funds rates. The function A(L) is a matrix of polynomials in the lag operator L, and U
is a vector of disturbances. All variables, except the federal funds rate, are in logs. We include
a linear time trend and 6 lags of the variables. The shock to oil prices is identified using a
standard Cholesky decomposition. The shocks are aggregated to a quarterly frequency to
match the frequency of our firm level data.


A.2     Correcting gross margins for changes in inventories

One potential source of measurement error in our aggregate retail and firm level data stems
from the possibility that the cost of goods sold might reflect goods purchased in previous

                                               28
periods and stored as inventory. As a result, the cost of goods sold does not measure the
true marginal replacement cost.

       We deal with this issue in Section 3.4 by using actual replacement cost for a retailer.
Here, we use instead a perpetual inventory approach to correct the cost of goods sold for
changes in inventories.

       Denote by C̄t the observed cost of goods sold and by Ct the true cost of goods sold. The
observed cost of goods sold is

                                       C̄t = αt C̄t−1 + (1 − αt )Ct ,

where
                                          Starting period inventoriest
                                   αt =                                .
                                                     Salest
We assume that if αt ≥ 1, then
                                             C̄t = Ct /(1 + πt ),

where πt is the rate of change in the producer price index for final goods from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. This equation implies that, if the inventories at the start of the period
exceed sales in that period, then the goods sold in that period come from inventories.22 The
observed value of cost of good sold is then assumed to be given by the true cost of goods
sold, deflated by the producer price index.

       The true cost of goods sold is given by

                                            C̄t − αt C̄t−1
                                     Ct =                  ,    if αt < 1
                                                1 − αt
and
                                     C̄t = Ct /(1 + πt ),      if αt ≥ 1.

We assume as starting value C̄0 = C0 and implement our approach separately for each firm.

       The gross margin adjusted for changes in inventories is given by
                                                Salest − Ct
                                                            .
                                                  Salest
  22
    This occurrence is rare, particularly at the annual frequency. The average retailer ratio of inventories to
sales is about 12%.




                                                      29
We use this adjusted measure to re-estimate the elasticity of gross margins with respect to
real GDP. We regress the year-on-year logarithmic difference of each variable on the year-
on-year logarithmic difference of real GDP.

   Table 10 shows our results from Section 3, which do not adjust for inventories, as well
as the elasticities estimated using gross margins adjusted for changes in inventories. We
see that while point estimates are different, the elasticity of gross margins with respect to
GDP growth remains statistically insignificant when we use the adjusted measures of gross
margins.


A.3     Proof of proposition 1

Equilibrium in the homogeneous good market requires:

                                        wt = (1 + g)t .

The equilibrium price index for consumption of differentiated goods is:
                                                        νt
                                      Pt = vt−γ n1−v

                                                    t
                                                           .
                                                        At
Households choose the same consumption level for all available varieties: xivt = xvt . The
consumption bundle is given by:
                                       Ct = νtγ nvt t xvt .

Using the household budget constraint, we can rewrite Ct as:

                                    Ct = νtγ−1 nv−1
                                                t   αYt At .

Since γ > 1, the household’s utility is monotonically increasing in vt . The value of xvt is
given by:
                                                αAt Yt
                                        xvt =           .                               (13)
                                                 νt n t

   Since utility is increasing in νt , the constraint xvt ≥ 1 is binding. Setting xvt = 1 in
equation (13), we obtain the optimal value of vt :
                                                αAt Yt
                                         νt =          .                                (14)

The free entry condition, πt = 0, implies that the markup is given by:

                                                 νt = 1 + ΨAt .                               (15)

Using equation (14) to replace vt , we obtain:

Combining equations (16), (17), and (18), we obtain the following expression for the equi-

To solve for real income, we replace Yt in equation (9):

Notes: Data is from a large U.S. retailer. The figure depicts the distributions of gross margins (levels),
sales (log-difference from same quarter in the prior year) and number of items (log difference from same
quarter in the prior year) for the period 2006-07 and the period 2008-09. Each data point in the distribution
is a region-quarter observation. See text for more details. For confidentiality purposes, we normalize the
distribution of gross margin by the mean margin in 2006-07. Specifically, we subtract the mean 2006-07
margin from the 2006-07 distribution, so at the mean it is zero. We also subtract the mean 2006-07 margin
from the 2007-08 distribution.

Notes: Data is from a large U.S. retailer. The table gives key moments from the cross-sectional distribution
(across regions) of gross margins, average sales growth and average growth in number of items. We report
the average levels of each variable in 2006-07 and 2008-09, and the differences between 2006-07 and 2008-09
for sales growth and growth in number of items. Due to confidentiality reasons, we do not report the levels
of the margins, and only report how the level of margins changed between 2006-07 and 2008-09.

gross margins for the same item, differences in assortment of composition, the interaction terms, and the
covariance terms. See text for more details.

Notes: Data is from a large U.S. retailer and a large Canadian retailer. Table gives the elasticity of the gross
margin with respect to each of the variables. Each regression is estimated separately. Standard errors are
in parentheses. ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ give the significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels.

Notes: Table gives the elasticity of the gross margin with respect to each of the variables. Each regression
is estimated separately. Standard errors are in parentheses. ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ give the significance at the 10, 5,
and 1 percent levels. The baseline regressions are from Section 3 and correspond to the estimates from Table
1. The regression estimates with inventory adjustment are based on the perpetual inventory approach. See
Appendix A2 for details.
