    Standard trade theory views the capital stock as an endowment. However, trade

policy can affect a country's steady—state capital stock. By ignoring the endogeneity
of capital, standard analysis is incomplete and can be misleading. For instance,
when capital in endogenous, the Stolper—Samuelson theorem incorrectly predicts the
long—run impact of a tariff n factor rewards in a 2—by—2 trade modeL Moreover,
the output effects of a trade policy can be greatly amplified by its indirect effect on
the steady—state capital stock. Since this indirect effect may take a very long time
to be fully realized, trade policy can have a long—lasting effect on growth. Ricardo
first studied   this link between trade and steady—state factor supplies.

   This paper shows that trade policy can affect a nation's steady—state capital stock, so
   standard trade theory, which takes the capital stock as an endowment, is Incomplete and
   can be misleading. For instance, in a 2—by-—2 trade model the Stolper—Samuelson theorem
   incorrectly predicts the long—run impact of a tariff on factor rewards. Moreover, the output
   effects of a trade policy can be greatly amplified by its indirect effect on the steady—state
   capital stock. Since this indirect effect may take a very long time to be fully realized, trade
   policy can have a long—asting effect on growth. Ricardo first studied this link between
   trade and steady—state factor supplies.


     This paper points out that standard trade theory, which views countries' capital stocks as

endowments, is incomplete and can be misleading. A textbook version of the Stàlper—Sasnuelson

theorem states that if a country's imports are relatively capital—intensive, imposing a tariff
unambiguously raises the return on capital and lowers the return on labor.1'2 Yet the capital
stock is not like land or natural resources; it is endogenously determined by savings and

investment behavior which are in turn almost surely governed by intertemporal optimization.

Allowing the capital stock to be endogenous in the simplest two goods, two fictors trade model

yields substantially different results. This paper shows that the tariff mentioned above has

affect on factor prices. Instead, it leads to an endogenous change in the capital—labor ratio and

thus is entirely translated (via the Rybcsynski effect) into an output effect. A trivial implication

of this point is that the standard 2—by—2—by—2 trade model should not take capital as a factor.

     Capital, however, is an important factor of production in advanced industrialized countries.

If a nation's capital stock is determined endogenously, trade policy will affect its steady—state

level in almost any inoacl where trade policy affects factor rewards. Thus standard trade analysis,

which focuses on static allocation and strategic effects, is incomplete. In other words, by ignoring

the endogeneity of capital, standard trade policy analysis .n.... what could be a quantitatively

Important effect. Baldwin (1989b) quantifies this effect in a simple one —, two factor model

                                                    1
 and shows that this indirect, dynamic effect can be quite large. Moreover, since the adjustment of

 the capital stock may take a very long time, trade policy can have a very long—lasting effect on

 the growth rate of output.

 Ricardo 's Dynamic Model

      Ricardo (1815) emphasised this dynamic effect in a simple model where growth occurs due to

 the accumulation of productive factors (farm land and wage labor). In a closed economy, growth

and the rate of profit eventually fall to sero due to airnhiisbing return. in agriculture. Trade

permits continued growth as "England's agriculture is stationary but Manchester and
Birmingham make her the workshop of the world which pays in food and primary products for the

expanding output of the workshop.         Trade does not affect the long—run growth rate (which is

sero), it affects the amount of productive factors in use and thereby the level of output at the

long—run steady state. According to Findlay (1984), it was this link between the accumulation of

productive factors and trade, not so much the static gains from trade, that made free trade
attractive to Ricardo. Ricardo's model has little direct applicability to the modern industrialised
world. Yet the basic point is important. Even if trade policy does not affect the long—run growth

rate, it can affect the steady—state level of productive factors. Consequentially, it can affect the

medium—term growth rate as the economy moves toward the new steady state.

     Theoretically this Ricardian dynamic effect is completely distinct from the very important

dynamic effect. stressed in the Grossman—Relpman trade and growth literature.4 In these

models, trade policy can permanently affect the long—nan rate of return on accumulating factors

(be it knowledge, human capital or varietie, of intermediate inputs). Trade policy can therefore

permanently alter the long—run growth rate. The Ricardian dynamic effect does not alter the

growth rate on the steady—state growth path. It alters the level of this path. Putting this point

differently, the Grossman—Eelpman dynamic effect depends on the link between trade and the

rate of return on accumulating factors. The Ricardian dynamic effect depends on the link
between trade and the steady—state factor supplies. Empirically, however, it would be rathqr
difficult to distinguish between the two effects.

      Section 1 lays out the basic model which is beat thought of as a shotgun wedding of the

Heckscher—Ohlln trade model and the Solow growth model. Section 2 derives the steady-itate

growth path. Section 3 investigates the link between protection and factor rewards in a small
open economy. Section 4 presents a su.nmny and some concluding remarks.



1. The Basic Model

      We work with a model which: (i) is identical to the standard 2—by—2--by—2 model in any

period (i.e., with a fixed capital stock), and (ii) is .1mph to solve for the evolution of the capital

stock. Consider an integrated world equilibrium with two goods (1 and 2) produced with two
factor (capital K and labor L) under constant returns to scale by price—taking firma. The fixed

coefficients technology (identical in all countries) relates output of the two goods, x1 and '2 to

inputs at all points in time (for convenience the model employ, continuous time; the time index is

suppressed where clarity permits):

                      .1      L1
                                     ,

                                              I.    x=msnl  .r L2            1(2

                                                                 (a,/A) 52K

Labor augmenting technology exogenously advances according to: A(t) = A(O)e', where fl is the

exogenous rate of technological progress. Good 2 is assumed to be relatively capital intensive, so

a2KaiL> a2LaiK. Neither good ii storable. In keeping with the trsditional trade model, there

are no adjustment costs to changing the amount of K or L employed in either sector.

      The standard Solow growth model views investment as forgone consumption. The literal

translation of this economic insight into mathematics (in the context of this model) is:



(2)                                      = ()1/2 (12)1/2


where I and 12 are the amounts of goods 1 and 2 devoted to making new capital instead of


                                                     3
consumption. Depreciation is ignored, so lii the change in the capital stock.

      The infinitely—lived representative consumer's preferences are given by:




(3)                   U=
                           (l__(/e))JCct [C1(t)1/2C2(t)1/2]1")dt,

where p reflects pure time preference, U ii the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (assumed to

be positive) and c.(t) lithe consumption of good i at time t.



2. The Steady-State Balance Growth Path of the Integrated WorM Equilibvtm
      Both the Heckscher—Ohlin and neoclassical growth models are long run models. For instance

traditional growth theory makes no attempt to account for the business cycle, and the standard

trade model makes no attempt to describe the adjustment to the static equilibrium. In keeping

with this spirit, we focus on the steady—state growth path (which ii a dynamic model's equivalent

of the long run). The appendix sketches stability and convergenceresults. To solve for the
steady—state path we presume that it exists and write down the set of simultaneous conditions

that this implies. Finding a set of paths and time—invariant variables that meets these conditions

is equivalent to finding a steady—state balance growth path (and proves existence).

Static Equilibriism

      The representative consumer chooses expenditure paths for goods I and 2 to maximi.ses

utility subject to a lifetime budget constraint. Given (3), if the representative consumer's optimal

total expenditure at t is E(t), the optimaj static allocation is to divide this evenly between goods 1

and 2. Defining his income in period t as Y(t), we have that expenditure on new capital goods

(which is assumed to be the only way to carry over income between periods) is Y(t) — E(t). The

consumption demand functions are therefore:



(4)           c1(t)(p1(t))'(E(t)/2) and c2(t)=(p2(t))'(B(t)/2)

                                                     4
 where p1(t) and p2(t) are the prices of good 1 and 2 at time t. Additionally, the representative

consumer's demand for new capital goods leads to derived demands for good 1 and 2



 (5)     11(t) = (P1t)'(Tt)—81t))/2                 and   12(t) = (p2(t))_t(Y(t)_.B(t))/2


Equations (4) and (5) imply that equilibrium production satisfiesp1x1 =
                                                                            p2x2 at every instant.
       Price, factor rewards (w for wages, nor the rental rate) and outputs at all times satisfy:



(6)                                1        p1 = (alL/A)w + alKr
(7)                                             =   (L/A)'     + a2Kr
(8)                                         A(t)L = alL11 + a2Lx2

(9)                                         K = alKxl +a2Kx2

The matrix of a.'s is assumed to be non—singular. Good 1 is taken as the numeraire.

       It is usefiul to define indices for aggregate real consumption, C, aggregate output, X, and the

price level, P. C(t) ii defined as (c1(t))I'2(c2(t))l'2, X(t) as (x1(t))1'2(x2(t))''2, and P(t) as
                     Additionally, we define world income as: Y(t) 9 w(t)A(t)L + r(t)K(t). Plainly

income equals output in equilibrium so Y also equals x1(t)+p2(t)x2(t). Note that
expenditure is exactly equal to C(t)P(t) and world income ii exactly equal to P(t)X(t).

Bainced Growth Path

       The easiest way to find the steady—state balanced growth path is to guess what it will look

like and then verify that the guess is correct In this simple model the obvious guess is that the

relative price of goods and the rental rate are time—invariant, and everything else grows at i7. To

start out, suppose K grows at i so that K/A(t)L is time invariant. Inspection of (8) and (9)
reveal, that if this ratio is time—invariant, output of the two goods will grow together at the rate

i7 Given (4) and (5), balanced output growth implies that the world relative price of goods, p2,
and the price index P would also be time—invariant (call these      and P5). Obviously then Y also

                                                      5
would grow at i9. With income and foregone consumption growing at 1, the index of consumption

would alsogrow at 17.

       Next we turn to the steady—state rental rate. The maximization of (3) subject to a life—time

budget constraint is a clonic optimal control problem. A usefiul way to write the lifetime budget

constraint it



(10)          = (1/P(t))(w(t)A(t)L + r(t)Z(t)) — C(t), subject to urn Z(t) -. ic          0
                                                                        t-'w

where     Z ii the consumer's stock of assets (capital), and Ic is an arbitrary constant. The
Hainiltonian for utility niarimisation subject to (10) is



                   H[C,A1 = (1_11)eCHtI'O + A{(wL + rZ)/P — C}


where A is the co—state variable. The necessary conditions are that A = —a     and B =0 (using
the standard notation that a dot indicates a time derivative). in this case these imply
                                                                                                  a

                                             A   = —A(r/P)

(it)
                                         A   =


We are interested in Ô, so we take the time derivative of the latter and eliminate A with the

former. This yields the differential equation:



(12)                              t(t)/C(t) = u [rtvt —

Clearly   if O/C equals T   (as   argued above) then r(t) must be constant in steady state. In
                                                      6
 particular, the steady—state rental rate, r, equals P'Ol/c+ p). lir is constant and yet Y and K

 aregrowingat17itmustbethatwagesarealsopowingatq(renflLiifi<j) Usingr'in(6)
 enables us to pin don w(t) on the steady—state path. Substituting r5 and the steady—state wage

rate into (7) yields the time—invariant p in terms of r' and unit input coefficients (recall that w

and A are both growing at 17). Note that if income and consumption grow at the same rate,

investment is a time—invariant fraction of income. Lastly1 since p is uniquely determined,
                                                                                               (4)
and (5) would uniquely determine the steady-state ratio x2/x1. This together with (8) and (9)

would give us the unique steady—state ratio K(t)/A(t)L (call this value k') We shall find it

convenient to refer to the K(t)/A(t)L ratio as k(t).

     To summarize, we have found the time—invariant relative price and rental rate in terms of

preference and technology parameters. Also we have characterized the steady—state paths of

'2' Y, C, w5 and K. This set of variables and paths characterise the steady—state balanced
growth path for the integrated world economy. Having found it we know that a steady—state

path ests. Furthermore, there ii only one steady-state path on which both goods are produced.

To see this, we work backward. If */E don not equal tfv then the capital stock heads toward

either infinity or zero. Thus on any steady-state path, expenditure and income must grow at a

common rate. Consequently, on any steady—state path K must also grow at this common rate. If

this growth rate does not exactly match the growth rate of effective labor, the output of either

— I. or good 2 will eventually be driven to zero (Rybczynski effect).



3. Protection and Factor Rewards When Capital is Endogenous

     We now turn to the effects of a tariff on factor prices and output. The steady—state balance

growth path described above was for the integrated world equilibrium. Any division of the factors

among countries would reproduce the integrated world equilibrium, as long as the relative

"endowments' are similar enough so that no country specializes. Clearly, any such division would

be time—invariant since each country would have proportional balanced growth paths (in other

words the steady—state growth path is independent of L). To be concrete suppose the home

                                                       7
country is "endowed" with aK(t)/A(t)L ratio equal to k°, when k° isles than k5. Obviously the

home country imports the capital—intensive good 2. Finally to keep the dynamics simple, we rely

on the convenient fiction that the home country is small in that sense that its output does not

affect world prices.

     Consider the effects of the borne country unexpectedly imposing a permanent tariff on

imports.5 Ignore for a moment the endogeneity of capital. The tariff raises the local price of good

2. By assumption the determinant of the a.. matrix is positive, so by (6) and (7) this price change

lowers wand raises r in the home country. Having assumed fixed input coefficients, there would

be no output response. Had we allowed for factor substitutability, the price rise would shift

resources to the protected sector. This is the Stolper—Samuelion effect. It has three aspects: r

rises and w fails (factor price effect), these changes are greater than the changes in goods prices

(magnification effect), output of the protected sector rises and output of the export sector falls

(quantity effect).

     Consider the effects of this short—run change in factor prices on the endogenous

capital—labor ratio. The jump in r raises the return to foregone consumption in the home

country. This leads consumers to find it optimal to accumulate capital faster than on the

steady—state path. Thus the home k rises. This rise in k leads to an increase in good 2 production

and a fall in good 1 production (Rybcsynski effect) — reducing both imports and exports. It

does not, however, affect relative prices due to the small, open economy assumption.

Consequently, the initial rise in k has no effect on the return to foregone consumption (since the

amatrix is non—singular). k will therefore continue to increase. Indeed, as long as the tariff is

effective, r will be above r5 so k will continue to rise. The rising k drives the home country toward

self—sufficiency in x2. When k rises enough, imports of good 2 cease and the tariff becomes

irrelevant. At this point relative goods prices equals the world price, p, so the home return to

capital is r5. Dynamic equilibrium is restored. The Stolper—Samuelson effect does not hold in the

long run.

       As it turns out, it is straightforward to describe the adjustment process more precisely. The

dynamics of this system are simple and can be solved using Dornbusch (1976) techniques. There

are two state variables, K and C. C can jump, K cannot. It is convenient to transform the model

in order to work with the capital and consumption per unit of effective labor, A(t)L. We refer to

these as k and c respectively. That is c(t) equals C(t)/A(t)L; also define x(t) as X(t)/A(t)L.

Capital accumulates according to:



(13)                                         =x(t)—c(t).


In the pre—tariff equilibrium consumption evolves according to



(14)                               ;/c = u [r'/?       —




Here x depends on k according to:




(15)                                       x(t) = if k(t) J,


       Signing Pf.J requires additional assumptions. A rise ink expands x and contracts x1. The

effect on the index 1ht22hit2 is in general ambiguous. Figure 1 depicts the problem. With fixed

coefficients, the production frontier (at any point in time) is square. An increase in k would shift

the corner from B to B'. Depending on the relative factor intensities, B' maybe above or below

the hyperbolt Q = x1hi'2x2h/'2 (Q is an arbitrary constant). Essentially for B' to be above the
hyperbola, the factor intensities of 1 and 2 must be sufficiently different.6 (If the factor intensities

are quite close, x must fall a lot to release the right amount of its capital and labor to allow

sector 2 to employ the new capital.) We assume that fbr all relevant k the au's are such that our

index of output is increasing in

       We analyse the dynamics with a phase diagram. Figure 2 plots the & =0 schedule in c—k

if   is to remain unchanged.7 The arrows indicate the laws of motion off the £ = 0

schedule. Forallpairzofkandctotherightofk=0,zisgreaterthancsokwillberising;for
combinations to the left, k will be failing. Since k is assumed to be such that the home country is

unspecialized, factor price equalization holds. Consequently r equals r5 for any combination of k

and c inside the dashed lines (k and show the limits of the diversification cone).           is therefore

zero anywhere within this region. The position of the economy, {c? k°}, will be determined by

the initial "endowment", k°.

     Now consider how the tariff changes this picture. The rise in home p2 raises r above r5. By

(14) this implies that    is positive at the initial point, (c? k°}. The tariff will affect p2 for all k

lea than k5 (since the home country will be an importer of good 2 for such k). However, for

greater or equal to k5, the tariff will be irrelevant, so   is still zero for all combination, of c and k

where k is between Ic' and E In Figure 3 we have added arrows to represent this change in the

laws of motion. Note that this system displays saddle path stability. The saddle path is drawn as

55. The new steady—state is labeled B in Figure 3. Finally, we are ready for the more precise

analysis of the adjustment. Imposition of the tariff leads to a jump in r. This changes the laws of

motion as discussed. Consumption jumps down to the saddle path and both c and Ic increase

during the adjustment process.8

     Summarizing the above discussion we have:

Proposition I: (Stolper—Samuelson effect with endcgenous capital)

     A tariff on capital—intensive imports has no long—run effect on factor prices. Instead, it

leads to an endogenous change in the capital—labor ratio and thus is entirely translated (via the

E.ybczynski effect) into an output effect.

Abandoning the Smell, Open Economy Asrimption

     It may appear that the small, open economy assumption is crucial to the results. This is

incorrect. Consider the same setup with only two countries, each of which is large. Again divi4e

 proceeds as before except the dynamics are more complicated. The rise in home k is accompanied

 by a fall in foreign k (since p2 in the foreign country fails). Eowever, there Is still a unique
 steady—state path where both goods are produced. Assuming that the world does reach it,
producers in both countries must face 4, so that r in both countries will be?. With the home

country tariff firmly in place, the only way this can occur is if the home country ii self—sufficient

in good 2, so that the tariff is irrelevant. This implies that the tariff either shifts both countries to

self—sufficiency (a kind of factor endowment equalization), or turns the home country into an
exporter of good 2. Such a system involves five differential equations ( and          for each country
and j,). Consequentially the adjustment path is potentially quite complicated.



4. Summary and Concluding Remat*s
     This paper uses a simple model to illustrate a simple point. The fact that the capital stock Is

endogenously determined has important implications for trade theory and policy analysis. This

point has two implications, one trivial, one profound. The standard 2—by—2-—by—2 trade model

(which is generally considered a long—run model) should not take capital as one of its two factor..

In the simple example considered here, the Stolper—Sainuelson theorem incorrectly predicts the

long—run effects of commodity price changes on factor rewards. Protection of the capital—intense

sector leads to no change in factor rewards. Instead it has an amplified effect on production. This

point is really quite general. Almost any growth moTdel ties don the return on foregone

consumption (consider the Fisher diagram). If capital is foregone consumption (ignoring price
effects) then the rental rate in the model is tied don. This removes a degree of freedom from the

2—by—2 model. This degree of freedom is replaced by allowing the capital stock to vary. Thus

instead of obtainbig a unique set of prices, factor rewards and outputs for the integrated world

equilibrium given factor endowments and trade policy, we obtain the equilibrium factor
endowments given trade policy. Had we called the two factors labor and land (as Stolper and

Samuelson 1941 did), the analysis is moot. Thus, this is the trivial implication.

    In the modern world, capital is an important factor of production. Moreover a country's

                                                     11
capital stock ii determined by investment and savings behavior, which ii almost surely
determined by intertemporal optimization. This papa shol!. that trade policy can alter the

intertemporal optimization problem and thereby alter the steady—state capital stock (more
precisely, the capital—labor, ratio). Consequently, a complete analysis of the effects of trade policy

should not ignore the Ricardian dynamic effect. Baldwin (198Db) shows that this Ricardian

dynamic effect of trade policy on output. may be many times larger than the standard static

effects of resource allocation and market segmentation. Other factors, such as labor skill,
technology and infrastructure also accumulate. Since trade policy cetti-la pariMis affects factor

rewards, it will in general affect the steady—state supplie. of such factor..

     More tentatively, one might speculate that the Ricardian dynamic effect is in part
responsible for the growth performance of Japan and Korea. Both countries appear to have highly

distorted trade policies which favor capital and skilled—labor intensive industries. Presumably

this boosts the return on accumulating physical and human capital. Even more tentatively, we

note that worldwide growth was higher than normal during the decades of the multilateral tariff

reduction on manufactured goods. Suppose manufactured goods are capital—intensive (physical

and/or human). If the multilateral liberalization raised the return on these factors, the Ricardian

dynamic trade effect may have contributed to the faster growth during those decades.

    This simple model is certainly not appropriate for the detailed study of the Ricardian
dynamic trade effect. Baldwin (1989a) investigates the R.icardian effect in a model where trade

policy has less extreme effects on factor endowments and the trade pattern.

7. If f'(•JcO, 6o would be negatively sloped, yet the saddle path would still be upward sloping.

8. If consumption starts out at any other point, the country will become specialized in the

production of one good. This is where our simplifying assumptions begin to get in the way.

Having assumed fixed coefficients, the system (in particular w and r) is not determined under

specialisation. We cannot therefore describe the dynamics outside the diversification cone.

fundamental theorems of the standard trade theory. An increase in k leads to an expansion of

good 2 production and a contraction of good 1 production (R.ybcsynski effect). By the (4) and

in the return to effective labor and a fall in the return to capital. Moreover, the fall in r is a

     This system has a unique saddle path (drawn as SS). Units the economy starts out
somewhere on the saddle path, it will never converge to the steady—state balanced growth path.

This however is not a problem since the representative consumer can choose c freely (i.e.1 c is a

jump variable). Moreover, he would choose to be on the saddle path since any other path would

eventually lead to nero consumption. If he starts below the saddle path capital accunniaS.
forever as consumption falls toward zero. Starting out shove the path leads him to consume too

much as k and therefore x tend toward nero. This rather obvious point can be formalised by the

use of & tran.vcrnality condition. Alternatively, we could have worked with an intertemporally

separable utility function for which the sub—utility function goes to negative infinity (at a
sufficiently fast rate) as C goes to zero. For such a function it would never beoptimal to allow

consumption to go to zero. (3) then could be taken a a local approximation of such a function.
