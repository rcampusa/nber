          Location Decisions of New Immigrants to the United States



                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper estimates a multinomial logit model of the location
decisions of new Immigrants to the United States. Data from the 5—
percent Public Use Samples of the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of Population
are used to study the geographic distribution of immigrants who arrived
after 1965. The major findings are as follows:

     (1) In choosing both initial and subsequent locations, immigrants
are considerably more geographically concentrated than native Americans
who move to a new city.

     (2) All of the immigrant groups prefer to live In cities where
their countrymen are already located, but this relationship is much
weaker for the more educated immigrants.

     (3) There is ambiguous evidence on the question of whether immigrants
learn about economic opportunies as they spend time in this country. On the
one hand, with the exception of the Mexicans, distance from the home country
has a much weaker negative impact on location choice as time in the U.S.
elapses. On the other hand, the expected wage variable,which should have
a larger positive effect over time,only did so for the Asians, and to some
extent, the Central and South Americans (excluding Mexicans and Cubans).

      (4) Within each ethnic group, there are significant differences in
the location choice behavior of the 1965—69 and 1975—79 immigrant cohorts.
The results are consistent with an increase over time in the quality of
Asian immigrants, and a decrease in the quality of Mexican, Cuban and
European immigrants.

I.    Introduction
       Over the past two decades, immigration to the United States has

sharply increased to levels not seen since the great immigrant waves of

the pre-1920 period. During the 1960s, legal immigration exceeded three

million persons for the first time in thirty years, and during the 1970s

it surpassed four million. As a result of this upswing, immigration has

once again come to the forefront of national attention. The recent

increase in immigration is largely due to the passage of the 1965 amend-

ments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which abolished the nation-

al origins quota system and replaced it with an ethnic-blind preference

system. A second cause is the fall of U.S. -backed governments in Cuba

and Indochina, producing large numbers of refugees seeking entry to the

United States.

       During the past ten years, economists, sociologists and demographers

have begun to study the process by which the new immigrants (defined as

those arriving since 1965) become integrated into American society. This

literature has examined the economic status (e.g., Borjas, 1985;

Chiswick, 1978, 1979; DeFreitas, 1979, 1982), fertility (e.g., Jaffe and

Cullen, 1975; Kritz and Gurak, 1976), residential segregation (e.g.,

Massey, 1979, 1981), and political participation (e.g., Buehler, 1977) of

the new immigrants. An obvious aspect of the assimilation process of the

new immigrants into American society is their settlement patterns in this

country. To date, however, almost no research exists on this subject.

While researchers have studied the existence of residential segregation

within an urban area, no one has yet conducted a comprehensive study of

regional, state or SMSA choice for the new immigrants.1 The purpose of

this paper is to develop and test a model of the location decisions

(within the United States) of the new immigrants, where location is

defined as an SMSA. The following questions will be addressed: (1)

Where do the new immigrants first locate in the United States? (2) What

variables can explain these location choices? In particular, do economic

incentives play an important role in this decision? (3) How and why do

the location decisions of the various ethnic groups in the immigrant

population differ from each other? (4) As individuals acquire experience

in this country, does this affect their knowledge and perception of

economic opportunities throughout the U.S.? In other words, are economic

variables more important in the choice of subsequent (as compared to

 initial) locations in the United States?

     Data from the 5—percent Public Use Samples of the 1970 and 1980

 Censuses of Population are used for the analysis. I have chosen the

 Census of Population as my data base because the "new immigrants" are a



      1One exception is a paper by Vasegh-Daneshvary, Herzog and
 Schlottman (1985) that analyzed the 1980 interstate distribution of
 college-educated immigrants who arrived between 1970 and 1974. This
 study is extremely limited for two reasons. First it looks at a very
 small percentage of the new immigrant population. Second, it does not
 take advantage of information on personal characteristics and merely
 estimates the impact of state characteristics on the proportions of
 immigrants located in the states. A study was also conducted by Dunlevy
 (1980) that examined the intended versus lifetime settlement patterns of
 the 19th-century European immigrants to the U.S. Dunlevy concluded that
 these immigrants reacted significantly to economic factors in their
 selection of settlement sites.
                                    3



very small percentage of the population and the proportion from subsets

of foreign countries is even smaller. Empirical analysis of the internal

migration behavior of these individuals therefore requires either a

moderate-sized data set which substantially oversamples the new inuni-

grants or a very large random sample. The Census of Population provides

a large number of new immigrants and contains pieces of data, such as

country of origin and year of immigration, that are not included in other

large data sets. In addition, by using data from two Census years, I am

able to observe a given cohort of immigrants at two points in time. As

shown later, this is particularly useful for analyzing the extent of

geographic assimilation that occurs with the acquisition of experience in

the U.S.2

     Studying the location decisions of the new immigrants is an impor-

tant topic for several reasons. First, given the increased number of

immigrants to the U.S. and the impact that such population increases can

have on the economies of the receiving regions, it is necessary to gain

information on the determinants of the immigrants' location choices in

order to predict which areas can expect to receive future immigrants.

This information would aid in forecasting regional needs for federal

funding to provide economic and social services to the new immigrants.

     Second, studying the determinants of the internal migration behavior

of the immigrants can shed light on the existence of potential barriers

to assimilation. The analysis in this paper will show whether additional

time spent in the United States enables the immigrant to acquire informa-



     2Borjas (1985) used data from two Census years in order to study the
relative importance of assimilation and across-cohort changes in immi-
grant quality in explaining cross-section analyses of immigrant earnings
growth.

tion   about opportunities in various locations and, thereby, follow the

migration behavior patterns of the native-born population, namely, to

move in response to economic incentives.

       Section II of the paper describes a model of individual location

choice. Section III presents data on the 1970 and 1980 geographic

distributions of the new immigrants. In Section IV a multinomial logit

choice model is specified and data sources are discussed. Section V

presents the results of estimating the model for two waves of immigrants.

Section VI compares the behavior of the immigrants to that of native—born

individuals with the same ethnicity. Conclusions and policy implications

are discussed in Section VII.



II. Modeling Individual Location Choice



       Assume that an individual has a set of N possible location choices

and that there is a given level of utility, 1).., for individual i at

location j. The individual will compare the utilities associated with

each of the N locations and choose that location in which the utility is

largest. Hence the probability that individual i chooses location j is

 given by:


 (1)          P.. =   P(U..   =
                                  MAX(U1,   U2, ...   UiN))

        In   order to estimate equation (1), information is needed on the

 utility levels in each of the N locations. Utility levels are impossible

 to observe, however; hence an alternative approach is to specify those

 variables which determine utility in each location. We can begin by

 relying on studies of the migration behavior of the native-born
                                     S



population and then consider how to modify the specification for new

arrivals to this country. Previous research on the location choices of

the native-born have generally found that a small set of variables

describing the location can explain settlement patterns.3 These are (1)

size of the area, (2) expected earnings, (3) the probability of finding a

job, generally measured by the unemployment rate, (4) the level of

welfare benefits, and (5) distance from the location of origin. It has

been argued that population acts as a measure of job opportunities and

general economic activity thereby attracting migrants.   Similarly, the

higher expected earnings or the greater the probability of finding a job,

the more attractive is the location. The availability of welfare bene-

fits serves as an index of nonmarket opportunities while distance
                                                                    proxies
the financial and psychic costs of migration.

     This economic model of location choice serves as a useful starting

point for analyzing the settlement patterns of the new immigrants. If

these variables can explain the patterns, then we can conclude that, like

the native-born population, immigrants respond to economic incentives in

choosing places of residence. It is likely, however, that during their

initial years in the U.S., immigrants have little information about

relative economic opportunities in various locations. In particular, the

location of family and friends may be the key determinant of initial

location choice.4 Hence, an additional determinant of U. might be the
                                                          .

     3Greenwood (1975) provides an excellent survey of research on
internal migration in the United States.


     4Greenwood (1969) has shown that, even in the case of native-born
Americans, the location of family and friends is an important predictor
of internal migration. He uses the number of individuals born in the
same state as his measure of family and friends.
                                           6




stock of foreign-born individuals in the location. Over time, as the

immigrants become more assimilated into the American society, one would

predict a decrease in the importance of the stock of foreign born and an

increase in the relative importance of the economic variables in explain-

ing the geographic distribution of the immigrant population.    In

addition, we would expect the distance variable to become less important

(i.e, have a weaker negative effect) as time spent in the U.S. enables

the immigrant to learn about locations that are distant from the port of

entry.

       Personal attributes of the individual may also play a role in the

choice of location. For example, individuals with different characteris-

tics may prefer different lifestyles and hence could have distinct

utility values for the location choices that are unrelated to relative

economic opportunities at the location. A good example is age.       Some

cities may provide amenities and lifestyles that are more appealing to

older individuals and age would then be a determinant of the utility

 level of locations. The individual's education may also influence

 location choice if differences in returns to education are not fully

 captured by the expected earnings measure that is used. Finally, the

 individual's ethnic background can be important since the characteristics

 (e.g., climate, geography) of certain cities may more closely approximate

 the characteristics of the countries of origin.

         Hence, the individual's utility level at each location is a function

 of a set of location characteristics, L.., and a set of personal

 attributes, X... Assuming a linear relationship results in:

where a and      are the parameters to be estimated and e.. is the error

term.

        Before turning to a description of the estimation of equation (2),

the geographic distributions of the various immigrant groups studied in

this paper are described in section III. Then, in section IV, the

econometric specification of equation (2) is discussed.



III. Geographic Distributions of Various Immigrant Groups



     As explained in the Introduction, data from the 5-percent Public Use

Samples of the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of Population are used for this

study. In order to minimize econometric difficulties in estimating a

large multinomial logit model (described in the next section) I have

restricted the analysis to individuals residing in the twenty-five

largest SMSAs.5 Since at least three-quarters of the new immigrants live

in these SHSAs, this sample selection rule is not overly restrictive.6

From the 1970 Public Use Sample, I selected male immigrants aged 22-54

who arrived between 1965 and 1969; individuals residing in group quarters

such as college dormitories were excluded. In the 1980 Public Use



     5Although Washington, D.C. falls into this category, it is deleted
from the analysis in order to exclude diplomats whose location behavior
requires a unique model. Hence, to keep twenty-five SMSAs in the loca-
tion choice set, the twenty-sixth largest SMSA is added to the list. It
is more appropriate to use SMSAs than states as the location unit because
in the economic model of location choice, the key determinants of that
choice are labor market conditions; SMSAs are generally viewed as close
approximations to homogeneous labor markets.


     6As the number of SMSAs was incrementally increased beyond
twenty-five, the number of immigrants in the sample increased moderately
while the computational difficulties in using the multinomial logit
technique increased dramatically.

Sample, this cohort of immigrants could also be observed as those indi-

viduals aged 32-64 who arrived between 1965 and 1969. From the 1970

Census, we therefore have information on their "initial" location choices

and in the 1980 Census we observe their locations some ten to fifteen

years after immigrating. Another sample is also selected from the 1980

Census, namely, individuals aged 22-54 who arrived between 1975 and 1979.

These individuals are observed in their "initial" locations in 1980 and

their geographic distribution can be compared to the 1965-69 cohort's

distribution in 1970.

     Table 1 shows the 1970 distribution of male iimnigrants aged 22-54

who arrived in this country between 1965 and 1969. As a frame of refer-

ence, the table also shows each SMSA's share of natives who moved into

one of the 24 SMSAs between 1965 and 1970. Comparing the distribution

of the immigrants to that of native movers shows whether immigrants are

choosing those cities that are also receiving individuals from other

parts of the country. In Column (1) the distribution across the 24 SMSAs

of immigrants from all countries is shown. Columns (2) through (6) show

the distributions for five ethnic groups: Asians, Central and South

Americans,8 Mexicans, Cubans, and Europeans. Below each column, I report

a Herfindahl index that measures the degree of geographic concentration




      7Data on the native in-migrants are reported by broad age category
 and the group aged 20-54 was the closest to the 22-54 age group I am
 using for the immigrants.


      8Thjs category excludes Cubans and Mexicans.
                                        9



of each of the groups.9 The maximum value of the index is unity (which

occurs when all of the individuals are in one SMSA) and the minimum value

is 1/N (which occurs when all of the N cities have equal shares of

individuals). The data in column (1) show that in 1970, the immigrants

who arrived between 1965 and 1969 were less dispersed than the native

migrants of similar age; the Herfindahl index for the immigrants is more

than double that of the natives and almost one-third of the immigrants

first located in New York.

     Distinguishing the immigrants according to their country of birth

shows important differences. The Herfindahl indices for the Asians and

Europeans are considerably lower than those of the Central and South

Americans, Mexicans and Cubans. Although sixty percent of the Asians

chose Los Angeles, New York or San Francisco as their initial U.S.

location, a number of other cities had sizable representations. Similar-

ly, although New York and Chicago accounted for 45 percent of the Europe-

ans' locations, at least seven other cities received large numbers of

these immigrants. The other groups are more heavily concentrated, with

seventy-six percent of the Mexicans choosing Chicago or Los Angeles,

fifty-three percent of the Cubans choosing Miami and sixty-two percent of

other Central and South Americans choosing New York.

     Table 2 shows the 1980 geographic distribution of the 1965-69

immigrants, i.e., ten to fifteen years after their arrival in this

country. Comparing the Herfindahi indices in Tables 1 and 2 shows that

some interesting changes occurred between 1970 and 1980. Asians,

Europeans and Central and South Americans became more dispersed, with the

largest change occurring for the latter group. The concentration of

Mexicans remained about the same,'° while Cubans became noticeably more

concentrated as Miami's share grew from 53 percent to 67 percent. For

each of the immigrant groups, the inter-SMSA movement that occurred

between 1970 and 1980 primarily conformed to the overall migration of the

U.S. population from the Frostbelt to the Sunbelt in the 1970s.    Cities

such as New York and Chicago lost these people while Houston, Miami, Los

Angeles and San Diego gained.

     Finally, Table 3 presents data on the "initial" location choices of

immigrants aged 22-54 in 1980 who arrived between 1975 and 1979. Compar-

ing the Herfindahi indices for the immigrants and the 1975-80 native

in-migrants shows that these immigrants were also considerably more

geographically concentrated than native movers. Los Angeles and New

York, in particular, attracted very large shares of the recent immi-

grants. Columns (2) through (6) can be compared to the same columns in

Table 1 in order to examine cohort differences for each ethnic group.

There are a number of interesting findings here. The Central and South

Americans who arrived between 1975 and 1979 were noticeably less concen-

trated in 1980 than their 1965-69 counterparts were in 1970; the

Herfindahi index for the recent cohort is only half the magnitude of the

index for the earlier cohort.111 The dominant change for this ethnic



     10Although the Mexicans' Herfindahi index did not change between
1970 and 1980, the frequency distributions show that there was a fair
amount of moving between SMSAs during the time interval.


     11The 1975-79 arrivals are even more dispersed in their initial
locations than their 1965-69 countrymen were ten to fifteen years after
arrival.

group was the sharp fall in New York's share and the rise in the shares

of Los Angeles and Miami. Similarly, the recent Mexican immigrants were

more dispersed than their earlier counterparts. Chicago and Los Angeles

only accounted for 60 percent of the choices of the 1975-79 arrivals as

compared to 76 percent for the earlier arrivals. The 1975-79 arrivals

from Asia and Europe were moderately less concentrated in 1980 than were

their 1965-69 counterparts in 1970. Although the Herfindahl indices for

these groups are largely unchanged, there are noticeable differences

between the 1970 and 1980 frequency distributions. In particular, for

both groups, New York's share fell, while the shares of Sunbelt cities

such as Anaheim, Houston and Los Angeles rose. Finally, in the case of

the Cubans, the more recent immigrants were considerably more concentrat-

ed than the earlier counterparts, with Miami's share rising from 53

percent to 73 percent.

     In sum, the data in Tables 1, 2 and 3 show that the new immigrants

are more geographically concentrated than native Americans who have

recently moved to new cities. We have seen, however, that it is impor-

tant to distinguish the various ethnic groups in the immigrant popula-

tion. At a given point in time, the geographic distributions of the

 ethnic groups are remarkably different. Examining changes between 1970

 and 1980 for the 1965-69 arrivals also indicates that general statements

 cannot be made about these changes for all five ethnic groups. The

 research problem is to explain why various ethnic groups seem to system-

 atically prefer certain SIISAs, why the 1970 and 1980 distributions differ

 for a given cohort (i.e., the 1965-69 arrivals), and why the two cohorts

 have different distributions. In order to answer these questions,

 equation (2) will be estimated for each of the immigrant groups in the

section of the paper.



IV. Econometric Specification



      A.    The Multinomial Logit Procedure


      As shown in equation (1) in Part II, the probability that individual

i chooses location j is the probability that the utility associated with

j is greater than the utility associated with any other potential loca-

tion. The individual's utility level at each location was assumed to be

a linear function of a set of location characteristics and a set of

personal attributes as shown in equation (2). For convenience, rewrite

equation (2) as:

where   Z.,. =   [L..,X..]   and y        [a,]


Using equation (3), we can write the probability of choosing location j

It has been shown (McFadden 1973) that if the c's are all assumed to be

independently identically distributed Weibull, then (4) can be rewritten

as:


                                     N
                  =   exp(Z..y)/         exp(Z.y)
                                 n=1
                                         16



     Equation (5) is the likelihood function for any individual i ob-

served to be in location j.        The log of this likelihood function can be

sunined across all individuals and maximized with respect to the y's. The

resulting estimates of y provide information on the impact of the vector

of Z variables in a particular location on the underlying utility level

that the individual associates with that particular location. If a

variable in Z. .       increases utility, its estimated coefficient will be
                  13

positive,   i.e., it has a positive effect on the probability that a

location is chosen over all the alternative locations.



     B.     Variables and Data Sources


     The first component of the vector Z is a set of characteristics

describing each SMSA in the choice set. The following variables were

obtained from the published volumes of the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of

Population: TOTPOP -- the total population in the SHSA; UNEMP --        the
unemployment rate of males 16 years of age and older in the SMSA; and

PFORB --    the   percentage of the population in the SMSA that is foreign-

born. PFORB is calculated separately for each ethnic group that is

studied. The level of welfare benefits is measured by GENAST, the real

average monthly general assistance payment per recipient, which is a good

proxy for the level of social services in the SFISA.        The nominal figures

 are obtained from the Public Assistance Statistics and are deflated by

 the BLS cost-of-living index for each SMSA. PFORB, TOTPOP and GENAST are

 predicted to have positive signs, while UNEMP is predicted to have a

 negative sign. The wage that the immigrant would expect to receive in

 each SMSA is measured by the mean wage (WAGE) of immigrants in that SMSA,

 classified by immigrant cohort and ethnicity. This is calculated from
                                    17




the data in the Public Use Samples. This wage variable is far superior

to an overall mean or median earnings measure for each SMSA, which would

give a very imperfect measure of an immigrant's opportunities in differ-

ent cities)2 Classifying the immigrant wage variable by ethnicity and

cohort adds even more precision.'3 One problem with this approach,

however, is that it requires limiting the analysis to cities in which the

immigrants are actually located. This is not a problem for the Asians,

Europeans and Central and South Americans who are represented in each of

the 25 cities being studied. It is a problem for the Mexicans and Cubans

who are each concentrated in a much smaller set of cities. The result is

that for the latter two groups, the number of cities actually included in

the multinomial logit analysis ranges between eight and twenty. Finally,

another characteristic of the SMSAs that may be important in explaining

the location choices of the immigrants is the distance from the immi-

grant's home country to the SMSA. Data on air distances between each of

the foreign countries and each of the SMSAs (DISTANCE) were obtained from

Fitzpatrick and Nodlin (1986). It is expected that DISTANCE will have a

negative sign in the regressions.




     2The paper by Vasegh-Daneshvary et al. referred to earlier used
median family income as a measure of market opportunities in different
locations.


     13Another approach is to estimate a wage equation for each immigrant
group and include a vector of dummy variables for the 25 cities. The
parameters could then be used to predict a wage for each individual in
each city. The advantage of this approach is that it controls for
differences in the characteristics of the immigrants across SMSAs. The
disadvantage is that the reliability of the predicted wage depends on the
precision with which the parameters are estimated. I tried this approach
and found that the results reported in Section V were largely unchanged
but I prefer using the mean wage variable since it is not dependent on a
set of parameters which may not be terribly robust.
                                   18




    It was argued in Part II that, in addition to location characteris-

tics, personal attributes themselves can determine the relative utility

values of the locations. Since the location probability equations are

estimated separately for each ethnic group, the role of ethnicity itself

in determining location choice is already taken into account. The effect

of personal attributes such as age and education could also be estimated

by including them as regressors in the logit equation. This would mean

estimating 24 parameters for each personal variable since there are 25

cities in the choice set. Unfortunately, this approach proved to be

computationally intractable and the algorithm never converged. Hence, an

alternative procedure, interacting the personal variables with some of

the location characteristics, is used.14

     The results of estimating the multinomial logit model for various

immigrant groups are presented in the next part of the paper. The reader

should keep in mind the fact that, as discussed above, in the case of the

Cubans and Mexicans, the empirical analysis only deals with the distribu-

tion of the immigrants across a restricted set of cities. It is unable

to answer the question of why these individuals do not locate in the

other cities in the original sample. For this reason, the reader is

urged to focus on the results presented for the Asians, Central and South

Americans, and Europeans.




           fact, using multiple interaction terms in the same equation
 resulted in non-convergence in many cases. Hence, I decided to concen-
 trate on the interactions with PFORB since a major concern is how differ-
 ent types of immigrants react to the location of fellow countrymen.

V.   Results for Immigrants



     A.   1965-69 Arrivals


     In Tables 4 and 5, the results of estimating equation (5) for the

male immigrants who arrived between 1965 and 1969 are shown. Each table

has two parts. The top half shows the coefficients from the model with

the six regressors, PFORB, TOTPOE', EWAGE, UNThP, GENAST and DISTANCE.

The bottom half reports three coefficients from the model which added two

interaction terms: AGEPF, which is AGE*PFORB, and EDUCPF, which is

EDUC*PFORB; only the coefficients on PFORB, AGEPF and EDUCPF are shown.

In Table 4, the determinants of the 1970, or initial location choices of

the 1965-69 immigrants are analyzed. Table 5 shows the determinants of

their 1980, or subsequent location choice. The individuals who are used

for the analysis in Table 4 are between the ages of 22 and 54 while those

in Table 5 are between the ages of 32 and 64. Comparing Tables 4 and 5

enables us to explore the role of assimilation in location choice be-

cause, by 1980, these individuals have been in the U.S. between ten and

fifteen years.

     In Table 4, we see that location of fellow countrymen, as measured

by PFORB, is the most powerful explanatory variable for all the ethnic

groups. An important finding is that the more educated immigrants place

less emphasis on this factor than the less educated in choosing their

initial locations. The differential role of PFORB for young and old

cohorts does not have a clear pattern; AGEPF is significant only for the

Cubans, for whom it can be observed that the older immigrants are more

dependent on the location of their fellow Cubans.

     The effects of the other variables in the model are not consistent

across the five ethnic groups. The expected wage in the SMSA is positive

and significant only for the Mexicans, Cubans, and Europeans. Unemploy-

ment rates have the hypothesized negative coefficient only for the Asians

and Mexicans. The welfare variable, GENAST, is positive and significant

only for the Asians, Central and South Americans, and Cubans. Finally,

DISTANCE is negative and significant in three out of five cases; the

positive coefficient for Mexicans reflects their large representation in

Chicago in 1970.

     In Table 5, the 1980 location decisions of the 1965—69 immigrants

are examined. Since by 1980 these individuals have been in the U.S.

between ten and fifteen years, the model developed in Part II predicts

that PFORB should now be a less important determinant of location choice,

the economic variables should be more significant, and DISTANCE should

have a weaker negative effect. This prediction is based on the assump-

tion that as immigrants spend time in the U.S., they learn about relative

economic opportunities in different cities and have less of a need to

rely on family and friends for economic and moral support. The estimates

in Table 5 are partially consistent with this hypothesis. PFORB is still

the most important determinant of location choice. However, DISTANCE is

only negative and significant in one case (the Mexicans), indicating that

with time spent in the U.S., most immigrants do move away from their

ports of entry. The predicted change for the WAGE variable holds true

only for the Asians and the Central and South Americans. The other

ethnic group for whom the analysis is most reliable, the Europeans,

unfortunately shows a decrease in the importance of the wage variable

between 1970 and 1980, but an increase in the significance of GENAST.

Indeed, in 1980, GENAST is the most consistent determinant of location

choices for the five ethnic groups.



     B.    1975-1979 Arrivals


     Table 6 presents the results of estimating equation (5) on the 1980,

or "initial," location choices of the male immigrants who arrived between

1975 and 1979. This table can be compared to Table 4, which examined the

initial location choices of the 1965-69 arrivals, to explore whether the

two cohorts behaved differently in choosing their initial locations in

the U.S.

     In Table 6, we see that, as in Tables 4 and 5, the most important

determinant of location choice is PFORB and, except for the Cubans, the

interaction term between PFORB and EDUC is negative and significant.

Comparing Tables 4 and 6 shows that the role of DISTANCE in the choice of

initial location has changed for some of the groups; the Central and

South Americans and Europeans chose more distant initial locations while

the Mexicans located closer to home. Market opportunities, as measured

by WAGE, also play a different role. The recent Asian immigrants chose

initial locations that had high expected wage rates and low unemployment

rates, unlike the Asian arrivals in the 1960s, who chose cities with low

unemployment and high welfare opportunities. This is an important

difference since it indicates that the more recent arrivals acquired

information regarding regional wage differentials within a very short

span of time. For the Mexicans, Cubans and Europeans, however, the wage

variable was positive and significant for the earlier cohort, but not for

the 1975-79 arrivals. There is no change in the effect of WAGE for the

Central and South Americans.

     What   can   account for the observed differences in the behavior of the

1965—69 and 1975-79 cohorts? Recent work by Chiswick (1986) provides an

answer. His analysis of earnings shows that there have been noticeable

trends in "the unmeasured dimensions of immigrant productivity, such as

language fluency, the quality of schooling and experience, and ability"

(Chiswick, p. 182). In particular, Chiswick finds that the quality of

Asian immigrants who arrived in the 1970s exceeds that of the immigrants

who arrived in the 1960s. Mexican and Cuban immigrants who arrived in

the 1970s were found to be of lower quality than their 1960s counter-

parts. Chiswick's white immigrant category, which includes Europeans and

other Hispanics, showed no change in quality over the decade. Chiswick's

findings can provide an explanation for the results I have presented.

The Asians who arrived between 1975 and 1979 are found to be more respon-

sive or more knowledgeable about relative economic opportunities than the

1960s arrivals, and this is exactly what we would expect to observe if

there has been an increase in immigrant "quality." On the other hand,

the Mexicans who arrived in the 1960s were found to choose their initial

locations on the basis of economic attributes of the cities (even locat-

ing far from home in some cases), quite unlike their 1970s counterparts;

and this is perfectly consistent with Chiswick's finding of a decrease in

quality of Mexican immigrants over time.



VI. Results for Natives



     In order to understand whether the location choice patterns of the

immigrants can be explained by their ethnicity, or by the fact that they

are recent arrivals to the United States, an analysis of native-born
                                  26




males who are members of the same ethnic groups as the immigrants is

conducted.15 The natives were restricted to be between the ages of 32

and 64 so that they could be compared to the immigrants who had already

been in the U.S. for ten to fifteen years and who, presumably, have

acquired some information about different areas in the U.S.16

     Table 7 shows the frequency distribution of the natives in 1980 and

the corresponding Herfindahl indices. It is noteworthy that these

distributions are quite different from the total population distribution.

For example, the Asian and Central and South American natives are more

likely to be located on the West Coast and less likely to be in the

Midwest than the rest of the population. Fully one third of the Mexican

natives are in Los Angeles, and another twenty percent are in other parts

of California. One-third of the Cuban natives are in New York City and

25 percent are in Florida. Comparing Table 7 to Table 2 shows the

relative importance of ethnicity and birthplace. The Asian natives and

immigrants have sharply different distributions. The natives are much

more likely to be in Los Angeles and less likely to be in Chicago and New

York, compared to the immigrants. In fact, the natives are much more

geographically concentrated than the immigrants. For the Central and

South Americans, we also find very different distributions for the




     15This was not done for the Europeans because of the difficulty in
interpreting the ancestry information for the white natives. Often
multiple ancestries were reported, making it difficult to determine
ethnicity. For the other four groups of natives, direct information on
ethnicity was available.


     l6The analysis was also done for natives aged 22-54 and the results
were virtually identical.

natives and ixmiigrants. Half of the iisigrants are in New York as

compared to 10 percent of the natives, while the natives are more likely

to be in the West. For this ethnic group, however, the natives are much

more dispersed than the immigrants. While the Mexican natives and

immigrants have similar distributions with both primarily in the West,

the immigrants are much more highly concentrated. Finally, the Cuban

natives differ from the Cuban immigrants in that the former have a

significant representation in New York, followed by Tampa, Los Angeles

and Miami, while two-thirds of the latter are in Miami; again, the

natives are more dispersed than the immigrants. In sum, with the excep-

tion of the Asians, the native ethnic groups are more dispersed through-

out the U.S. than the immigrants.

     The results of estimating the multinomial logit equation are shown

in Table 8 and should be compared to the ininigrant results in Table 5•17

The Asian natives, like the Asian immigrants, choose locations based on

the stock of individuals of similar ethnicity. All of the economic

variables have the right sign and are significant for the Asian natives;

the only difference between the natives and the immigrants is the

insignificnace of UNEMP for the immigrants. The Central and South

American natives are quite different from their foreign-born counterparts

since PPORB has no effect in the native regression but was the dominant

variable in the immigrant regression. Another difference for this group

 is that WAGE has a negative effect for the natives! Mexican natives,

 like Mexican immigrants, choose locations with high concentrations of




      17The equations were also estimated using data from the 1970 Census
 for the natives who were aged 22-54 in 1970. The results are very
 similar to those shown in Table 8.

Mexicans. However, they differ from the immigrants in that both WAGE and

GENAST have negative coefficients.18 Can the location choice behavior of

the immigrants be explained by their ethnicity? This analysis shows that

it is only in the case of the Asians that the same behavioral model can

be applied to both the natives and the immigrants. Although the Asian

natives and immigrants have different geographic distributions, the

parameter estimates follow a similar pattern for the two groups.



VII. Summary
        This paper developed and tested a multinomial logit model of the

location decisions of new immigrants to the United States. Data from the

5-percent Public Use Samples of the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of Population

were used to study the distribution of the 1965—69 and 1975-79 ininigrants

across the top 25 SMSAs in the U.S. In this section of the paper, the

major findings of the study are summarized.

        1. In choosing both initial and subsequent locations, immigrants

are considerably more geographically concentrated than native Americans

who move to a new city. There are interesting differences, however, in

 the degree of concentration of the initial locations of the two cohorts.

For example, the 1975—79 arrivals from Central and South America and

 Mexico are more dispersed than their 1965-69 counterparts, while the

 reverse pattern holds for the Cubans. The Asians and Europeans who

 arrived in the later years are moderately more dispersed than the earlier




      18Although the Cuban native sample is very small, we can tentatively
 infer that PFORB is not a factor in the location choices of this group,
 nor are the economic variables themselves. For the Cuban immigrants,
 however, PFORB was significant and WAGE was positive with a t-value of
 1.3.

arrivals. It was possible to study the change that took place between

1970 and 1980 in the degree of concentration of the 1965-69 immigrants.

With the exception of the Mexicans and the Cubans, there is evidence of a

moderate increase in dispersion.

     2. Probably the main lesson from this study is the diverse behavior

of the various immigrant groups. As we have seen, the five ethnic groups

that were studied are quite distinct from each other in their location

choices as well as the determinants of those choices. If we strive to

draw general conclusions about the location choice behavior of the new

immigrants to the United States, about the only thing that can be said is

that all of the immigrants prefer to live in cities where their fellow

countrymen are already located but this relationship is much weaker for

the more educated immigrants. In terms of forecasting which areas of the

country are likely to be most affected by the influx of immigrants, a

question posed in the Introduction, the answer is that those cities with

large foreign-born populations will continue to attract the new immi-

grants of the same ethnicity.

     3. The second question raised in the Introduction,, i.e., whether

immigrants learn about economic opportunities as they spend time in this

country, requires an ambiguous answer. First, with the exception of the

Mexicans, the immigrants who arrived in the late 1960s did tend to

relocate by 1980 to cities that were more distant from their home coun-

tries. This is consistent with the notion that experience in the U.S.

enables the immigrant to learn about opportunities in different parts of

the country. But the second response to the question requires an exami-

nation of the change in the importance of the expected wage variable in

predicting location choice. Only for the Asians, and to some extent, the
                                  32



Central and South Americans, is there evidence that the 1960s arrivals

did relocate by 1980 to cities with more attractive labor market

opportunities.

     4. Within each ethnic group, there is evidence of significant

differences in the behavior of the 1965—69 and 1975-79 cohorts. The

Asians who arrived between 1975 and 1979 were found to be more responsive

or more knowledgeable about relative economic opportunities than the

1960s arrivals. For the Mexicans, Cubans and Europeans, however, the

expected wage variable became negative for the 1975-79 arrivals. These

results are remarkably consistent with Chiswick's work on immigrants and

indicate an increase over time in the quality of Asian immigrants, and a

decrease in the quality of Mexican, Cuban and European immigrants.

     5. Finally, the immigrants were compared to natives of similar

ethnicity in order to gauge the relative importance of ethnicity and

birthplace in determining location choice. It was shown that the native

ethnic groups are more dispersed throughout the U.S. than the immigrants

and, with the exception of the Asians, the equations estimated for the

natives differ sharply from those for the immigrants. Only in the case

of the Asians can we conclude that ethnicity is an important determinant

of the location choice behavior of the immigrant groups.
