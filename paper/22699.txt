                                             ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the relation between house prices and economic growth. Using a dataset that
covers house prices for 19 countries from the first quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 2013. We
find that house price appreciations are positively associated with economic growth, while the relation
between house price depreciations and economic growth is highly non-linear, depending on country-specific
characteristics. In the absence of concurrent banking crisis, large house price depreciations (rather
than prolonged and modest ones) are positively associated with economic growth. We also find that
the positive association between house price depreciations and economic growth is more pronounced
in countries with civil-law legal systems, in countries without mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy
law.

1. Introduction

    House price appreciations contribute to the economic growth through increasing household consumption

(i.e. via the wealth effect, see Mian, Gao and Sufi, 2013, Mian and Sufi, 2014) and firm investment beyond new

housing construction (i.e. via the network or collateral effect, see Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz‚Äê

Salehi, 2012, Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar, 2012). Large house price appreciations, however, can lead to

overinvestment (Miao, Wang and Zhou, 2015), which crowd out the funding supply to more productive sectors

and reduce economic output (Chakraborty, Goldstein, and MacKinlay, 2016). The eventual house price

depreciations tend to happen with tightening credit conditions due to falling collateral value, declining real-

estate related employment and deteriorating consumption demand. The large depreciations that follow prolong

appreciations can potentially reduce capital market distortion and improve investment efficiency, which

subsequently enhances economic growth via reducing existing economic slack (Lau and Zheng, 2015).

Understanding the dynamics of house prices and economic growth is the objective of this paper.

    To study the relation between economic growth and house valuations, we look at house prices in a panel of

19 countries from the first quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 2013. In the econometric analyses, we find that

there is a positive relation between house price appreciations and economic growth. Interestingly, the eventual

house price depreciation has a non-linear relationship with economic growth. Similar to Jord√†, Schularick and

Taylor (2015a), we find that house price cycles can be costly if it is accompanied by a banking crisis. In the

absence of a banking crisis, a large house price depreciation (rather than a prolonged and modest one) is

associated with a stronger economic output and productivity growth. This result is consistent with the finding

by Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2015) that economic activity recovers faster after a larger decline in house prices,

driven by more foreclosure by delinquent homeowners. We also find that the positive relation between large
house price depreciations and economic output growth is more pronounced in countries with a civil law system,

and without mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy law.

    This paper is related to Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2015) who use the U.S. household level data to evaluate the

impact of house prices on economic activity. We extend their exercise to an international context using country-

level data and find similar evidence that a country‚Äôs economic output grows faster when its house price

undergoes sharp and deep corrections. The new evidence adds to the existing literature that study the dynamic

interaction between house price shocks and global macroeconomic fluctuations (Beltratti and Morana 2010;

Musso, Neri, and Stracca, 2011; Jord√†, Schularick and Taylor, 2015b). This paper is also related to Borio,

Disyatat, and Juselius (2015), who find that credit conditions and property prices explain the cyclical variations

of output gap in the U.S. significantly, and Miller, Peng, and Sklarz (2011), who find that houses prices affect

aggregate economic growth using U.S. metropolitan data. While these studies focus on the U.S. market, we

offer cross-country evidence on the relation between house valuations and economic growth. Moreover, we

document a positive linkage between large house depreciations and economic growth, which may channel

through increasing capital allocation efficiency (Borensztein and Lee, 2002; Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap,

2008) and labour mobility (Donovan and Schnure, 2011; Schulhofer-Wohl, 2011). These new findings have

important policy implications for managing bursting house bubbles.

    The remainder of this paper as organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, Section 3 presents the

results, Section 4 explores the implications of house price cycles on aggregate economic growth, Section 5

discusses the possible mechanisms that drive the positive relation between large house price depreciations and

economic growth, and Section 6 concludes.
2. Data

      House price data come from The Economist‚Äôs house-price index1. Our estimation sample includes quarterly

house prices in real terms and price-to-rent ratios for 19 countries (both OECD and non-OECD) from the first

quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 2013. We look at two measures: House Price Return (ùêªùëÉùëÖùëñ,ùë° ), a three-

year cumulative return on real house price index in country i at period t, and House Price to Rent Ratio (PRR),

which is calculated as a three-year cumulative change on real price-to-rent ratio. Housing market related policies,

including maximum loan to value ratio (LTV), mortgage subsidies/insurance, personal bankruptcy law, are

drawn mainly from Shim, Bogdanova, Shek and Subelyte (2013).

      Country-level macroeconomic variables come from IMF‚Äôs International Financial Statistics and Bank for

International Settlements (BIS). A set of dependent variables includes real GDP growth, per capita GDP growth,

and total factor productivity growth. In addition to house prices, we also include a set of control variables: (i)

Log(initialGDP), the log of real GDP lagged by one year; (ii) Investment, the annual return on the gross capital

formation to GDP calculated as the log difference in the gross capital formation to GDP between current quarter

and the same quarter of last year; (iii) Unemployment, the annual change in the log of unemployment rate; (iv)

Inflation, the annual change in the log of CPI index; (v) GovExp, the nominal government consumption divided

by the nominal GDP; (vi) TradeOpenness, the sum of nominal exports and imports as a ratio of the nominal

GDP; and (vii) Credit, the domestic credit to private sector divided by GDP. Appendix Table A1 summarizes

the data sources and variable definitions in details.

      On aggregate, we have 1,920 common country-quarter observations for our regressions. The sample starts

from the first quarter of 1978 (the first three year observations are dropped when calculating HPR and PRR).

    The data is available from http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/global-house-prices. The original data
covers 21 countries, Singapore and China are excluded from the final sample due to the lack of quarterly data on trade and
inflation in International Financial Statistics.
Table 1 reports summary statistics of these variables. House price appreciations are more frequent and larger in

size than house price depreciations: there are 1,212 country-quarter episodes of housing price appreciations with

an average HPR of 17%, and 718 episodes of housing price depreciations with an average HPR of -11%.




3. Results

    3.1. Baseline Estimation

    To estimate the association between economic growth and house prices, we use the following specification:

          ùë¶ùëñ,ùë° = Œ∏ ‚àô ùêªùëÉùëÖùëñ,ùë° + Œ≥ ‚àô |ùêªùëÉùëÖùëñ,ùë° | ‚àô ùê∑ùëñ,ùë° + Œí ‚àô Œõ ùëñ,ùë° + Œ¥ ‚àô Countryùëñ + Quarterùë° + ùúÄùëñ,ùë° ,       (1)

where we denote ùë¶ for economic growth, HPR for house price return for country i, and time period t (quarterly).

House price depreciation variable, ùê∑ùëñ,ùë° , is a dummy variable identifying the degree of house price depreciation:

DHPR <0, (DHPR <m, or Dm‚â§HPR <0) is equal to one if HPR is negative (lower than median of HPR depreciation, or
    i,t           i,t            i,t




higher than the median of HPR depreciation), and zero otherwise. The main independent variable is the

interaction between HPR and house price depreciation dummy. To differentiate between house price

appreciations and depreciations, we use the absolute of house price return |ùêªùëÉùëÖùëñ,ùë° | in the regression. The

coefficient of the interaction term, Œ≥, thus captures the linkage between house price depreciations and economic

growth, relative to that between house price appreciations and economic growth. A positive value of Œ≥ suggests

that house price depreciations are more positively associated with economic growth than house price

appreciations.

    We also include other explanatory variables (Œõ) in the regressions. First, we control for the initial level of

economic development proxied by Log(InitialGDP) as well as the growth of capital and labor, captured,

respectively, by the annual log change in gross capital formation as a ratio to GDP (Investment) and the log

change in unemployment rate (Unemployment). These variables account for growth in factor inputs influencing
output growth. Following the literature, we also control for Inflation, captured by the annual change in the log

of consumer price index (CPI); the level of TradeOpenness of an economy, defined as the ratio of the exports

plus imports to GDP; the ratio of government expenditure to GDP (GovExp), and bank credit to private sector

as a ratio of GDP (Credit). All the level variables (TradeOpenness, GovExp, and Credit) are lagged by four

quarters in the estimation. Also included in the regression is country and quarter fixed-effects, where Quarter

takes the value of 1, 2, 3 or 4. The standard errors of the estimated coefficients allow for clustering of

observations by quarter.

    Using Equation (1) as the baseline specification, Table 2 reports estimation results of the relation between

real GDP growth and house prices. Column 1 indicates that the economic growth is positively associated with

house price returns. As we differentiate the house price returns into depreciation (HPR < 0) and appreciation

(HPR > 0), we find that the association is highly non-linear: in absolute term, there is some evidence that both

house price appreciations and depreciations are positively associated with economic growth. The result in

column (2) suggests that a 1% house price appreciation is associated with 2.3 basis points increase in the

economic growth, while the house price depreciation of the same size is positively associated with 1.7 basis

points increase in the economic growth [the number 1.7 basis point is calculated as |ùêªùëÉùëÖ| ‚àó

(Œ≥ ‚àí Œ∏)=1%*(4.00-2.26)].

    Motivated by Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2015), who show that large and moderate house price depreciations

have asymmetric impacts on economic activity, we differentiate further the house price depreciations into large

depreciations and moderate depreciations; i.e. whether the negative HPR is lower (that is, more negative) or

higher than the median value of the negative HPR. Based on Table 1, a country-quarter housing price

observation is considered a large depreciation if it drops by more than 9.4% over three years, and moderate

depreciation otherwise. Interestingly, the estimation results in Table 2 columns (3) and (4) suggest that only
large depreciations are positively associated with the economic growth. More specifically, a large depreciation

of 10% is associated with 14 basis points increase in the real GDP growth. In Appendix Table A2, we also

differentiate the large appreciations with moderate appreciations, but find no evidence of an asymmetric relation

with economic growth.

     The association between economic growth and other controls are as expected and in line with previous

studies; countries with lower initial GDP, more investment and less unemployment rate are found to have higher

economic growth; less trade openness is associated with higher growth, which is in line with Yanikkaya, (2003);

less financially developed economies are associated with higher economic growth, consistent with Alfaro,

Chanda, Kalemli-Ozcan and Sayek (2004). Overall, the baseline estimation can explain about half of the

variation in the growth rates across countries as suggested by the R-squared.

    3.2. Endogeneity Issues

     The ordinary least square (OLS) estimation results in Table 2 provide evidence that house price

appreciations and large depreciations are positively associated with the real GDP growth. In this section, we

address potential feedback from economic growth to housing prices; i.e. house price appreciates following

strong economic growth. In addition, the relation observed from Table 2 may be spurious if we omit common

variables that affect both house prices and economic growth. Both reverse causality and omitted variables could

result in the OLS estimated coefficients being biased and inconsistent. To address these concerns, we employ

an instrumental variable (IV) approach. We use the three-year cumulative change in the price-to-rent ratios,

PRR, to instrument house price returns, HPR. Almeida, Campello, and Liu (2006) find price-to-rent ratio to be

an important determinant of house prices. Further, it is plausible that price-to-rent ratios can affect the economic

growth mostly through house prices. Therefore, the excluded instrument PRR should satisfy the relevance and

exogenous criteria.
    Together with the coefficient estimates from the first and second stage regressions, Table 3 reports the F-

statistics and p-value of Endogeneity Test under the null hypothesis that HPR are exogenous: they clearly reject

the null hypothesis at 1% significance level, supporting the use of IV approach. The endogenous regressor, HPR,

as well as its interactions with large and moderate depreciation dummy variables are instrumented with PRR

together with its interactions with the two depreciation dummy variables. Columns (1) - (3) provide the first-

stage regressions, using two-stage least square (2sls) methods. It shows that the excluded instruments are

significantly associated with HPR and the interaction terms. The under-identification test reports the

Kleibergen-Paap rank LM statistic and its corresponding p-value under the null hypothesis that the instrumental

variable is not relevant: it rejects the null hypothesis that the excluded instruments are not relevant at 5%

significance level. The weak-identification test reports a Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald F-statistic of 7.5. Given

that the Stock-Yogo weak ID test critical value at 10% maximum IV size is 7.03, the F-statistic rejects the null

hypothesis that the IV is a weak instrument. These test statistics support our choices of the instruments.

    Column (4) of Table 3 reports the second-stage estimation results. It shows that house price appreciations

and large depreciations remain positively and significantly related to the real GDP growth. Moreover, coefficient

estimates from the IV estimation is larger than that the estimates from OLS: 10% house price depreciation

increases the real GDP growth by 30 basis points in the IV, compared to 14 basis points in the OLS regression.

For moderate house price depreciation, the estimate has become negative and insignificant. In particular, an 8%

depreciation in housing prices is associated with 35 basis point decline in real GDP growth [calculated as

8%*(6.44-2.07)]. Such a result is however not significant.




    3.3. Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity

    We next delve further into the cross-sectional differences in the relation between house valuations and
economic growth. Table 4 reports the second-stage estimation results based on the 2sls method, accounting for

differences across countries with additional country-specific characteristics. All regressions are controlled for

country and quarter fixed-effects. Across various specifications, the estimated coefficients of HPR and

|HPR|*DHPR<m are both positive and statistically significant, while that of |HPR|*Dm<HPR<0 is negative but

insignificant. The results are consistent with our earlier findings that house price appreciations and large house

price depreciations are positively associated with economic growth. The estimated coefficients for other control

variables included in Table 3 remain consistent (not reported for brevity).

    Additional country-specific characteristics included in this set of estimation are in order. Columns (1) of

Table 4 report the estimation results that account for institutional characteristics, measured by CommonLaw that

equals to 1 if the country is in the common-law system as recorded in Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny

(1998), and zero otherwise. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term |HPR|*DHPR<m*CommonLaw is

statistically significant and negative, suggesting that large house price depreciations is less associated with

economic growth in common law legal framework than in civil law legal framework. In particular, a 10%

depreciation in house prices is associated with 60 basis points increase in the real GDP growth in countries with

civil law legal framework (the estimated coefficient of |HPR|*DHPR<m 7.98 minus the estimated coefficient of

HPR 1.96, multiplied by the magnitude of depreciation 10%), but only related to 3 basis point increases of the

real GDP growth in countries with common law legal framework [calculated as (7.98-1.96-5.71)*10%]. As the

civil law systems tend to provide relatively weak legal protection for investors as compared to the common law

systems (Porta, et al., 1998), our results seem to suggest a stronger relationship between larger house price

depreciations and economic growth in countries with weaker safety nets.

    Columns (2) and (3) report the regressions that account for the availability of mortgage insurance and

personal bankruptcy law, respectively. The dummy MI takes a value of 1 if the government provides mortgage
insurance in country i at period t. The PBL is also a dummy that equals to 1 if there is personal bankruptcy law

in country i at period t. Both interaction terms |HPR|*DHPR<m*MI and |HPR|*DHPR<m*PBL are statistically

significant and negative, suggesting stronger relation between large depreciations and economic growth in

countries that do not provide mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy law. As the provision of mortgage

insurance and personal bankruptcy law strengthens the cushion against large house price depreciations, the

results support our previous argument that the relation between large depreciations and economic growth is

stronger in countries with weaker safety nets.

    Column (4) report results that account for housing policy, using the national requirement on maximum loan

to value ratio (LTV), based on Almeida et al. (2004), as a proxy. The dummy variable LTV<0.8 takes a value of

1 if the maximum LTV ratio is less than 80% (that is, the minimum down payment is more than 20%). The

interaction term |HPR|*DHPR<m*LTV<0.8 is negative but not statistically significant. Column (5) explore whether

the results differ between OECD and non-OECD countries. The interaction term |HPR|*DHPR<m*OECD, where

OECD is a dummy that equals to 1 for OECD countries, is positive but not statistically significant. Column (6)

reports results that account for a concurrent banking crisis. The dummy variable Crisis equals to 1 if there is a

banking crisis, as identified in Laeven and Valencia. (2013), and 0 otherwise. The interaction term

|HPR|*DHPR<m*Crisis is statistically significant and negative, indicating that the positive relation between large

depreciations and growth becomes weaker in the presence of the banking crises. In fact, when there is a banking

crisis, the relation between large depreciations and economic growth becomes trivial and insignificant.

    To summarize, the positive relation between large depreciations and economic growth is more pronounced

in countries with civil-law legal systems, in countries without mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy law,

and in countries without a concurrent banking crisis.

    3.4. Alternative Measures of Growth
    To check for the robustness of our results, we use two alternative measures of economic growth: Per Capita

GDP Growth (the change in log of annual GDP per capita) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth (the

Solow residual). Columns (1) and (3) provide estimation results based on OLS using, respectively, GDP per

capita growth and TFP growth as the alternative dependent variables. All regressions control for country-

specific time-varying characteristics as well as country and quarter fixed-effects (not reported). For both

alternative measures of economic growth, our main results remain robust: both house price appreciations and

large house price depreciations are positively related to economic growth. Columns (2) and (4) provide the

second-stage estimation results based on 2sls. The under-identification tests reject the null hypothesis that the

excluded instruments are not relevant at 5% significance level. The weak-identification tests reject the null

hypothesis that the excluded instruments are weakly identified. Both tests support the use of price-to-rent ratio

(PRR) and its interactions with depreciation dummies as the excluded instruments and their statistical relevance.

The 2sls estimation results suggest that large depreciations are positively associated with growth in GDP per

capita as well as TFP: we infer from the results that a 10% housing price depreciation is associated with 43 basis

points growth in GDP per capita and 38 basis points growth in TFP.

    Based on Table 3 and 5, Figure 1 summarizes the relation between different measures of economic growth

and 1% marginal increment in house price appreciations, moderate depreciations, and large depreciations.

Regardless of which growth measures are used, house appreciations and large depreciations are associated with

higher economic growth.

    3.5. Additional Controls

    To mitigate the concern of spurious relation between house valuations and economic growth caused by

omitted variables, we control for additional variables. Table 6 reports the second-stage result based on 2sls

estimation. We find that including the lag of HPR, the lag of GDP growth, or both, does not affect our main
results. Throughout the various specifications, the estimated coefficient of HPR remains positive and

statistically significant. The estimated coefficients of the interaction between |HPR| and large house price

depreciation dummy remains positive and statistically significant. With the exception of column (6) when the

one-quarter lagged HPR and real GDP growth are included, the estimated coefficient of |HPR|* DHPR<m is

greater than that of HPR, further suggesting a positive linkage between large house price depreciations and

economic growth.

    3.6. Plausibly Exogenous IV

    The results that both house price appreciations and large depreciations are positively related to economic

growth are robust across different estimation methods, different measures of growth, and alternative

specifications. Nonetheless, the excluded instrument PRR may still be imperfect, it may affect the economic

growth directly or through channels other than house valuations that are neither documented in existing literature

nor easily observable. We shall, therefore, take caution in interpreting the causality running from house

valuations to economic growth.

    To further check the robustness of the results, we take into considerations that the excluded IV may not

satisfy the exogenous criteria. In particular, we verify the results using the methodology in Conley, Hansen and

Rossi (2012), allowing the excluded IV to be not entirely exogenous. Table 7 reports the second stage estimation

results under flexible (plausibly exogenous) conditions based on the union of confidence intervals approach.

We find that our main findings on the association between house valuations and economic growth remain

consistent for all three measures of economic growth. Specifically, a 10% house price appreciation is associated

with 35, 29 and 22 basis points increase in real GDP growth, per capita GDP growth and TFP growth while a

10% house price depreciation is associated with 21, 33 and 18 basis points increase in the growth of real GDP,

per capita GDP and TFP, respectively.
4. Implications on Economic Growth

    According to Bracke (2013), the average duration of housing appreciations in a housing cycle, deÔ¨Åned as

the time interval between a trough and a peak, is 24.1 quarters or approximately 6 years, and the average duration

of housing depreciations, defined as the time interval between a peak and a trough is 18.2 which is about 5 years.

In our sample, the average size of house price appreciations and depreciations over three years are 17% and 11%

respectively (see Table 1). If the housing market appreciates 17% per three years (or 5.4% per year) for the first

6 years, and then depreciates sharply at 11% per three years in the 5 years that follows, the total contribution of

a typical housing cycle to GDP growth is about 3.8% based on the estimation results in Table 3.2 Based on the

2sls estimation results in Table 5, such a housing cycle would be associated with 4.5% and 3.6% increment in

GDP per capita growth and TFP growth. If the house price depreciates slowly, say at 4% per three years over

the 5-year downturn periods, a typical housing cycle would have to be associated with 1%, 1.8% and 1.9%

increase in the real GDP growth, GDP per capita growth and the TFP growth respectively.

    Based on the estimation results, we calculate the contribution of housing price dynamics to economic

outputs in terms of growth in GDP, GDP per capita, and TFP. In particular, for each country-quarter, we multiply

HPR with the difference of the estimated coefficient of HPR and its two interaction terms |HPR|*DHPR<m and

|HPR|*D0<HPR<0 based on two-stage least square as reported in Table 3 and 5 to calculate the economic

significance of the relation between house prices and economic growth. Table 8 presents the average annual

association between housing valuations and economic growth for each country. Figure 2 illustrates the average



2
  It is calculated as [17%*2.07*6+11%*(5.06-2.07) *5]/100=3.76%, where 2.07 is the estimated coefficient of
HPR and 5.06 is the estimated coefficient of |HPR|*DHPR<m in Table 3. The difference between 5.06 and 2.07
measures the relation between large depreciations and economic growth. More precise calculations that simulate
the growth of housing prices and its cumulative association with growth yield similar results. For example, the
compounded cumulative return is (1+17%*2.07/100)6*(1+11%*(5.06-2.07)/100)5-1=3.82%.
relation between housing valuations and real GDP growth for each country. Such a relation is the strongest in

Hong Kong, translating housing valuations into the economic growth of 6.7 to 81 basis points per year: in the

absence of housing price cycles, the economic growth in Hong Kong would have been lower by 67 to 81 basis

points per year. If cumulated over several years, this can have a significant implication on its long-term

economic growth. On average, the housing price cycles add 26 to 35 basis points to economic growth annually.

Note that, given our sample periods, the contribution of housing valuations to economic growth in German and

Japan is negative, although the magnitude is comparatively small.

5. Discussion

     It is intuitive that house price appreciations are positively related to the economic growth as they increase

the consumption and investment both directly (captured by the inputs in the control variable) and indirectly

(Mian, Gao and Sufi, 2013; Mian and Sufi, 2014; Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz‚ÄêSalehi, 2012;

Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar, 2012). While large house price depreciations are associated with lower levels of

consumption and investment that undermine economic growth, it can trigger financial and labour market

restructuring that benefits growth. According to Borensztein and Lee (2002), credit is reallocated to more

efficient firms after a crisis. One can, therefore, expect a credit market reshuffle that direct investment flows

from real estate to more productive sectors following a sharp and deep correction in the housing market as

captured by the large depreciations episodes, which improves the long-term economic growth. Moreover, in

countries where zombie lending distorts capital allocation and depresses growth (Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap,

2008), steep housing prices corrections may force zombie firms out of the market, which allows banks to lend

more efficiently than committing loans to unproductive zombie firms. In this sense, large depreciations can be

related to higher economic growth through improving banking efficiency. Finally, large depreciations can

benefit economic growth through improving labor mobility. According to Donovan and Schnure (2011) and
Schulhofer-Wohl (2011), underwater mortgages provide greater incentive for households to relocate from a

relatively poor to a better labor market, which improves labor mobility. Large depreciations that increase the

number and magnitude of underwater mortgages, therefore, enhance labor mobility and subsequently economic

growth.




6. Conclusion

    Our empirical study suggests that house price appreciations are positively associated with economic growth,

while the relation between house price depreciations and economic growth is highly non-linear, depending on

country-specific characteristics. In the absence of concurrent banking crisis, large house price depreciations are

positively associated with economic growth. We also find that the positive linkage between house price

depreciations and economic growth is more pronounced in countries with relatively weak safety nets, the

presence of a civil law system, provision of mortgage insurance and existence of personal bankruptcy law.

The table reports the second stage results by regressing output growth on house price return (HPR) and its interaction with large appreciation dummy DHPR<ma (equals to 1 if HPR is

greater than the median value of all positive HPR and 0 otherwise, the default), moderate appreciation dummy D0<HPR<ma (equals to 1 if HPR is greater than 0 but less than the median

value of all positive HPR), large depreciation dummy DHPR<m (equals to 1 if HPR is less than the median value of all negative HPR and 0 otherwise), and moderate depreciation dummy

Dm<HPR<0 (equals to 1 if HPR is greater than the median value of all negative HPR but less than 0)   The control variables other than HPR related terms are the same as in the estimation

of Table 3 (not reported).   Robust standard errors clustered by quarter are reported in parentheses, with the symbol ***, ** and * denote respectively the statistical significance levels

Table 2. House-Price Adjustment and Economic Growth.

This table reports the ordinary least square estimation results based on Eq. (1). The dependent variable is the growth rate of real GDP measured in 2005 USD; calculated as the change

in log real GDP, scaled by 100. HPR is the three-year change in log real house-price, scaled by 100.     DHPR<0 is a dummy variable, equals to one if HPR is negative, and zero otherwise.

DHPR<m is a dummy variable identifying episodes of large depreciation in house-price, equals to one if HPR is lower than median of HPR depreciation, and zero otherwise.        Dm‚â§HPR<0 is

a dummy that equals to one if the HPR is higher or equal to the median of HPR depreciation, and zero otherwise.     Log(initial GDP) is the log of real GDP, lagged by one year.   Capital

Investment is the change in log of nominal gross capital formation to GDP.     Unemployment is the change in log of unemployment rate.         Inflation is the change in log of CPI index.

Government Expenditure is the nominal government consumption divided by the nominal GDP.               Trade Openness is the sum of exports and imports to nominal GDP.       Credit is the

domestic credit to private sector divided by GDP.     Accompanying the estimation results, robust standard errors clustered by quarter are reported in parentheses.        All regressions

control for country and quarter fixed-effects, with symbol ***, ** and * denoting, respectively, statistical significance levels at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 3. Instrumental-Variables Estimation.

Table 3 reports the Instrumental-Variables (IV) estimation results based on Eq. (1).      The instrument variables are PRR, the log change of Price/Rent ratio over the past three years, and

its interaction with Dm‚â§HPR<0 and DHPR<m, where Dm‚â§HPR<0 equals to one if HPR is higher or equal to the median of HPR depreciation and DHPR<m, equals to one if HPR is lower than

median of HPR depreciation.      Columns (1)-(2) provide the first-stage regressions, while column (3) provides the second-stage estimation results, using 2sls methods. All regressions

are controlled for country and quarter fixed-effects.   Robust standard errors clustered by quarter are reported in parentheses.     The under-identification test reports the Kleibergen-Paap

rank LM statistic and its corresponding p-value under the null hypothesis that the instrumental variable is relevant.      The weak identification test reports the Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald

F-statistic.   Note that the Stock-Yogo weak ID tests‚Äô critical values at 10% maximum IV size are 7.03.       Endogeneity Test reports the F-statistics and p-value under the null hypothesis

that instrumented variables are exogenous.     The symbol ***, ** and * denote, respectively, the statistical significance levels at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 4. Cross-sectional differences in large house-price adjustment.

The table reports the two-stage least-square estimation results by including the interaction between large price depreciations with country characteristics.      The CommonLaw is a dummy that equals to 1 if the country belongs to the common law system. MI is a

dummy that takes the value of 1 if the government provides mortgage insurance at period t. LTV<0.8 is a dummy that equals to 1 if the maximum loan to value ratio is less than 80%. PBL is a dummy that equals to 1 if there is Personal Bankruptcy Law in that country

at period t. OECD is a dummy that equals to 1 if the country is a member of OECD. Crisis is a dummy that equals to 1 if there is a banking crisis in the country at period t. All regressions are controlled for country and quarter fixed-effects. The control variables are

the same as in the estimation of Table 3 (not reported).   Robust standard errors clustered by quarter are reported in parentheses, with the symbol ***, ** and * denote respectively the statistical significance levels at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 5. Alternative Measures of Economic Growth.

We use GDP Per Capita Growth (measured as the change in log of GDP per capita) and Total Factor Productivity growth (measured by the residual in the country-specific regression of

real GDP growth rate on capital investment and labor). Columns (1) and (3) provide the estimation results based on OLS.          Columns (2) and (4) provide the results based on two-stage

least square.    All regressions are controlled for country and quarter fixed-effects.   The under-identification test reports the Kleibergen-Paap rank LM statistic and its corresponding p-

value under the null hypothesis that the instrumental variable is relevant.     The weak-identification test reports the Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald F-statistic. The Stock-Yogo weak-ID

test critical values at 10% maximum IV size are 7.03.       Robust standard errors clustered by quarter are reported in parentheses, with the symbol ***, ** and * denote respectively the

statistical significance levels at 1%, 5%. and 10%.

Table 8: Average Contribution of Housing Cycles to Economic Growth. This table reports the average annual
contribution of housing price return (HPR) to the growth in GDP, GDP per capita and total factor productivity
(TFP) country by country. For each country in each quarter, the contribution of HPR to the growth is calculated
by multiplying HPR with the difference of the estimated coefficient of HPR and its two interaction terms based
on two-stage least square as reported in Table 3 and 5. All numbers are reported in percentages.
