A Bargain at Twice the Price? California Hospital Prices in the New Millennium

                                             ABSTRACT

We use data from California to document and offer possible explanations for the sharp increase in
hospital prices charged to private payers after 1999. We find a downward trend in price for private
pay patients in the 1990s and a rapid upward trend beginning in 1999, amounting to an annual average
increase of 10.6% per year over 1999-2005. Prices in 2006 were almost double prices in 1999. By
contrast, there was little discernable trend in prices for Medicare and Medicaid patients, although these
prices varied from year-to-year. Surprisingly, the increase in prices is not correlated, geographically,
with the change in hospital market concentration. For example, the greatest price rises came from
hospitals in monopoly and highly concentrated counties which experienced little or no change over
our sample period. Two recent California state hospital regulations, the seismic retrofit mandate and
the mandatory nurse staffing ratio affected hospital costs. However, the cost increases due to the nursing
staffing regulations are not large enough to account for the price increase, and the price increase is
not substantially correlated with the costs of compliance with the seismic retrofit mandate. Therefore,
the source of the near-doubling of California hospital prices remains something of a mystery.

Introduction
After relatively modest growth in the 1990s, US healthcare costs began to rise
more rapidly again with the start of the new millennium. From 1992 to 1999, per
capita healthcare costs rose in nominal dollars from $3,265 to $4,518, a
compound average annual growth rate of 4.7%. These costs rose from $4,782 to
$7,421 between 2000 and 2007, at an annual growth rate of 6.5%. Adjusting for
inflation using the CPI yields an average growth in real per capita spending of
2.2% from 1992-1999 and 3.7% from 2000-2007.1 The difference in growth rates
was even greater for hospital costs, as their real per capita growth rate rose from
0.4% from 1992-1999 to 3.8% from 2000-2007.
    This increase in hospital costs has drawn attention in the popular press and the
public policy community. For example, a recent article in the Wall Street Journal
(Martinez and Johnson, 2009) reports that hospitals have been achieving 6-9%
price increases “in recent years.” A report prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers
for the California Healthcare Foundation (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2007) found
that the profitability and financial position of California hospitals had improved in
the new millennium relative to the 1990s.
    There are a number of potential explanations for the increase in hospital costs
and prices since 2000. These increases could reflect increased costs from
increasing input prices, increased costs from new regulatory requirements,
increased bargaining power due to the decreasing influence of managed care,
increasing market concentration of hospitals, or some other cause. In this work,
we take advantage of California’s unusually good hospital data to document the
price increase for California hospitals over recent years and to explore the
possible causes for it.

Literature Review
The upsurge of inpatient hospital prices for commercial patients in California
after 1999 has received some attention in the literature. Melnick and Keeler
(2007) for instance, document that the period covering 1999 to 2003 showed
significant growth in the price of inpatient services. They use data on average net
revenue per discharge for 10 common Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) in
California to show that price increased rapidly between 1999 and 2003. The
increase in price varied with system membership. Hospitals that belonged to
systems were able to charge a much higher price than comparable non-system
hospital. Hospitals that belonged to large systems (with more than 15 members)
increased their prices by 34% more than non-system hospitals. Those in small

systems (with up to 15 members) increased their prices by 17% more than non-
system hospitals.
    Using data from California from 1993 to 2001, Zwanziger and Bamezai
(2006) find that the increase in inpatient net revenues of private payers after 1999
is associated with a decrease in net revenues from Medicare patients. Using a
multivariate hospital fixed-effects analysis, they conclude that controlling for
costs, every 10% decrease in Medicare price is associated with a 1.7% increase in
prices to private payers.
    The increase in hospital prices was not restricted to California. Strunk et al.
(2005), report that hospital prices (both inpatient and outpatient) increased
significantly from 1994 to 2004. Using price data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) “all other payers” Producer Price Index (PPI) series for general
and surgical hospitals they find that the annual percent change per capita for
hospital prices decreased by 1.5 percentage points (from 4.0 to 2.5) from 1994 to
1999 and increased by 4.5 percentage points (from 2.5 to 7.0) from 1999 to 2004.
The three studies highlighted above all confirm the increase in prices we see in
our data. The time period covered in the data used in the first two studies end
before the significant increase we observe after 1999. The price reported by
Strunk et al. is a noisy measure of hospital price and includes both inpatient and
outpatient prices. However, it also confirms the general price trend we observe in
California.
    In this paper, we document the rapid escalation in the price of inpatient
services in California and offer possible explanations for it. We find that the usual
factors mentioned in the literature as reasons for hospital price increases do not
adequately explain the magnitude of the price increase we observe in the data.
The sharp price increase we observe does not seem to be correlated
geographically with the change in hospital market concentration. In addition,
changing case mix does not seem to explain the increases we observe. California
imposed cost-increasing regulation over the period of time we observe the rapid
price changes (nurse staffing requirements and seismic retrofit requirements), but
neither of them seem adequately to explain the run up in prices2. There is
evidence that after 1999, the influence of managed care organizations weakened
and hospitals were able to exploit this weakness to demand significantly higher
payments from health insurers.




2
  It is possible that increasing costs account for a large percent of the run up in prices we see in our
data. Our measure of hospital cost does not separate out costs for each payer, thus it is possible
that overall cost has grown steadily but a cost related to the care of private paying patients has
increased rapidly.
Data
We use data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and
Development (OSHPD) covering the 15 year period from 1992-2006. Every non-
federal hospital in California is required by law to file a report to OSHPD on
various aspects of their operations. These reports include un-audited quarterly
financial data, audited annual financial data, and inpatient discharge abstracts.
OSHPD creates a number of standardized data products depicting California’s
hospital industry from these reports.3 In our work, we use three of these data
products: the quarterly financial data, the annual financial data, and the inpatient
discharge abstracts. Throughout our analysis, we restrict our sample to short-
term, general, non-Kaiser hospitals.
    The submission of an annual financial report including a detailed income
statement, balance sheet, statements of revenue and expense, and supporting
schedules, as well as a quarterly hospital financial report is required of all non-
federal California hospitals. The annual financial data contain extensive
information on revenue by payer and revenue center, expenses by cost center,
staffing levels and wages, property, plant, and equipment, and the like. The
annual data is on a fiscal year basis and is therefore somewhat cumbersome.
OSHPD does, however, provide a calendar year version of the data for the years
1995-2005. We use this data for some of our analyses. The quarterly financial
data is synchronized to calendar quarters but is less informative.
    Saliently for our purposes, from 1992 onwards the quarterly data contain
fairly detailed revenue and quantity information by payer. For each of six payer
types (Medicare, Medicaid, County, Indigent, Third Party Private, and Other), the
data contain gross charges (charges before deducting contractual discounts) for
inpatient and outpatient care. For the same payer groups, the data contain net
revenues overall (aggregating inpatient and outpatient).4 For the same six groups,
the data contain counts of inpatient discharges, inpatient days, and outpatient
visits.
    Many California hospitals belong to systems; we take common ownership into
account in our analyses using the panel ownership data collected by Glenn
Melnick and colleagues as part of the California Hospital Data project.5 This data
permits us to calculate concentration measures through 2003.6
    Finally, we obtained information on seismic risk—specifically maximum
ground acceleration expected with a 10 percent probability in the next 50 years—

  The availability of net revenues disaggregated by payer types makes the California data unusual
and attractive.

from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) web site7 and linked it to hospital
location to determine each hospital’s seismic risk. See Chang and Jacobson
(2008) for an excellent discussion of California’s seismic retrofit program and the
use of USGS data to assess its effects.

Variables
Our principal price measure is net revenue per discharge for third party private
payers, aggregated across the population of community hospitals. This measure is
constructed from the quarterly financial data beginning with gross inpatient
revenue for third party private payers. We multiply this figure by the ratio
between overall net revenue for third party private care and overall gross revenue
for third party private care. Here, we assume that average discounts are equal for
inpatient and outpatient care. We make this assumption since net revenue is not
separately disaggregated for inpatients and outpatients. Finally, this estimated net
revenue for third party private inpatients is divided by the number of discharges to
create our price measure: estimated net revenue per discharge for third party
private patients.8
    We perform some sensitivity analyses on this price definition. First, we
divide by inpatient days rather than inpatient discharges, and this produced results
very similar (in terms of the patterns among markets and over time) to those
reported below. Second, we go through an extensive case-mix adjustment process
to ensure that our results are not driven by changing case-mix over time. The case
mix adjustment uses the inpatient discharge data in addition to the financial data
and considers primary and secondary diagnoses, age, sex, and race of the patient.
The methodology for adjusting for case mix is discussed in detail in Gaynor and
Vogt (2003) and in Akosa-Antwi, Gaynor, and Vogt (2008). We measure
concentration in local hospital markets by the county Herfindahl-Hirschman
Index (HHI). This index is the most common way of characterizing the degree of
concentration in markets. It is defined as the sum of the squares of the market
shares of the competitors in a market. A market with many competitors each with
negligible market share would have an HHI near 0. In general, the HHI of a
market is equal to 10,000 × + nV (s ) . In this equation, n is the number of firms

                                n
in the market, and V (s ) , is the variance of market share among firms. This implies
that the concentration index for equal sized firms is equal to 10,000/n: a

  Since all of our calculations involve quantities which are aggregates across all the hospitals each
year, we are implicitly calculating a discharge-weighted rather than hospital-weighted average
price. A hospital with twice as many discharges counts twice as much in the average..

Inpatient Hospital Prices
Figure 1 illustrates the movements in California hospital prices during our study
period of 1992-2006. As can be seen from the Figure, private prices declined
steadily from 1992 through 1999. They fell from $10,800 in 1992 to $8,500 in
1999 (a decline of 11%). Beginning in 2000, these prices began a rapid increase,
increasing ultimately in 2006 to an average of $15,600 per discharge. This
represents, over the period 1999-2006, an 84% increase or an annual average
increase of 10.6%.
    The private price changes differed among ownership classes. The real price
decrease from 1992 to 1999 was larger for for-profit hospitals (38%) than it was
among not-for-profits (24%). Over 1999-2006, the price increase among for-
profits (69%) was smaller than the corresponding increase among not-for-profits
(103%). The price pattern for government hospitals was similar to that for not-
for-profits.
    In contrast to the growth in private prices, inpatient price for Medicare and
MediCal patients did not increase rapidly after 1999. This is not surprising since
the price setting mechanism for Medicare and MediCal is different from that of
private patients.9 Medicare prices declined sharply after 1997 most likely due to
reduced reimbursement rates associated with Balance Budget Act of 1997. After
years of decline, MediCal prices increased steadily from 1995 to 2003 and then
declined afterwards. The uptrend in MediCal prices coincides with state
legislation that expanded MediCal managed care enrollment by making it easier
for MediCal recipients to switch from Fee for Service (FFS) plans to managed
care plans. The increase in observed MediCal price in the late 1990’s is most
likely due to this expansion.. Duggan (2004), for instance, finds that the
expansion of managed care enrollment from MediCal recipients was associated
with a substantial increase in spending (with no corresponding increase in
quality).

Possible Explanations
We consider in turn the following candidates: mergers and increases in
concentration, increasing case mix, a legislated increase in nurse staffing, seismic
retrofitting, and the backlash against managed care.

 Medicare and MediCal prices are set by the federal and state governments while price for private
paying patients is set by the market.
Mergers and Concentration
During the second half of the 1990’s, a dramatic wave of hospital consolidation
occurred in the United States. Levin and Associates 10 estimate the total number
of hospital mergers from 1994 to 2005 at over 1,000 deals on a base of
approximately 6,100 hospitals. Figure 2 shows the number of mergers and
acquisitions increased sharply from 1994 to 1997 and then steadily declined
afterwards. This wave of mergers was national in scope and affected all hospital
markets in the United States including California.
    As a result of this consolidation, many local markets, including large cities
such as Boston, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Saint Louis, and San
Francisco have come to be dominated by two or three large hospital systems,
where 6 to 12 independent firms used to be typical. At the same time, exit has
led to a decrease in the total number of hospitals from 5,229 community hospitals
in 1994 to a little over 4,897 in 2007. (American Hospital Association, 2009)
    This wave of consolidation has led to a dramatic increase in the level of
concentration in local hospital markets. The average resident of a metropolitan
area11 in 1990 faced a hospital market with an HHI of 1,574, considered
moderately concentrated by the antitrust authorities12. In 2003, this average
metropolitan resident lived in a market with a hospital concentration index of
2,323: highly concentrated by U.S antitrust standards.13 (Vogt and Town, 2007)
    There is an extensive literature documenting the correlation between
concentration and price in California’s hospital market. The evidence suggests
that hospital consolidation leads to substantial price increases, with the biggest
increases accruing to merging hospitals which are in close geographic proximity
to one another (Capps and Dranove, 2004; Dafny, 2005; Gaynor and Vogt, 2003;
Sacher and Vita, 2001).
    Given the extensive merger wave of the 1990s, the obvious explanation for
the run-up in prices is the decrease in the competitiveness of California’s hospital
market. Thus, if there was a substantial increase in hospital concentration in
California as a result of the merger wave, this could provide an explanation for
the increase in prices.
    Over the period 1992-2003, we find a substantial increase in hospital market
concentration in California. The average14 county HHI for a California hospital
rose from 2,046 to 2,824. This is approximately equivalent to a decrease from
10
   See http://www.kff.org/insurance/7031/print-sec5.cfm
11
   A market in this context is defined as a Metropolitan Statistical Area.
12
   Antitrust enforcement agencies consider a market with HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 as
moderately concentrated. (Federal Trade Commission, 1997)
13
   A market with an HHI greater than 1,800 is considered highly concentrated. (Federal Trade
Commission, 1997)
14
   In taking average HHI across hospitals, we weighted each hospital equally. If we weight instead
by the number of discharges, the increase in HHI is from 1,534 to 2,201.

five to four equally sized firms. The national run up in average HHI over 1990 to
2003 was from 1,576 to 2,323 (Vogt and Town, 2007). In each case, HHI rose by
about 800 points, and, in each case, these are increases which would be
considered large by the articulated standards of the US antitrust enforcement
authorities (Federal Trade Commission, 1997) which describe a 100 point
increase in HHI as representing a substantial lessening of competition.
    In Figure 3, we graph the evolution of average HHI and average inpatient
hospital price over time. The increase in HHI echoes and reinforces the message
of Figure 2. There was a substantial wave of hospital consolidation in California
in the 1990s, shown in Figure 3 by the steep increase in average HHI over that
time period. The increase in price is also again visible in this figure, and the two
lines do have a vaguely similar shape. One might imagine interpreting this graph
as showing that the increase in hospital concentration created the increase in
price, but with a lag. The lag necessary to justify this explanation is on the order
of six years, however. Given that hospitals normally contract with insurers for
one or a very few years, this seems, to us, to be a very long lag.
    Another way to explore the association between rising hospital market
concentration and rising prices is geographically. If rising concentration is leading
to rising prices, then presumably we should expect to observe that hospital prices

rose the fastest in geographical areas in which concentration was rising fastest. In
Figure 4, we graph such an analysis. We classify each county in California which
contains a hospital over the 1992 to 2003 period into one of four categories:
monopoly, high concentration, low concentration, and Los Angeles. Monopoly
counties are those which had a single hospital over 1992-2003.                  Low
concentration counties are defined to be those with HHI below 2000 in 1992.
High concentration counties are defined as those with HHI was above 2000 in
1992.
    The high and low concentration counties were further subdivided into those
whose concentration rose quickly over this time period, by more than 300 points
and those whose concentration rose slowly over this time period, by less than 300
points. Finally, Los Angeles County was singled out because it is so different
from the other counties. It contains about a quarter of all California’s general
hospitals, and it experienced a very large number of closures and mergers over
this time period. Its HHI was 344 in 2002 and it rose to 589 by 2003. If Los
Angeles were to be classified like the other counties, it would be low
concentration and low growth.

period 1992-2006 for the hospitals in the six groups of counties. The black solid

line corresponds to hospitals in monopoly counties. The red lines correspond to
hospitals in the counties whose concentration grew quickly. The black dashed
lines correspond to hospitals in the counties whose concentrations grew slowly.
The blue line shows prices in Los Angeles County hospitals.
    The lines fall into three groups. Hospitals in the monopoly counties and
hospitals in the high concentration, low concentration growth counties had the
fastest price increases over this period. Hospitals in counties with the highest
growth in concentration (the low-concentration, high-growth, and high-
concentration, high-growth counties) had the moderate price increases. Finally,
hospitals in the low concentration, low concentration growth counties and
hospitals in Los Angeles County experienced the slowest growth in prices.
    These results do not seem, at least on the surface, consistent with a story that
growth in hospital concentration led to growth in prices. The highest price
increases were in counties with monopoly hospitals or very few hospitals—
concentrated, unchanging markets had the fastest price growth. The markets one
might expect to have the fastest price growth, the red lines in Figure 4, had only
moderate growth. The slow price growth in less concentrated and slowly
changing markets does seem to be consistent with the story, however.
Case Mix and Other Mismeasurement
As we discuss above, our principal measure of price is net revenue per discharge
for third party payers. One potential difficulty associated with this measure is the
possibility that the patients are different— an increase in this measure of price
might reflect a sicker, more costly patient pool which consumes more hospital
output per stay rather than a true increase in price. To examine the possibility of
changing case mix explaining our results, we extensively case-mix adjusted using
the inpatient discharge data, accounting for differences in age, sex, race, and
primary and secondary diagnoses using methods we have described elsewhere.
(Gaynor and Vogt, 2003; Akosa-Antwi, Gaynor, and Vogt, 2007)
    We plot the crude private price of Figure 1 against this extensively adjusted
private price (scaled to be equal to the crude price in 1992). The result is
displayed in Figure 5. It shows that, as expected, the adjusted private price lies
below the crude private price for years after 1992. This shows that case mix did
get less favorable over time and that this change accounted for some of the
apparent price run-up. However, as is immediately apparent, the difference
between the growth in crude and adjusted prices is very small. The crude price
grew by 84% over 1999-2005 while the adjusted price grew by 86% over the
same period. Thus, the worsening of case mix mostly occurred from 1992 to
1999, and, in any event, the case mix effect was small.
    Another potential difficulty is that, even for a fixed population of patients, the
average amount of care delivered in each stay may have evolved over time— an
increase in our measured price might reflect an increasingly intensive style of care
perhaps including the deployment of more or more expensive technologies.
Addressing this objection completely would be a significant undertaking.
However, we can crudely measure the intensity of treatment by counting the
number of procedures performed on average using the procedure codes in the
OSHPD discharge data. For each year, we calculate the average number of
procedures from the discharge data. For the years 1992-1999, there are 0.84
procedures per discharge, and for 2000-2007 there are 0.77. We include a graph
of the average number of procedures per discharge in the appendix as Figure A1.
While there is an uptick after 2000, the increase in number of procedures per
discharge over 2000-2005 is less than 9%.
    Since hospitals’ patient volumes are changing over time and since we are
using discharge-weighted rather than hospital-weighted averages, it is possible for
composition to affect our price measures. For example if patients over time were
becoming more likely to go to higher priced hospitals, this would appear, in our
measure, to be a price increase even if each hospital’s price were to be
unchanging. To ensure that this does not explain our results, we fix each

hospital’s number of discharges at its 2000 level,15 and we adjust its gross and net
revenues by the ratio of its year 2000 discharges to its current year discharges.16
Then we performed the same overall price calculation described above. The
results are that prices calculated this way fell from $11,400 in 1992 to $8,900 in
1999 and then rose to $15,600 in 2006. The price increase from 1999 to 2006
(76%) is similar to the 83% calculated earlier, and the price decline from 1992 to
1999 (32%) is similar to the 31% decline observed using the earlier methods.

Nurse Staffing Ratio Mandate
In 1999, state legislation was passed (AB 394) that mandated minimum nurse
staffing ratios for certain hospital units. The final nursing staffing ratio regulation
was announced in 2002 and was implemented in January 2004. Perhaps this

15
   Obviously, this can only be done for the 330 hospitals which existed in 2000. The price history
of these 330 hospitals is highly representative of the overall price movements over this time
period. Their average prices fell from $10,900 in 1992 to $8,500 in 1999 and then rose to $15,700
in 2006, almost exactly the same price history as the overall sample.
16
   For example, if a hospital’s discharges in 2001 were 5% higher than its discharges in 2000, then
we would reduce its discharges in 2001 by 5% (to bring them back to the same level as in 2000),
and we would reduce gross revenues and net revenues for that hospital by 5% in 2001.
regulation, in concert with other changes in California’s labor market (such as the
run-up in nurse wages), raised the costs of providing care enough to explain the
growth in hospital prices. This possibility is explored in Figure 6. To draw that
figure, we have taken operating expenses and labor expenses for California
hospitals and allocated them between inpatient and outpatient care on the basis of
total gross charges for inpatient and outpatient care. Then, we have divided the
allocated inpatient costs by discharges. Because we are using data from the
annual (rather than the quarterly) reports for this analysis and because California
has only rationalized these data to calendar years for 1995-2005, those are the
years we present. The quarterly data also contain information on the value of
capital projects at a hospital in a given year, and we have graphed the average
value of reported capital projects also in Figure 6.
    Hospital costs rose between 1995 and 2005. Capital expenditures especially
have risen, apparently due to California’s seismic mandate legislation (discussed
below and in Chang and Jacobson, 2008). However, the per-discharge increases
in operating expenses and in labor expenses are dwarfed by the price increases
over this period. For example, from 1999 to 2005, operating expenses rose from
about $9,000 per discharge to about $10,800 per discharge (a difference of
$1,800). Over that same period, private third-party prices rose from $8,500 per
discharge to $15,600 (a difference of $7,100). Similarly, compensation expense
rose from about $4,600 per discharge to $5,700. Thus, increasing costs are
insufficient, at least on their face, to explain the rise of hospital prices. It is
important to note, however, that the hospital expenses reported here are the total
of all expenses for a given hospital. Perhaps expenses pertinent only to private
payers were increasing much more rapidly than were overall expenses. Our data
are insufficient to disentangle this possibility.

Seismic Retrofitting Mandate
California’s seismic retrofit law (passed in 1998) requires retrofitting or complete
reconstruction of California hospital buildings to make them more earthquake
tolerant. This regulation is expected to be expensive to comply with, but the
expense depends on, among many other things, the degree of earthquake risk as
assessed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
    The seismic retrofitting mandate represents a fixed-cost shock to a hospital’s
budget. If hospitals are profit maximizers, then as economic theory predicts, we
do not expect any changes in a hospital’s resource use, services provided and
consequently, their pricing behavior.        Chang and Jacobson (2008) find that
consistent with economic theory, for-profit hospitals in California did not change
their resource use or service mix in response to the seismic retrofitting mandate.
Not-for-profit hospitals however, responded to the legislation by increasing the
provision of profitable services. It is possible that the increase in the provision of

profitable services led to an increase in labor expenses and price. Government
owned hospitals responded to the mandate by decreasing their provision of charity
care. As noted previously, not-for-profit hospital increased their prices much
faster than government and for-profit hospitals.
    As Chang and Jacobson point out, the location of a hospital is an important
determinant of its response to the mandate. We examine the relationship between
a hospital’s location and its pricing behavior.
    The regulation’s requirements are based, to a significant degree, on
earthquake risk as measured by the USGS. This risk varies across California
broadly (San Francisco and Los Angeles are higher risk, San Diego and
Sacramento lower). The risk also varies at much smaller geographical levels, and
Chang and Jacobson demonstrate that hospital spending on property, plant, and
equipment increases with higher seismic risk (and, presumably, greater required
modifications to achieve the regulated degree of safety).
    Using the USGS measure of maximum ground acceleration expected with a
10 percent probability in the next 50 years (hereafter, g) to measure seismic risk,
we divide hospitals into three categories. The low risk category consists of
hospitals with a below-median value of g. The medium risk category consists of
hospitals with a value of g above the median but below the 90th percentile. The
high risk category consists of hospitals with g above the 90th percentile. As is
evident in Figure 7, the price increases of hospitals in these three categories are
very similar over the period 1995 to 2006, with the high risk hospitals showing a
price increase of 75% vs. 58% for the other two risk groups.

Managed Care Backlash
    The early literature examining managed care and hospital competition finds
that price and concentration are positively associated and that this effect is
strengthened by high HMO penetration. (Dranove et al., 1993; Keeler et al.,
1999; Melnick et al, 1992; Simpson and Shin, 1998; and Zwanziger and
Melnick, 1988). Managed care may play an important mediating role in the
relationship between concentration and price. One way managed care reduces
costs is by reducing hospital prices by playing one hospital off against another.
Since this strategy is likely to work best with many independent hospitals, one
might expect to see a larger effect of concentration on price in markets with high
managed care penetration.
    After the turn of the millennium, numerous commentators reported a
“managed care backlash” in which consumers were demanding broader provider
networks from insurers. This would be expected to reduce the ability of insurers
to extract discounts from hospitals by playing them off against one another.
Dranove et al (2008) find that the association between concentration and price
was positive in the 1990s, strongly positive around the turn of the millennium, but
substantially weaker by 2003. In related work, Shen et al. (2008) find that the
ability of HMOs to contain costs was significantly weakened during the managed
care backlash period of 2000-2005.
    White et al. (2004) provide anecdotal evidence of a shift in power with respect
to contract negotiation between hospitals and insurance providers, particularly
HMOs. After conceding to deep discounts in the 1990’s, most hospitals systems
have turned the tables on HMOs. A case in point happened in 2000 in Orange
County, California where St. Joseph Health System terminated its contract with
PacifiCare after the latter refused to accept a new agreement in which St. Joseph
proposed significant increases in the payments it received. This dispute reportedly
affected about 100,000 people in Southern California. According to White et al.,
PacifiCare was the loser in this dispute as three-quarters of its patients switched to
other health plans and stayed with St. Josephs Health System. After this public
showdown, most health insurers recognizing the new clout that hospitals wielded
accepted their demands of rate increases. In fact, PacifiCare’s operation was so
badly affected that it returned to St. Joseph two years after the separation.
    The studies discussed above provide evidence that managed care
organization’s ability to contain hospital prices waned after 1999. This provided
hospitals with the ability to extract significantly higher payments. It is possible
that the significant price increases we see after 1999 reflects the ability of
hospitals to demand significantly higher payments because of the perceived
weakness of HMOs.

Conclusion
In this paper we document the trend in inpatient hospital prices before and after
the wave of mergers in the mid 1990’s using California hospital discharge and
financial data from 1992 to 2006. We find a downward trend in price for private
pay patients in the 1990s and a sharp increase beginning in 1999. Prices to private
pay patients almost doubled from 1999 to 2006, while Medicare and MediCal
prices showed little trend. This trend remained after we corrected for differences
in case mix over time.
    In addition, we document a rapid increase in hospital market concentration in
California during the merger wave of the 1990s. Surprisingly, the price run up
does not seem to be explained by this increase in concentration. The price
increase occurred about six years after the increase in concentration.
Furthermore, the run up does not seem to have been larger in areas which
experienced a larger increase in concentration.
    The escalation in prices does not seem to be associated with either
California’s nurse staffing regulation or with its seismic retrofit mandate. The
increases over this period in overall costs and in staffing costs are dwarfed by the
price increases to private payers. Furthermore, the price run up does not seem to
be concentrated among hospitals in areas with the greatest earthquake risk. There
is some evidence that, after 1999, hospitals were able to exploit the weakness of
managed care to demand significant increases in payments. A detailed analysis of
whether this accounts for the increase in prices documented here is left to future
work.
