                                           ABSTRACT

China-born scientists and engineers who conduct their research outside China, the diaspora
researchers of our title, contributed to global science through the exceptional quantity and quality
of their scientific work and through distinctive connections to China-based researchers and
research. Analysis of the Scopus database of English language scientific journal articles shows
that Chinese diaspora research publications are a substantial and growing proportion of global
scientific publications, receive an above average number of citations per article, and are published
at above average rates in high Scopus CiteScore journals. In addition, diaspora researchers helped
China advance to the forefront of science through collaboration on papers with China-based
researchers and through the citation network linking China-based research to research outside the
country.

    China's "great leap forward' in science and engineering in the first two decades of the 21st
century moved the country to the forefront of global scientific research. In 2018 China became
the global leader in scientific publications with 25% more papers than the US. 1 From 2000 to
2015, the average number of 3-year forward citations to a China-addressed English language
journal article jumped from about one quarter of the world average to just above the world
average. The increase in papers and citations per paper combined to raise China's share of
citations in the Scopus data base from a negligible 0.7% in 2000 to 17.5% in 2015. 2
     In this study we examine the contribution to scientific literature of a group of China-born
researchers that has received little attention in China's "great leap forward" in science ­ diaspora
researchers who conduct part or all of their research outside China. We identify these researchers
by their having Chinese first and last names, and having one or more journal articles where their
address is outside China.
     If Chinese diaspora researchers were a small group of scientists doing average quality work
or if they had a similar connection to China as their non-Chinese named peers, there would be
little gain from differentiating their work from that of others. But our data show that far from
being modest contributors to science, Chinese diaspora researchers have produced a large and
growing body of papers that has gained exceptional numbers of citations and publications in
journals with high Scopus CiteScores.3 Diaspora researchers top lists of most productive
scientists, publish extensively in Nature and Science, and have stronger network links to China-
addressed researchers in co-authorship and citations than other scientists and engineers
publishing papers with addresses outside of China.
       This paper documents these claims. Section 1 defines Chinese diaspora research and
measures its contribution to global scientific publications. Section 2 examines the citations and
Scopus CiteScores of diaspora papers and performance of diaspora authors. Section 3 describes
the collaboration and citation links between diaspora and China-based research. Section 4
concludes.

Section 1: Chinese Diaspora Papers and Researchers
       Researchers publish contributions to knowledge in scholarly papers that contain their
name, institutional affiliation, and address. Analyses of research contributions focus on the
number of published papers, citations received and/or the prestige of the journals of publication.
We use author's name and country address in the Scopus database to identify the Chinese
diaspora researchers on whom we focus. We use a Chinese last name to identify someone as
ethnic Chinese 4 and a Chinese first name to differentiate those likely to be mainland born from
those born elsewhere. Our measure identifies Qing Yang as coming from China and David Yang
as coming from outside China, and labels a US addressed paper by Qing Yang as a diaspora
paper and one by David Yang as a US paper.5 We define a paper with all non-China addresses as
an NC paper and define an NC paper with at least one diaspora (D) author as an NCD paper and
define an NC paper with no Chinese named author as an NCN paper. We further differentiate a
paper with China-addressed (C) and non-China addressed (NC) authors as a China Joint paper
(CJ), and label CJ papers in which one or more Chinese named author has an NC address as a
CJD paper and those without a Chinese named author at an NC address as CJN papers.
       To measure the "diasporaness" of a paper, we use the proportion of Chinese first and last-
named authors with non-China addresses on the paper as indicating membership in the set of
CJD diaspora papers. A three authored paper with all authors having Chinese first and second
names and addresses outside China would have 100% membership in the diaspora set, while a
paper with two Chinese named authors with outside China addresses would have 67%
membership, and so on.
       Turning to authors, we define a Chinese diaspora author as a mainland born researcher
who has written at least one paper with an address outside mainland China and examine the
proportion of papers in which they have a non-China address. Those who publish entirely at NC
addresses are 100% diaspora. Those with a lengthy publication record where all or most papers
were at a non-China address are likely to be permanent emigrants. Persons with, say 20% NC
addresses on their papers, would be 20% diaspora and would likely be temporary diaspora
researchers who wrote those papers during overseas research visits or study. Degree of
membership in the diaspora set of authors will vary over time as an author changes the country in
which they work. Young researchers who study or do post-docs outside China and write NC


                                                                                       3|Page
papers would have high membership in the NC set early in their careers, which would fall if they
returned to permanent jobs in China.
Diaspora papers, 2018
    Table 1 records the number of English language journal articles with China addresses and
names and the estimated numbers that meet our diaspora definition in the 2018 Scopus database.
It also shows those numbers relative to all Scopus journal articles and to China addressed
articles. 6 We use Scopus because it is the largest bibliometry of scientific journals, with more
journals and wider coverage of China-published English and Chinese language journals than its
Web of Science rival. We focus on natural and physical sciences, including engineering and
mathematics, as providing a less politicized area of study than social sciences or humanities.
    We limit analysis to articles written in English because articles in Chinese (and other non-
English languages) face a language barrier that makes them less visible to much of the research
community. English language journals constitute about 88% of Scopus journal articles. By
contrast, only 4.8% of 2018 articles were in Chinese. 7 Indicative 8 of the language barrier
between Chinese and English language publications, articles published in 2015 with only China
addresses averaged 1.4 citations if they were written in Chinese, compared to 9.1 citations if they
were written in English. 9 Ninety-seven percent of citations to the Chinese language articles came
from China-addressed papers. 10
    Line 1 records the number of journal articles with China Only (CO) addresses in the 2018
Scopus data base. These articles constituted 16.8% of all journal publications in that year ­ a
massive increase over the 2.4% of articles that had China Only addresses in 2000. 11 By
definition, none of these articles are diaspora articles, though their authors could be diaspora
authors by virtue of previously publishing non-China addressed articles.
    Line 2 records the number of articles with only non-China (NC) addresses. They constitute a
bit over 3/4ths of the 2018 scientific literature. We counted the number of Chinese last-named
authors in the NC only addressed articles from the full Scopus data, but had to estimate the
proportion of those authors with Chinese first names to meet our diaspora criterion. To do this,
we randomly sampled 2,000 NC papers published in 2018 (see Appendix A), and hand checked
the first names of all Chinese last-named authors. We found that 79.7% had a Chinese first name,
which implied that there were 152,255 non-China addressed diaspora papers (NCD) in 2018. As
we had only 324 papers with at least one Chinese last name in the 2018 NC sample, we drew a

                                                                                        4|Page
larger sample of 2,000 NC papers with at least one Chinese last-named author and obtained a
virtually identical estimate of 79.9% with Chinese first names. 12 These papers were 9.5% of
Scopus articles and were 46.8% as numerous as China addressed articles.
    Line 3 gives the number of China Joint (CJ) papers. Those with a first and last-named
Chinese author at a non-China address fit our diaspora definition. 13 To estimate the proportion in
this situation, we randomly sampled 2,000 CJ papers in 2018, as described in Appendix A, and
counted the number of first and last-named Chinese authors. Line 3a gives the estimated number
of CJ papers with at least one Chinese last-named author at a non-China address. Line 3b gives
the estimated number of CJ papers in which the Chinese last-named author had a Chinese first
name and thus were CJD papers.
     Line 4a sums the relevant numbers in lines 2 and 3 to obtain the total number of papers
with at least one Chinese named author at an NC address. Line 4b estimates the more limited
number with first and last-named Chinese authors. The 220,974 papers that met this definition
were 13.8% of all Scopus articles and 67.9% as numerous as China-addressed papers.
     Taking line 4b's number of diaspora papers and line 1's number of China only (CO)
addressed papers gives us a broad measure of China's "presence" in the scientific literature.
Figure 1 shows that in 2018, China had a presence on nearly one in three papers ­ a tripling of its
presence in 2000 when one in ten papers had a China name or address with, strikingly, a majority
being diaspora papers.
     Counting papers with Chinese names and addresses as part of China's contribution to
science comparable to China-addressed papers arguably exaggerates the size of diaspora
research. The number of diaspora authors on a non-China addressed papers can range from a
single person amid many non-Chinese co-authors to all the authors on a paper. The number of
China addresses on a China Joint paper can similarly vary from one among many to all but one
while the number of Chinese names could range from one name to all names.
     To adjust for the "diasporness" of diaspora papers, we calculated the percentage of authors
with a Chinese first and last name on the NCD papers in our 2,000 sample of NC papers and
come up with an estimate of 37.5%. Multiplying the line 2b number by 37.5% gives the
fractional count of NCD papers in line 5a. Similarly, we estimated the percentage of first and last
Chinese named authors on CJD papers in our 2,000 sample of CJ papers at 27.6% of the names
on those papers. Multiplying the line 3b number by 27.6% gives the fractional count of CJD

                                                                                        5|Page
papers in line 5b. The sum of the fractional counts of NCD papers with non-China address and of
diaspora papers on international collaborations in line 5c shows that diaspora papers were 4.7%
of all 2018 papers ­ a proportion which exceeds the fractional count of papers by address for all
countries in save for China, the US, and India. 14
    Finally, note that even our fractional counts of the Chinese diaspora share of articles are
crude estimates of the country's contribution to global publications. They are crude because they
assume that addresses and names count equally in the contribution. If address better reflected
contribution than the Chinese name of an author, more of the diaspora share should go to the
addressed country than to China, and conversely if Chinese origin better reflected contribution. 15
Absent a counterfactual model of what would happen to scientific research and publications in
China and outside China if Chinese diaspora researchers could not work overseas, 16 our
calculations can be viewed as drawing attention to the crediting problem for diaspora researchers
that addressed-based measures ignore entirely. They are also crude because they ignore the
potential impact of the paper, which we address in Section 2.
Diaspora papers among diaspora researchers
    To what extent do diaspora authors write all or most of their papers at a relatively permanent
non-China address as opposed to writing just a few papers outside China?
    To answer this, we calculated the distribution of papers written inside and outside China for
a sample of authors with at least one diaspora paper in 2018. Figure 2 shows that 47.5% of the
authors wrote all of their papers at a non-China address; while 62.7% wrote over 90% outside
China; and 72.1% wrote over 80% outside China. Sampling from 2018 under-represents persons
who wrote few diaspora papers and published them in years other than 2018 but the
concentration of papers among those primarily writing outside China documents the existence of
a permanent or relatively permanent diaspora research group. Given visa requirements for
residence in a country, these researchers likely have citizenship/permanent residency in the
country where they work.
    In the 2010s the diaspora research community was boosted by the huge number of Chinese
students earning PhDs and other post-graduate degrees in advanced countries and by the
substantial number of Chinese PhDs working as overseas post-docs. 17 Social Security data for
the US, which hosts the largest number of Chinese international students, show that 84% of
Chinese students who gained US science and engineering PhDs in 2007-2009 and 85% of those

                                                                                        6|Page
who earned US PhDs in 2003-2004 were working in the country in 2013 (Finn and Pennington,
2018: tables 6 and 7). In addition, the US employed many China-educated PhDs as post-docs, all
of whom would have US addresses on papers.


Section 2: The Quality of Chinese Diaspora Research
        If Chinese diaspora research was close to the global average in research quality the Table
1 numbers would capture its main contribution to science. If the research was above (below)
average quality, the Table 1 numbers would understate (overstate) its contribution. To assess the
relative quality of diaspora research, we compared 3 year forward citations and the CiteScores of
the journals which published diaspora papers with other papers. We chose the 3 year period to
provide a reasonable indicator of the likely position of papers in citation distributions over
time. 18 We analyze both citations and CiteScores because while the two are highly correlated (r
= 0.50 in our data),19 the decision processes for them differ enough to allow for substantial
within-journal variation in citations. 20
        On the citation side, individual researchers decide whether or not to cite a paper based on
their view of its quality and relevance to their research, among other factors. Articles in high
impact journals, in fields with more researchers, and on hot topics gain more attention, raising
their chances of being cited. Articles by persons with large research networks in a field,
determined by the number of persons similar to them in, say, gender, graduating institution, or
national origins (Schubert and Glänzel, 2006; Yan and Ding, 2012; Maliniak at el., 2013;
Freeman and Huang, 2015) also gain more citations. And people cite themselves and famous
persons ("Matthew Effect") more than others.
        The CiteScore of the journal that publishes a paper depends on the quality of the paper
and on decisions by the papers' authors on the journal to which they submit the paper and on
journal editors' decisions to accept or reject a submission. Since more prestigious journals have
low acceptance rates, researchers' submission decision will balance the lower likelihood of
getting an acceptance against the potential advantages in prestige and future citations. Journals
editors will decide whether to accept or reject a paper based on the reviews of the experts they
asked to review it and on the editors' assessment of how journal readers and the scientific
community may respond to it.          The idiosyncratic factors that affect the CiteScores almost
certainly differ from those that impact its future citations.

                                                                                        7|Page
       Panel A of Table 2 presents the mean and median of citations and the mean of citations
for the upper decile of the citation distribution for diaspora papers and comparison papers. We
give the median and the mean citation in the upper 10% because the distribution of citations is
heavy tailed (with power law or related shape) so that means and standard errors do not fully
capture its properties. The Table gives statistics for NCD and CJD papers and for NCN, CJN, and
CO papers without diaspora authors.
       The Table shows that diaspora papers, written at non-China addresses (NCD) or with
collaboration from China-addressed authors (CJD), gained roughly twice the citations of the
NCN papers and CO papers that make up the bulk of scientific publications. The diaspora
advantage is larger in mean citations than in median citations, indicating a heavier tail to the
diaspora distribution (also evinced in the higher mean of the upper 10% of papers for diaspora
papers). NCD papers lead all others in citations in means but CJD papers top them in medians.
CJ papers without diaspora authors obtain more citations than CO papers and NC papers without
diaspora authors but fall short of the citations received by diaspora papers.
        The high number of citations of diaspora research can also be seen in very different
statistics on individual authors in lists of top scientists. In 2011 Clarivate Analytics named the
"Top 100 Materials Scientists" based on 2000-2010 citations in the Thomson Reuters Web of
Science data. Table 3 shows that 5 of the top 10 had Chinese first and last names and worked in
the US and thus fit our definition of diaspora authors. All remarkably had undergraduate training
from the same Chinese university, which suggests their Chinese education played a strong role in
their success". 21 In the entire list, 12 of the top 100 material scientists were diaspora scientists.
Clarivate also reported "Top Scientists" in Chemistry, where 3 of the top 10 and 10 of the top
100 were Chinese diaspora researchers.
CiteScores
    The CiteScores in panel B of Table 2 relate to citations relative to publications in the 3
previous years' publications, which gives them a different time period and metric than the 3 year
forward citations. Our CiteScores are from Scopus' 2017 tabulation and thus depend on citations
from 2014-2016 while our forward citations are for 2016 to 2018. Consistent with the citation
data, diaspora papers gain higher CiteScores than papers with all non-China addresses and no
diaspora authors and higher CiteScores than papers with all China addresses. 22
    Finally, to exemplify the growing success of diaspora papers in getting into top scientific

                                                                                           8|Page
journals, we examined their share of papers in Nature and Science in 2000 and 2018. Table 5
shows that in 2000 Nature and Science published virtually no papers with China Only addresses
and relatively few joint China-other country collaborative papers. But 16.4% of Nature papers
and 18.1% of Science papers were NCD papers ­ far in excess of the diaspora share of papers.
Between 2000 and 2018 when the CO share of all scientific articles increased massively, the CO
share of Nature and Science articles increased just marginally. The big increase in China's
presence in Nature and Science was in diaspora articles, written entirely at non-China addresses
(which reached about one-fourth of papers in Nature and Science) or in smaller numbers, as CJD
papers. In 2018 30.3% of papers in Nature and 35.0% in Science had a diaspora author.
    As Chinese authors and addresses are only part of the authors and addresses on diaspora
papers, we have fraction counted the diaspora contribution, which necessarily reduces the credit
given to China. Even so, in 2018 diaspora papers had a larger share of Nature (3.4%) and
Science (3.9%) articles than the far more numerous China Only papers (0.9% and 2.6%,
respectively). Diaspora researchers were in the forefront of quality research from Chinese-
named scientists.
Regression estimates of the diaspora quality effect
    The Table 2 differences in citations and CiteScores between diaspora papers and other
papers could be due to differences in the attributes of papers beyond addresses and names, such
as their field of study, number of authors, or other factors associated with citations or publication
in more prestigious journals (Börner et al., 2010; Abramo and D'Angelo, 2015). To see whether
the Table 2 patterns hold up in analyses that contrast papers identical in measurable determinants
of citations and CiteScores, we regressed citations and CiteScores on dummy variables that
distinguish 21 scientific fields and on the numbers of authors on a paper as well as on dummy
variables for diaspora and other name-address groups relative to NCN papers as the deleted
name-address group.
    The regressions in Table 5 show that while field and number of authors substantially impact
citations and CiteScores, their inclusion in the analysis leaves standing the finding that diaspora
papers score higher on these measures than papers written without a diaspora presence. The
column 1 regression shows that NCD and CJD papers gain about as many extra citations versus
NCN papers and versus China Only papers in the Table 2 mean differences. The column 2
regression shows that addition of the CiteScore of the journal of publication has a huge impact

                                                                                          9|Page
on the estimated effects of diaspora groups reducing the coefficients on NCD and CJD papers by
70-80%. The implication is that much of their advantage comes through publication in higher
impact journals.    The column 3 regression for CiteScores shows indeed showed diaspora
research papers get into higher CiteScore journals than papers with CO addresses or NC
addresses with no diaspora authorship.
    Given the non-normal distribution of citations and the number of papers with zero citations
in the three-year period, the linear regressions do not fully capture the relation between citations
and CiteScores and independent variables.        Accordingly Appendix B explores four other
specifications: (1) a log form regression where one citation is added to the citations for each
observation to keep 0 citation papers in the data set; (2) a log regression limited to positive
citation observations with a separate equation that estimates the impact of the groups of papers
on the probability of positive citations; and (3) a regression in which the citation and CiteScores
were scaled into a 0-1 interval by dividing each observation of a variable by its maximum value
in the data set; and (4) a power law that regresses the Ln of citations on the Ln rank of
citations. 23 All of these forms confirm that diaspora papers produce more citations and higher
CiteScores than non-diaspora papers. Whether CJD papers or NCD papers top the citation list
varies with specification.
    The higher citations and CiteScores associated with diaspora research suggest that the
Section 1 estimate of the diaspora contribution to the scientific literature based on numbers of
papers understates that contribution. To assess the extent of understatement, we adjusted the
numbers of papers for citations using our table 5 regression estimates of the difference in
citations between diaspora papers and an NCN paper. Given the sizable regression coefficients
on CND and JCD papers, the estimated diaspora contribution increases from 13.8% of papers to
24.9% of papers "citation adjusted". 24


Section 3. Impact of Diaspora Research on China-Addressed Science
     To what extent does the existence of highly productive China-born researchers working
outside China impact research in China?
     There are two competing views on how emigration of highly qualified workers affects
countries. Traditional brain-drain literature views emigration as a loss that weakens the ability of
the source country to upgrade its productive capacity and catch up with economically advanced

                                                                                        10 | P a g e
countries (Docquier and Rapoport, 2012). Emigrants and the countries to which they move
benefit at the expense of the countries they left. By contrast, the "ethnic network view" analyzes
emigrants to more advanced countries as a positive channel of communication and knowledge
that allows the source country to access advances in science and technology more rapidly than
otherwise (Kerr, 2008).
     The evidence in this section shows that Chinese diaspora research best fits the ethnic
network view. We compare the diaspora proportion of nodes linking Chinese research to research
outside China to the proportion that we would expect if diaspora researchers had the same ties to
China as other scientists working outside China. The comparisons show overwhelmingly that
diaspora researchers are more linked to China than other non-Chinese named researchers.
Diaspora researchers collaborate more with China-addressed researchers and their papers cite
China-addressed papers more, and are cited more by China-addressed papers compared to non-
China born researchers working outside China.
International co-authorship
       We assess the likelihood that diaspora researchers collaborate more with China-addressed
authors than other non-China addressed researchers in two steps.
       First, using Table 1 statistics on papers we compare the share of CJ papers that have a
diaspora author with the share that would have a diaspora author if non-China collaborations
came randomly from all NC papers. Under the null hypothesis that diaspora scientists do not
differ in their connection to China than other non-China addressed scientists, the diaspora share
of non-China addressed authors in joint China-other country collaborations would approximate
the diaspora share of authors on NC papers. Line 1 of Table 1 shows that 12.3% (=152,255
/1,233,660) of NC papers had at least one diaspora author, which would yield a similar
proportion of papers with at least one diaspora authors in CJ papers. Instead, the statistics in lines
3a and 3b of Table 1 show that CJ papers with at least one diaspora author make up 69.2% (=
68,719/ 99,316) of CJ papers ­ a 5.8-fold difference.
       Second, counting the number of authors with Chinese first and last names and the number
of all authors on NC addressed papers, we estimate that 5.7% of authors on NC papers were born
in China (smaller than the diaspora share of NC papers). Taking 5.7% as the likelihood that a
random draw of a co-author from the pool of NC addressed authors would have both a first and
last Chinese name, we estimated the proportion of diaspora authors on papers with given

numbers of non-China addressed co-authors under random selection and compared it to the
observed percentage of Chinese first and last named NC addressed co-authors, Figure 3 gives the
results for papers with 1-5 non-China addressed co-authors. For CJ papers with just one NC
addressed author, 44.3% of CJ papers had a Chinese named co-author with an NC address
compared to the 5.7% expected from the random draw. The larger the number of NC addressed
co-authors on a paper, the greater the gap between the observed and random distributions. Given
the small diaspora proportion of NC authors, virtually no paper with 3 or more non-China co-
authors should have 3 or more diaspora co-authors while in fact one in three papers had 3 or
more diaspora co-authors.
      Finally, looking at CJ papers from 2000 to 2018, Figure 4 shows an upward trend in the
Chinese presence on joint papers in terms of both the Chinese share of addresses and diaspora
share of non-China addressed authors. The proportion of China addresses, with addresses
counted separately for each author, increased steadily from 43.7% in 2000 to 58.6% in 2018.
The proportion of NC authors who had Chinese first and last names also increased steadily from
25.5% in 2000 to 34.9% in 2018. Dividing credit for the work of the diaspora authors equally
between their names (credit to China) and their address (credit to NC), the two trends raise
China's share of credit for the papers from 51% in 2000 to 64.0% in 2018. 25 By this metric CJ
papers have become more of a collaboration between China born researchers working outside
China and China-based researchers than a 50-50 split between China and non-China based
research.
Importing and exporting knowledge through citations
       The flow of citations from China-addressed papers to papers written outside China
measures the extent to which China-based research "imports" knowledge from the rest of the
world, or alternatively the extent to which the rest of world "exports" knowledge to China.
Conversely, the flow of citations from non-China addressed papers to papers written in China
measures the import of knowledge from China or, alternatively, China's export of knowledge to
the rest of the world.
       To see if diaspora research has a special role in transmitting non-China based research to
China addressed papers, we contrasted the three year forward citations received by NCD and
NCN articles published in 2015 from CO articles. Table 6 shows that NCD articles received 2.3
future citations from CO papers while the NCN articles received just 0.9 future citations ­ a

                                                                                     12 | P a g e
differential of 2.6 to 1.0, which suggests that China addressed researchers import more
knowledge from papers with diaspora authors than from papers without those authors due to the
greater connection between the diaspora researchers to China. There is, however, an alternative
possible explanation for the differential. This is that the high quality of diaspora research articles
shown in Section 2 produced the greater number of citations from CO papers to NCD papers
than to NCN papers.
       We use the citation statistics in the "from NCN" column in Table 6 to adjust for the
quality differential. This column shows that, consistent with NCD papers being high quality,
NCN papers also cite NCD papers more than other NCN papers. But the rate at which NCN
papers give more citations to NCD papers compared to NCN papers is1.6, which is much lower
than the rate at which CO papers give more citations to NCD than to NCN papers. To the extent
that the NCN differential citing of NCD papers reflects their differential quality, we can use the
2.6 ratio of citations from CO papers relative to the 1.6 ratio for NCN papers ­ 1.56 ­ as
reflecting the greater connection between diaspora and China-based researchers on citations. By
this interpretation, papers with only China addresses are 56% more likely to cite an NCD paper
than an NCN paper cites an NCD paper because of the ethnic link between diaspora authors on
the NCD papers and China addressed authors.
       In Table 7 we apply the same logic to assess the flow of citations from non-China
addressed papers to China Only addressed papers. If diaspora researchers are more connected to
Chinese research, we would expect them to cite China Only addressed papers more frequently
than authors on a non-China addressed paper without a diaspora researcher. The data in line 1
appears at first blush to reject the hypothesis that diaspora papers were more likely to cite CO
papers. It shows that China Only addressed papers averaged 2.1 three year future citations from
NCN papers compared to 0.6 three year future citations from NCD papers. But diaspora papers
made up just 11.9% of NC papers in the 2016-2018 period in which we computed citations, 26
which implies a huge differential in citations due solely to the sizes of the citing populations. To
assess the differential preference of NCD and NCN papers for citing CO work, we scaled the
citations to reflect the different sized citing populations and obtained the average number of CO
citations per NCD paper and average number of CO citations per NCN paper in columns 3 and
4. 27 The differential here shows a huge differential of 2.11 to 1.0 in NCD citations of China only
papers compared to NCN citations.

                                                                                         13 | P a g e
       Line 2 shows a similar greater diaspora link among papers with both China and non-
China addresses but with no Chinese-named authors at a non-China address. NCD papers give
relatively more citations per paper to these papers than do NCN papers, by a ratio of 1.48 to 1.00.
This is our smallest estimate of NCD/NCN differential diaspora effect on citing papers with a
China address.
       Line 3 shows that NCD papers cite CJ papers with a diaspora author by a 2.90 to 1.00
ratio over NCN papers. This is our biggest estimate of a diaspora effect on citing papers with a
China address. The likely reason is that CJD papers, as the overlap papers between CJ and
diaspora papers, reflect the strongest network connections/homophily among those authors.
       Finally, recognizing that the univariate analysis in Tables 6 and 7 leaves open the
possibility that the link between diaspora papers and China-addressed papers could reflect factors
associated with the papers beyond the diaspora connection, we estimated the impact of diaspora
papers on citations to and from China-only addressed papers in a regression model that conditons
on papers being in the same field of study and having the same number of authors. The results
summarized in Appendix C show that while field and number of authors impact citations, they do
not substantially change the finding that diaspora papers are more likely to cite and to be cited by
China Only addressed papers.


Section 4. Conclusion
       Standard assessments of country contributions to scientific publications credit a country
for papers in which an author's address is in that country, regardless of the origin of the scientist.
Using the names of Chinese scientists to differentiate those likely to have been born in China
from those likely to have been born elsewhere, our evidence shows that despite being relatively
few in number, Chinese diaspora researchers accounted for a substantial (fraction counted)
proportion of journal articles; had a presence on many more articles; gained above average
citations and publication in top journals; disproportionately co-authored with researchers in
China; and were a key node in the flow of citations between China and the rest of the world.
       Since countries govern borders, the development of the Chinese diaspora research
community required supportive or permissive migration policies by China as the source country
and by destination countries. In contrast to the former Soviet Union which discouraged scientists
from engaging with scientists in other countries and viewed emigrant scientists as traitors,

                                                                                         14 | P a g e
China's government began to sponsor and support overseas education and scholarly research
visits in the early 1980s, following the end of the Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping's rise
to become the paramount leader of China. 28 It continued to support international students and
research trips even as many Chinese students and scholars chose to seek permanent residence
and citizenship overseas. As tensions over trade, refugee crises and COVID-19 pandemic fears
have led to more local nationalist orientation, the diaspora contribution deserves attention as a
success of globalization that spread knowledge and talent widely and spurred the growth of
global scientific publications even as publications slowed in such traditional scientific leaders as
the US and Japan.
        Our research raises questions about the diaspora experience and transmission of
scientific knowledge across country lines that can illuminate the ways science progresses in a
global world.   How much do extended stays overseas impact career trajectories in the form of
future collaborations or research topics compared to attending or presenting at a single
conference (Chai and Freeman, 2019)? Does working or studying overseas matter more for
persons from developing countries or from more advanced countries? Is overseas exposure or
diversity of backgrounds more useful in some disciplines than in others? To what extent, if at all,
does the return of diaspora scientists to their country of origin alter research in that country? Do
diaspora scientists from other countries contribute "above their weight" to science as those from
China have done and if not, why not? Finally, while we treated the co-authorship network and
citation networks as separable processes, analysis of the interactions between these networks29
and possible synergies and trade-offs between knowledge gained by collaborations compared to
reading/citing published studies might suggest ways to go beyond our analogy of citations as
"exports" and "imports" in the transfer of knowledge to greater insight into the development of
comparative advantage in national expertise in different scientific specialties.

Note: The standard errors for the means in citations are 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 0.9, 2.1, 0.3
The standard errors for means of CiteScores are 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2
The CiteScore values are assigned to papers based on the CiteScore of the journals in which they
appeared. Scopus does not assign a CiteScore to new or inactive journals so observations on
those journals are excluded at the CiteScore calculation. We use the 2017 version CiteScore list
issued by Scopus, Downloaded at 25 May 2018.

Note: Citations counts are 3-year forward citation counts. Column 1 and 2 citations to CO papers
are estimated from sample of 2,000 CO papers. Citations to CJD and CJN papers are estimated
from sample of 2,000 CJ papers. Columns 3 and 4 multiply the citations per 2015 receiving
paper by the number of 2015 papers published in each group, from Table 1, and divided by the
estimated number of NCD an NCN papers published in 2016, 2017, and 2018 in a three-step
procedure. First, we obtained from the Scopus website using query strings the total number of
NC papers which were: 2016: 1,213,200; 2017: 1,215,647; 2018: 1,233,660. Second, we counted
the number of NC papers with at least one China last named author in 2016: 185,799; 2017:
187,903; and 2018: 191,040. Third, we estimated ratios of NCD papers to NC papers with at
least one China first named author based on a sample of 2,000 NC papers in 2016, 2017, and
2018 described in appendix A with estimates of 2016: 74.5%; 2017: 78.1%; 2018: 79.6%. This
produced an estimated number of NCD papers is 138,234 in 2016; 146,376 in 2017; and 152,255
in 2018. The number of NCN papers are #NC papers minus #NCD papers, which is 1,074,966 in
2016; 1,069,271 in 2017; and 1,081,405 in 2018.

Notes: Credit for Authors with more than one address in China and a foreign address prorated
by giving ½ to each of the two country addresses. Two authors with the same address count as
two addresses. We count the proportion of China address and proportion of diaspora authors

           To measure the impact of journals Scopus uses CiteScore, the number of citations to the journal in one year
to documents published in the three previous years, divided by the number of documents indexed in Scopus in the
same three years. See https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14880/supporthub/scopus/. The Web of
Science measure of the number of citations received by a journal is its impact factor.

           We identify Chinese last-named authors using a list of common Chinese last names from the Chinese
Ministry of Public Security household registrations: http://www.mps.gov.cn/, accessed June 26, 2017. This list has
last names for 84.8% of the population, leaving out uncommon last names, including some non-Han minority
names. We distinguish Mainland Chinese names from other Chinese language speaking areas, by analyzing
differences in the Chinese Pinyin spelling (Pinyin is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in
mainland China). We check authors' first names by hand.
5
           This method limits mislabeling country of birth to immigrants who changed their first name to fit the
country to which they moved and to native born persons whose parents gave them a mainland first name.
6
           The sum of China Only (CO) addressed articles and fractional counts of articles with both Chinese and non-
China addresses proportionate to China's share of the article's addresses.
7
           Scopus contained 350 active Chinese language journals that made it the 2nd largest language in the
bibliometry in 2018.
8
           Indicative because differences in research quality almost surely account for a large proportion of the
difference in citations.
9
           The average 3-year-citation to all non-English language papers published in 2015 is 1.3, while the average
3-year-citation to all English language papers published in 2015 is 9.5, so the citation pattern goes beyond the
Chinese language.
10
           Papers published in 2015 with NC addresses gave just 0.05% of references to Chinese language papers
compared to a 6.4% share for China addressed English language articles. These statistics ignore citations to papers
from the many Chinese language scientific publications in the China National Knowledge Inventory database
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNKI) not included in Scopus (Xie and Freeman, 2019).
11
           We obtained the number of CO English language papers published in 2000 in the science and engineering
fields from the Scopus online database and divided it by the number of all English journal articles in those fields in
2000.
12
           To check this statistic, we obtained an independent sample of 2,000 papers all with at least one Chinese
last-named author. In this sample 79.9% of the papers had at least one China first named author, giving us an
estimated number of 152,641.
13
           We prorated the address share of credit for an author with addresses in China and another country on the
extent of a paper being diaspora by giving ½ to each of the two country addresses. For example, we credited a paper
with one Chinese named author and with both a Chinese and a US address 3/4th to China and 1/4ths to non-China.
In an n-authored paper, this gives 3/4n to China and 1/4n to non-China. Because non-Chinese named researchers
with China addresses are a negligible part of China addressed papers, we ignored them but their contribution could
be divided similarly by names and addresses.
14
            National Science Board (2020) Table 5A-1 shows India with 5.3%, Germany with 4.1% and Japan with
3.9% of papers in 2018. We obtain the same ranking in our compilation of English journal articles in Scopus.
15
            If we used number of citations as the metric of value of a paper, the measure of contribution would be the
relative impact on citations of having a Chinese-named author or a China-addressed author.
16
            Such an analysis would have to estimate the likely lower productivity of diaspora scientists if they were in
China rather than working outside China and the likely lower productivity of their potential replacements on projects
outside China. The impact would likely depend on the size of the counterfactual change in flows.
17
           Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China data show that from 1978 to 2018, 5.9 million
students studied abroad, with 1.5 million students outside China at the end of 2018. Among those 4.3 million
students who completed their studies, 3.6 million students returned to China:

           Three year forward citation in a sample of 5989 papers published in 2000 had correlations of 0.97, 0.89,
and 0.68 to their citations 5, 7, and 10 years in the future. An extensive literature examines ways to predict later
citations from early citations and other attributes of papers (Bornmann et al., 2014; Abrishami and Aliakbary, 2019).
19
          This is for a sample of 5,540 papers with valid cite scores published in 2018.
20
          Larivière et al. (2016) analyze the distribution of citations within journals. Callaway (2016) notes that
variation in the within-journal variation could potentially be explicable by attributes of the journals, including cite
scores.
21
          Requiring a Chinese first name meant that Michael Huang, from Taiwan and educated in part in the US, is
not counted.
22
          As cite scores are highly correlated over time, the results should be similar with modestly different year
coverage. The correlation for the cite score of Scopus journals is 0.93 between 2017 and 2015, and is 0.87 between
2017 and 2011.

elsewhere.
24
          The number of diaspora papers was 220,974 (line 5 of Table 1) and the number of all English journal
articles was 1,602,030. Using the Table 5 column 1 regression coefficients that estimated the relation between
citations and types of papers conditional that papers are in the same fields and have the same number of author, we
estimated that diaspora share of citations adjusted for relative number of citations as (NCD+CJD) =
[(9.44+7.92)*152,255 + (8.55+7.92)*68,719] / [(9.44+7.92)*152,255 + (8.55+7.92)*68,719 + (3.88+7.92)*30,597 +
(1.24+7.92)*269,054 + 7.92*1,081,405] = 24.9%. 7.92 is the mean of NCN deleted group in the regression.
25
          This procedure credits China with 43.7% + (0.5) (0.255) 56.3% = 50.9% in 2000 and with 58.6% + 0.5
(0.349) 41.4% = 64.0% in 2018.
26
          Computed using data in source of Table 7.
27
          Specifically, we multiplied the estimated average number of citations that CO papers received from the
NCD and NCN papers in columns (1) and (2) by the total number of CO papers to obtain the total number of
citations from NCD and fromo NCN paperts to CO papers. We then divided these numbers by the total number of
NCD and NCN papers respectively, to obtain the numbers in columns (3) and (4).

          The Tiananmen Incident in April 1976 was followed by the arrest of the Gang of 4 in Oct 1976, and Deng
Xiaoping's becoming leader in 1978. In 1977 China restored the college entrance examination system, which had
been interrupted for ten years due to the Cultural Revolution and universities began to operate "normally". The
Minister of Education made a goal to send 3000 more Chinese students to study overseas in 1978 and succeeded in
sending 4252 government-sponsored Chinese students, including 3006 visiting scholars, 537 graduate students, and
649 undergraduate students. In 1981, the state allowed self-supporting overseas education. After China's accession
to the WTO in 2001, the number of Chinese students/researchers going abroad boomed. (Chen, 2009; Miao et al.,
2009).

                            Appendix A. The data set of sampled papers.

         There are two ways to use data from Scopus in analysis. The first method is to download a file
that contains bibliographic data on of papers from the Scopus online website https://www.scopus.com
using the Scopus query string ( https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/11365/c/10545/
supporthub/scopus/). The second is to make requests to the server of Elsevier and get the response
content through its API (Application programming interface). Downloading files from the first channel
does not provide the first names of researchers that we need to differentiate mainland-born persons
from citizens or permanent residences born in other countries that meets our definition of diaspora
researchers. It also does not give sufficiently detailed data to determine the position of diaspora
researchers in the citation network of papers. It records the number of citations a paper receives but
little about the citing papers. It also does not report the address or name of authors of the papers in the
reference part of a paper.
         To extract evidence on those aspects of papers, we undertook a two-part analysis.
         First, we randomly selected samples of 2000 articles from the Scopus English journal articles
with valid address or name information that are the focus of our study. The query string in Scopus
allows 2,000 papers to be downloaded in any query. It reports up to 100 pages of data for each query,
with each page containing from 20 to 200 items. We specify the result page to show 100 items per
page. To draw the random samples, we generated 20 random numbers between 1~100 from the random
function in Excel and used the numbers to select 20 pages with papers for our sample. The 100 papers
in each of the 20 pages gives us a sample of 2,000 papers out of the 10,000 items in the query. The
downloaded files contain the author name and address information and other bibliographic information
­ the title of paper, the publication year, and the ISSN number of the journal etc. But they don't report
the first names of authors nor which publication in Scopus cites the selected papers.
         Second, using the paper identifier in the downloaded files, we added the desired information to
the samples through Elsevier API. We find information on the first names of authors and the papers that
cited the paper using the unique identifier assigned to papers in Scopus ­ eid (see:
https://dev.elsevier.com/guides/ScopusSearchViews.htm) and added the first names and the author and
address information of the citers of the selected samples via the API portal provided by Elsevier (see:
https://dev.elsevier.com/api_docs.html). To get the address and name information of the references in
papers in our sample, we accessed the metadata of papers to get the eid code of the references indexed
in Scopus through the Elsevier API. We then obtained the detailed address and name information of
those cited papers using their eids also through Elsevier API.
         The 2000 paper maximum sample that Scopus allowed for an inquiry gives us an adequate
number of observations for generalizing to the larger population of all papers. As most of our statistics
are counts that we use to compute proportions of papers in different groups, we calculate the sampling
error for estimating a proportion in a random sample of 2,000. It is quite small, with a maximum value
on the order of 0.006 for a true proportion of 0.50. This allows us to distinguish modest differences in
shares of the magnitudes we observe with a high level of significance. As noted in the text, in the case
where we had a substantially smaller sample with just 324 persons with Chinese last names in the 2018
NC sample from which to calculate the proportion with Chinese first names, we drew a much larger
sample of 2,000 NC papers with at least one Chinese last-named author and obtained virtually identical
estimates of the proportion with Chinese first names as in the smaller sample.
         Table A-1 lists the data samples that we created. Our focus on diaspora authors meant that we
sampled papers with diaspora authors more intensely than papers with all China addresses. The
number of 2,000 samples for CJ papers is particularly large because we wanted to track the change over
time carefully for a related project. The 2018 sample of NC papers with China last named authors was
our check on the estimated proportion of China named authors who also had Chinese first names.

Note: Given the relatively small sample of papers in the upper decile, we also estimated the Ln(citations) on the
ln(rank-1/2) to reduce bias, per Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) and obtained similar results to those in the column
for the upper decile sample. The lower estimated coefficient in the column for the top 10% of cited papers is
markedly smaller than in the column for all papers with citations, reflecting the "fatter tail" at the upper end of
the distribution that is found in many estimates of power laws.
