                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper studies average and conditional expected returns in national equity markets,
and their relation to a number of fundamental country attributes. The attributes are organized
into three groups. The first is relative valuation ratios, such as price-to-book-value, cash-flow,
earnings and dividends. The second group measures relative economic performance and the third
measures industry structure. We find that average returns across countries are related to the
volatility of their price-to-book ratios. Predictable variation in returns is also related to relative
gross domestic product, interest rate levels and dividend-price ratios. We explore the hypothesis
that cross-sectionaj variation in the country attributes proxy for variation in the sensitivity of
national markets to global measures of economic risks. We test single-factor and two-factor
models in which countries' conditional betas are assumed to be functions of the more important
fundamental attributes.

 1. Introduction                                                     Ferson and Harvey
 Asset pricing theories postulate that cross-sectional differences in expected returns are
 linearly related to the covariances or betas of securities with marginal utility, which is a
 function of a set of economic risk factors. Firm-specific attributes other than betas have

 traditionally served as alternative hypotheses in tests of these asset pricing models at the
"micro' level. A well known example is the firm "size-effect," which first drew attention as

an alternative to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) of Sharpe (1964), Lintner

(1965) and Black (1970). Additional examples include ratios of stock market price to
earnings and the book value of equity [e.g. Basu (1977), Fama and French (1992), Chan,
L.akonishok and Hamao (1991)]. In the early 1990's, a flurry of research is attempting to
understand the role of such firm-specific attributes in domestic asset pricing.

        In contrast to research on foreign exchange markets, which has long been
interested in predictability, research on international equity pricing has traditionally

focussed on average returns. Recently, however, studies have widened the focus to include
the predictability of returns in different countries and the sources of this predictable

variation [Harvey (1991), Dumas and Solnik (1993), Ferson and Harvey (1993a)]. This
paper studies the relation between predictable variation and fundamental valuation ratios,
measures of economic performance and industry structure at the country level.
        It is interesting that there is a divergence between the cross-sectional fundamental

analysis that is important to investment practitioners [e.g. Rosenberg, Reid and Lanstein
(1985), Guerrard and Takano (1990), Wadhwani and Shah (1993)] and the perspective
taken in most of the academic research on asset pricing. The evidence of Fama and

French (1992) and others suggests that firm-specific attributes are important for explaining

the cross-section of domestic equity returns. This, of course, would be no surprise to
                                                  2

  many practitioners. One of the objectives of this paper is to begin to bridge the gap, at
  the country level, between the cross-sectional analysis of attributes and the beta pricing

  models for expected returns that are familiar to academics.

          We estimate cross-sectional models, using fundamental attributes to predict future
 equity market returns. For example, the regressions ask if lagged price-to-book ratios
 predict the next period's cross-section of returns. The simplest international aset pricing

 theories, based on perfect and integrated markets, imply that fundamental attributes
 should be useful in discriminating expected returns across countries only to the extent that

 they are proxies for the relevant risk exposures. We explore the hypothesis that
 fundamental ratios serve as proxies for conditional betas in national equity markets. We
 test single-factor and two-factor models in which countries' conditional betas are assumed
 to be functions of the fundamental attributes.

         The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3
 presents some initial empirical results. Section 4 presents our empirical asset pricing
 models, and section 5 offers concluding remarks.


2. The Data
2.1 National equity market returns:
Total returns for 21 countries are based
                                           on indexes from Morgan Stanley Capital
International (MSCI). The returns are calculated with gross dividend reinvestment. They

represent value.weighted portfolios of the larger firms traded on the national equity
markets, and are designed to cover a minimum of 60% of the market capitalization.
Returns are available from January 1970 except for Finland, Ireland and New Zealand
                                                3

 (which begin in February 1988). A value-weighted world market portfolio is constructed
 as the aggregate of the 21 countries.


 2.2 Country Attributes

  We examine three different groups of country attributes. The first group includes the
 relative valuation ratios. The second group measures country economic performance and

 the third reflects industry structure. The data series are available from different starting
 dates, the earliest of which is January of 1970. We conduct most of our analysis using the

 January, 1976 through May, 1993 period for which all of the series are available. Here we
motivate and briefly describe the variables. A data appendix contains more detailed
descriptions of the data and sources.


Valuation Ratios:

  Measures of relative value have long been used by equity analysts in their attempt to

discriminate high from low expected return stocks [e.g. Graham (1965)J. A number of
investment services characterize the "styles" of equity managers as "value" or 'growth,"

largely on the basis of similar valuation ratios for the stocks they buy [e.g. Haughton and

Christopherson (1989)]. Quantitative stock selection models place a great deal of weight
on valuation ratios for individual stocks in the United States and in other national markets

[e.g. Rosenberg, Reid and Lanstein (1985), Guerrard and Takano (1990), Wadhwani and
Shah (1993)]. With the recent work of Fama and French (1992), academics have become

increasingly interested in valuation ratios. No previous study, however, has used such
ratios at the country level to model the cross-section of conditional expected returns as we
                                                 4
  do in this paper.

          The usefulness of valuation ratios to predict stock returns may be related to mean
  reversion in the stock markets [Poterba and Summers (1988)], time-varying risk and

  expected returns [Fama and French (1989)], or investor sentiment [e.g. Shleifer and
 Summers (1990)]. At the country level, relative valuation measures take on another
 dimension. For example, Stulz and Wasserfallen (1992) suggest that differences in stock
 market price levels across countries, other things held fixed, may proxy for their relative

 investability. If expected returns differ across countries with investability, we might expect
 differences in valuation ratios to be related to differences in expected returns.1

         We use four valuation ratios, obtained from MSCI. These are (1) Earnings-to-

 price, (2) Price-to-cash-flow, (3) Price-to-book-value and (4) Dividend yield. Earnings-to-
 price was one of the first valuation ratios to attract attention as an alternative to the
 CAPM for individual stocks [Basu
                                     (1977)]. Our ratio is value-weighted across the firms in
 the MSCJ universe. Chan, Hamao and Lakonishok (1991) found that a ratio of price to
cash flow had a stronger relation to individual stock returns in Japan than a ratio of price

to earnings. Our price to cash ratio defines cash
                                                     as accounting earnings plus
depreciation. The price-to-book-value ratio is also a value-weighted average across the
firms. Finally, we examine dividend yields, which are the 12 month moving sum of
dividends divided by the current MSCI index level for each country.


Economic Performance Measures:
 We study four measures of country economic performance, designed to
                                                                           capture relative
output, inflation and future expected economic growth. Unlike the relative valuation
                                                 5

 measures, these variables come from outside the stock markets. The first is the ratio of

 lagged, quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, to lagged quarterly GDP per
 capita for the OECD countries, both measured in U.s. dollars. The growth of GDP per
capita is studied by Harris and Opler (1990)), who find that stock market returns reflect
forecasts of growth rates. Our second measure is relative inflation, measured monthly as

the ratio of country inflation (annual percentage changes in the local CPI), to pEcD
annual inflation. Country inflation and inflation volatility, in relation to stock returns, are

studied by Mandelker and Tandon (1985). A long term interest rate and a term spread
are the final economic performance measures. Harvey (1988, 1991) has shown that the
slope of the term structure contains forecasts of future economic growth rates in a number
of countries. Bond yields and spreads for individual countries are also used in predictive
models by Ferson and Harvey (1993a), Solnik (1993) and Wadhwani and Shah (1993).2


Industry Structure Measures:

 We measure the industry structure of a country using the coefficients from regressing the

country returns on international industry indices. We use the MSCI world industry
portfolios to construct the industry indices. MSCI tracks 38 industry groups. Industry
factors are examined for explaining differences in stock return behavior across countries by
Roll (1992) and Heston and Rouwenhorst (1993). Investment services, such as BARRA,
use   related industry structure measures in their models for individual stocks. They use as
many as   55   industry groups. However, since our analysis is at the country level instead of
the individual firm level, parsimony is important, We therefore aggregate the 38 MSCI
industry returns into four groups, as shown in Figure 1. The industry groups are (1)
                                                 6
  natural resources, (2) construction and manufacturing, (3) transportation, communication,

  and energy, and (4) services, including financial. The correlations of the four industry-
 grouped portfolio returns are shown in the data appendix.


 2.3 Global risk factors

   We consider five global risk factors in our initial exploratory analysis, and focus on the

 most important two in our empirical asset pricing models. Our choice of the factors
 follows previous theoretical and empirical work on international asset pricing. Stulz

 (1981b, 1984) and Adler and Dumas (1983) provide conditions under which a single-beta

 capital asset pricing model (CAPM) based on a world market portfolio holds globally,
 which motivates the use of a world equity market risk factor. A number of empirical
 studies have used a similar risk factor in a conditional asset pricing context [e.g.,

Giovannini and Jonon (1989), Harvey (1991), Ferson and Harvey (1993a)J. The MSCI
world return is the U.S. dollar world market return less the 30-day Eurodollar rate.

         Solnik (1974) showed that exchange risks should be "priced in a world otherwise
similar to that of the static CAPM, when
                                        purchasing power parity fails. Adler and Dumas
(1983) present a model in which the world market portfolio and exchange risks are the
relevant risk factors. The exchange risks can be broken down into a separate factor for
each currency, as in Dumas and Solnik (1993), or can be approximated by a single
variable, as in Ferson and Harvey (1993a,b). Our
                                                     second global risk factor, the Gb FX
return, is the return to holding a portfolio of the currencies of the 010 countries (plus
Switzerland) in excess of the 30-day Eurodollar deposit rate. The currency return is the

percentage change in the spot exchange rate plus the local currency, 30-day Eurodeposit
                                               7

 rate. The currency returns are trade-weighted to form a portfolio return [see Harvey
 (1993b) for details of the construction]. This measure is similar to the one used by Ferson

 and Harvey (1993a.b), but it is measured directly as an excess return. This avoids the

 need to construct a mimicking portfolio for the factor in an asset pricing model.

         International equilibrium and arbitrage pricing (APT) models with several risk
 factors are described by Stulz (1981a), Hodrick (1981), Ross and Walsh (1983), and

 Bansal, Hsieh and Viswanathan (1993), among others. The central intuition of such
 models is that only the pervasive sources of common variation should be priced.

 Korajczyk and Viallet (1989) and Heston, Rouwenhorst and Wessels (1991) find evidence
 for several common sources of variation in U.S. and European stocks, which suggests that
a number of world-wide risk factors may be important. Ferson and Harvey (1993a,b) find
evidence that a number of global risk factors are useful in capturing both the cross section
of average returns and the predictable variation of returns in national equity markets.
Our additional factors are similar to theirs. The OIL return is the percentage change in
the dollar price of oil minus the 30-day Eurodollar deposit rate. The growth in OECD
production is the percentage change in the OECD index of industrial production in

member countries. OECD inflation is the percentage change in the OECD index of
consumer prices in member countries. The data appendix provides more detailed
descriptions of these variables.


2.4 World Information Variables

 We are interested in the relation between predictability in country returns over time, to

the cross-sectional predictability using the fundamental attributes. We therefore include a
                                                8

  number of world-wide information variables, similar to those which previous studies found
 can predict country returns over time. The variables are lagged values of the MSCI world
 market return, the GlO FX return, a world dividend yield, a short-term Eurodollar deposit
 rate and a short-term structure measure taken from the Eurodollar market. The term
 spread is the difference between a 90-day Eurodollar deposit rate and the 30-day
 Eurodollar deposit rate. The short term interest rate is the 30-day Eurodollar deposit
 yield which is observed on the last day of the month.

          As the predetermined variables follow previous studies using similar variables,
 there is a natural concern that their predictive ability arises spuriously from data mining.

 However Solnik (1993) finds, using step ahead forecasts, that the predictability is

 economically significant. Ferson and Harvey (1993) find that a large fraction of the
 predictability is related to premiums for economic factor risks. Even so, the possibility of
 data mining remains an important caveat. Our methodology addresses this issue to some
extent because it is robust to the specification of the expected factor premiums, as is
explained below.



3. Preliniinaiy Empirical Evidence
        The Appendix Table I presents summary statistics for the country returns and the
fundamental attributes. We report the sample means, standard deviations and

autocorrelations. The monthly returns are measured in U.S. dollars. The sample period
is 1975:1.1993:5, but for some of the countries and series the starting dates are later.

Summary statistics are also reported for the MSCI world market index. As time-series,
the valuation ratios and most of the other fundamental attributes share the high degree of
                                              9
 persistence that is familiar from the dividend yield series. However, the autocorrelations

 of the other series tend to damp Out at longer lags more quickiy than those of the
 dividend yields.

         The appendix table 2 reports the average correlations across countries of the
valuation ratios and economic performance measures. For each country we calculate the
 time series correlation matrix of the attributes. We then average these matrices across the

countries. The highest absolute correlations are among the valuation ratios, which range
from 0.69 to 0.79. The remaining correlations are all smaller than 0.51. The correlations
between the valuation ratios and the measures of economic performance are generally
much smaller than the correlations among the valuation ratios, which makes sense given
the common price level in all of the valuation ratios. This suggests that some of the
valuation ratios will be redundant in a time-series model, but there is not likely to be
serious collinearity problems between the group of valuation ratios and the measures of
economic performance.

        The appendix table 3 records the measures of industry structure for each of the
countries. These are obtained by regressing the country returns, over time, on the
industry groups. The coefficients provide a simple measure of the extent to which the
returns of a given country move in association with the global industry groups. Some of
the industry loadings make intuitive sense. For example, Australia and Canada load
heavily on natural resources, Germany on construction and manufacturing, while Hong

Kong loads heavily on services, including financial. There are also examples of loadings
that do not seem so intuitive. Furthermore, some of the loadings are negative. Negative
loadings can be symptomatic of collinearity, or of missing factors. There is high, but not
                                               10

  extremely, high correlation between the industry groups (see the data appendix). If the
 four industry groups do not span the relevant factors, then the sum of the loadings should
 differ from 1.0 [Huberman and Kandel (1987)]. The coefficients are often less than 1.0,
 which suggests missing factors. This implies that the industry loadings should he used in
 conjunction with other attributes in an asset pricing model.

         Time-series plots of the valuation ratios for each country are shown in the

 Appendix Figures 1-4. Each ratio is plotted on a graph with the corresponding ratio for
 the MCSI world market index as a reference series. The valuation ratios typically show no
 strong trends over the sample period. A number of the series show episodes of relatively
 high and low volatility, suggestive of conditional heteroskedasticity. The
                                                                              price-to-earnings
 ratios are the most volatile of the valuation ratios and are sometimes negative, due in

 large part to low and negative earnings during the world recession in 1992 (these graphs
are truncated at zero and 50).
        We examine scatter plots of the average returns across countries, against the
means and standard deviations of the fundamental attributes. Some of these are displayed
in figure 2. Most of the plots show little relation among the variables. The plots do

suggest a weak positive relation of average returns to the ratio of price to book value.
Previous studies [e.g. Jaffe, Keim, and Westerfield (1989), Fama and French (1992)] find a
U-shaped relation between U.S. stock returns and their earnings-to-price ratios. We find
no such pattern at the country level.

        The strongest relations revealed by the scatter plots is between average returns
and the standard deviation of the price-to-book ratio, and between average returns and

the average term spread. The regression equations (standard errors in parentheses) are:3
                                               11


 avg(R1) = 6.7 +        17.7   sd(?/B)1 + e., R2 =   .23
                        (7.4), and

 avg(R) =    13.1   +    3.9   TERM1 +   e1,
                                                R2 =   .34
                        (1.2).




These relations are stronger than the relation between the average returns and the
standard deviation of the returns. The slope coefficient in that relation is 0.22 (standard
error=0.39) and the R2 is l.6%. The positive relation of average returns to the term
spreads should not be surprising, given previous evidence that both the slope of the term
structure [Harvey (1991)] and stock returns [Harris and Opler (1990)] forecast future
economic growth in many countries.

        It is interesting that the volatility of the price-to-book-value ratio is so strongly
related to average returns, while stock return volatility shows little relation over this

period. If variation over time in price-to-book ratios captures fluctuations of stock prices
around "fundamental' values, then countries with higher price-to-book volatility may be
countries where the risk of stock price departures from fundamentals is greater. If such
deviations from fundamental values represents a risk that is priced in the market [e.g.
Shleifer and Summers (1990)], we would expect countries with higher volatility of price-to-
fundamentals to have higher average returns.

        The average relations shown in the scatter plots can be misleading if expected
returns vary over time, as recent evidence suggests. The slopes in the cross-sectional
                                               12

 relations represent a return premium associated with the attribute. Ferson and Harvey
 (1991) note that if the expected risk premium is time-varying, it is possible to find an
 average slope close to zero even though the conditional expected premium is important at
 some times. Table 1 summarizes cross-sectional predictive regressions of the country
 returns each month on the predetermined, fundamental attributes. The regression
 equation for month t is:




(1)             R1+1 =      7ot+1   + + K 7j1+1          + e1÷1   ;   i = 1,...,   N,




where 101+1 is the intercept, the         are the slope coefficients, and A is the
fundamental ratio j, j= 1,..,K, for the country i in month t. The dating convention indicates
that the fundamental attribute is public information at time t.5 The slope coefficient
1jt+1' j=1,...,K is the return on a maximum correlation, zero net investment portfolio for
the j-th attribute, subject to zero cross-sectional correlation with the other attributes.6 The
portfolio weights depend only on the cross-section of the fundamental attributes observed
at time t. The expected values of the coefficients therefore represent expected returns
premia associated with the attributes.

        Table 1 reports the mean, standard deviation, and other summary statistics for
time series of the cross-sectional regression slopes and for the coefficients of determination
of the regressions. There are 205 regressions, one for each month over the 1976:01-
1993:01 sample period. To avoid the extreme outliers caused by near zero earnings, we
                                              13

use the ratio of earnings to price, rather than the inverse ratio, in these regressions. Panel
A of Table I reports univariate regressions. In panel B, multivariate regressions are show,
with each regression reported in a subpanel. The first three subpanels show regressions
using the three main groups of fundamental attributes. The remaining subpanels show
regressions which combine attributes across the three main groups. For the univariate

regressions, the average of the cross-sectional R-squares varies from 6.4 to 9.9%. For the
mutivariate regressions, the average R-squares vary from 22.1 to 31.7%. While the

average R-squares suggest that the cross-sectional predictive regressions have explanatory
power, they should be interpreted with caution because they do not control for cross-
sectional dependence of the error terms.
        Table 1 reports t-ratios for the time series average of each slope coefficient. The
time series average of the slopes is the same as the slope in the average relation, similar
to those shown in figures 2. (However, the numbers in Table 1 and the figures 2 are

multiplied by 1200, while those in the regressions are not, and the samples of firms differ
between the table 1 and the figures 2.) The t-ratios are calculated as in Fama and
MacBeth (1973), an approach which controls for cross-sectional dependence of the error
terms. The t-ratios should be a better guide as to the significance of the average premia
than the scatter plots of the figures 2 [see Shanken (1992)]. For example, based on the
scatter plots, the term spread showed a strong relation to average returns. However, term
structure slopes are strongly positively dependent across countries, so the Fama-MacBeth
t-ratios are reduced.7 Table I also reports the standard deviations and the minimum and
maximum values of the coefficients. The return premiums for the fundamental ratios vary

substantially over the sample. This is not surprising, since the premiums are the realized
                                                14

 excess returns of portfolios. Some of the premiums show significant autocorrelation,

 suggestive of time-variation in the conditional expected premiums. Recall that if the
 expected risk premium is time-varying, it is possible to find a small Fama-MacBeth t-ratio,
 even though the conditional expected premium is important.

         Overall, a few of the fundamental attributes emerge as the more important cross-
sectional predictors. We retain three of them for our subsequent investigations, based on
the overall evidence. These are the ratio of per capita GDP to OECD per capita GDP,
the dividend-to-price ratio, and the long term interest rate. The price-to-cash-flow variable
performs similarly to the dividend-to-price ratio, so we check the sensitivity of our main
results to this substitution.

         In Table 2 we examine sample correlations between the slope coefficients from
cross-sectional regressions on the three surviving attributes, and the contemporaneous
values of the five global risk factors. If the levels of the fundamental ratios are proxies
for the risk sensitivity of a national market to underlying risk factors, the cross-sectional

regression slopes should jointly be proxies for the risk factors. Most of the correlations in
Table 2 are low, although some are statistically significant. Using the approximate

standard error equal of T1'2=O.067, two of the fifteen simple correlations exceed three
standard errors and four more exceed two standard errors. The multiple correlations,

reported in the right-hand column and the bottom two rows of the table, are all less than
0.35, which corresponds to regression R-squares of about 10% or less. (The one-factor
case refers to the MSCI world excess return; in the two factor case the 010 FX excess
return is the second factor.)
                                               15

        There are a number of possible interpretations for the low correlations in Table
2. One possibility is that the factors exclude some important, priced risks. Another
possibility is that the cross-sectional predictability using the attributes is not explained by a

rational pricing model using the global risk factors, in an integrated capital market. Yet a
third possibility is that there is so much noise in the cross-sectional regression estimates of

the return premiums, that the true relation is obscured. It is likely that the crops-sectional
regression slopes are noisy estimates, given the range of the values recorded in Table 1.
[See also Shanken and Weinstein (1990) in a domestic asset pricing context.]
        Our hypothesis is that expected returns, which are modeled in the cross-sectional
regressions as a combination of the attributes multiplied by the conditional expected values
of the i's, are equal to a combination of betas multiplied by conditional expected risk
premia for the global risk factors. If this view is correct, there are a number of things
that can cloud the relation between the cross-sectional slopes and the risk factors. In
particular, both time-series and cross-sectional variation in the ratios of betas to attributes
can reduce the time-series correlation between the regression slopes and the risk factors.
In order to obtain a clearer picture of the relation between the fundamental attributes and
betas, we need to model the relation of the attributes to the betas explicitly.
        Table 3 explores the time-series predictability of the national market returns in
relation to the predetermined attributes. We report the results of time series regressions
for each country, on a constant, the vector of predetermined, world information variables

(denoted by Z), and on the three own-country fundamental attributes (denoted by A). F
statistics examine the hypotheses that Z may be excluded or that the fundamental
attributes may be excluded. The results are interesting and differ from previous studies.
                                                16

 Harvey (1991) found that world information variables were more important than country-
 specific variables for predicting the MSCI index returns over the 1970-89 period, while
 Ferson and Harvey (1993a) found that both global and local information variables had

 marginal explanatory power. Solnik (1993) chose to use only local information variables.

 In Table 3 we reject the hypothesis that the country attributes can be excluded when the
world information variables are in the regressions, for II of the 21 countries at the 5%
level, and five more at the 10% level. In contrast, we reject the hypothesis that the world

information variables can be excluded, only for one country (Australia), at the 5% level.
When we replace the dividend-to-price ratio with the ratio of price-to-cash flow, the
results are similar.8

         There are several differences between the regressions in Table 3 and previous
studies. The sample period is different, as Table 3 refers to the 1976.01-1993.01 period

(205 observations or fewer, depending on the country). The importance of the world
information variables as predictors seems to diminish in such regressions when the 1970-75

period is excluded [see Ferson and Harvey (1993a)J. Our fundamental attributes differ
from the local information variables used in previous studies. In particular, the measure
of relative GDP is a strong predictor of future stock returns in our regressions. The

coefficient on this variable has a t-statistic larger than two for 14 of the 21 countries.
        We conclude from Table 3 that the fundamental attributes are important in time-
series as well as in cross-sectional predictive models. In time-series, they largely subsume

the global information variables over this sample period. Ferson and Harvey (1993a)
found that beta variation contributed less to the time-series predictability of returns than

risk premium variation for most countries, but they modelled the effect of local
                                               17

information variables through betas, and the effect of world information variables through
the expected risk premia.9 The results of tables 2 and 3 lead us to an asset pricing model
in which global expected risk premiums are not restricted to depend only on our world
information variables.



4. Conditional Asset Pricing
4.1 The Models
 While international beta pricing models make strong assumptions about market
integration, lack of frictions and information efficiency, it is interesting to see how far one
can go in modelling the relation of conditional returns to fundamental attributes and world
information variables by using this standard framework. We hypothesize that conditional
expected returns can be written as:




(2)            E(R11 I)=       A0(fl) +         b.(fl) A(fl).



where the b1(fl1) are the conditional regression betas of the country returns, R.1+1,

measured in a common currency, on K global risk factors, j=1,..., K. The expected risk

premia, Affl) j= 1,...,K, are the expected excess returns on mimickizg portfolios for the
risk factors.10 The expectations are conditioned on a public information Set, denoted by

fl. The intercept,          is the expected return of portfolios with all of their betas equal
to zero. Equation (2) implies an expression for the expected excess returns:
                                               18



(3)                      E(r11 fl) K (fl) A(f11),




where the           =          -
                        b.(fl1) b0(fl1) are the conditional betas of the excess returns and
the b(fl), j=1,...,K, are the conditional betas of a 30-day Eurodollar deposit. Note that,
according to equations (2) and (3), the only variables which differ across countries in the
expressions for expected returns are the conditional betas of the country on the underlying
risk factors. If rational expectations are assumed, then the difference between the actual
returns at time t+ 1 and the conditional expected returns, using information at time t,

should not be predictable using information at time t. Therefore, if a cross sectional
regression of time t+ I returns on variables known at time t, such as the fundamental

attributes, has explanatory power, the model implies that the attributes measure the
underlying betas.

        In addition to evidence that expected country returns vary over time, there is
evidence that the conditional covariances move over time in association with lagged

variables [e.g. King, Sentana and Wadhani (1990), Harvey (1991)], and evidence of time-
varying betas for international asset returns [e.g. Giovannini and Jorion (1987, 1989), Mark
(1985), Ferson and Harvey (1993a)]. Given the evidence in these studies and our tables,
we allow for time-variation in both the expected risk premia and the conditional betas.
Let fl = {Z,, A',, i=1,...,n, ,},   where Z1 represents our global information variables, A',
                                               19

the fundamental attributes of country i at time t, and     any remaining public information
that is relevant for conditional expected returns. We isolate the fundamental attributes
from the other information to incorporate the idea that the variables with cross-sectional

explanatory power for future returns are the variables which drive the conditional betas,

1311(fl1). A parsimonious model, similar to one suggested by Ferson and Harvey (1993a),
assumes that the betas are functions only of the fundamental attributes. That is, we
assume          =
                    /31(A'1)." Taking the first term of a Taylor series, we use a linear
function and model the conditional betas as:




14\)                   aIA'\_bOij +B'A'r
                       PIjV t)            ij




The elements of the vector B1 describe the response of the conditional beta of country i
on factor j to the attributes which are the components of A'1.

         Equation (4) allows the functional relation between the fundamental attributes and
the betas to differ across countries, as was suggested by the evidence of Tables 2 and 3.
The relation between attributes and betas for a given country is assumed to be stable over
time, however, as B,1 is a vector of fixed coefficients. The relation may differ across
countries because of differences in the accounting conventions used to compute earnings,
depreciation and book values, as well as other factors. For example, Kester and
Luehrman (1989) and Ando and Auerbach (1990) argue that high cross-holdings of
corporate shares in Japan inflates measured Price-to-earnings ratios in that country.
                                                20

          The global beta pricing model (3), our model of the conditional betas (4), and
rational expectations implies the following econometric model:



(5)                    =    +
                r111               {b0,J F11 + B,' [A'1 F+1]} +



where F1+1 is the excess return on the j-th risk factor-mimicking portfolio. The

intercept, a,, is an average pricing error similar to a Jensen's (1968) alpha, and should be
zero if the model is well specified.

         Using an OLS regression to estimate (5) imposes moment conditions that identif'

      ÷ B,J'A'1 as a conditional beta. Indeed, these are the same conditions that would be
imposed if the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is used. To see this informally,
consider the normal equations for a conditional beta given A, $(A), where the time and
other subscripts are suppressed and the variables are demeaned:


(6)                    (F F') $(A) - F r' = w
                       E(wIA)=0.


Using the GMM, the standard approach is to work with the weaker condition E(w'A)=O,

finding parameters which make the corresponding sample means close to zero. If the
model is exactly identified, the sample means can be set equal to zero. Using the
regression (5) to substitute for the term r in (6), it follows that E(w'A)=O if and only if

E(uF'A)=O. Since the OLS regression imposes the conditions that
                                              21

E(u'F)=E(u)=E(uF'A)=O, it implies that E(w'A)=O. Hence, b01 + B'A',, as estimated
by regression (5), is a conditional beta.

        To improve the power of tests using regression (5), we generalize the regression
to provide specific alternative hypotheses. One interesting alternative hypothesis is that
the fundamental attributes can predict returns, over and above their role as instruments
for the betas. This alternative may provide powerful tests, in view of the traditional role
of the attributes as alternatives to beta. In other words, we can address the question of
whether the attributes represent country-specific determinants of expected returns, as in
segmented capital markets, or proxies for country exposures to global risk factors. For
this alternative we replace the intercept in (5) with: ail =   a10   +   D1'A'1,   and test the
hypothesis that D1=O. A second alternative posits that the deviations between the 'true'
expected country returns and the model are linear functions of the world information
variables. That is, we consider an alternative hypothesis• with a time-varying conditional

alpha: ai1 =   a+     C1'Z.'2
        Under the null hypothesis, the regression model (5) should be robust to the form

of the expected risk premiums, E(F1÷11fl1). To see this, write F1+1 =
                                                                               E(F+1 I1) +
      and   note that the error term in (5) may be written, under the null hypothesis, as:




(7)            u.4.
                      =   {r÷ - E(r+ fl)}
                             1         I       /3(A')'E1+
                                                22
 where f3(A') is the vector of conditional betas for country i and         is the vector of
 unexpected factor excess returns. Since the L(A'1) are, under the null hypothesis, the

 conditional betas given (1, equation (7) implies that u111 is the error from projecting the
 unanticipated country return {r1+i - E(r11+1 I1)}    on   the unanticipated factor excess
 returns, where $(A'1)'ç÷1 is the projection. The error term u1 in (7) should be
 orthogonal to both the public information set fl and the ex post factors, F,+1 and
 therefore to the right-hand side variables in the regression (5). The expected risk

premiums, E(FJI+1 f 1I), may depend on the world information variables, as in Ferson and

Harvey (1993a), or they may depend on the world variables and the country attributes, or
possibly on all of fl1. The risk conditional premia could even be constant over time, and
the regression (5) should still be well-specified.
        The robustness of the regression (5) is attractive, since the evidence suggests that

it is restrictive to model the risk premia as functions only of our world information
variables. Robustness to the functional form of the expected risk premia is also attractive
given that linearity may be restrictive, and in view of the possibility that the relation
between the expected factor risk premia and the predetermined variables could be subject
to a data mining bias.


4.2 Asset Pricing Results
        Table 4 records the results of estimating the conditional asset pricing models. The
first panel shows results for a one-factor model, in which the MSCI world excess return is
the factor. The second panel presents a two-factor model, using the world market
portfolio and the GlO FX excess return as the second factor. F statistics test for the
                                               23

 significance of the products of the factors with the lagged fundamental attributes.
         The results for the one-factor model confirm that the fundamenta] attributes are

 important when they enter the regression through the conditional betas. The tests reject
 the hypothesis of constant conditional betas, for 7 countries at the 5% level and one more
 at the 10% level. In the two factor model, the F tests reject the exclusion of the product
 terms for 10 of the countries, using a 5% level, and two more using a 10% level. The

 tests therefore show that using the attributes to model conditional betas improves the

 explanatory power of the regressions.13
         Table 5 reports tests of the asset pricing models against three alternative

 hypotheses. Testing for exclusion of the intercept a in equation (5), the tests produce
only weak evidence against the models. In the one factor model, the average pricing
errors are significant at the 5% level for two countries, and at the 10% level for two

more. These results are similar to those of Harvey (1991) in testing a conditional version
of a world CAPM.'4 In the two-factor model, none of the intercepts are significant at the
5% level, while three are significant at the 10% level.
        Table 5 also reports the results of the tests against the alternative of a time-

varying conditional alpha, using the fundamental attributes to model the time variation.
These tests ask if the attributes represent country-specific determinants of expected

returns, as in segmented capital markets, or proxies for country exposures to global risk
factors. If the model captures the role of the fundamental attributes adequately through
the conditional betas, we should find that the attribute variables do not provide additional

explanatory power when added to the regression in an unrestricted way. In the one-factor

model, the hypothesis that the model captures the information in the attributes through
                                                 24
  the betas is rejected at the 5% level for five countries, and at the 10% level for three

  more. In the two factor model, the hypothesis can be rejected at the 5% level for only
 two countries, although it can be rejected at the 10% level for seven more. Thus, it

 appears that the conditional beta pricing model is only partially successful at capturing the
 explanatory power of the fundamental attributes.
         The final tests in Table 5 consider the alternative in which the model pricing
 errors ar assumed to be a function of the world information variables. In the one-factor

 model, the exclusion hypothesis for these variables is rejected at the 5% level for five
 countries, and in the two-factor model the hypothesis is rejected for four countries.


 5. Concluding Remarks

  We studied average and conditional expected returns in national equity markets, and
 their relation to a number of fundamental country attributes. The attributes included

relative valuation ratios, such as price-to-book-value, cash-flow, earnings and dividends;

measures of relative economic performance and industry structure. We found that

average returns across countries are related to the volatility of their price-to-book ratios.
Time-variation in expected returns is also related to relative gross domestic product,
interest rate levels and dividend-price ratios. We explored the hypothesis that cross-
sectional variation in the country attributes proxy for variation in the sensitivity of national

markets to global measures of economic risk. We tested single-factor and two-factor
models in which countries' conditional betas were assumed to be stable, country-specific

functions of the more important attributes. Such models are partially successful at
capturing the relation of future returns to the fundamental attributes, but there is evidence
                                                      25

 of misspecification in the models. Our results suggest a number of directions for future
 research. A natural extension is to allow the structural relation between fundamental

 attributes and risk exposures to vary through time. The role of industry structure and of
 price-to-book value volatility should also be further explored. Our framework can be used
 to examine the links between attributes and risk factors at the firm level.

Economic Performance Measures:
          The ratio of lagged, gross domestic product (GD?) per capita, to lagged GD? per capita for the
OECD countries is provided by the OECD, which provides quarterly OECD GD? figures for most of the
countries. For some countries, Ihe GD? data are only available on an annual basis. The ratio is lagged five
quarters to account for publication lag. Since the data are observed quarterly (or annually), the monthly
observations for each month in a quarter (or year) are the same. The population data are observed annually.

 The following currency exchange rate data used are used to convert GDP in local currency to U.S. dollar
 terms. These series are national currency units per U.S. dollar, quarterly and annual averages, depending on
 the frequency of the GDP data. Period averages arc used to better match the fact that GDP figures also
 represent an average over the period as opposed to a spot figure.

The relative inflation measure is the ratio of annual perccntagc changes in the local Consumer price index to
annual percentage changes in the OECD CPI inflation series, available monthly for most of the countries. In
predictive regressions, the variable is lagged live quarters to account for publication lag. The inflation series

Short term interest rates for the various countries arc used to construct a measure of the slope of the term
structure. The Term Spread is the difference between the long-term interest rate and a short term interest
rate in each country. The Term spread is lagged one month in the predictive regressions. The short term
inicrest rates are listed here together with their series codes:

Industry Structure Measures:

These are the regression coefficients from regressing the countiy returns on the four groupings of the MSCI
industry indexes, presented in Figure 1. We use the MSCI world industry portfolios to construct the industry
indexes. Each aggregate index is an equally-weighted average of the returns of the MSCI industries in the
group. MSCI tracks 38 industry groups. These are: Aerospace and Military Technology, Appliances and
Household Durables, Automobiles, Banking, Beverages and Tobacco, Broadcasting and Publishing, Building
Materials and Components, Business and Public Services, Chemicals, Construction and Housing, Data
Processing and Reproduction, Electrical and Electronics, Electronic Components and Instruments, Ener'
Equipment and Services, Energy Sources, Financial Services, Food and Household Products, Forest Products
and Paper, Gold Mines, Health and Personal Care, Industrial Components, Insurance, Leisure and Tourism,
Machinery and Engineering, Merchandising, Metals (Non-Ferrous), Metals (Steel), Miscellaneous Materials
and Commodities, Multi-Industry, Recreation, Other Consumer Goods, Real Estate, Telecommunication,
Textiles and Apparel, Transportation-Airlines. Transportation-Road and Rail, Transportation-Shipping,
Utilities-Electrical and Gas, and Wholesale and International Trade. All of the world industry indices have a
base value of 100 in December 1969. The indices are calculated in U.S. dollars but do not include dividends.
We group 37 of the industry returns into the four groups shown in Figure 1. The correlations of the four
industry grouped portfolio returns are:
          IND1 IND2       IND3     IND4
IND 1     1       0.69    0.71    0.64
IND2                      0.81    0.90
IND3                              0.78

World Information Variables:
A short term slope of the term structure is the difference between the 90 day Eurodollar rate (Citibase
FYUR3M) and the 30-day Eurodollar deposit rate. The short term interest rate is the 30-day Eurodollar
deposit yield. Both arc monthly averages of daily quotes. The lagged values of the MSCI world stock market
return, the dividend yield of the world stock market index, and the GlO FX return are also used.

Global Risk Factors:
Data arc available as early as January of 1970 for somc of the series; all are available by February of 1971.
The MSCI world return is the U.S. dollar world market return less the 30-day Eurodollar rate. This serics is
                                                          30
 from DATASTREAM. The Oil return is the percentage change in the U.S. dollar price of Saudi light crude,
 less the 30-day Eurodollar deposit rate, which is available from OECD from 1973. Prior to that date, the
OECD series is constant, so we use the same oil price series as in Ferson and Harvey (1993a,b) prior to
1973. This is the posted West Texas Intermediate price from 1969-1973. Since the West Texas price reflects
a different grade of oil than the Saudi light crude, the 1969-1973 data is grossed down by a scale factor, based
on the average price levels over the 1974-1976 period. The GlO FX return is the return on holding a
portfolio of currencies of the 010 countries (plus Switzerland) in excess of the 30-day Eurodollar rate. Thc
currency return is the percentage change in the spot exchange rate plus the local currency, 30-day Eurodeposit
rate. The portfolio weights are based on a one-year lag of a five-year moving average of trade sector
weights. The numerator of the weight is the sum of the imports plus exports and the denominator is the sum
over the countries, of the imports plus exports of each countzy, measured in a common currency (U.S.
dollars). We use a five-year moving average of these weights, lagged by one year to insure they are
predetermined, public information. Further details of the index construction arc presented in Harvey (1993b),
who compares this measure with the Federal Reserve series of GlO Exchange rate changes that was uscd by
Ferson and Harvey (1993a,b). He finds that the correlation of the Iwo series is in excess of 0.9.

                                                          Ferson and Harvcy

                                 FOOTNOTES:

1. To the extent that such effects are concentrated in smaller shares, we may
understate their importance by using the MSCI indexes, which are heavily
weighted towards the larger and more liquid issues.

2. We use the long rate and the spread because their correlation is much
lower than the correlation of the short rate and the spread or the short rate
and the long rate. While the long rates are highly persistent, Appendix Table
1 shows that the sample autocorrelations damp out at longer lags.
3. These are based on the 1976.1-93.1 period shown in Table 1. When we
begin the samples in 1970.1 when available, the R2 of the relation between
average returns and the standard deviatio.n of the price-to-book ratio increases
to 25.7%.
4. Starting the sample in 1970.1 when available, the slope is 0.35 (standard
error=0.23) and the R2 is .107.
5. The GDP and inflation variables are lagged 15 months in these regressions
to account for publication lag, and the interest rates are lagged one month.
The industry structure variables are not predetermined, since they are
estimated using regressions over the full sample period. However, they are
constrained to be constant over time, which limits their predictive ability. We
should not expect significant bias from including these measures, but we
believe that future research should use alternative measures of industry
structure which are predetermined.
6. The maximum correlation and zero correlation condition with the other
attributes is imposed only in a cross-sectional sense, and need not hold over
time [See Shanken and Weinstein (1990) or Ferson and Harvey (1991)].
7.   The slope of the average relation, equal to 3.9, is not identical to
.o05*120060 in Table 1, because the cross-sectional regressions for different
months use different numbers of countries in Table 1.
8.  Joint tests across the countries are complicated by the fact that the
regressions for different countries use different sample periods. This also
reduces the dependence across the separate regressions.
9. Ferson and Harvey motivated their assumption that the global risk premia
depend only on world information variables by appealing to market
integration. But they pointed out that their distinction between world and
local market information variables was somewhat arbitrary. Expected risk
                                            35

premia may depend on the collection of the country attributes, as well as
other public information variables, even in integrated equity markets.
10. Mimicking portfolios are defined as portfolios that may be substituted for
the factors in a factor model regression, to measure the betas, and whose
expected excess returns are the risk premiums. See Huberman, Kandel and
Stambaugh (1987), or Lehmann and Modest (1988).
 11. Some informal intuition for the impact of this restriction is suggestd by
 Ferson and Harvey (1993a). Assume that E(r1,1 I1) is a function f(A'1,Y,),
where Y1 is the remaining public information, given A1. Dropping the
subscripts, consider an example where there is a single factor (K=1), where
/3, x, A', and Y are scalars, and where A' is uncorrelated with Y. Writing
f(A',Y)=13(A',Y)X(A',Y) and taking a first order Taylor series about the
means, we have:

Var(f)     [X(.)a/3/aA' +   13(.)axJaA'12    Var(A') +         [X(.)a$/aY     13(.)axlaY]2
Var(Y),
where X(.) and /3(.) are evaluated at the means. The first term captures the
contribution of the fundamental attributes to the variance of country i's
expected return, and the second term captures the contribution of the
remaining public information. The assumption that the betas depend only on
the local market information implies that a/3/8 = 0 in the second term. By
setting aI3/o=0, we are ignoring what should be the smaller of the
coefficients on the variance in the second term. This is because the square of
an average risk premium is a small number, compared with the square of an
average beta.
12.       We also     combined       the         alternative    hypotheses,    modelling
a1=a1o+C1'Z1+D1'A',. The impressions from these tests are similar to the
results reported below.
13. We repeated the tests in table 4, where the dividend-to-price ratio is
replaced by the price-to-cash flow ratio. The results are generally similar.
which shows some robustness of the results to the precise specification of the
fundamental attributes.

14. Harvey (1991) also conducted joint tests across the countries and did nor
reject that the average pricing errors are zero. Such joint tests would be
complicated here because the sample periods for the countries are different.

The mimicking portfolio returns, y, are based on cross-sectional regressions of country returns on three lagged
attributes: dividend yield, country per capita GD? to OECD GD?. and the long-term interest rate GD? to OECD
is the ratio of per capita annual GD? calculated in U.S. dollars for country to per capita annual OECD calculated
in U.S. dollars. In the cross-.ectioiial regressions from January 1975—January 1977, there are 14 countries (Austria.
Finland, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland are excluded). From February 1977-February 1978,
there are 16 countries in the regessions (Finland, Italy, Ireland and New Zealand Spain are excluded). From March
1978—April 1984, there are 17 countries in the regessions
                                                              (Finland, Italy, Ireland and New Zealand are excluded).
From May 1984—January 1988, there are 18 countries (Finland, Ireland and New Zealand are excluded). From
February 1988—May 1990, there are 20 countries (Ireland is excluded). All 21 countries are used from June 1990.
The cross-sectional slope coefficienta are the mimicking portfolio returns. Time-series correlations are reported with
five world risk factors: the exc return on the MSCI world market return, the excess return on a portfolio of
currency investments in 10 countries ieee Harvey (1993) for details of the construction of this variable], the excess
return to holding crude oil, growth in OECD industrial production and the rate of change in OECD inflation

A model is estimated with the world risk factor(s) and the product of the world risk factor(s) and the lagged country attributes The
first risk factor is the excess return on the MSCI world market portfolio. The second risk factor is the excess return on holding a
trade-weighted portfolio oF 10 countries currencies invested in local eurodeposits. Three exclusion tests are presented (I) exclude an
intercept. (2) exclude the lagged world information [the lagged MSCI world return, the lagged change in a portfolio of 10 currency
returns, the lagged MSCI world dividend yield, the lagged spread between the 90-day and 30-day Eurr,dollar rates (based average
daily rates) and the 30-day Eurodollar rate (quote last day of previous month)], (3) exclude the lagged country attributes (dividend
yield, ratio of CDI' to OECD GDP and long-term interest rates].
