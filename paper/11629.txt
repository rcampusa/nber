Hours Worked: Long-Run Trends

                                           ABSTRACT


For 200 years the average number of hours worked per worker declined, both in the market place
and at home. Technological progress is the engine of such transformation. Three mechanisms are
stressed:
(i) The rise in real wages and its corresponding wealth effect;
(ii) The enhanced value of time off from work, due to the advent of time-using leisure goods;
(iii) The reduced need for housework, due to the introduction of time-saving appliances.
These mechanisms are incorporated into a model of household production. The notion of
Edgeworth-Pareto complementarity/substitutability is key to the analysis. Numerical examples link
theory and data.

1     Facts

Over the course of the last century there was a precipitous drop in the average length of

the workweek, both in the marketplace and at home. In 1830 the average workweek in

the market place was 70 hours. This had plunged to just 41 hours by 2002. At the same

time there was a 9-fold gain in real wages. Figure 1 shows the descent in the length of the

market workweek and the leap forward in real wages. Likewise, the amount of time spent

on housework has dropped. A famous study of Middletown, Indiana, documented in 1924

that 87 percent of housewives spent more than 4 hours per day on housework –see Figure

2. None spent less than 1 hour. By 1999 only 14 percent toiled more than 4 hours per day

in the home, while 33 percent spent less than 1 hour.

    This decline in hours worked, both in the market and home, was met by a rise in leisure.

One measure of the increase in leisure is the uptrend in the share of personal consumption

expenditure spent on recreation. This rose from 3 percent in 1900 to 8.5 percent in 2001, as

Figure 3 illustrates. Additionally, the amount of time that a person needs to work in order

to buy the goods used in leisure has fallen by at least 2.2 percent a year –real wages grew

at an annual rate of 1.65 percent over the 1901 to 1988 period. This price decline neglects

the fact that many new forms of leisure goods have become available over time, or that old

forms have gotten better. As the workweek –or the time spent on work both in the market

and at home –was dropping, more and more women were entering into the market place to

work. This may seem a little paradoxical. Only 4 percent of married women worked in 1890

as compared with 49 percent in 1980 –again, see Figure 2.

    What can explain these facts? The answer is nothing mysterious: technological progress.

Three channels of e¤ect will be stressed here. First, technological progress increases wages.

On the one hand, an increase in real wages should motivate more work e¤ort since the price

of consumption goods in terms of forgone leisure has fallen. On the other hand, for a given

level of work e¤ort a rise in wages implies that individuals are wealthier. People may desire

to use some of this increase in living standards to enjoy more leisure. Second, the value

of not working has also risen due to the advent of many new leisure goods. Leisure goods

by their very nature are time using. Think about the impact of the following products:

radio, 1919; monopoly, 1934; television, 1947; videocassette recorder, 1979; Nintendo and

Trivial Pursuit, 1984. Third, other types of new household goods have reduced the need for

housework. These household goods are time saving. Examples are: electric stove, 1900; iron,

1908; frozen food, 1930; clothes dryer, 1937; Tupperware, 1947; dishwasher, 1959; disposable

diaper (Pampers), 1961; microwave oven, 1971; food processor, 1975. Some goods can be

both time using or time saving depending on the context: the telephone, 1876; IBM PC,

1984. A model will now be developed to analyze the channels through which technological

progress can a¤ect hours worked in the market and time spent at home.




2     Analysis

Setup.– Let tastes be represented by


                      U (c) + V (n); with U1 , V1 > 0 and U11 ; V11 < 0.



                                              4
Here the utility functions U and V are taken to have the standard properties, while c and

n represent the consumption of a market and nonmarket good. Now, suppose that the

nonmarket good is produced in line with the constant-returns-to-scale production function

                                   l
                  n = H(l; d) = dH( ; 1); with H1 , H2 > 0 and H11 , H22 < 0
                                   d

where H has standard properties, d represents purchased household inputs, and l is time

spent in household production. The idea that nonmarket goods are produced by inputs of

time and goods, just as are market ones, was introduced in classic work on household pro-

duction theory by Becker (1965) and Reid (1934). Assume for simplicity that there is some

indivisibility associated with d. The household must use the quantity d = . [This assump-

tion is innocuous. Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorukoglu (2005, Section 6) and Vandenbroucke

(2005) illustrate how it can easily be relaxed.] This …xed quantity of the household input

sells at the price q, which is measured in terms of time. Last, an individual has one unit of

time that he can divide between working in the market or using at home. The market wage

rate is w.

   Now, de…ne the function
                                                   l
                                   X(l; d) = V (dH( ; 1)):
                                                   d

Household time, l, and purchased household inputs, d, will be described as Edgeworth-Pareto

complements in utility when X12 > 0 and substitutes when X12 < 0 – cf., Pareto (1971,

Eq. 63 and 64). When l and d are Edgeworth-Pareto complements in utility an increase in

d raises the marginal utility from l, or X1 , and likewise more l increases the marginal utility

from d, or X2 .

                                               5
   The individual’s optimization problem is


                         W (w; q) = maxfU (w(1           l)   qw) + X(l; )g:
                                         l



The upshot of this maximization problem is summarized by the …rst- and second-order

conditions written below.


                       wU1 (w(1     l)       qw) = X1 (l; )
                                                             l         l
                                                    = V1 ( H( ; 1))H1 ( ; 1);               (1)


and

                                              w2 U11 + X11 < 0:

The lefthand side of (1) represents the marginal cost of an extra unit of time spent at home.

An extra unit of time spent at home results in a loss of wages in the amount w. This is

worth wU1 (w(1    l)     qw) in terms of forgone utility. The righthand side gives the marginal

bene…t derived from spending an extra unit of time at home, X1 (l; ). The solution for l is

portrayed in Figure 4.



   E¤ect of Technological Progress in Household Goods.– Now, suppose that there is tech-

nological progress in household goods. In particular, let this be manifested by an increase

in the amount of home inputs, , that can be purchased for q forgone units of time. How

will this a¤ect the amount of time spent spent at home? It is easy to calculate that

                                  dl          X12

                   Figure 4: The determination of time spent at home, l


Therefore, time spent on household activities will rise or fall depending on whether time

and goods are complements or substitutes in household utility. When time and purchased

inputs are complements in utility an extra unit of d raises the worth of staying at home. So,

time spent at home should rise. Leisure goods, such as the television, fall into this category.

Such goods have contributed to the decline in work (either in the market place or at home)

by both men and women. A detailed account of how this mechanism can contribute to the

long-run decline in hours worked is provided by Vandenbroucke (2005). This case is shown

in Figure 4 by a rightward shift in the marginal bene…t curve from MB to MB”, resulting in

time spent at home rising from l to l00 . The opposite is true when they are substitutes. This

is portrayed in the …gure by the leftward movement in the marginal bene…t curve from MB



                                              7
to MB’. Time-saving household appliances, such as the microwave oven, are an example of

this case. Such products have reduced the need for housework and have contributed to the

increase in market work by women. Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorukoglu (2005) show how

the increase in female labor-force participation can be explained along these lines. Therefore,

technological advance in household products is consistent with the long-run decline in the

market workweek (leisure goods) and the rise in female labor-force participation (time-saving

appliances and goods).

   When are two goods Edgeworth-Pareto complements or substitutes? From (1) the mar-

ginal bene…t of time spent at home, X1 (l; ), is the product of two terms, the marginal

utility from nonmarket goods, V1 ( H( l ; 1)), and the marginal product of household time,

H1 ( l ; 1). The marginal utility of housework is decreasing in , while the marginal product

of household time is increasing in it. Thus, the net e¤ect of an increase in            will depend

upon whether the former falls faster with an increase in          than the latter rises. Speci…cally,

                                                             2
                         X12 =   V11 H12 (l= )   V1 H11 l=       + V11 HH1 ;


so that
                                     (l= )H11        nV11 (H H1 l= )
                       X12 Q 0 as             Q                      :
                                       H1            V1      n

In other words, whether or not X12 Q 0 depends on whether the elasticity of the marginal

product of labor with respect to the time-goods ratio,            (l= )H11 =H1 , is smaller or larger

than the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to the home good,           nV11 =V1 , weighted

by share of purchased inputs in output, (H           H1 l= )=n. Thus, for example, l and         are

likely to be substitutes in utility when: (i) the responsiveness of the marginal product of l=

                                                 8
is small with respect to a change in ; (ii) the marginal utility of home goods declines fast

with more consumption; (iii) when purchased inputs are important in production.


Example 1 (The impact of leisure goods on hours worked) Let U (c) =                                      ln (c) and V (n) =

(1     ) ln (n) : Represent the household technology by the constant-elasticity-of-substitution

production function H (l; ) = (          + l )1= . The household’s budget constraint is c = w (1                   l      q) :

Given this setup, the …rst-order condition (1) can be rewritten as

                                                     1       l q       1
                                                 =               l         :                                     (2)
                                          1                  +l

Observe that a change in wages, w, does not a¤ect hours worked in the market, 1                              l. The

length of the workweek in the 1890s was about 42 percent above that of the 1990s. In 1995

the typical worker spent about 1/3 of his available time working in the market. So, set

1    l1995 = 1=3 and 1         l1895 = 1:42     1=3. Let       1895   = 0:1. The share of leisure goods in

expenditures, s, is given by s = q= (1         l). Costa (1997) reports that this share was 2 percent

in the 1890s, and 6 percent in the 1990s. Thus, the time-price q is given by qt = (1                          lt ) st ,

for t = 1895 and 1995. Finally, pick             =       0:6, which implies an elasticity of substitution

between leisure time and leisure goods of 0.63: Proceed now in two steps. First, use (2) to

back out the value of         that is consistent with l = l1895 , q = q1895 , and          =   1895 :   This results

in    = 0:19. Second, use this equation to …nd the value of                    1995   that is in agreement with

l = l1995 , q = q1995 , and     = 0:19. This leads to        1995   = 0:69. Voilà, an example has now been

constructed where the change in market hours matches exactly the corresponding …gure in

the U.S. data. Additionally, the share of expenditure spent on leisure is in line with the data.

In physical units, households in 1995 had 6.90 times more leisure goods than did households

                                                         9
in 1895. This number depends upon the elasticity of substitution between leisure time and

leisure goods. The higher the degree of complementarity (or the smaller is ), the less is the

required increase in .


Remark 1 An example can be constructed in very similar fashion to show that labor-saving

household inputs (or the case of Edgeworth-Pareto substitutes) can account for the rise in

female labor-force participation. The interested reader is referred to Greenwood and Seshadri

(2005, Example 5, p. 1256).


   E¤ect of an Increase in Wages.– How will rising wages impact on hours worked? It’s

easy to calculate that

                dl   U1 + w(1         l   q)U11
                   =                              R 0 as U1 Q   w(1   l   q)U11 :
                dw

On the one hand, a boost in wages increases the opportunity cost of staying at home. This

should lower time spent at home and is represented by the substitution e¤ect term, U1 = < 0.

On the other hand, higher wages make the individual wealthier. The individual should use

some of this extra wealth to increase his time spent at home. This income e¤ect is shown

by the term, w(1    l     q)U11 =   > 0. Thus, time spent at home can rise or fall with wages

depending on whether the income e¤ect dominates the substitution e¤ect. In general, then,

anything can happen, as the following two specialized cases for U make clear.


  1. Let U (c) = ln c, the macroeconomist’s favorite utility function. Here, U1 = 1=c and

     w(1    l   q)U11 =     1=c. Therefore, the substitution and income e¤ects from a change


                                                  10
     in wages exactly cancel out. Long-run changes in wages have no impact on hours

     worked, 1   l.


  2. Suppose U (c) = ln(c   c), where c > 0 is some subsistence level of consumption. Now,

     U1 = 1=(c c) and w(1 l q)U11 =       c=(c c)2 . Therefore, dl=dw =     c= (c   c)2      >

     0. Consequently, rising wages lead to a fall in hours worked, 1      l. The intuition is

     simple. At low levels of wages an individual must work hard to meet his subsistence

     level of consumption, c. Covering the subsistence level of consumption becomes easier

     as wages rise and this allows an individual to let up on his work e¤ort. Thus, this

     form for the utility function is in accord with a long-run decline in hours worked.

     Additionally, it is consistent with the observation reported in Vandenbroucke (2005)

     that unskilled workers labored longer hours in 1900 than did skilled ones, while today

     they work about the same.


   Can an increase in wages explain the decline in the workweek? The answer is yes, as the

following example makes clear.


Example 2 (The impact of rising wages on hours worked) Let U (c) = ln (c                  c) and

V (n) = n: Represent the household technology by H (l; d) = l. Equation (1) appears as

                                              1       c
                                     1   l=       +     ;                                   (3)
                                                      w

which gives a very simple solution for hours worked, 1      l. Let the time period for this

example be 1830 to 1990. The real wage rate in 1990 (actually in 1988) was 9:15 times the

wage rate of 1830 – Williamson(1995). So, set w1830 = 1 and w1990 = 9:15. Following the

                                           11
discussion in Example 1, …x hours worked in 1830 and 1990, or 1             l1830 and 1   l1990 , using

the equations 1     l1830 = 1:65    1=3 and 1      l1990 = 1=3. Employing these restrictions in

conjunction with (3) leads to a system of two equations in the two unknown parameters

and c. Speci…cally, one obtains

                                                   1         c
                                     1   l1830 =       +           ;
                                                           w1830

and
                                                   1         c
                                     1   l1990 =       +           :
                                                           w1990

Solving yields    = 3:26 and c = 0:24. The subsistence level of consumption, c, amounts to

44 percent of consumption in 1830, and 8 percent in 1990.


   The last century saw the advent of labor income taxation. So, perhaps the previous

example should have focused on the rise of after-tax wages. This is easy to do.


Example 3 (The e¤ect of higher labor income taxation on hours worked) Take the

setup from Example 2 with one modi…cation, to wit the introduction of labor income taxation.

In particular, suppose that wages are taxed at rate . A fraction            of the revenue the gov-

ernment receives is rebated back to the worker via lump-sum transfer payments, t. The rest

goes into worthless government spending on goods and services, g –or equivalently one could

assume that it enters into the consumer’s utility function in a separable manner. Hence, the

worker’s budget constraint reads c = (1         )w(1       l) + t, while the government’s appears as

g + t = w(1       l). The …rst-order condition for this setting is

                                          (1     )w
                                                    = :
                                            c    c

                                                 12
Combining the worker’s and government’s budget constraints yields c = [1                             (1    )]w(1 l).

Using this fact in the above …rst-order condition results in

                                                   1                          c
                                  1     l=                         +                        :                     (4)
                                              [1       (1     )]       w[1     (1      )]

Observe that when c = 0 and               = 0 (no rebate) an increase in the tax rate will have no impact

on hours worked, because the substitution and income e¤ects exactly cancel out. When c = 0

and       = 1 (full rebate) higher taxes will dissuade hours worked since only the substitution

e¤ect is operational. Alternatively, if c > 0 and                      = 0 (no rebate) then it transpires that a

rise in taxes will cause hours worked to move up. Here the negative income e¤ect from the

increase in government spending, which will result in more hours being worked, outweighs the

substitution e¤ect. Therefore, in general the e¤ect of labor income taxation on hours worked

is ambiguous. The result will depend on how the government uses the revenue it raises, and

the functional forms and parameter values used for tastes and technology.

Take labor income taxes to be 0 in 1830. Assume a rate of 30 percent in 1990, in line

with numbers reported by Mulligan (2002). Fix                          = 0:33, its value for 1990 as measured

by the National Income Product Accounts. By following the procedure in Example 2, it can

be deduced that the observed fall in hours worked is obtained when                              = 2:86 and c = 0:20.

Furthermore, it can be inferred that the rise in wages accounts for 93 percent of the fall,

while the increase in taxes explains the remaining 7 percent.1

All of the above examples are intended solely only as illustrations of some secular forces

that potentially in‡uence hours worked. A quantitative assessment of the impact that taxes

have on hours worked will depend upon the particulars of the model used. A serious study

is conducted in Prescott (2004).

   The real world seems to have had two con‡icting trends: a decline in market work, and

a rise in female-labor participation. A more general model could be consistent with both

of these facts. To see this, imagine a framework with two types of labor, male and female.

There is a division of labor in the home. Men work primarily in the market. Females do

housework and, time permitting, market work. Households purchase both time-saving and

time-using household inputs. Female labor-force participation would rise as labor-saving

goods economized on the amount of housework that had to be done. Simultaneously, the

market workweek could decline, either due to the introduction of leisure goods or an income

e¤ect associated with a rise in wages. The value of leisure would rise for both men and

women. Interestingly, Aguiar and Hurst (2005) document a dramatic increase in leisure

for both men and women over the period 1965 to 2003. They construct various measures of

leisure. They all showed a gain over the period under study. The narrowest de…nition rose by

6.4 hours a week for men and 3.8 hours for women, after adjusting for demographic changes

in the population. This measure included time spent on activities such as entertainment,

recreation, and relaxing. Their preferred measure increased by 7.9 hours a week for men

and 6.0 hours for women. This broader de…nition also included activities such as eating,
The …rst term in brackets is a measure of the change in hours worked, (1 l0 ) (1 l), due to the shift in
wages from w to w0 , while the second term gives the change due to a movement in taxes from to 0 .

sleeping, personal care, and child care. Another manifestation of the rise in the value of

leisure is the increase in the fraction of life spent retired. Kopecky (2005) relays that a

twenty-year-old man in 1850 could expect to spend about 6 percent of his life retired, while

one in 1990 should enjoy about 30 percent of his life in retirement. She shows how the trend

toward enjoying more retirement can be analyzed in much the same way as the decline in

the workweek.


3    Data Sources

     Figure 1: The average weekly hours data for 1830 to 1880 comes from Whaples (1990,

     Table 2.1). The source for the period 1890 to 1970 is the Historical Statistics of the

     United States: Colonial Times to 197 0 (Series D765 and D803). The data for rest of

     the sample, or the years 1970 to 2002 , is taken from the Statistical Abstract of the

     United States. The wage data is provided in Williamson (1995, Table A1.1).


     Figure 2: The source for time spent on housework in Middletown is Caplow, Hicks and

     Wattenberg (2001, p. 37). The numbers for female labor-force participation are taken

     from the Statistical Abstract of the United States.


     Figure 3: Recreation’s share of expenditure for the years 1900 to 1929 is contained in

     Lebergott (1996, Table A.1). After 1929 the data is taken from the Statistical Abstract

     of the United States. The source for the time price of leisure goods is Kopecky (2005).
