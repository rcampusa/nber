                                  ABSTRACT



         We investigate how labor and investment demand at the firm level

(gross as well as net and replacement investment separately) differs in

French, German and U.S. manufacturing, and has changed since the 1974—75

crisis. We use three consistent panel data samples of large firms for

1970—79, and rely on simple models of the accelerator.-profits type. We find

that the accelerator effects and the profits effects did not vary much

between 1970—73 and 1976—79, and were quite comparable in the three countries,

the former being of a more permanent nature and the latter more transitory.

To a large extent these effects account for the important changes and

differences in labor and investment demand between the two subperiods and

across the three countries.

I — INTRODUCTION


       The first oil shock at the end of 1913 marked a considerable break in the

economic evolution of France, Germany, the tJnited States and other industrial

countries. For the first time in thirty years ("Les trente glorieuses"),

aggregate industrial production dropped: this happened in 19114 in Germany and

the United States, in 1915 in France. Since then the economic situation has not

recovered to what it was before; most industrial countries have experienced

weaker growth, with a slowdown in capital accumulation and rising unemployment.

Many macroeconomic studies, a number of them in a comparative perspective, have

tried to analyse and understand the various issues at stake. The present work

is part of an effort to complement and enrich these studies, by considering some

of the same issues at the microeconomic level, i.e., using firm panel data

instead of aggregate time series.1

       Our purpose here is to investigate whether the behavior of firms in

regard to labor demand and investment demand (gross investment as well as net

investment and replacement investment separately) is similar in the French,

German and U.S. manufacturing industries, if not how it differs, and whether it

has been stable before and after the 197141975 crisis, if not how it changed.

To accomplish this we had to construct consistent and comparable data sets for

French, German and U.S. manufacturing firms over a long enough period

(1966—1919). In view of the formidable complexities of the formal modelling of

factor demand decisions, as well as the lack of good information on

theoretically relevant variables, or even that of acceptable proxies (especially
                                      —2--



as regards expected factor prices at the firm level), we resorted to simple

models of the basic accelerator profits type. Further, of the many

possibilities in structuring the data and specifying the estimated equations,

we have chosen two: year to year growth rates and average growth rates. We have

also kept the seemingly necessary minimum number of lags in the regressions. We

thus bypass some of the difficulties of the econometrics of panel data.

      It is necessary to define the scope and meaning of our study by giving

some explanations of these matters, i.e., sample construction and the

measurement of variables, choice of model and interpretation, specification and

estimation considerations. We shall do so in the first part of the paper. We

shall then present the empirical results and comment on them in the second part.

We concentrate on the estimates of the accelerator profits equations, but we

shall also report on some attempts to use additional explanatory variables on

average labor costs and interest expenses. We end with a few brief remarks.

II   - GENERAL FRAMEWORK AND BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS


2.1. On Samples and Variables


        We have constructed our samples of firms for all three countries along

the same lines. However, due to the different characteristics of the data banks

from which we drew these samples (range of firms, extent of missing observations

or large errors, proportions of firms entering, leaving or going through a major

merger), we cannot consider them as truly representative in any definite sense.2

They consist of 307 French firms, 1145 German firms and 422 U.S. firms, for which

we have complete data for our main variables over the l4 years 1966—79.

Although these firms are only a small cohort out of the total number of

manufacturing firms, they are relatively large companies, and they account for

about I   and   8   per   cent, 9   to   10 per cent and as much as 50 per cent of total

employment in French, German and U.S. manufacturing industries respectively.

Their average sizes reflect the well known fact that U.S. firms are generally

much larger than their French and also German counterparts: the geometric means

of the number of employees being about 1000 in the U.S. sample as against 700

and 11400 in the French and German samples, respectively. Because our

regressions     involve three lags, our study period is in fact restricted to the 10
years 1970—79, i.e., four years before and four years after the l9714_75           break.

        We have defined and measured our basic variables as similarly as possible

for the three samples. With the major exception of the physical capital stock

variable in the case of the German sample, they can be considered as closely

comparable. Labor L is measured by the total number of employees (average number
over the year). Both for France and the U.S., gross capital stock C is taken as

the gross book value of fixed assets following an adjustment for inflation

which involves a rough estimate of average age.3 For Germany, such a measure is

not possible and we constructed C as the sum of past investment expenditures

based on a fixed average service life of i6 years. This required a

retrapolation of the investment series for our firms before 1961 on the basis of

the corresponding industry growth     rates)   Gross investment I is measured as the

total capital expenditures in plant and equipment deflated by the industry

investment price indices. However, these investment numbers happened to be

generally missing in the accounts of our German firms before 19714, and we had to

compute them as the yearly change in the net book value of fixed assets plus the

depreciation charges in the same year. Thereby we neglect corrections for

acquisitions, disacquisitions or revaluations of assets. But though our

investment variables are not strictly comparable for Germany, the problem in

this case would seem to be less severe than as regards the capital stock

measure. Output Q is defined as sales deflated by the available industry output

price indices.5 Profits P are taken as gross operating income adjusted for

inventory changes, i.e., production less total cost of goods sold or value added

less labor cost.6

        In order to assess the possible influence of the inconsistency between

our capital and investment measures for our three samples we also estimated the

investment series for France and the U.S. in the same way as for Germany, and

the   capital stock figures for all three using the permanent inventory method
with the standard assumption of   a   constant rate of replacement.7   The   results we
                                         -.5 —




obtain   with these alternative measures are not on the whole too different from

the ones we find with our main measures, and they lead essentially to the same

conclusions. This is apparent in the estimates we present in the Appendix I.

         The actual variables that we use are the rates of growth of labor,

capital and output: DL, DC and DQ (computed as the first differences in Log L,

Log C and Log Q, respectively), the ratio of gross investment to the capital I/C

and the profit rate PR (computed as P/CV where CV is the value of the capital in

current prices, i.e., the value in constant prices C multiplied by the

appropriate investment prices indices). The two variables I/C and DC can also

be termed the gross investment rate and the net investment rate, respectively,

and their difference (I/c — DC) measures the proportion of capital that has been

retired or scrapped, that is the ratio of replacement (and modernization)

investment to capital, or the replacement rate B/C for short.8       This variable

is of course bound to suffer from all measurement errors affecting both our

gross and net investment rates I/C and DC, and from the discrepancies between

the two. We can expect however, that in the case of the French and the U.S.

samples it conveys some useful and genuine information about the true

replacement investment. Since so little is known about replacement ("The other

half of gross investment" Feldstein and Foot, 1911), it seemed interesting to

consider it explicitly in our investigations of these two samples. In the case

of the German sample, by virtue of our    construction   of the capital stock

measure, the replacement rate can only reflect (after some smoothing) the

proportion of investment expenditures 16 years ago to the capital stock at

present. However, we also consider this rate in that case so as to get a better

feeling of how to judge the results for the other two samples.

2.2.   On Resorting to the Accelerator Profits Model

        As M. Feldstein (1982) put it in a somewhat provocative way "the

investment process is far too complex for any single model to be convincing,...

and the applied econometrician, like the theorist, soon discovers from

experience that a useful model is not one that is "true" or "realistic" but one

that is parsimonious, plausible and informative". We shall take up such a stand

in this study — which is not so humble an attitude as Feldstein seems to suggest

but already a quite ambitious claim.

        At   least four factors should a priori enter, and be tested as important
determinants,    in a behavioral model of   the investment demand and (or) the labor
demand by firms: expected output demand, expected profitability, the relative

expected cost of labor and capital, and, to the extent that capital markets are

imperfect, the actual current and past profits (or the financial liquidity of the

firm). Except for the last one, these factors are generally unobservable.

Moreover the way they should intervene in the model equations should

specifically depend on the form of the production function (for example whether

it is Cobb—Douglas or CES, or more importantly "putty—putty" or 'putty—clay"),

the form of the costs of adjustment functions (or that of other relevant

constraints), and the nature of the firms' objectives, expectations and market

environment.

       Being aware of such basic complexities and being bounded by the

limitations of our data, as well as relying on the empirical findings of

numerous econometric studies of factor demand, we had recourse to an accelerator

profits type of model. As is customary, we have adopted a growth rate
                                              —1--



formulation,      i.e., investment and labor change equations rather than capital

stock and labor ones. This formulation can be advocated on various grounds. Tt

provides equations which are conveniently linear both in the current and past

changes of sales and in the current and past levels of profits. It can be

viewed as a way to deal simply with the heteroscedasticity associated with the

large differences in size of firms. It is also related to other more profound

econometric issues of specification and estimation, as we shall show below.

       The relations that we choose to estimate are thus of the following form:

                                              £
                                                  1              2
       DL or DC or I/C or R/C =          +            a DQ +         b.PR
                                    c0
                                             j=O               j=O

In fact we used industry dummies (16 of them for each country) instead of a

simple constant c0.9 Experiments with various lags have also shown that besides

the current values three lags for sales growth rates (2. = 3) and one for profit

rates (L2 = 1) were sufficient and did not oblige us to shorten our study

period too much. This is documented in the Appendix II, in which we provide the

estimates of the total accelerator effects when using no lags, three and five

lags and geometrically decreasing lags in the autoregressive form. For reasons

to be given below we have at the same time estimated "long run versions" of our

regressions with no lag and using average growth rates instead of the year to

year ones:

             or     or Tf7   or   = c    +   (a )• + (Eb )
       The precise motivation and interpretation of the accelerator profits

model need not be explained here at length. A detailed and very sensible
                                      —8—




account can he found in R. Eisner's 1978 book, which recapitulates his
investigations pursued during nny years on the individual firm data of

McGraw—Hill capital expenditure surveysJ0 Although it properly concerns gross

investment or net investment, to a large extent the same line of arguments

applies to labor demand. We would expect, however, the profits effects to be

smaller for labor than for investment, and the accelerator effects more rapid.

The accelerator profits model can also be extended to the replacement investment

demand, but in this case one would expect much smaller accelerator effects or

even "decelerator effects".

       Investment and labor hiring decisions are essentially forward—looking and

depend on expectations. The more irreversible these decisions are (i.e., the

more "fixed" capital and labor factors or the higher their costs of adjustment),

the longer the time horizon of the relevant expectations. Thus only the sales

increases which firms perceive as long term or permanent will lead to net

investment and hiring, while short term or transitory changes will he generally

met by changing the hours of work and the utilization of existing capital. In

that respect perhaps the most drastic simplification of the accelerator model

(and of most other factor demand models as well) is the substitution of current

or past variables for anticipated future ones. It reflects the underlying

investment and labor demand behaviors to the extent that firms view their

current and past changes in sales as permanent. The proper meaning of the model

is thus related to the validity and stability of the relationship between

changes, or revisions, in expected output demand and observed current and past

changes in sales, as much as it is to that of other behavioral assumptions and
                                      —9—


the form of the production function. The accelerator model is just a convenient

short cut through an intricate system of relations and conditions. It should

be gauged by its empirical significance and robustness and not by its appeal or

status. When looking at our estimates for the different country samples and

subperiods, we shall be at best comparing an overall average outcome of the

processes by which firms have been forming their anticipations and on that basis

have reached their investment and employment decisions.

      Within such a general interpretation of the accelerator model, the

appreciation of the respective roles of sales changes and profits warrants some

discussion. It might seem intuitively appealing to take the sales change

variables as a proxy for changes in expected demand, and the profit variables as

a proxy for expected profitability as well as an indicator of the financial

liquidity of the firm. The finding that only current and one—year lagged past

profits come out to be statistically significant (as well as the fact that their

estimated coefficients are larger in the regressions on the year to year growth

rates than in the ones on the average growth rates) mainly supports the

financial liquidity interpretation. On the other hand, it is plausible that

profits would also convey information about the future demand addressed to the

firm, and past sales changes information about its future profitability. To

make the interpretation more clear—cut (though controversial), we can break this

a priori symmetry by taking the view that all the relevant information about

future demand (at least that which is more specific to the firm) pertains to the

sales changes variables only, although all this information is not directly

channelled and is partly transmitted through profits. Accordingly, following
                                         —10—


Eisner's example, we will be justified in computing full or total accelerator

effects as the sum of the direct effects of sales changes and of the indirect

effects through profits. These total effects are the ones we would obtain if we

had a pure accelerator model, and this is a simple way in practice to compute

them (i.e., by omitting the profits variables and keeping only the sales changes

variables in the estimated regressions).


2.3. On Year to Year and Average Growth Rates Estimates

          Panel samples such as ours offer a number of possibilities for

structuring and handling the data, which lead to various types of estimators.

In the case of a standard linear regression model, if it is well specified,

these various estimators should all be consistent. Conversely, their

differences when significant imply some sort of specification errors, and this

can provide formal specification tests (see for example Hausman and Taylor,

1981). More interestingly, if one is ready to be specific about the kind of

misspecification occurring, these differences can be used to retrieve the

characteristics and orders of magnitude involved in such misspecification. For

instance, it is possible to assess the importance of correlated specific effects

(possibly due to the omission of unobserved firm characteristics in the model)

or that of random errors in variables, which are the two specification errors

usually   put forward. Comparing estimates for different structuririgs of data can
contribute to a richer understanding and knowledge of the model and the data, as
well   as to a better awareness of their limits.

        The most usual transformations applied to panel data (and the corres-

ponding least—squares estimates) can be roughly put into two groups depending on
                                           —11—


whether or not they remove the individual specific effect u. in an error

components model (where the overall error term e. is decomposed into two

independent terms u. +           the subscripts i and t standing for firm and year,

respectively). In general, when the original variables are in levels (or in

logs of levels or in the form of more or less structural or stable ratios), the

variability of the individual effect u is largely predominant, and the two

groups of transformations can be viewed as providing cross—sectional and time

series type estimates, respectively. The total estimates performed on the

untransformed variables y        and the hetr-ri—trm estimates performed on the
                            it

firm means y. belong typically to the first category. The within—firm estimates

relying on the deviations to ;he trm means                 ), the   first difference or

long—difference estimates using the year to year differences                      or

their average over a given period                            are the usual candidates

in the second category. When starting with a model in logarithms, which is our

case, first and long differences correspond to yearly and average growth rates,

respectively.

       The general view is to believe that the individual effect u1 is more

likely to be seriously correlated with the explanatory variables than the

disturbance w.t, and therefore that time—series type estimates would be the

better, less biased ones. Although this view may      be   controversial (see

Mairesse, 1918 and Griliches and Mairesse, l984), we shall go along with it

here.11 However, one of the important drawbacks of the time series estimates is

that they tend to be quite sensitive to random errors of measurement in the

variables. This is specially true of the first—difference estimates, but less
                                        —12—



so    for the long—difference estimates, inasmuch as they will average out over a

long period such errors. Long—difference estimates (and to a lesser degree

within estimates) have thus the specific advantage of reducing the errors in

variables   biases (see Griliches and Hausman, 19814).   Unfortunately, on the other

hand, taking long differences does not permit in practice     to estimate the lag

structure of the explanatory variables in a dynamic model     such as the

accelerator—profits   model. Unlike first differences (which are often quite
moderately   correlated) the long differences of lagged variables are bound to be
strongly collinear. Hence, the    estimates of the individual lagged coefficients
are   bound to be very imprecise and unstable,; furthermore, even relatively minor

errors of measurement in the variables would result in aggravating this problem.

In fact, we can only expect to estimate well the sum of the coefficients.

Since the current values act as excellent proxies of the lagged values, there is

not much sense in specifying lags in a model to be estimated on long

differences. In the version without lags the estimated coefficient will be the

long—run coefficient, corresponding to the sum of the lagged—variables

coefficients in the model with lags. Similar considerations largely apply to

the within estimates, which are not better than the long differences estimates

in that respect; moreover, in short panels they will also suffer from

serial-correlation biases.

         In our context, the first and long difference estimates (i.e., the

estimates on yearly and average growth rates) can be given a more specific

interpretation, and this is a further reason to consider both types. By

comparing them, we can illustrate the distinction between permanent and
                                      —l 3—



transitory sales changes or profits, and the fact that firms in their labor and

investment decisions will typically respond much more strongly to permanent

sales changes than to transitory changes, and that conversely they will react

more markedly to transitory than to permanent profits. If we are willing to

accept some extreme simplifications, we can give a more definite meaning to

these notions and infer what are the orders of magnitudes involved. Trying to

make less stringent assumptions would lead us in fact to adopt a vector

autoregressive framework in the line of Mairesse and Siu (vAn extended

accelerator model of R&D and physical investment", 19R)4). We present a more

precise distinction between transitory and permanent effects in Appendix III.

III.   PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS

3.1. Looking at the Average Record


        Table 1 lists the means (in %) and standard deviations of our

main variables: the labor, capital and sales rates of growth (DL, DC, DQ) and

the gross investment, replacement and profit rates (I/c, R/C, PR). These are

given for the three samples, the overall period 1910—79, and the three

subperiods: 1970—73. 197)4—75 and 1976—79. We also give corresponding "macro"

figures for the growth rates of total employment and output (i.e., the aggregate

estimates for manufacturing in the three countries). For the convenience of

comparison, we have added the growth rates of labor productivity (DQ — DL)

implicit in these numbers for our samples and manufacturing as a whole.

        When looking at such averages computed from "micro" data, and in

particular    if   one brings them together with similar "macro"   figures,   one should

be quite aware of the many discrepancies that could arise from the selection of
the samples and the measurement of the variables. Among other things, computing

unweighted   rather than weighted averages, or using even close variants to adjust

variables —    for   example deflating them with different prices indices which may

be available for more or less disaggregated industrial breakdowns — can really

matter. It is our experience, however, that even in these cases when the

discrepancies on averages could be large, the second order characteristics

(standard deviations and correlations), especially if they concern relative

magnitudes (or logs), will not be significantly affected in general. Thus the

results of regression analyses, and the estimated elasticities of interest — such
                                            —15—


as the ones we will be considering next -      are   usually quite robust.'2

         Another difficulty —   but   a usual one this time — when comparing averages

of growth rates is that they may be very sensitive to the exact periods on which

they are computed (and particularly if it is not possible to choose beginning

year and end year occupying similar positions in the business cycle). Despite

these warnings of caution about averages, the general picture they provide in

Table 1 seems quite consistent, and would deserve a number of comments. We

shall limit them to a few observations, leaving to the interested reader to look

into more details.

         For   our three samples as well as for manufacturing as a whole in the
three countries, the two years 191)4—1915 mark a severe break. Employment and
output   dropped in absolute terms by as much as 10% for employment in Germany,

and 10% for output in the U.S. It is noteworthy that by dismissing workers to

such an extent Germany was able to maintain gains in labor productivity even in

these two years, unlike France and the U.S.

         Although the 197)4—75 crisis seems to have hit the three economies with

similar force, their relative situations before and after have changed a great

deal. Between 1910—73 and 1976—79, in both the French and German samples,

output growth has been slowing down strongly, net and gross investment have

dropped drastically and employment has started diminishing. The firms in the

U.S. sample on the contrary appear to have recovered completely: their

production and labor force have been growing even more rapidly. These trends

are confirmed by the aggregate numbers on output and employment for

manufacturing as a whole. However, it should be pointed out that the
                                       —i6—



deceleration   observed for France and Germany is much more marked in our samples

than in the aggregate, while conversely for the U.S. the acceleration is more

pronounced in the aggregate than in the sample. Such a discrepancy which is

strikingly similar for our three samples might be explained by a comparable

selection bias: by selecting firms which are in existence over a long period, we

necessarily exclude the new—corners which are plausibly more rapidly growing

firms; we also exclude firms growing through major mergers.

         It is also interesting to underline the comparable increase in the

replacement investment ratio between the two periods for our three samples.

As it is clear from the computation of this ratio in the German case, this

increase reflects the slowdown in the stock of capital; in the cases of France

and the U.S. it may also illustrate to a certain extent what is often said about

the shortening of capital service lives and the acceleration of obsolescence.

Last, the differences in the average levels of the rate of profits computed for

our three samples should be taken as very dubious, and particularly the much

lower rate in Germany. Such shortcoming does not preclude of course that these

measures should be good proxies for the true differences (between firms) and

changes (within firms) in the rates of profits for each sample separately.


3.2. Comparing the Accelerator and Profit Effects
     Between Countries and Periods
       Comparing our estimates (sales changes and profits coefficients) for the

four equations of interest (labor and capital growth rates, gross investment and

replacement rates), the two types of estimates (on yearly and average rates),

the   three country samples, and the two periods 1970—13 and 1976—19 (we shall
                                         —17—


leave aside 1975—76), involves indeed a lot of numbers. We shall try to go

through them in just about that order, looking at the differences first between

the two types of estimates, then between countries, last between periods. The

estimates of the two types are respectively given in Table 2 and 3 for the four

equations by three countries. Since, by and large, as we shall see, these esti-

mates do not change much from the first to the second period, they are only

given in full detail for the overall period 1970—79. The sums of sales changes

coefficients (or direct accelerator effects) and of the profits coefficients (or

profits effects) have been also computed in Table 2; they are directly com-

parable to the (unique) sales changes and profits coefficients in Table 3. In

addition, the total accelerator effects (obtained from running the same

regressions without the profits variables) are presented in the last lines of

Table 2 and 3. Both types of estimates of the direct and total accelerator

effects and profits effects are recorded in Table 4    for   the two periods 1970—73

and 1976—79 separately. Last, Table 5 highlights the contributions of our

models in explaining what are on average our labor and investment variables

during the two periods, and in explaining their average changes between these

two periods.


Permanent   Versus Transitory Effects
      Our first general observation on Tables 2     and 3 is that   the pattern of
differences    between our two types of estimates of the accelerator and profits

effects is always the same for the different equations across countries. With

only very few exceptions, the estimates of the accelerator effects on average
                                           —18-.



rates (i.e., long differences in logs over 10 years) are larger by about 20 to

50% than the estimates on yearly rates (i.e., first differences in logs). The

reverse situation is true for the profits effects: the average rates estimates

are   smaller in about the same proportions than the yearly rates estimates. The
same pattern of differences is also visible, but much less consistently so, in
Table   )4,   when we consider the corresponding estimates for the two periods (long

differences in logs over 14 years only and first differences in logs).

         Such a pervasive finding extends the similar results obtained by Eisner

(1918) and Oudiz (1978) for the gross investment equation on their respective

samples of U.S. and French firms. It illustrates clearly the importance of the

distinction between permanent and transitory effects. Firms tend to view their

actual sales changes as partly transitory and are cautious not to alter their

labor and investment demands in response to these transitory fluctuations. They

take their labor hiring and investment decisions on the basis of expectations of

their future output demand, and they form these expectations on the basis of

their past sales changes to the extent that they consider these changes

permanent. Granted the assumptions and simplifications indicated in the

Appendix III, it is possible to give more substance to such interpretation and

to retrieve tentative orders of magnitude by comparing the two types of

estimates. The weight of the transitory component (relative to that of the

permanent component) in the total variance of sales changes practically vanishes

when going form yearly rates to 10 years average rates (from roughly about 25%

in the three countries down to less than 5%). The finding of smaller estimates

of the accelerator effects on yearly rates than on average rates thus reflects
                                          —19—


to what extent the elasticity of firms own demand expectations is smaller in

response to transitory sales changes than in response to permanent ones.     The

"transitory   elasticity" could range from 0 to   0.20 and the "permanent

elasticity"   from 0.60 to 0.80 on   the basis of the orders of magnitudes found for

the labor and investment equations in the three countries (i.e., total

accelerator effects in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 and of 0.6 to 0.8 when estimated

on yearly rates and 10 years average rates, respectively).

       Beyond the numbers themselves, these results point to the fact that the

accelerator effects should not be simply conceived as technological parameters

(to be equal to 1 in the long run assuming constant returns to scale and neutral

technological progress in production for cost minimizing firms). It makes a

more plausible story to consider them as also dependent on the elasticities of

firms sales expectations (or even to strictly identify them with such elasticities).

       Turning to the profits effects, the interpretation runs in the same way

but with reverse implications. The transitory profits effects are higher than

the permanent ones. Firms tend to hire more labor and to invest more in the

years when they make higher profits or in the years that immediately follow

them, even if they perceived these profits as short run. They do not, however,

sustain such decisions to a comparable extent, whenever the higher profits

persist. In other words there is a timing influence of profits. Firms which

may encounter difficulties in borrowing on financial markets will accelerate or

delay their investments as well as their labor hiring decisions depending on

good or bad profits. Looking at the tentative orders of magnitude under the

assumptions of Appendix III, the weight of the transitory component in the total
                                      —20—


variance of profits could be as high as 50 percent in terms of the yearly rates,

and be reduced to about 10 percent in terms of the 10 years average rates. On

this basis the transitory and permanent profits effects would be respectively of

about 0.15 and 0.05 for labor demand and 0.20 and 0.10 for net investment demand

(taking 0.10 and 0.05 as the estimates of the profits effects on yearly rates

and 10 years average rates respectively in the labour equation and 0.15 and 0.10

as the corresponding estimates in the net investment equation).


Differences Between Countries

       Our second general observation on Tables 2 and 3 is that the differences

between countries for the four estimated equations are for most of them

relatively small; although they may be statistically quite significant, they

usually correspond to orders of magnitude which are roughly the same. The

prevailing impression is one of overall similarity, showing that in fact the

labor and investment demand behaviors of the large manufacturing firms making up

our samples are largely comparable in France, Germany and the U.S.

       Concentrating on the total accelerator effects, and considering chiefly

the average rates estimates (i.e., practically the permanent effects) to make

comparison easier, these effects are of about 0.6 to 0.T for both labor and net

investment demands in France and Germany. The smaller coefficient in the net

investment equation for Germany is in fact not statistically different from the

French one; to some extent it may also reflect the difference in the measurement

of the capital stock variable for Germany (as we can gather from the estimates

using more comparable measures in Annex I). The accelerator effects appear also
                                      —21—


to be almost equal for the two equations in the U.S., but of somewhat higher

order of magnitude (0.8).

       Looking at the gross investment equation instead of the net investment

one, the total accelerator effects are well reduced, being about O.)4 to 0.5 in

the three countries. These reductions correspond to the "decelerator effects"

apparent in the replacement investment equation. Such effects are particularly

important for the U.S. sample, less so but still manifest for the French sample,

and not really significant for the German one.

       As we explained, in the case of Germany, the replacement rate is by

construction the proportion of 16 years ago past investment to current capital

stock. Thus we expected to find zero effects for the German replacement

equation. If we consider them altogether, the estimates we get are indeed quite

poor. The sales changes coefficients are clearly insignificant. The profits

coefficients, though, come out significantly negative for our two types of esti-

mates. Such result may seem strange and could be spurious. They may also

simply reflect the fact that firms with a relatively low R/C ratio (the way it

is calculated in the German sample) are rapidly growing firms with relatively

high profits. In the case of France and the U.S., the evidence for decelerator

effects appears strongly by way of contrast with Germany. The total decelerator

effects would be of about —0.30 in the U.S. and of about —0.15 in France. If we

look, however, at the estimates by subperiods in Table 4,   there   is clearly a

change occurring for France: the decelerator effect, which was smallish before

1974—75, becomes quite important after and comparable to what it is for the U.S.

Despite the severe measurement problems which probably affect also our
                                          —22—


replacement investment ratios for French and U.S. firms, it would seem that we

can attach credence to the finding of sizeable decelerator effects in these two

cases. Other things equal, firms tend to increase their replacement and moder-

nization investments when their sales slow down and their expected capacity

needs get weaker; conversely they tend to diminish them when they anticipate

that their capacity needs will intensify. In France such behavior seems to have

really come into action only since the l9T4—T5 crisis. This might confirm —

in   a perhaps less ambiguous way than the increase of the average replacement rate

—   the   widespread beliefs about the acceleration of obsolescence.

           Turning to the profits effects, they appear more variable between the

different equations and also across countries than the accelerator effects. If

we put aside the replacement equations in which the influence of profits seems

rather dubious (for Germany as we have said, but also for France and the U.S.

where this influence is at best small and tends to go in opposite directions),

the profits effects are clearly smaller in the three countries for labor than

they are for net and gross investments. This may be considered as another indi-

cation of the predominance of the financial role of the profits variable in our

equations. One noticeable difference between the three countries is that one

year lagged profits have the largest impact in France and Germany relatively to

current profits, while the opposite is true for the U.S. Apparently American

firms react almost immediately to the good or bad news about their profits, and

French and German firms are slower in their responses.

          Some last remarks are worth mentioning about the time profile of the

accelerator effects and the relative importance of the direct and total acce—
                                      —23--



lerator effects. If we compute the proportion of the accelerator effects taking

place in the first year, it is of about 60 percent for labor in both France

and Germany, and as much as 80 percent in the U.S. It is much less but still

high, about a third, for gross and net investment in the three countries. The

proportion of the direct accelerator effects (working through sales changes

only) to the total effects (transmitted also via profits) is overwhelming and

pretty much the same in the three countries: on the order of 90 percent for

labor, and 60 to 80 percent for net and gross investment.


Changes After l9T4—T5

       Examining thoroughly in Table I the various estimates of the accelerator

and profits effects obtained for our two periods 1910—T3 and l9T6—19, the

general conclusion is one of no drastic changes and of a relative overall stabi-

lity. Although economic environment altered vastly and mostly for the worse,

firms have sustained basically the same labor demand and investment demand beha-

viors, as characterized in our equations and variables.

       However, a general tendency towards both smaller accelerator effects and

smaller profits effects is clear, these coefficients being reduced on average by

as much as one fourth in the second period relative to the first one. An excep-

tion, that we have already stressed, is the appearance of a sizeable decelerator

effect for replacement investment in France after l91I_T5, which is comparable

to the one found for the U.S. Of course, such a reduction in our estimates does

not necessarily mean that the "true" accelerator and profits effects, in as much

as they have a structural interpretation, are really undermined; it could mdi—
                                       — 21—




cate   that a factor of importance omitted in our equations (and correlated with
sales   changes and profits) has come specifically into play. One might see there

the influence of the overall economic climate and of the future prospects of the

various industries, which contribute to weaken or reinforce firms expectations

in their own sales and profits.

        A better insight into the characteristics of our models and their com-

parative performance in the two periods is provided by the detailed information

recorded in Table 5. We have computed in this table the results of applying

directly our estimated equations to the average situations in the two periods

(two first columns for each country), as well as to the changes between the two

of them (third column obtained by difference). Besides the R2 and the standard

errors on the estimated coefficients, this is another way of assessing the

explanatory value of a model and the respective contributions of its variables.

For these computations, we used the estimates derived from the 10 years average

rates (given in Table 3) and the means of the variables for the two periods

1970—73 and 1976—79 (given in Table i). We thus obtain the direct and indirect

accelerator effects (DA and IA lines respectively in the Table 5), and the own

profits effects(OP). In order to fully account for our variables of interest,

(i.e., average labor and capital growth rates DL and DC, average gross investment

and replacement rates I/C and      ) we are left with residual constants, summing

up the independent contributions of all other ignored factors. In an attempt to

go one step further, we distinguish in these residuals the part which would

correspond to shifting coefficients in our equations, ie.., the variation in

the value of the residuals, using the different estimates found for the two
                                      —25—


periods separately instead of the ones obtained for the overall period. This

part we note DCst in Table 5, and the remaining one Cst.

       After these necessary explanations on the contents of Table 5, our com-

ments can be straightforward. We shall leave aside the replacement equation, in

which the decelerator and profits effects tend to be at best small and offset

each other (and thus the "constant" remains most of the story). For the labor,

net and gross investment equations, the results are fortunately much more satis-

factory. The direct accelerator effects (DA) very often play the largest role,

for example in explaining the severe fall in average labor growth or in net and

gross investment rates after l97)-—75 in France and Germany. The profits effects

are in general quite sizeable, even considering only the own effects (OF) and

taking apart as we do the indirect accelerator effects (IA), which usually

constitute a fair share of the total. As could be expected, the shifting coef-

ficients effects also contribute appreciably to explaining the changes which

occurred between the two periods. Finally, in many instances, the constants or

residual factors effects (Cst) do not appear as predominant; if they tend to

account largely for the average situations in the two periods, they have often

enough a more modest role with respect to the changes. It seems fair to

conclude that on the whole, for our three samples, the performances of the

accelerator profits model in accounting for the changes in labor and investment

demands after l9'—T5 are not only significant from the statistical point of

view but also important in terms of magnitudes (ie., both in terms of variances

and of averages).

3.3. Trying to Go Beyond the Accelerator Profits Model
       One of the theoretically most important determinants of firm factor demand

that we neglect in the accelerator profits model is the relative expected cost
of    labor and capital. If the firm anticipates that the wage rate will increase

more rapidly relatively to the user cost of capital, it will be induced to

substitute more capital for labor. Assuming the simplest (standard) assumptions

with a Cobb—Douglas production function (and constant returns), the elasticities

of the relative cost of labor and capital should be in theory equal to minus the

share of capital (in value added, say about —0.3) in the labor demand equation,

and to the share of labor (say 0.1) in the capital demand equation. If the pro-

duction function has an elasticity of substitution between capital and labor a

(and is for example of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution form), the shares

should be multiplied by a and the coefficients reduced in that proportion (say

—0.30 and 0.10 with a plausibly less than i). If the production function is of

the   type "putty—clay" (the ex—ante production function for each capital vintage
being for example Cobb—Douglas),     the coefficients should also be reduced and in

quite a large proportion (say by a factor of 10). Thus the theoretically
expected orders of magnitude of the labor and capital costs elasticities could

be extremely different a priori, and their estimation is an empirical issue of
great import.
         Despite   the considerable amount of econometric research that has been

done on precisely this issue, there are still doubts and debates among economists

about the real importance of factor price elasticities. Although we could

construct only very poor proxies of the relevant price variables, we thought
                                      —21—


worthwhile to explore the matter at the firm level on our data. Unfortunately,

the results we get are either insignificant or dubious if significant. As

usual, and probably not unfairly in the present instance, the suspicion falls

on the data.

       Besides the basic problem of observing only the actual values of the

variables and not their expected values, our measures of the cost of labor

and capital suffer from other shortcomings. Our labor cost variable W is the

average labor compensation (total wages and associated social charges) per

employee. The wide dispersion in W across firms thus largely corresponds to

differences in labor qualifications, in the number of hours worked and of over-

time, and only partly reflects the true differences in wages in the labor

market. Also, by construction, W will be affected by measurement errors in the

number of employees L, and this is a possible cause of a negative spurious

correlation between the two. It is also the case that W cannot be computed for

the U.S. sample, since most U.S. firms declare their labor cost and material

purchases lumped together (in the item "cost of goods sold").

       Our proxy for the cost of capital IR reflects only the interest rate com-

ponent of a proper measure of the user cost of capital; it is computed as total

interest expenses divided by total debt. It is thus the apparent average rate

of interest paid by the firm, and in an analogous way with W it is only loosely

related to the present rates of interest prevailing (at the margin for a given

firm) on the financial markets.

       Because of our growth rate formulation, the additional variables we enter

in our equations are the growth rates DW and DR (or log differences of W and
                                         —28—


iR). It will be sufficient to report the estimates obtained from the 10 years

average rates (the other estimates on yearly rates or on subperiods being neither

better nor worse). Table 6 thus gives the estimated labor and capital cost

elasticities (and their estimated standard errors) for our four equations and

three samples (in a format similar to that of Table 3). We do not reproduce the

estimated accelerator and profits effects, since the introduction of the cost

variable does not change them much from what they are in Table 3 (i.e., DW and

DIR are nearly orthogonal to DQ and PR in our samples). We have been careful to

introduce DW and DIR separately in our equations without imposing a priori that

their coefficients should be equal. One reason is that only DIR is available in

the U.S. sample. But more importantly, as it has been pointed out by Clark and

Freeman (1980) and further developed by Dormont (1983), in this way we avoid

contaminating one variable with errors of measurement affecting the other one.

The cost of capital variable is in fact extremely dispersed and suffers quite

probably from very large random errors. Hence we can expect that its estimated

elasticity is strongly biased towards 0, while the estimated labor cost

elasticity might be more satisfactory.

       The results in Table 6 are basically disappointing, and do not call for

long coimnents. Almost all cross price elasticities (i.e., the DW coefficient in

the investment equations and the DIR coefficient in the labor equation) are sta-

tistically insignificant at the 5% level of confidence. The DW coefficient in

the DC equation for Germany is an exception, but has the opposite sign

(negative) to what would be expected. It has the right sign (positive) in the

RIC equation, but that is dubious because of the way replacement investment is
                                       —29—


computed in the German sample. The (direct) capital cost elasticities in the

investment equations are also insignificant but for the French sample. In this

case, the sign is correct (negative) but the magnitude seems small, although

random errors in DIR could account for it.

       The (direct) labor cost elasticities in the labor equation seem too good

to be true. Their magnitude is much larger than expected (—0.8 as against —0.3

if the elasticity of substitution of capital and labor 0   is   about 1). It seems

also inconsistent with the view of labor—capital substitution that the labor

cost variable would show up so strongly in the labor demand, and not conversely

in the investment demand. One plausible explanation is the existence of

measurement errors in our measure DL, which by construction would be

(negatively) transmitted to our measure DW. Since the variance of DW is much

smaller thayi that of DL (by a factor of the order of 4), even relatively small

errors in DL would lead to relatively large ones in DW. Thus if random errors

were responsible for about 20% of the observed variance of DL, they could also

be responsible for as much as 80% of the observed variance of DW. Such

situation could account for our estimated elasticities of —0.8, even though the

"true" coefficients would be zero.13

      In closing, we should say again, if only by way of taking some comfort,

that such inconclusive results in estimating price elasticities in factor demand

studies are rather common. It may be also that we have been too pessimistic in

considering them. If true, this will be only a small compensation for the

(over) optimistic statements which sometimes dress up poor evidence.

IV - FINAL REMARKS


      Our present work is just a step in a line or a style of research, which

we think to be fruitful and deserving further effort: the analysis of

macroeconomic issues using microdata in a comparative setting. The dif-

ficulties, however, of this style of research, which combines the problems of

individual data studies to those of international comparisons are equal to the

promises. Facing such difficulties, one should be specially cautious. This is

why we are reluctant to put much emphasis on differences of results between

countries, even when they correspond to what could be expected, while we put a

priori more faith in finding comparable patterns of results and behavioral

similarities. Differences of results may be due, in part or even completely, to

errors or discrepancies in the data and to inadequate specifications of the

models. On the contrary, it seems implausible to obtain similar results if they

were not truly so.

      Although comparative macroeconomists are usually more interested in

looking at differences between countries, it is fortunate, from what we just

say, that we find mainly similarities in our study. Despite the diversity of

situations and evolutions of French, German and US manufacturing over the period

1910—79, the labor and investment demand behaviors of large firms in the three

countries are in fact largely comparable. This is the main message of the

analysis; however, this message should not be overstated. There is still room

for interesting differences; even if limited and hard to ascertain, these may be

quite important from an economic policy point of view. In particular, as we
                                      —31—


would expect, the US firms seem to behave in a somewhat more flexible way then

their French and German counterparts, the accelerator effects tending to be

higher for labor and investment and more rapid for labor in the U.S. than in the

other two countries.

      Among the many directions in which further work should be done, three must

be mentioned here.

      The problems of interpreting and specifying the accelerator and profits

effects and the permanent—transitory distinction should he investigated further.

It would be certainly interesting to pursue the vector autoregressive approach

already used in MAIRESSE and SIll (l9R1). There are also many difficulties,

however, with this approach, and unless we put complete faith in a given speci-

fication, we are still in a dilemma of choosing a formulation of variables in

ternis of growth rates or 1evels.l4 To make more decisive progress would probably

need to have some direct notions of the firm expectations about demand and pro-

fitability in both the short and long run.

      More effort should be devoted to investigating the role of factor prices

and to deciding whether our finding of inconclusive evidence is due to the use

of poor measures, or because the effects of prices are relatively small and

there is little to discover. However, obtaining appropriate measures of labor

and capital user costs at the firm level is very problematic. One might think

that there is very limited dispersion of true factor prices among firms, at

least within industries in a given country. Thus one would use the average

macro—prices which can be better specified and estimated. We are not very hope-

ful though, because this means relying mainly on aggregate time series infor—
                                       —32—



mation,   and we know from all the econometric research done at the macro—level

that we should foresee mixed results at best.

      Specific efforts should be also devoted to the important issue of

replacement investment. There is very little work done on this issue, contrary

to that of factor prices, one main reason being the lack of information. Since

balance sheet data are one of the very few possible sources of relevant

information on the subject, detailed analyses should be applied to them.15 It

would be important, for example, to try to make corrections for acquisitions,

disacquisitions, and the revaluation of assets, and to be able to separate

equipment and structures for long enough periods of study. This seems indeed a

painstaking route, but there is no good short cut around it.

Appendix I — The Robustness of estimates to the measurement of
             of investment and capital stock


          Since our measures of investment and capital stock were different in the

German sample and in the two other samples, it seemed particularly useful to

investigate   the sensitivity of our estimates to the differences in these
measures. It was simplest to compute alternative measures on a strictly com-
parable   basis for all three samples. Investment was taken as the change In net

plant   plus depreciation charges (as was already the case for the German sample)

and capital stock was estimated according to the standard application of the

permanent inventory method under the assumption of a constant rate of replace-

ment 5. Under this assumption the distinction between replacement and depre-

ciation (and that between net and gross capital stock) vanishes in principle.

Hence, we thought more appropriate to adopt a relatively large value for the

constant rate     of l0, which makes our measure of capital stock closer to the

notion of a net capital stock, and has the practical advantage of giving less

importance to the choice of the initial benchmark capital stock. As the bench-

mark capital, we took simply the reported book value of net plant at the

beginning of 1967, multiplied by what seemed an appropriate factor of adjust-

ment.

        In fact, both the choice of the factor of adjustment and that of the

constant rate ô in plausible ranges have little impact on our estimates of the

investment equation. Estimates of the accelerator and profits effects for the

three samples (on yearly and average growth rates over the whole period) are

given in Table Al. By comparing them to the corresponding estimates in

Tables 2 and 3 in the text, it is apparent that they yield a fairly similar
                                       —3I —




picture.   On the whole they tend to be closer to the estimates of the net

investment equation (rather than the gross investment equation) and somewhat

more comparable for our three country samples.

Appendix II — Estimates of the Total Accelerator Effects
              with Different Lag Specifications


      As was noted in the text, before adopting a specification with three lags for

sales growth rates (and one for profit rates) we experimented with a number of

different specifications. Table A2 presents the various estimates of the total

accelerator effects obtained when using no lags (only the current value DQ),

five lags (DQ, DQ1,...DQ5) and geometrically decreasing lags in the first

auto—regressive form (i.e., introducing the one lag endogenous variable, DL1 or

DC1 or i/C1 or R/C1, in addition to DQ, as an explanatory variable). For the

ease of comparison, Table A2 repeats also the corresponding estimates on yearly

rates with three lags (last line of Table 2) and on average growth rates (last

line of Table 3). It is generally clear that for the four equations and three

countries our three lag estimates of the total accelerator effects do not differ

much from the five lags estimates, both types of estimates being sizeably larger

than the no lag estimates, and being smaller with some exceptions than the

average rates estimates. It is also interesting to note that the

estimates obtained with the autoregressive specification are practically the

same as the no lag estimates.

Appendix III — The Distinction Between Permanent and Transitory Effects


         The differences between the estimates computed from yearly growth rates

and the estimates based on average growth rates can be interpreted in terms of

the differences between permanent and transitory (accelerator and profits)

effects. We shall provide here an elementary formalization of such interpreta-

tion, allowing us to compute illustrative orders of magnitude under extreme

Riimption.       Trying to he ies simplistia would   inrply a more   appropriate npeoi_
fication    of the permanent—transitory distinction. Clearly this is an important

issue. If one had a proper model, one would want to estimate it directly, and

would not need to consider differences in yearly and average growth rates esti-

mates.

         To illustrate the distinction between permanent and transitory effects, it

is enough to look at a simple regression; a straightforward generalization to

the niultivariate case would not be very difficult. We abandon the usual

equation:


                 (1)             y. = a x. +

where        is the labor or capital growth rate for the firm i in year t,        is

the   corresponding sales growth rate or the profit rate, 5it is the usual
perturbation or error term, and a measures the total accelerator or profits
effects. Instead we consider the following equation:

                 (2)                    pp  TT
                                         x.--a x.t1.c.t
where x and x are respectively the permanent and transitory components of

                                      it   it



a and aT measuring the corresponding permanent and transitory coefficients.

       Since x and x are unobservable, we cannot estimate the true model

(2), but only the equation (1). It is thus necessary to make specific

assumptions in order to identify x?÷ and x÷, and to retrieve estimates of        a
     T
and a

       First, we shall assume, as if by definition, that the permanent and

transitory components are independent. Second, we shall assume that their (own)

serial correlation are respectively large and negligible, say: 0.1 and 0, or

even as a limiting case: 1.0 and 0. A serial correlation of 1 might seem quite

unrealistic, since it would imply x =    x.   Note however, that this might not

be too different from assuming that x = a                  ,   as we implicitly often

do in practice. Trying to proceed explicitly and more rigourously would lead us

to a vector autoregressive setup as in Mairesse and Siu (l98).

       As a direct consequence of the second assumption, the variance of the

permanent   component (x)2 will be reduced in a smaller proportion than that of
the transitory component (xT)2, when we go from yearly growth rates to average
growth   rates, say over 10 years (i.e., from 1910 to 1979). And therefore from

since our distinction between transitory and permanent components applies more

appropriately to the level of sales or log sales                           while the variable

entering in our model is the change in sales, or                       =             If the serial
                                                                            DX.t.
correlation of permanent sales X is one, it is zero for the permanent changes

x and hence the permanent variance (x)2 is reduced by a factor of 10 when

considering 10 years averages. If the serial correlation of transitory sales
 T                        .                           .                .                        T
      is zero, the first order correlation of the transitory changes                                is —0.5,

and the higher order correlations are zeros, then it is easy to see that the

transitory variance (xT)2 is reduced by a factor of 100 for the 10 years

averages. The reduction of the total variance (x) that we observe in fact

for our three samples is in a factor of roughly 12 to 1)4.                      This reduction

thus corresponds to shares of the permanent and transitory variances of sales
                                                                                            o         T
changes of about 75 and 25 percent respectively i.e., such that p/i0 +                               p    /100

=   1/13).
        The case of profits is more direct. The serial correlation of permanent

profit rates (x) being one, the permanent variance (x)2 is not reduced in

taking averages. The serial correlation of transitory profit rates (x?)

being zero, the transitory variance (xT)2 is reduced by a factor of 10 by

going to 10—year averages. The observed reduction in total variance is actually

about 1/2, and thus corresponds to shares of the permanent and transitory
                                                     T
variances on the order of 50 percent (such that p
                                                p + p /10 =                         1/2).
        Knowing     the respective shares of the permanent and transitory components,
we can easily derive estimates of the permanent and transitory coefficients a
aT, from the (least squares) estimates of the usual coefficient a on both the

yearly and 10 years average growth rates, say a and a. More precisely, we can
                                         -.39—



write   the two following equations in a and aT:


               ppp
                 a +pTT       —pp
                      a =a andp    —TT
                                a +p a =a

where p and      are the shares of permanent and transitory variances for the

averages growth rates which can be obtained from the corresponding shares for the

yearly growth rates p and

                ; P P,i(,P +   T/10)   and       =   (.nTIlO)/(DP +   T/10)

        It is clear that for small enough T (and for averages over a long period

such as 10 years), the permanent coefficient a will be practically equal to

that estimated on averages, even if the transitory coefficient aT is important.

It is clear also that if a is larger than aT, then the estimate based on annual

data (or first differences) will be in general smaller than the estimate based

on average rates (or long differences), and conversely. As we see in this

study, sales changes and profits in the accelerator profits model are good

examples of these two cases.

and J. MAIRESSE (1981).


2. The French, German and U.S. samples are built from the information respec—

tively available from the data bank of the Credit National, that of the

Institute fir Gesellschafts—und—Wirtschaftswisseunschaften, and from the Standard

and Poor's Industrial Compustat. Details on the construction and the cleaning

of these three samples, as well as on the definition and measurement of the

variables, can be found in three companion studies on productivity and

profitability in each country: B. DORMaNT, J.M. CHANUT and J. MAIRESSE, (198)4

and 1985).


3. To be precise, for France and the U.S., C is computed as reported gross

plant times P('T2)/P(t_AA), where P is the price deflator for investment and AAt

the average age of gross plant. AAt is computed as the ratio of accumulated

depreciation to gross plant (1 minus the ratio of net plant to gross plant)

divided by an assumed average service life of 16 years. This supposes straight

line depreciation. In the case of France, the ratio of accumulated depreciation
                                       _14]_


to gross plant is itself corrected to take into   account that the fiscal lengths


of life used to compute depreciation as reported in the firms accounts are much
shorter than   the actual service lives. Gross plant has been taken at the

beginning of the fiscal year, which for a number of firms does not coincide with

the calendar year. It does not seem from previous work that this timing

problem has any real impact on our type of results.


1. Only net plant is reported in the book accounts of our German firms, and

thus we could not use the gross plant measure.


5. We used deflators for both sales and investments at the level of a classifi-

cation in 16 manufacturing industries for the three countries (i.e., almost

the two digit industrial breakdown in the u.s.). Using more detailed deflators,

as we tried in previous work, does not seem to matter much.


6. We experimented also with not adjusting for inventory change, and with gross

profits after taxes and interest expenses, which should provide a better measure

of the "flow of funds" available for investment. On the whole, the results were

very similar. The correction for taxes and interest expenses appeared to

improve slightly the fit of our investment equations. However, since

interest expenses were missing for a number of U.S. firms, we preferred not to

reduce our sample size and kept the before taxes and interest measure.


7. Thus, by construction, the measures of gross and net investment rates

differ only by the constant replacement rate, and hence there is no point in

analysing them separately.
8. By    definition we have exactly: Rt/Ct =   I_(C1_Ct)/C.        In fact, we have

measured R/C by the difference I/C — DC, where DC computed as the log

difference is only an approximation to the rate of growth of C. We have

checked, however, that this approximation led only to insignificant differences

in our B/C estimated equation. We chose to present the results for the B/C =

I/C   — DC measure just for the sake of coherence, so that this definitional or

accounting identity would strictly hold for the estimates in our tables.


9.    Actually   using industry dummies instead of a constant has only a minor

impact on our estimates. Using year dummies in addition, or even using specific

year dummies for each industry (i.e., iOxl6 =    i60   of them for the whole period

1970—79) has not much influence either. In principle, having industry dummies

with no time dummies, as we did, should mean that a firm in reaching its invest-

ment and labor demand decisions takes into account not only its own relative

situation within its sector but also the general evolution of the economy. In

the same vein, another experiment that we could have tried would have been to

distinguish the firm expectations about their own sales and from those about the

industry sales. Instead of year dummies for each industry, we could have used

as additional variables in our equations the industry sales growth rates (i.e.,

the weighted averages of firm growth rates).


10. For an interesting recent survey on econometric models of investment, which

relates the accelerator profits model to other models (i.e., Jorgensonian neo-

classical and cost of adjustment type models, Tobin's q and disequilibrium

approach models) see P. ABTUS and P.A. MUET (1981).

11. The choice of the time—series type estimates versus the cross sectional

type estimates is equivalent to considering investment and labor change equations

rather than capital stock and labor equations. This choice between the two type

of estimates or the two sorts of specifications is a very profound issue that we

leave aside here. This is not simply a problem of heteroscedasticity, as it is

often thought, since in this case whatever the choice we would expect to get

consistent estimates. The two approaches lead, in fact, to very different esti-

mates. Cross sectional estimates of the total accelerator effects (i.e. total

or between—firm estimates on log L or log C equations) are typically of about

1.0, while, as we shall see, the time series estimates are about 0.5 to 0.6

based on yearly growth rates and 0.6 to 0.1 based on average growth rates. The

proper within estimates that we also computed but do not present are usually

quite close to the average growth rates estimates. An accelerator effect of 1.0

makes a priori more sense, if we interpret it as being exactly the reciprocal of

the scale elasticity of the underlying production function (in the simplest

model for a cost minimizing firm). On the other hand, a value less than 1.0 is

more sensible if we consider that the estimated effect depends also on the

elasticity of sales expectations relatively to observed past sales. As we

already explained, this is this line of thought that we pursue here.


12. There are of course exceptions to such robustness of regressions analyses.

For an example see CUNEO   and MAIRESSE (l98), in which it is shown that the
double   counting of R—D in   the available measures of labor and physical capital,
in   spite of its limited magnitude, results in sizeable   biases   in the cross—

sectional estimates of R—D capital stock elasticity.
                                                 —l4—



13.    Let the true model be DL* =        f DW   + e,   in which DL* and DW* are the true

changes in labor and wages, and in which we omit the other explanatory

variables for simplicity (and because they are nearly orthogonal). Suppose that

v is a random uncorrelated error in the observed DL : DL = DL* +            v,   the measured

DW will be: DW = DW* —        v,   and the estimated equation: DL =   f DW +   e +   (1 +   f)v.
Thus the error in variable bias of the least square estimate              of f will be

—   (i + f)   var   (v)/var   (DW), and even for a true f = 0 we could have          —   0.8.

l. The extended accelerator model in MAIRESSE and SIU is a four variable

autoregressive model with equations for the stock market rate of return, the

sales growth rate, the physical investment and R—D investment growth rates.

Thus, the choice of formulations in terms of growth rates or levels is carried

one degree further by considering the rate of change of investment (i.e., the

rate of acceleration of the capital stock), rather than its level (i.e., the

rate of change of the capital stock).
