Closing the Gap or Widening the Divide: The Effects of the G.I. Bill and
World War II on the Educational Outcomes of Black Americans

                                              ABSTRACT

        The effects of the G.I. Bill on collegiate attainment may have differed for black and white
Americans owing to differential returns to education and differences in opportunities at colleges and
universities, with men in the South facing explicitly segregated colleges. The empirical evidence suggests
that World War II and the availability of G.I. benefits had a substantial and positive impact on the
educational attainment of white men and black men born outside the South. However, for those black
veterans likely to be limited to the South in their educational choices, the G.I. Bill had little effect on
collegiate outcomes, resulting in the exacerbation of the educational differences between black and white
men from southern states.

        Recent empirical evidence points to a substantial positive effect of the G.I. Bill and

World War II service on the educational attainment of white men (Bound and Turner,

forthcoming; Stanley, 2001). Left unanswered is the question of whether the G.I. Bill and World

War II had a similar effect on black Americans. There are good reasons to believe that the

program effects of the G.I. Bill may have differed for black Americans, who had fewer

opportunities in the labor market and in higher education. In particular, black men in the South

faced explicitly segregated colleges and much more limited opportunities within the historically

black institutions.

        The related question of whether black veterans from states with de jure segregation

demonstrated educational gains similar to black veterans in other states is significant for both the

overall evaluation of the G.I. Bill and the lessons we draw from it for contemporary policy. In

general, portable grant aid programs such as the G.I. Bill are expected to have large effects on

collegiate investments when the supply of education is relatively elastic. Yet, limited state

investment in colleges and universities open to blacks may have restricted the extent to which

black veterans in the South were able to make use of G.I. benefits to attend college.

        More generally, comparing the effects of the G.I. Bill on the educational outcomes of

black and white Americans raises classic questions of the role of education in reproducing

inequality. In principle, the portable aid available to all veterans through the G.I. Bill held the

promise of significantly reducing black-white gaps in educational opportunity and long-run

economic outcomes. Given the absence of other national financial aid programs in the 1940s, one

might expect the G.I. Bill to have the largest behavioral effects on men for whom financial

constraints were most likely to impede college enrollment. In practice, it is less clear that

economically disadvantaged and minority veterans exhibited the largest changes in college


                                                                                                 Page 1
participation as a result of the financial aid provided by the G.I. Bill. These groups may have

lacked the academic readiness for college programs and supply constraints in higher education

may have limited their enrollment.

        Our research questions are twofold. First, we explore the extent to which World War II

service and the availability of G.I. benefits had similar behavioral effects on the collegiate

attainment of black and white men. Then, among blacks, we look at the extent to which state of

birth, and particularly location in a southern state, leads to differential collegiate outcomes. The

analytic strategy in this paper uses variation over time in the fraction of men serving from each

birth cohort to identify the effects of military service and the availability of G.I. benefits on

educational attainment. The first section of the paper presents institutional detail on military

service and educational opportunities for blacks in relation to whites during the World War II era.

The next section summarizes the relevant theoretical questions and outlines the empirical

strategy. The empirical section of this analysis points to a significantly positive impact of World

War II and the availability of G.I. benefits on the educational attainment of white men and black

men born outside the segregated southern states. However, for black veterans likely to be limited

to the South in their educational choices, the G.I. Bill had little effect on collegiate outcomes.

The concluding section presents a discussion of the empirical findings and considers the policy

implications of these results.



I. Black Americans, World War II Military Service, and the G.I. Bill

        A. Race and Military Service in World War II

        The politics and practice of minority participation in the military were contentious issues

as World War II approached. Before the start of the war, the black press and the NAACP


                                                                                                    Page 2
launched the “Double V” campaign, urging black Americans to work toward victories over Jim

Crow at home and fascism abroad. In late September 1940, President Roosevelt met with a

delegation of black leaders to discuss the administration’s defense policy and the utilization of

blacks in the military, as well as minority group support for the administration’s policies. Shortly

after that meeting, on October 9, the Roosevelt administration released a statement reaffirming its

support for the inclusion of blacks in the military in proportion to their representation in the

population while continuing the segregation of black and white troops in organized military

activities (Smith, 1987).1

         As the war approached, the capacity of the military to employ black servicemen was quite

limited. For example, in 1940 there were only 6 black units in the military, which accounted for

only 4,450 soldiers (Flynn, 1993). To maintain segregation, the military branches were required

to build additional housing, mess halls, and other facilities for black servicemen. Because of

initial placement barriers, few black men were accepted to the military through voluntary

enlistment in the early years of the war.

         When manpower demand intensified as the war progressed, voluntary enlistment was

largely eliminated and date of birth became a primary determinant of induction. All men were

required to register with local draft boards at age 18, after which they were classified as “service

eligible” or deferred from service. It is this classification by local draft boards that introduces the

significant problem of selection in measuring the effects of World War II and the availability of

G.I. benefits on the educational attainment of veterans. Reasons for deferment included mental

and physical deficiencies, illiteracy, and employment in industries vital to the war effort.

         1
          Although black leaders were unsuccessful in obtaining the changes necessary to achieve official
endorsement of integration in the military in World War II, they did see passage of an amendment to the Selective
Service Act of 1940 stating that “there shall be no discrimination against any person on account of race or color” in



                                                                                                                Page 3
Differences by race in these classification rates suggest potential differences in the nature of the

selection effects associated with military service. For instance, whites were much more likely to

receive occupational deferments and blacks more likely to be deferred for reasons of illiteracy or

“mental deficiency.” Table 1 shows selective service classification rates for black and white

registrants by age in 1945. Among registrants ages 19-25, black men were 2.25 more likely that

white men to receive deferments under section IV-F for physical or mental unfitness. Of those

deferred for service in 1944, 33.5 percent of blacks and 8.0 percent of whites were rejected for

low scores on the reading and writing examination (Selective Service System, 1948, Table 191,

p. 664).

        Figure 1 shows the share of white and black veterans of World War II and all other U.S.

conflicts by birth cohort for the first half of the 20th century, measured at quarterly intervals.

Among men designated service eligible, date of birth was significantly related to the probability

of induction as the selective service drafted “oldest eligible” men first. For men turning 18 during

the war, those born in the interval 1923-25 faced a relatively high risk of induction relative to

those born in later years. For black men, absolute levels of military participation were somewhat

lower than for whites, with a peak share of 66 percent reached among men born in the third

quarter of 1922. Among blacks and whites, the proportion of each cohort serving in the military

slid rapidly after the 1926 birth cohort. Ultimately, more than 1 million black men served in the

military during World War II.2




the selection of troops and the execution of the law (MacGregor, 1981).
          2
            The majority of these men served in the Army and the 885,945 black men inducted to this branch
accounted for 10.9% of the men inducted in the Army during the war. The Navy inducted 153,224 black men, which
accounted for about 10% of the inductions in this branch, while the Marine Corp did not admit blacks until June of
1942 (Selective Service System, 1948).

B. G.I. Benefits and Educational Opportunities for World War II Veterans

         The unprecedented support for the education of returning World War II veterans provided

by the Serviceman’s Readjustment Act (Public Law 346, 1944), known more generally as the

G.I. Bill, was notably race-neutral in its statutory terms. Educational benefits extended from a

minimum of one year to four years, depending on length of service and age, and men serving

between September 1940 and July 1947 were eligible. In addition to providing annual tuition

payments of up to $500, the bill also provided a monthly cash allowance.3 A notable feature of

the program was that benefits were awarded to individuals rather than institutions, allowing

veterans to use them for any educational or training programs to which they were accepted. G.I.

benefits not only covered enrollment at colleges and universities, but also provided opportunities

for vocational, technical, and apprenticeship training. In fact, the majority of veterans who

received training under the World War II G.I. Bill participated in non-collegiate and on-the-job

programs (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1973).4



         3
            The provisions of the G.I. Bill as signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 22, 1944 provided for a
monthly stipend of $50 for single veterans and $75 for married veterans, as well as the payment of tuition, books and
supplies up to $500. All veterans serving 90 days with a record of honorable discharge were eligible for one year of
educational benefits, with veterans receiving educational benefits matching years of service 1:1 up to a maximum of
four years of benefit eligibility. In December of 1945, the G.I. Bill was amended to increase the length of the period
over which a veteran could initiate and complete education, eliminate restrictions on educational benefits for older
veterans, and increase the level of monthly stipend to $65 for single veterans and to $90 for veterans with
dependents. The nominal stipend levels were raised again in April of 1948 to $75 for single veterans, $105 for
married veterans, and $120 for veterans with children.
          4
            Men chose a wide array of programs beyond collegiate-level training. Overall, black men were less likely
to enroll in college-level programs than whites. Data from the Survey of Veterans show more than 28 percent of
whites in the 1923-28 birth cohorts enrolled in collegiate level training, while less than 12 percent of returning black
veterans chose this option. Black men were, in turn, relatively over-represented in the range of programs comprising
the “other” training and schooling category as well as high school-level training.
          However, there is some evidence that black men in the south had a particularly difficult time gaining access
to vocational and on-the-job training programs with G.I. benefits. Southern Veterans Administration centers
employed few black counselors and were generally unforthcoming in providing services to black veterans (Onkst,
1998). For example, Onkst cites evidence noting that in March of 1946 only 6 of the 246 on-the-job training
programs in Atlanta for veterans had black participation. Another report of the period (Bolte and Harris, 1947) notes
that of 102,200 veterans receiving on-the-job training in 12 southern states, only 7,700 were black, despite the fact
that about 1 in 3 veterans in the area were black.


                                                                                                                 Page 5
       Very little information is available providing direct evidence on the comparative

utilization rate of G.I. benefits among black and white veterans. Limited data from the Survey of

Veterans presented in Table 2 suggest that black veterans turning 18 during World War II were at

least as likely as white men to use G.I. benefits, although the number of months of G.I.

educational benefits appears to be smaller for blacks than whites. One study conducted by the

Information and Education Division of the Army in 1944 just after the announcement of the G.I.

Bill showed the remarkable power of the benefits in changing educational aspirations. Prior to

the announcement of benefits, only 7 percent of enlisted men indicated that they planned further

training or education after the war. After the announcement, 29 percent of white enlisted men and

43 percent of black enlisted men expressed a definite interest in education and training after the

war (Brown, 1946).

       It is likely that educational opportunities for veterans returning from World War II varied

with race and geography. Southern states maintained explicitly segregated systems of education

in the 1940s and this affected the tertiary system of education, as well as the primary and

secondary levels. Moreover, access to information about veterans’ benefits and advising services

may have differed with racial groups. A statutory provision of the G.I. Bill was the availability of

employment and education counseling services through the Veterans Administration, designed to

help veterans obtain education and training. To meet the high post-war demand, the VA not only

maintained regional counseling centers but also contracted with educational institutions to

operate an additional 300 sites (Brown, 1946). It is probable that the availability of counseling

services differed by race, especially in the South. Onkst (1998) notes that the lack of black

counselors was particularly marked in the deep South, with only about a dozen black counselors

for all of Georgia and Alabama and none in Mississippi.


                                                                                                Page 6
         At the conclusion of World War II, blacks wanting to attend college in the South were

restricted in their choices to about 100 public and private institutions delineated in the Office of

Education publications as “Colleges for Negroes,”5 as segregation in public higher education

remained a legal mandate in many southern states. The public institutions for blacks were

founded largely under the Second Morrill Act in 1890, which specifically prohibited the

distribution of federal funds to states that did not provide separate accommodation for blacks if

the primary state institution denied admission to blacks.6

         Few of the post-secondary institutions for blacks offered education beyond the

baccalaureate and 28 of the institutions reporting in academic year 1949-50 were classified as

sub-baccalaureate teachers colleges or junior colleges (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1954).

Among the historically black colleges, those in only seven states offered post-baccalaureate

training and no institution offered an accredited engineering or doctoral program. A survey of

historically black colleges in 1945 found that 45 percent of institutions enrolled fewer than 250

students and 92 percent of the institutions had enrollment of less than 1000 students (Jenkins,

1946). Under-funded and small, these institutions were largely excluded from the “university

revolution” that swept through much of public higher education in the first part of the century—a

development described by Goldin and Katz (1999).

         The small scale of the historically black institutions relative to other colleges and

universities merits emphasis. While average enrollment at white or nonsegregated schools was


         5
            With the exception of Wilberforce University in Ohio and Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, these
institutions were located in southern states with legalized educational segregation. The data collected by the Office
of Education during the 1940s and 1950s does not record the attendance or degree completion of students by race at
integrated colleges and universities.
          6
            The Second Morrill Act led to the founding of 17 Negro land-grant colleges in the southern and border
states, with these institutions including Alabama A&M, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Southern University
A&M (Louisiana), and Alcorn State (Mississippi). Many of these institutions emphasized training in crafts and
trades following the “industrial education” philosophy of Booker T. Washington, rather than providing general


                                                                                                               Page 7
nearly 1,500 in 1949-50, the average resident college enrollment at the black colleges was 729

(U.S. Government Printing Office, 1954). Beyond their much smaller size, colleges for blacks

also had significantly fewer resources per student than their counterparts. Across all private and

public institutions in the South, white institutions accounted for 92 percent of total expenditures

in 1943-44; among public institutions alone, colleges and universities for whites accounted for

more than 94 percent of expenditures (Jenkins, 1947, Table I). In 1949-50, 56 percent of black

men enrolled in black colleges were at public institutions, while 66 percent of all men attending

college in southern states were at public institutions.7 Because private schools were likely to be

more limited than public institutions in their ability to expand capacity in response to demand

shocks, the reliance of blacks in the South on private institutions for collegiate opportunities may

have differentially affected their capacity to use G.I. benefits.

        Excess demand for higher education was particularly high among black veterans in the

South. Olson (1974) found that an estimated 20,000 black veterans were turned away from the

Negro colleges, and a survey of 21 of the southern black colleges indicated that 55 percent of all

veteran applicants were turned away for lack of space, compared to about 28 percent for all

colleges and universities. Part of the problem was housing (Bolte and Harris, 1947). For

example, the lack of family housing units at the Tuskegee Institute in 1945 constituted a

substantial barrier to black veteran enrollment as about a quarter of the school’s veteran

population were married and few were able to find alternative lodging (Onkst, 1998).



education on the model of liberal arts colleges (Pifer, 1973).
         7
           Data for enrollment at all southern institutions are from the Biennial Survey of Education 1948-50 (U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1954) and the data for enrollment at colleges for blacks are from Bowles and DeCosta
(1971). While the level of enrollment expanded markedly at both public and private colleges for blacks between
1939-40 and 1949-50, the growth at the public colleges was particularly marked. In 1939-40, enrollment of men at
the private black colleges exceeded enrollment of men at the public black colleges, with enrollment levels of 6,724
and 6,528, respectively.


                                                                                                              Page 8
         The historically black colleges were more limited than white colleges in their ability to

accommodate returning servicemen because institutional resources were more scarce and

deficiencies in physical space were often more serious than at the white institutions.8 While

flagship universities like the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan in the

North and the University of Texas and the University of Alabama in the South were able to

expand rapidly to meet the needs of returning veterans under the G.I. Bill, limited facilities at the

segregated institutions effectively constrained the supply of places for blacks in the South.

Institutions expanding most rapidly at the end of the war were the public institutions with the

economies of scale, scope, and funding of research universities (Stanley, 2001). With very few of

the historically black schools maintaining graduate or professional programs, they were ill-

equipped to expand to meet the needs of returning veterans. Although the portability of aid under

the G.I. Bill would have theoretically allowed southern blacks to attend schools in the North, the

barriers to enrollment— including limited information about collegiate alternatives, the

disruption of living far from home, and the potential persistence of discrimination at northern

institutions—would likely have been significant.

         A particularly important question concerns the extent to which urban universities in the

North and West enrolled black students. Institutional enrollment counts by race were not

collected at the collegiate level in the years preceding and following World War II and there is

little direct evidence of the level of integration at these schools. The available empirical

evidence provides a hint that colleges in the North may have provided substantial opportunities


         8
           Recognizing the extraordinary conditions at the colleges for blacks in the South, the Federal Works
Agency awarded the black colleges a disproportionate share of the institutional aid available under the Veterans’
Educational Facilities Program, passed in 1946. One source suggests that the surplus war buildings and materials
increased the physical plant of these institutions by 25 percent. Yet, it is less clear that this expansion in capacity
benefited the black veterans returning in the mid-1940s.


                                                                                                                    Page 9
for minorities after World War II, if not before. The concentration of northern-born blacks in

urban areas may well have made it relatively easy for World War II veterans from this group to

participate in higher education given the relative concentration of colleges and universities in

urban centers. In addition to changes in the racial composition of colleges in the North, southern

institutions of higher education were increasingly integrated in the post-War years and, by 1952,

all of the state universities in the South except those in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi

and South Carolina allowed some black enrollment (Johnson, 1954). In this regard, the decade

following World War II included significant changes in the range of colleges and universities

attended by black Americans, as well as the level of collegiate attainment.



II. Estimation Framework

       Our research questions focus on how World War II service, combined with the

availability of G.I. benefits, changed collegiate outcomes and whether such effects differed for

blacks and whites. First, even without the availability of educational benefits, veterans’ post-war

collegiate outcomes may have exceeded the attainment of non-veterans because veterans have

had higher levels of college-preparedness in the absence of the war. Also, veterans may have

acquired skills during military service that increased measured post-war educational attainment

and civilian productivity. Moreover, the G.I. benefits reduced the direct cost of college through

tuition payments and living stipends, thereby increasing the likelihood of college participation.

        A central question of this analysis is whether the effect on collegiate attainment of

military participation and the availability of educational benefits varied with race and geographic

location. In fact, there is good reason to suspect that the return to education differs by race owing

to discrimination in the labor market or differences in the quality of educational opportunities


                                                                                                Page 10
available to blacks and whites. Pressing in the other direction, if blacks were more likely to face

credit constraints than whites, the addition of G.I. benefits might have somewhat larger effects on

the enrollment behavior of blacks.

Still, this formulation presupposes the presence of elastic supply of enrollment places in the

college market. The evidence discussed above suggests that black men residing in the South may

have faced quite limited college enrollment options. The combination of de jure segregation at

public institutions and limited capacity at private colleges may have limited the collegiate options

for the large waive of returning black veterans in southern states.

          As with a wide array of efforts to measure how a public policy initiative – in this case

World War II and the G.I. Bill – affect educational attainment, the key challenge is to measure a

causal effect rather than to record the association between eligibility and educational outcomes.

Because veterans of both race groups are likely to differ systematically from non-veterans owing

to the screening employed by the Armed Forces, simple comparisons of the educational

attainment of veterans and non-veterans are likely to overstate the effects of military service and

the availability of G.I. benefits on educational attainment. This is particularly true for black men,

since a principal reason for rejection in this group was illiteracy. Thus, finding exogenous

determinants of veteran status is of paramount concern.

          Our strategy for estimating the effects of World War II service and the availability of G.I.

benefits for black Americans is parallel to the regression discontinuity approach employed by

Bound and Turner (2001). Consider a measure of collegiate attainment as a function of veteran

                                                                                               Page 11
where Edij represents the educational attainment (years of college or college completion) of

individual i in cohort j. Vij is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the individual served in World

War II, and εij is an error term. Conceptually, αj represents the mean educational attainment for

randomly selected individuals from cohort j under the assumption that the individual did not

serve in the military, while βij represents the effect of military service for individual i in cohort j.

Note that the coefficient on Vij is allowed to vary across individuals – there is no reason to

believe that service during the war would affect all of those that served in the same way. Some

individuals would have attended college regardless of service; others would not have attended

regardless of service. For both of these populations βij=0. On the other hand, some men would

not have otherwise attended college except for the G.I. benefits available. For this population, the

effect is positive and βij>0. Stated in this way it should be clear that βij represents the impact on

educational attainment of switching the ith individual’s veteran status, while holding the veteran

status of other individuals constant. To understand the (partial equilibrium) impact of the war on

educational attainment, we are interested in estimating β ≡ E ( β ij | Vij = 1) , which in the program

evaluation literature has been referred to as the effect of treatment on the treated. Such a measure

is, by definition, an average treatment effect and a question of this analysis is to consider the

extent to which the treatment effect varies by race and place of birth.

        One can imagine various strategies to estimate β. The simplest approach is to compare

mean educational attainment between veterans and non-veterans for a cohort of individuals:

β cj = [ Ed ij | Vij = 1] − [ Ed ij | Vij = 0] , where the overlines are used to represent sample means. It is

clear that:

                         E ( β$ cj ) = E ( βij |Vij = 1) + [ E (ε ij |Vij = 1) − E (ε ij |Vij = 0)] .
(2)



                                                                                                        Page 12
The term in the square brackets represents the difference in the propensity to go to college of

those that did and did not serve in the military. As long as selection into the military is

nonrandom, this term is unlikely to be 0. However, given the nature of the exemptions from the

draft that existed during World War II, we would expect that for the cohorts that served in World

War II, the term in brackets would be positive. As a result, the simple comparison between those

who did serve and those who did not serve will exaggerate the causal effect of service on

educational attainment ( E ( β$ cj ) > β ).

        The primary strategy we use to try to estimate β is to compare educational attainment

across cohorts employing the methodology known in the evaluation literature as a regression

discontinuity design. Starting with a time-homogeneous environment, that is, the α‘s and the

distribution of the β‘s are constant across cohorts, consider the comparison of cohorts across

time. Define d Ed as Ed ij − Ed ij ' , where the overlines represent averages across individuals

within a specific cohort. Then:

         E(d Ed ) = [E( β ij | V ij = 1)Pr( V ij = 1) - E( β ij ' | V ij ' = 1)Pr( V ij ' = 1)]
(3)                                                                                               .
                                  + [( α j - α j ' ) + E( ε ij - ε ij ' )].

The assumptions imply that the term in the second set of square brackets is 0. Comparing

educational attainment for birth cohorts with significant service during World War II to birth

                                                                              d Ed
cohorts that were born too late to serve [ Pr(Vij ' = 1) = 0 ] yields              as a consistent estimate of
                                                                               dV

E( β ij | V ij = 1) , where Pr(Vij ' = 1) indicates the probability that an individual is a veteran in the

indicated birth cohort. More generally, suppose that Pr(Vij ' = 1) > 0 , but that anyone who served




                                                                                                        Page 13
in the later period would have served during the earlier period and that no one who did not serve

in the earlier period would have served during the later period. Formally we are assuming that:

                                             Vij ' = 1 ⇒ Vij = 1
(4)
                                             Vij = 0 ⇒ Vij ' = 0   .



Under this assumption, cross-cohort changes in educational attainment divided by cross-cohort

changes in the fraction of the cohort serving identify the average effect of service for the

population that would have served in one regime but not in the other – what Imbens and Angrist

(1994) have referred to as the local average treatment effect (LATE).9

         Prior to the start of the war, collegiate attainment followed an upward trajectory for

blacks and whites. In this regard, it seems natural to assume that the αj’s increased over time. The

inclusion of a linear time trend, which is allowed to vary by race, accounts for such secular

change. Therefore, it is deviations from a trend that identify the effects of veteran status for both

blacks and whites, with the model allowing different trends by race. It is also plausible that the

distribution of β‘s might change over time. For example, individuals from cohorts that had, for

the most part, started careers before being inducted would probably be less motivated to attend

college on the G.I. Bill than would individuals drawn from cohorts that were inducted

immediately out of high school. We address this issue by focusing, when possible, on

comparisons between closely adjacent cohorts. In particular, we focus on cohorts that likely

entered military service shortly after turning 18 (or shortly before, if they volunteered).




         9
          In this regard, condition (4) is exactly analogous to the monotonicity condition discussed by Imbens and
Angrist (1994). This empirical strategy closely follows much recent discussion of the estimation of causal effects. It
has long been understood that under suitable assumptions comparisons over time could be used to eliminate selection
bias (Heckman and Robb, 1985). In effect, we are using cohort dummies to form an instrument for veterans’ status.
The connection between instrumental variables and time aggregation has been noted by various authors (e.g. Angrist,
1991; Moffitt, 1995).


                                                                                                              Page 14
         Estimates based on the population of white men may be very different than those for the

population of black men for several reasons including different opportunity costs, returns to

education in the labor market, and effects of military service.10 Distinguishing the data by place

of birth allows for the examination of the hypothesis that segregated educational institutions

attenuated the impact of access to G.I. benefits for blacks from the South.11 Yet, because there

was a large migration of blacks from South to North in young adulthood during this period, a

better test would be to identify outcomes of men born and residing in the South after

demobilization in relation to men born and residing in the North after demobilization. While we

do not observe this classification, we do observe state of residence in 1970 as well as state of

birth. Comparing outcomes among men born and residing in the South in 1970 in relation to

men born and residing in the North after 1970 produces similar outcomes to those reported in the

subsequent section. However, the further stratification of the data for southern-born men,

combined with the reduction in the Census sample size by 1/3 when place of birth and place of

residence are considered, leads to large increases in estimated standard errors.



III. Empirical Results

         As a starting point, it is useful to examine within-cohort differences in the educational

attainment of veterans and non-veterans by race and birthplace. Tables 3 and 4 compare the


         10
             Collins (2001), as well as Margo (1995), demonstrates that black economic progress during the war years
was striking and blacks made particular employment gains in the manufacturing sector, leading to a substantial
narrowing in the black-white wage gap in the decade between 1940 and 1950 (Maloney, 1994).
          11
             The 1970 Census data indicate state of birth and state of current residence, either of which may obviously
differ from state of residence at the time of induction or demobilization. Using data from the 1940-1960 Census
surveys, we estimates nearly 40 percent of men born in the South from the 1923-28 birth cohorts had migrated to the
North by 1960. Yet, comparisons of state of residence in 1940 (when most southern born men were still in the
South) to state of residence in 1950, 1960, and 1970 makes it clear that much of the South to North migration for this
cohort occurred in young adulthood, with roughly half occurring in the 1940s and most of the remaining migration
occurring during the 1950s.


                                                                                                              Page 15
educational attainment of World War II veterans to non-veterans. Using data from the 1970

Census representing 3% of the population, we present estimates of the relationship between

service in World War II and educational attainment (see Data Appendix for additional detail).

These measures of educational attainment by birth year indicate substantial differences between

World War II veterans and men who did not serve in the military, particularly at the collegiate

level. The tables also show large educational attainment differences by veteran status between

blacks and whites (Table 3). For example, among white men who turned 18 during the war (those

born between 1923-1928), veterans received about .45 years more college education than non-

veterans. For blacks, the differences in educational attainment between veterans and non-veterans

are somewhat lower (.29 more years of college and 4 percentage points in college completion),

while the percentage differences are appreciably larger owing to the low baseline levels of

educational attainment among blacks born in the 1920s. It is likely that these simple differences

in education exaggerate the causal effects of World War II service and the availability of G.I.

benefits on collegiate attainment. To the extent that blacks were more likely to be rejected from

the military for illiteracy and other attributes associated with college readiness, blacks were more

likely than whites to be rejected from the military for illiteracy, it is likely that this exaggeration

is larger for blacks than for whites

         Table 4 presents the mean level of educational attainment by World War II veteran status

for blacks born in the South (here defined as: AL, FL, GA, MS, NC, SC, and VA) and blacks

born outside this area.12 While the level of educational attainment for men born outside the


         12
            As discussed in the Data Appendix, the definition of southern states that is the focus of the analysis
includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. A broader
classification of the southern states is considered in the Data Appendix, with regression results included as Appendix
Tables 1-3. Classifying more states as part of the South does not change the qualitative results of our analysis. In the
text, we use the comparisons South/non-South and South/North interchangeably.


                                                                                                                Page 16
South is uniformly greater than for men born in the South, the difference between veterans and

non-veterans is slightly larger among black men born in the South. It is also noteworthy that

blacks born in the South have much lower levels of secondary achievement than those born in

other states. Among non-veterans born in the 1923-28 interval, non-southern black men were

about twice as likely to have graduated from high school as those born in the South. It is well

established that the public education systems in the South lagged those in other states and,

combined with literacy requirements for military service, it is plausible that southern- and

northern-born blacks faced different likelihoods of service by educational attainment. In this

regard, while the observed differences in educational attainment between veteran and non-

veteran blacks born in different geographical areas are nearly identical (.27 to .28 more years of

college and 4 percentage points in college completion), it need not follow that the causal effects

of military service and the availability of G.I. benefits were identical for blacks from the different

regions.

       To reduce the potential upward bias attributable to the greater selectivity of veterans

relative to non-veterans, we employ a between-cohort estimation strategy that relies on the

markedly different probabilities of induction faced by men from adjacent birth cohorts. The

graphical presentation of this strategy (Figure 2) shows the trend in military participation and

educational attainment over a long horizon of 50 years using data from the 1970 census for black

men.

       Limiting the comparisons to those turning 18 during the war (born 1923-1928) mitigates

the effect of potential differences in the educational response to the G.I. Bill among veterans

reaching college age before and after the start of the war. Among this group of men, those with

earlier birth dates stood much higher probabilities of induction in World War II. It is the variation


                                                                                               Page 17
in service participation that identifies the effect of military service and benefits for World War II

participants. Essentially, we compare the educational attainment of men born during the first half

of the 1920s, who would have typically been inducted into the military after finishing high school

in the early 1940s, to men born in the later half of the 1920s, who would have finished high

school at the conclusion of the war.

         Between-cohort estimates for the educational outcomes of years of college and college

completion are shown in Table 5, for blacks and whites overall and then distinguished by birth

for the 1923-28 birth cohorts.13 Estimates in Table 5 reflect aggregate regressions (with each

observation reflecting a quarter of birth average), although the exact instrumental variables

analog is a micro-level regression using quarter-of-birth dummy variables to instrument for the

endogeneity of veteran status. The overall estimates are strikingly smaller than the within-birth

cohort estimates for both blacks and whites. For whites, the point estimates suggest an effect of

World War II and the availability of G.I. benefits of about 0.14 years of college and about 3.5

percentage points in college completions. For blacks, the estimated average effects are similar in

magnitude, though the confidence intervals are quite sizable.

          Turning to the question of whether the effects on educational attainment of World War II

service and the G.I. Bill were similar by region of birth, Figure 3 presents educational attainment

by region for blacks and for whites. Within race groups, northern-born men have greater

educational attainment at both the secondary and college levels. Turning to the regression

estimates presented in columns (2) and (4) of Table 5, it is evident that, among white veterans,

those from the South gained at least as much in collegiate attainment as those from outside the


         13
           Specification tests did not reveal evidence of serial correlation. For this reason, our standard errors are
calculated under the assumption of independence of errors over time. Standard errors are also corrected for
heteroskedasticity in accordance with an estimate of the variance matrix suggested by Huber -White.


                                                                                                                 Page 18
South; the point estimates for white men born in the South are modestly larger though not in a

statistically significant sense. For black veterans, however, those born outside the South

experienced sizable gains at the collegiate level, while those from the South made no significant

gains in educational attainment.

        Expanding the range of birth cohorts used in the estimates helps to sharpen the analysis.

As shown in Table 6, the point estimates of the effect of World War II participation and the

availability of G.I. benefits on years of collegiate attainment do not change much with the

addition of more years of observation. For non-southern blacks, these estimates range from .30

to .41 years of college and 6 to 8 percentage points for college completion. Moreover, the

educational gains associated with World War II service and the availability of G.I. benefits are

consistently indistinguishable from zero for southern-born black veterans. We are limited by the

structure of the education question in the Census data to using years of completed educational

attainment as our outcome variable, with this measure explicitly excluding non-degree credit

enrollment. To the extent that much of the G.I. Bill training took alternative forms, it is

conceivable that there are other interesting and important changes in skills brought about by the

G.I. Bill not captured in this analysis.

        To answer the question of whether the combination of World War II service and G.I.

benefits increased educational attainment, we need to compare the veterans to a “no service/no

benefits” control group. Because men who did not serve in World War II were at risk for service

in the Korean War and those who served in this later conflict were also eligible for educational

benefits, the simple comparison of World War II veterans to non-World War II veterans will not

accomplish this objective. The interval between the conclusion of World War II and the start of

the Korean conflict is short and men from birth cohorts in the 1920s who did not serve in World


                                                                                              Page 19
War II were at increased risk of induction for service in Korea. For both black and white men, the

manpower demands of the Korean conflict intersect the right tail of World War II service, as the

youngest cohorts serving in World War II also participated in the Korean conflict (see Figure 1).14

         To help control for the confounding effects of service in Korea on our estimates of the

effect of World War II service on educational attainment, we first attempted to estimate the

effects of Korean War service directly, but we find that the limitations in sample size preclude

the estimation of our model with two endogenous variables. Instead, we considered a range of

alternatives generated as the assumed magnitude of the Korean War effect changes. Table 7

presents results from estimates in which we have varied the Korean War service effect up to 0.5

in the case of years of college completed to 0.1 in the case of college completion. We also

consider panels of alternative length, ranging from the 1923-28 interval of birth cohorts to the

1923-32 interval of birth cohorts. Plainly, the longer series yields more precise estimates, though

the tradeoff is that the additional cohorts may have faced other appreciably different

circumstances when making their educational investments.

         Assuming positive effects of the Korean War on educational attainment pushes up the

estimated effect of World War II service on educational attainment in a necessarily mechanical

way. Yet, even at the high end of the range of predictions, the effects of World War II and the

G.I. Bill on educational attainment remain more than twice as large for those born outside the

South. Alternative estimates of the effect of the Korean War and the associated benefit program

provide some guidance.


         14
            The service participation in the Korean War peaked at the last quarter of the 1931 birth cohort, as about
48% of black men and 65% of white men were veterans of this conflict. It is also the case that among men service-
eligible for both conflicts, blacks were somewhat more likely to serve in Korea than whites. For example, only 8
percent of white men born in early 1927 served in the Korean conflict but not World War II, whereas about 15
percent of black men in this cohort participated in the Korean conflict but not World War II.


                                                                                                               Page 20
        In suggesting a preferred estimate among the ranges presented in Table 7, one strategy is

to look to alternative sources to pin down the magnitude of the Korean War effect for blacks.

Although the Survey of Veterans records only a small number of black veterans from the Korean

War, it nevertheless provides one of the few gauges of the Korean War effect. This source points

to an effect of the Korean War on educational attainment of about .23 years of college (see

Appendix Table 4), which would correspond to point estimates of .42 (.14) and .04 (.16) for

black men born in the North and South, respectively, using data from the 1923-28 interval. A

disadvantage of the Survey of Veterans is that it is not possible to disaggregate by location. There

is no reason to assume that the effects of the Korean War and associated G.I. benefits were

identical for men born in and outside the South. On the one hand, the evidence from World War

II points to more limited higher education opportunities for blacks from the South relative to

outside the South; on the other, the wave of litigation emphasizing equal opportunities for blacks

combined with the addition to facilities at the historically black colleges after World War II may

have markedly widened opportunities for southern-born blacks in the 1950s. Within cohort

estimates of the educational attainment of Koran War veterans relative to non-veterans provide

an alternative set of Korean War estimates with distinction by region. These estimates, which

place the Korean War effect at .47 years of college in the South and .35 years of college outside

the South, effectively define an upper limit. Still, when the effect of the Korean War on

educational attainment is restricted to these values, the estimated gain in collegiate attainment

attributable to World War II service and the G.I. Bill is more than .3 years larger for black men

from non-southern states relative to those born in the South.15


        15
           An additional strategy for identifying the effect G.I. benefits available to Korean veterans on the
education of blacks and whites and by region follows the approach identified by Stanley (2000), which compares
men commencing service before January 31, 1955 who are benefit-eligible to those who begin service thereafter and


                                                                                                          Page 21
         It is important to emphasize that the nature of our estimation strategy of using variation

over time in military participation to identify deviations from a trend in collegiate attainment

makes it difficult to distinguish the importance of competing interpretations. First, it is well

documented that resources per student at the elementary and secondary levels were particularly

low in segregated schools in southern states. As such, the low quality of schooling received by

black veterans at the primary and secondary levels may have impeded opportunities to benefit

from collegiate training through the G.I. Bill.16

         Moreover, supply-side constraints in higher education are likely to have restricted

collegiate choices among blacks in the South, also decreasing the effect of G.I. benefits. Within

the South, institutions open to blacks were too few and too small to accommodate the population

of black veterans with G.I. benefits.17 If college education opportunities for southern-born blacks

were limited by their preparedness to attend college or by a limited market supply, it might be

expected that blacks would have pursued vocational training or other skill development with G.I.

benefits. Still, regardless of the level or type of training, we find little evidence that military


are not benefit eligible. Data from the 1980 Census identifies veterans by birth cohort, race, place of birth, and the
conflict in which they participated, though these data do not have the date of service commencement or rich
covariates which are available in the OCG data employed by Stanley. Nevertheless, estimates using the sharp break
in benefit eligibility in 1955 to identify the effect of the Korean War G.I. Bill on educational attainment of those men
turning 18 near the start of service participation (the 1934-1939 birth cohorts) suggests that this program had a
somewhat larger effect on the collegiate attainment of black men from the South than those born outside the South.
However, these results are not estimated precisely enough to introduce in the text.
          16
             Card and Krueger (1992) provide substantial evidence on the narrowing in resource differences (e.g., the
pupil teacher ratio) between schools for blacks and whites in the segregated states which started early in the 20th
Century and continued through the years when the World War II cohorts were enrolled in school. Differences
between black and white students from the South in the change in school resources are captured in the race-specific
time trends. Card and Krueger (1992) also present evidence on the differential return to education for blacks and
whites, with blacks from states with particularly large differences in educational resources by race also experiencing
lower returns to education. Differences in elementary and secondary school quality combined with discrimination in
the labor market may well have lowered the expected return to college for black veterans from the South.
          17
             In addition to the limitations in physical capacity, the inability to expand the faculty may have severely
affected the supply response of colleges for blacks in the South. Thompson (1946) highlights this problem noting
that, not only did the war itself limit the supply of prospective young faculty, but able men were often taking
advantage of the G.I. Bill to obtain advanced degrees and salaries at the black colleges were quite low and these
institutions were unable to compete in the faculty labor market with colleges and universities in the North and West.


                                                                                                                Page 22
service and the availability of education benefits changed skill acquisition of black veterans from

the South. Ideally, we would be able to do more to distinguish the hypothesis that low

elementary and secondary school quality reduced the expected return to college for black

veterans from the South from the hypothesis that limitations in collegiate supply restricted

attainment of black veterans from the South. We have stratified the southern sample along the

lines of school quality and included veteran status interacted with state-level school quality

measures in our estimation. There is not evidence that states with poor elementary-secondary

schools have smaller educational gains associated with the G.I. Bill, but the standard errors are

large enough that we are unable to put much weight on these results. While it is hard to pin

down whether the low quality of the segregated southern schools directly reduced educational

gains made available by the G.I. Bill, there is ample evidence from the historical record that the

limited supply response of colleges and universities in the segregated states reduced the

educational gains of black veterans from the South.



IV. Discussion

        How the G.I. Bill affected the level of education among men from different races and

backgrounds is an important question in both educational history and public policy analysis.

Models of educational investment suggest that the benefit provisions associated with the G.I. Bill

might well be expected to have a larger effect on the average educational outcomes of blacks

than whites, owing to lower opportunity costs and the potentially larger relative reduction in

credit constraints.18 For white men, the combination of World War II service and the availability

           Measures of the median income for white and black men in 1948 provide an indicator of relative
opportunity costs, with the median income for black men $1,363 and the median income for white men $2,510 (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2000).


                                                                                                        Page 23
of G.I. benefits had substantial positive effects on collegiate attainment, and these effects were

similar in magnitude for men born in different geographic regions. For black men, we find that

the effect of military service and the availability of the G.I. Bill differs markedly between men

born in the southern states and those born elsewhere, with former experiencing appreciably little

gain in educational attainment in comparison to the latter. Beyond collegiate attainment, non-

collegiate vocational and technical training was a major component of the World War II G.I. Bill,

with more veterans receiving training in these institutions than in colleges. Yet, available

evidence does not suggest that this avenue was a substitute for collegiate participation among

black men born in the South. Rather, black men in the South also had a particularly difficult time

gaining access to vocational and on-the-job training programs with G.I. benefits (Onkst, 1998).

       The absence of behavioral effects of World War II and the G.I. Bill on black veterans

from the South parallels results obtained by Collins (2001) in association with the Fair

Employment Practice Commission during World War II. Collins finds that efforts to enforce

complaints associated with Executive Order 8802, which barred discrimination in war-related

industries, led to wage gains for black workers in the North, while political opposition to the

goals of the program contributed to its ineffectiveness in the South.

       The results of this analysis illustrate some of the potential pitfalls associated with

decentralized federal initiatives. Contemporary advocates for choice-based reform in education

have often trumpeted the success of the G.I. Bill, using its favorable effects as a motivation for

vouchers (Hauptman, 1999). Yet, this analysis indicates that state-level policies and conditions

may undermine the equal distribution of such programs. The structure of the G.I. Bill ceded the

responsibility for overseeing and administering many of the educational benefits to the states

(Onkst, 1998). Congress did not create a set of uniform standards for implementation nor was


                                                                                                Page 24
there a regulatory mechanism to ensure equal access to program benefits. As a result, the

intersection of federal programs such as the G.I. Bill with significantly different state policies

yielded substantial interstate differences in outcomes.

       The availability of benefits to black veterans had a substantial and positive impact on the

educational attainment of those likely to have access to colleges and universities outside the

South. Unfortunately, for those more likely to be limited to the South in their collegiate choices,

the G.I. Bill exacerbated rather than narrowed the economic and educational differences between

blacks and whites.

        The 1970 Decennial Census is the primary source for the empirical work in this

analysis. Micro data files for the 1970 Census use the long-form questionnaire distributed

to 15% of the population, with data available in three 1/100 samples.19 (The 1/100

samples identify either state, county group, or neighborhood characteristics.) Individuals

included in this analysis are those born in the continental United States. Observations for

which information was allocated for sex, age, race, veteran status, place of birth or

educational attainment are not included in the analysis. The classification of educational

attainment uses information and highest grade attended as follows. “College graduate” is

equal to one for all individuals completing at least 16 years of education and is zero for

all other cases. “Years of college completed” is equal to the maximum of 0 and years of

college completed (up to 4).

        In classifying states geographically into “non-South” and “South” in this analysis,

our aim is to distinguish those states with legislatively enforced segregation. While 17

states maintained some form of segregation in higher education at the start of World War

II, such a broad classification misses substantial variation within these states in the degree

to which race limited higher educational opportunities across states. In terms of empirical

analysis, the capacity to make finely grained distinctions about the outcomes of blacks at




        19
            A somewhat different set of questions is available on the 5% and the 15% questionnaires, with
the 15% questionnaire including the items on veteran status.
         The use of data from the 1970 Census in this analysis rather than data from the 1980 Census is
motivated by the observation that for cohorts born during the 1920s and 1930s the 1980 census shows
substantially higher levels of educational attainment than does the 1970 census. These differences
presumably have more to do with differential mortality, education inflation, and adult participation in
college than the lingering effects of war service.


                                                                                                   Page 29
the state level or several groups of states is constrained by the relatively small number of

blacks observed and their geographical concentration in the southern states.

       Following important judicial decisions including Missouri ex real Gaines v

Canada (1938) and McLaurin v Oklahoma State Regents (1950), many southern

universities quietly opened their universities to blacks. By 1952, only five states –

Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi -- still barred blacks from

their publicly supported universities. For this reason, the primary definition of “southern”

states employed in this analysis focuses on these five states plus Virginia and North

Carolina, representing the states in which segregation had long historical roots and was

generally supported though the local judicial process. Appendix Tables 1-3 present

regression results with a broader classification of southern states that includes AL, AR,

FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA. Using this classification the number of

blacks in the southern states increases from 7,051 to 10,357 and the number elsewhere

decreases from 6,883 to 3,577.

       While the large samples of the Decennial Census provide a particular advantage in

the cross-cohort estimation strategy, the 1979 Survey of Veterans provides supplemental

information on the utilization of veterans benefits and the duration of military service,

and more specific data on veterans serving in conflicts from World War II through the

Vietnam conflict. The Survey of Veterans draws its pool of veterans from the March 1978

CPS question on military service. The primary questions of interest for this study cover

information on the use of educational benefits and educational attainment before and after

military service.
