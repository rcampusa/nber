         "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator

1. Introduction

         One thing that unites different kinds of social scientists is a concern to understand the forces that

affect people's well-being. What makes individuals happy? What leads to happy societies? These are

difficult questions, but they seem important.

         This paper studies the numbers that people report when asked questions about how happy they

feel and how satisfied with life. There are, transparently, limitations to such statistics, and an inquiry of

this sort suffers the disadvantage that controlled experiments are out of reach. But it seems unlikely that

human happiness can be understood without, in part, listening to what human beings say.

         Sources of information exist that have for many years recorded individuals' survey responses to

questions about well-being.             These responses have been studied intensively by psychologists1,

examined a little by sociologists and political scientists2, and largely ignored by economists3. Some

economists may defend this neglect. They will emphasize the unreliability of subjective data – perhaps

because they are unaware of the large literature by research psychologists that uses such numbers, or

perhaps because they believe economists are better judges of human motivation than those researchers.

Most economists, however, are probably unaware that data of this sort are available, and have not

thought of whether empirical measures approximating the theoretical construct 'utility' might be useful in

their discipline.

2. On Happiness and Measurement

           One definition of happiness is the degree to which an individual judges the overall quality of his

or her life as favorable (Veenhoven 1991, 1993). Psychologists draw a distinction between the well-

being from life as a whole and the well-being associated with a single area of life: these they term

"context-free" and "context-specific". These researchers view it as natural that a concept such as

happiness should be studied in part by asking people how they feel.

           One issue in the psychology literature has been whether a well-being measure is, in their

terminology, reliable and valid. Self-reported measures are recognized to be a reflection of at least four

factors: circumstances, aspirations, comparisons with others, and a person's baseline happiness or

dispositional outlook (e.g. Warr 1980, Chen and Spector, 1991)).               Konow and Earley (1999)

describes evidence that recorded happiness levels have been demonstrated to be correlated with:

1. Objective characteristics such as unemployment.

2. The person’s recall of positive versus negative life-events.

3. Assessments of the person’s happiness by friends and family members.

4. Assessments of the person’s happiness by his or her spouse.

5. Duration of authentic or so-called Duchenne smiles (a Duchenne smile occurs when both the

zygomatic major and obicularus orus facial muscles fire, and human beings identify these as ‘genuine’

smiles).

6. Heart rate and blood-pressure measures responses to stress.

7. Skin-resistance measures of response to stress

8. Electroencephelogram measures of prefrontal brain activity.

Rather than summarize the psychological literature’s assessment of well-being data, this paper refers

readers to the checks on self-reported happiness statistics that are discussed in Argyle (1989) and

Myers (1993), and to psychologists’ articles on reliability and validity, such as Fordyce (1985), Larsen,

Diener, and Emmons (1984), Pavot and Diener (1993), and Watson and Clark (1991).

          The idea used in the paper is that there exists a reported well-being function

          r = h(u(y, z, t)) + e                              (1)

where r is some self-reported number or level (perhaps the integer 4 on a satisfaction scale, or “very

happy” on an ordinal happiness scale), u(…) is to be thought of as the person’s true well-being or

utility, h(.) is a continuous non-differentiable function relating actual to reported well-being, y is real

income, z is a set of demographic and personal characteristics, t is the time period, and e is an error

term. As plotted in Figure 1, the function h(.) rises in steps as u increases. It is assumed, as seems

plausible, that u(…) is a function that is observable only to the individual. Its structure cannot be

conveyed unambiguously to the interviewer or any other individual. The error term, e, then subsumes

among other factors the inability of human beings to communicate accurately their happiness level (your

‘two’ may be my ‘three’)4. The measurement error in reported well-being data would be less easily

handled if well-being were to be used as an independent variable.

          This approach may be viewed as an empirical cousin of the experienced-utility idea advocated

by Kahneman et al (1997). The structure of equation 1 makes it suitable for estimation as an ordered




4 It may be worth remarking that this approach recognises the social scientist’s instinctive distrust of a single person’s
subjective ‘utility’. An analogy might be to a time before human beings had accurate ways of measuring people’s height. Self-
reported heights would contain information but be subject to large error. They would predominantly be useful as ordinal data,
and would be more valuable when averaged across people than used as individual observations.



                                                                   3
probit or logit. In this way, ‘true’ utility is the latent variable, and the subjectivity of responses can be

thought of as being swept into the error term.

        It is possible to view some of the self-reported well-being questions in the psychology literature

as assessments of a person’s lifetime or expected stock value of future utilities. Equation 1 would then

be rewritten as an integral over the u(…) terms. This paper, however, will use a happiness question that

seems more naturally interpreted as a flow rather than a stock.

        In what has since emerged as seminal research, Easterlin (1974, and more recently 1995) was

one of the first social scientists to study data over time on the reported level of happiness in the United

States. One of his aims was to argue that individual well-being is the same across poor countries and

rich countries. The author suggests that we should think of people as getting utility from a comparison of

themselves with others close to them: happiness is relative. Hirsch (1976), Scitovsky (1976), Layard

(1980), Frank (1985, 1999) and Schor (1998) have argued a similar thesis; a different tradition, with

equivalent implications, begins with Cooper and Garcia-Penalosa (1999) and Keely (1999).

        On the trend in well-being over time, Easterlin's paper concludes: "... in the one time-series

studied, that for the United States since 1946, higher income was not systematically accompanied by

greater happiness" (p.118). This result has become well-known. Oswald (1997) makes the point that

Richard Easterlin's data may not actually support it; his longest consistent set of happiness levels seems

to find that Americans were becoming happier (39% very happy in 1946 to 53% very happy in 1957).

But, as Easterlin shows, splicing together surveys with slightly different well-being questions over a

longer set of years does suggest a flat trend in well-being in the early post-war period.

        This paper begins by examining information from the General Social Surveys of the United

States. Although little used by economists, these have for many years been interviewing people about

their levels of happiness. GSS data are available in most of the years from 1972 to 1998. The size of


                                                     4
sample averages approximately fifteen hundred individuals per annum. Different people are interviewed

each year: the GSS is not a panel.

        Are Americans getting happier over time? In the early 1970s, 34% of those interviewed in the

General Social Survey described themselves as ‘very happy’. By the late 1990s, the figure was 30%.

For women, the numbers go from 36% at the start of the period, to 29% a quarter of a century later.

The raw patterns are in Table 1. The question asked is:

Taken all together, how would you say things are these days -- would you say that you are very

happy, pretty happy, or not too happy? (GSS Question 157)

The same wording has been used for the last twenty six years. It is clear from the table that there is a

reasonable amount of stability in the proportion of people giving different well-being scores, and that,

not unexpectedly, the bulk of survey respondents place themselves in the middle category (‘pretty

happy’) of those offered.

        To explore the issue more carefully, it is natural to look at a regression-adjusted time trend.

Table 2A estimates regression equations in which the dependent variable is reported happiness. These

ordered logit equations control only for exogenous demographic characteristics: age, age squared,

gender, and race.

        Table 2A contains a number of findings that might have been hard to predict. Column 1 of the

table shows that America is apparently becoming systematically less happy (in the eyes of Americans

themselves). There is a negative time trend, -0.0027, with a t-statistic sufficiently large to allow the null

hypothesis of zero to be rejected. Men report lower happiness scores than women, although the size of

the difference between males and females appears to be small. Blacks and other non-white races are




                                                     5
less happy than whites. This effect is large5 (we return to the issue later in the paper) and well-defined.

The black dummy variable has a coefficient in column 1 of Table 2A of –0.7, with a t-statistic that

exceeds twenty. There is a concave shape in age. In column 1 of Table 2A, over the relevant range,

happiness grows with age. When other controls are introduced, however, it will be seen later in the

paper that a minimum emerges around the middle of life. The monotonicity in Table 2A disappears

when other independent variables -- especially work status and marriage -- are added.

          Given the starkness of the conclusion that the USA has, in aggregate, apparently become more

miserable over the last quarter of a century, it seems useful to examine sub-samples of the population.

Later columns of Table 2A do that. Columns 2 and 3 reveal that it is women rather than men who are

experiencing the decline in well-being. This might be viewed as paradoxical: the last few decades are

often seen as a period in the US in which discrimination against women has come down. Men report

flat levels of well-being over this period (the time trend coefficient in column 2 of Table 2A is positive

but insignificantly different from zero). In both male and female columns, reported happiness rises as

individuals get older. Moreover, the black coefficient is large and negative in both equations. It is

possible to view this as evidence of discrimination against black people.

          Columns 4 and 5 of Table 2A separate the data by race. An interesting finding emerges. It can

be seen, in column 5, that blacks are the only demographic group to be experiencing a statistically

significant upward time trend in reported happiness. The concave shape in age disappears. The male

dummy variable enters differently in columns 4 and 5; black men say they are happier than black

women. Whites’ happiness is trended strongly down over time -- in the sense that the time trend’s




5 Although for convenience the paper’s prose refers to coefficients, what is meant throughout the paper is ‘marginals’ in the
usual ordered-logit sense.



                                                               6
coefficient has a small standard error -- in column 4 of Table 2A. Therefore, over the period, the gap

between the well-being of American whites and blacks has narrowed.

         The last two columns of Table 2A look at age. Older people, in column 7, have a clear

downward movement in well-being. In column 8 the young are slightly up, by contrast, although the

trend is not well-defined.

         Table 2B changes from sub-samples with only exogenous characteristics. It reports regression

equations for other sub-groups of the population (looking at categories that are endogenous and thus, to

a large degree, chosen by the individuals). In columns 8-10, the downward time trend is greatest for

those who are out of the labor force. The consistently large black dummy in columns 8-14 is

noteworthy.

         Columns 11 and 12 divide the sample into Americans who have small and large amounts of

education. Interestingly, the size of the downward time trend is approximately the same in the two sub-

groups. Conventional wisdom would not have predicted this; it is widely thought to have been a better

era for the highly educated.

         Columns 13-14 of Table 2B split the sample according to marital status – with the married as

one category, while the other category combines the never married, those currently widowed or

separated, and those divorced. In both columns, the time trend in happiness is positive. It is well-

defined. This suggests that the statistical finding of a downward time trend in US happiness could be

caused by a failure to distinguish between married and unmarried people. The decline of marriage in

America -- from 67% of adults in the mid 70s to 48% by the late 90s -- may be one reason for the

secular decline in happiness through the decades. But we show in the next section that this is probably

not the full story.




                                                   7
           These US equations6 treat each person's reported happiness level as ordinal in much the way

that economic theory’s use of indifference curves does. Tables 2A and 2B do not assume cardinal

utility.

           It is useful to check these patterns on another country. Although there are differences of detail,

data from Great Britain give noticeably similar results. Here it is necessary to use a life-satisfaction

question because there is no British happiness question over most of the required period. Questions

about people’s satisfaction with life seem of independent interest. Moreover, for the short run of years

(1975-1986) over which both types of data are available, Appendix 2 confirms that the structures of

happiness and life-satisfaction equations are similar.

           The Eurobarometer Surveys provide cross-section information on approximately 55,000

Britons starting from the early 1970s (the annual sample is just over two thousand people). In each year

they are asked:

On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with

the life you lead? (Eurobarometer Survey Series).

The data come from the cumulative file and thirteen other surveys. In a way reminiscent of the US

happiness results, the lower half of Table 1 illustrates that in the early 1970s approximately a third of

British people say they are ‘very satisfied’ with life. The number is unchanged by the late 1990s.

Appendix 3 shows the equivalent for Europe.

           Table 3A reports the same kinds of logit regression equations as for the US. Here life

satisfaction is the dependent variable. It is not possible to include a dummy variable for race; but age,



6 These are, as explained, ordered logits. The usual approach in the psychology literature has been instead to assign numbers to
happiness levels and then to use ordinary OLS regression methods. Strictly speaking, this is illegitimate (it cannot be assumed
that "very happy" equals, say, twice "pretty happy"). Nevertheless, as shown in Appendix 1, we have found that the simple
method gives similar results to those from ordered logits.



                                                                8
age squared, gender, and a time trend, are again used as regressors. Column 1 of Table 3A finds that

well-being has not risen systematically in Great Britain from 1973 to 1998. Although the coefficient on

Time is positive, it is small and poorly defined (the t-statistic is 0.25). British males are less content than

females. Age enters in a convex way: well-being is U-shaped in years.

         Columns 2-5 of Table 3A break the data into different sub-samples (males, females, young,

old). None of these groups has a statistically significant time-trend in well-being. Although poorly

defined, the trends on males and females go in the opposite way from the United States. There is a

well-defined U-shape in age in each of the five sub-samples separately. Regardless of age group,

columns 4 and 5 of Table 3A show that men report lower well-being scores.

         Table 3B examines further sub-samples for Great Britain. For those in work, column 6 reveals

that there is a statistically significant upward time trend in life satisfaction. Its coefficient is 0.006. There

is no time trend among the out-of-the-labor-force group (the OLFs). Among the OLF individuals, men,

who are disproportionately the retired, are more satisfied than women. The age and gender variables

continue to enter as before. Columns 9 and 10 separate into those people with low and high levels of

education (ALS is ‘age left school’); both have time trends that are down, and approximately at the

border of significance at the five per cent level.

         An interesting finding in Table 3B is in columns 11-12. As was found for the United States,

married people in Britain report secularly rising well-being over this quarter of a century. The coefficient

is 0.0057 with a t-statistic of approximately four. Unmarried people, by contrast, have a flat time-trend.

The proportion of the sample who are married changes from 72% in the early 1970s to 55% by the late

1990s.




                                                       9
3. Happiness Equations with a Full Set of Controls

        The next step is to explore the patterns in well-being data by allowing for a larger set of

controls, and especially for the effects of income and other economic variables. Table 4 begins this.

Using again pooled US data from the beginning of the 1970s, it estimates ordered logit happiness

equations in which are included a time trend, age and age squared, dummies for demographic and work

characteristics, years of education, and dummies for marital status (including whether the individual’s

parents were divorced). Sample size is approximately 36,000.

        The first column of Table 4 continues to find a downward trend in American happiness.

However, the coefficient on time is smaller than in Table 2, with a t-statistic of approximately 1.3. This

suggests that it is changes in factors such as marital status and working life that explain part of the

downward movement in reported levels of contentment. The null hypothesis of no change over time

cannot be rejected in column 1 of Table 4.

        Looking across the columns, however, in this fuller specification it can be seen how different

groups within the US economy have fared differently. Men’s happiness has an upward trend in Table 4,

column 2. Yet American women’s well-being has fallen through the years. Blacks have trended up

over time, with a large coefficient of 0.009. Whites’ well-being has been down. Income is at this

juncture deliberately omitted from this table – to allow changing real incomes to be absorbed into the

time variable.

        One of the interesting conclusions, from the economist’s point of view, is how influential non-

financial variables appear to be in human welfare. The new variables, in the lower half of Table 4, enter

powerfully. Work and marital status variables have large and well-defined effects. The single greatest

depressant of reported happiness is the variable ‘separated’; this is closely followed by ‘widowed’.




                                                   10
Being unemployed is apparently almost as bad, and also has a small standard error. According to the

estimates, the joblessness effect is close in size to the unhappiness associated with divorce.

        Marital break-up features in two other ways in Table 4. Second and subsequent marriages

appear from these estimates to be less happy than first marriages. This confirms a result in the

psychology literature (for example, Diener et al 1999). Moreover, a person whose parents were

divorced (when the respondent was aged 16) has himself or herself a lower level of well-being in

adulthood. It is not clear, of course, how much this kind of effect is truly causal. Genes rather than life

events could be the explanation for such patterns in the data.

        Years of education enter positively in a happiness equation. An economist might have guessed

that this would occur -- because schooling would act as a proxy for earnings. A later table, however,

reveals that it cannot be an earnings effect of this sort. Education is playing a role independently of

income. The exact effect of age upon reported happiness is of interest. It is U-shaped, in Table 4, with

a minimum in the late 30s.

        Further checks, not reported, found that the addition of dummy variables for the number of

children had coefficients that were small and insignificantly different from zero. State dummies were

sometimes statistically significant but left the structure of the equations unchanged. Being religious

entered positively but did not affect other coefficients.

        When confronted with well-being data, it is natural for an economist to ask whether richer

people report greater levels of well-being. The idea that income buys happiness is one of the

assumptions -- made without evidence but rather for deductive reasons -- in microeconomics

textbooks7. To explore this, the trend is dropped, and replaced with year dummies (to pick up, among

other things, the nominal price level). Table 5 is the result for the US. Income per capita in the




                                                     11
household enters positively with a t-statistic exceeding twelve. Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly

from an economist’s point of view, the coefficients on the other variables in Table 5’s well-being

equations hardly alter. The amount of happiness bought by extra income is not as large as some would

expect. To put this differently, the non-economic variables in happiness equations enter with large

coefficients, relative to that on income.

          Table 5, or its ordinary least squares equivalent (see Appendix 1), can be used to do a form of

happiness calculus. The relative size of any two coefficients provides information about how one

variable would have to change to maintain constant well-being in the face of an alteration in the other

variable. To ‘compensate’ for a major life event such as being widowed or a marital separation, it

would be necessary -- this calculation should be treated cautiously but it illustrates the size of the

coefficients -- to provide an individual with approximately $100,000 extra per annum8. Diener, Gohm,

Suh and Oishi (undated) contains complementary evidence about the psychological benefits of marriage

in different countries.

          A different interpretation of this type of correlation is that happy people are more likely to stay

married. It is clear that this hypothesis cannot easily be dismissed if only cross-section data are

available. However, panel data on well-being suggest that similarly large effects are found when looking

longitudinally at changes (thus differencing out person-specific fixed effects).                          See, for example,

Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998) and Clark (1999). There is also a separate literature in which it

is concluded that marriage seems to provide protection against depression and mental ill-health (a recent

paper, with references, is Cochrane, 1996).



7 An indirect utility function is of course increasing in income, and consumer theory can be done using revealed preference alone.
8 In 1990s dollars. For simplicity we have here used the ordinary least squares equation; similar numbers can be derived from
ordered logits.



                                                               12
          If high income goes with more happiness, and characteristics such as unemployment and being

black go with less happiness, it is reasonable to wonder whether a monetary value could be put on

some of the other things that are associated with disutility. Further calculation suggests that to

'compensate' men exactly for unemployment would take a rise in income of approximately $60,000 per

annum, and to 'compensate' for being black would take $30,000 extra per annum. These are large

sums, and in a sense are a reflection of the low happiness value of extra income9.

          British results are comparable. They are contained in Table 6. Here it is not possible to control

as fully for income. However, the later columns of Table 6 incorporate an indicator of the family income

quartile in which the individual falls.

          Table 6 assumes that, apart from their income, a person’s satisfaction with life depends upon a

time trend, age and its square, gender, whether retired or keeping house or a student, work status, and

marital status. A set of age-left-school dummies are also included to capture the individual’s educational

attainment. The time trend enters positively in column 1, with a coefficient of 0.0038 and t-statistic of

2.84. One interpretation of this is that well-being has been rising through the years in Great Britain –

contrary to the United States. However, that would be somewhat misleading, because what is being

measured is a ceteris paribus effect. It needs to be compared to the zero coefficient on Time in Table

3A. The net effect of the variables listed in Table 6 is to remove the forces making for declining life

satisfaction. In answering the question ‘has Britain become more content?’ it is therefore necessary to

bear in mind the large rise in unemployment and fall in marriage.

          The time trend for men in column 2 of Table 6 is larger than for women in column 3. Men

appear to enjoy keeping house less than do women. Unemployment hits a male harder than it does a


9 It should be recalled that no trades are actually taking place, that budget constraints are not directly relevant in a simple sense,
and that economists find these large partly because they are used to thinking, possibly incorrectly, of pecuniary factors as



                                                                 13
female. Women living as married are happier than those who are single, but markedly less than those

who are legally married.

          In Table 6, columns 4-6, it can be seen that the introduction of an independent variable for the

person’s income quartile affects other coefficients only a little. It continues to be true that joblessness

hurts men more than women. The costs of unemployment are large relative to the costs from taking a

cut in income. British men continue to be less contented than British women.

          Table 7 sets out the British version of the United States equations of Table 4. The structure of

the two is similar – despite the fact that the dependent variable is life satisfaction rather than happiness.

Here a set of year-dummies controls for all macroeconomic changes in the British economy. The

variables for income quartiles enter in a monotonic way: richer people are systematically more satisfied

with their lives. In each of the three columns of Table 7, unemployment enters with a large negative

coefficient. Men keeping house continue to be less satisfied with life.

          The U-shape in age is again present in Tables 6 and 7. A notable feature is that the minimum is

reached around the same age range for British men and women separately (39 in column 5 of Table 6

for men, and age 41 for women in column 6). Something systematic appears to be at work. No

explanation is available even in the psychology literature. One tentative possibility is that this decline and

then rise in well-being through the years may reflect a process of adaptation to circumstances; perhaps,

by the middle of their lives, people relinquish some of their aspirations and thereby come to enjoy life

more.

4. Arguments and Counter-Arguments

          Equation 1 treats the subjectivity of responses as a component of the error term, but there still

exist objections to the analysis.


providing most of life’s well-being.


                                                     14
        First, it is not possible to control here for person-specific fixed effects, or, in other words, for

people’s dispositions. Nevertheless, the data are random cross-sections, and therefore suitable for the

estimation of time trends. What small amount of regression work has been done on panels, moreover,

finds similar microeconomic patterns to those documented here.

        Second, individuals are not randomly assigned to events like divorce, so the calculation of, for

example, the value of marriage describes an association in the data rather than clear cause-and-effect.

This is an important problem. In the generic sense it is of course common throughout applied

economics. The pragmatic response, here and elsewhere, is that at this point in the history of economic

research it is necessary to document patterns and to be circumspect about causality. As explained

earlier, marriage is believed by psychologists and psychiatrists to provide a protective effect to mental

well-being (Argyle, 1989, contains further discussion of the evidence), but unambiguous proof would

require a sharper statistical test than is possible with these data.

        Third, people in the early 1970s may have used words differently from those in 1998 (so

‘happy’ no longer means exactly the same, perhaps). This is not immediately plausible; it would be

more so over a century. Nevertheless, in so far as it holds, the paper’s approach would be open to

doubt, although the cross-section regression patterns would continue to be immune as long as year-

dummies accurately captured the change-in-language effect as a set of intercept shifts.

        Fourth, ‘satisfaction’ scores, as here for the British data set, may be inherently untrended –

perhaps because people unknowingly anchor their language on an observed aspiration level and adjust

accordingly through the years.       If true, this would create difficulties for some of the time-trend

conclusions for Britain. But the cross-section findings would hold, and the US happiness results would

go through.




                                                      15
        The analysis is not an attempt to define ‘utility’ in an exact empirical way. Nevertheless, the

philosophy underlying the paper is that subjective well-being data may turn out to be useful to

economists (as such statistics have to psychologists).

5. Conclusions

        Reported levels of happiness are dropping through time in the United States. Life satisfaction is

approximately flat in Great Britain. In a period of increasing material prosperity -- our data cover the

period from the early 1970s to the late 1990s -- these results may surprise some observers.

        Richard Easterlin (1974) argued that economic growth does not bring happiness to a society.

Our data begin around the time of that article’s publication, and our work provides some support, a

quarter of a century later, for his views. Nevertheless, the picture is not a simple one. Some groups in

society -- such as American men and blacks -- have become happier through the decades. Moreover,

once the British equations control for enough personal characteristics (including whether unemployed or

divorced), there is evidence of a statistically significant upward movement in well-being since the 1970s.

This effect may be due to higher real income.

        Other results emerge. In so far as conclusions can be drawn from random cross-section

samples of people, they are the following.

1. Whatever the consequences of anti female-discrimination policy elsewhere in society, it has

apparently not been successful in either country in creating rising well-being among women.

2. Black people in the US appear to be much less happy, ceteris paribus, than whites.                One

interpretation of this is that our methods provide a new way to document the existence of discrimination.

3. The difference in the well-being of racial groups in the United States has narrowed over the last few

decades. Blacks have made up some ground, in other words.




                                                   16
4. Our calculations suggest that to 'compensate' men for unemployment would take a rise in income at

the mean of approximately $60,000 per annum, and to 'compensate' for being black would take

$30,000 extra per annum. A lasting marriage is worth $100,000 per annum when compared to being

widowed or separated. Because there is no precedent for such calculations in the published social

science literature, they should be treated cautiously.

5. Higher income is associated with higher happiness.

6. Reported well-being is greatest among women, married people, the highly educated, and those

whose parents did not divorce. It is low among the unemployed. Second marriages are less happy.

7. Happiness and life satisfaction are U-shaped in age. In both Britain and the US, well-being reaches

a minimum, other things held constant, around the age of forty. This regularity is not known to most

social scientists.

Notes: Income quartiles have to be used because of the way in which the data are coded. Some sweeps have no income data, so
the number of observations is lower than in earlier tables.
The number of age-left-school dummies equals 12 in columns 1-3, and equals 9 in columns 4-6. This is necessary because of the
way in which Eurobarometer 43.1 - International Trade and Radiation Protection: April-May 1995 (#6839) is coded.

                                              The OLS form

If a simple OLS happiness regression is estimated, using the US General Social Survey, it produces the
following equation. The means are as stated. The dependent variable is constructed by assigning 3 to
very happy, 2 to pretty happy, and 1 to not too happy. There is then an implicit assumption of
cardinality.

The coefficients on the independent variables include (with t statistics in parentheses):

                                       Life-Satisfaction Means for Europe

The level of life satisfaction in Europe as a whole also appears to have been roughly constant over time.
According to the Eurobarometer surveys, the means (weighted by their relative sizes) to the life
satisfaction question referred to in the paper for the first 12 members of the EU (France, Belgium,
Netherlands, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, UK, Greece, Spain, Portugal)
were as follows:


                                  1973                1983                    1997

Not at all satisfied                4%                   6                     5

Not very satisfied                16                   16                     17

Fairly satisfied                  58                   59                     59
