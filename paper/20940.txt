Understanding whether racial attitudes are malleable is critical for addressing the underlying causes
of racial discrimination. We examine whether white males' stated attitudes and behavior toward African
Americans change based on the number and type of black peers to whom they are exposed. To overcome
selection bias, we exploit data from the U.S. Air Force Academy in which students are randomly assigned
to peer groups. Results show significant evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis. White males are
significantly affected by both the number (quantity) and aptitude (quality) of the black peers with whom
they are exposed. Specifically, white men randomly assigned to higher-aptitude black peers report
being more accepting of blacks in general and are more likely to match with a black roommate the
following year after reassignment to a new peer group with a different set of black peers. We also
find that, ceteris paribus, exposure to more black peers significantly increases the probability of a bi-
racial roommate match.

1    Introduction

Considerable attention has been paid to developing the theory of racial discrimination as well as to

documenting its empirical prevalence (see Lang and Lehmann (2012) for a thorough recent review.)

By comparison, less is known about how people form racial attitudes, and whether and how these

attitudes change over time. The purpose of this paper is to address not only how racial attitudes

change, but whether any changes in attitude are accompanied by observable changes in behavior

toward other groups.

    We do so in the context of the contact hypothesis, a concept first introduced by Williams Jr

(1947) and Allport (1954) in which interpersonal contact can be an effective way of reducing

prejudice between groups. The primary difficulty in empirically assessing the contact hypothesis

has been overcoming selection and simultaneity problems. As a result, while the cross-sectional

evidence is generally consistent with this hypothesis (Pettigrew, 1998), a lingering concern is that

this relationship could be driven by reverse causation or confounding factors that impact both

attitudes and the choice to associate with other groups. These concerns have led to a handful of

studies in which intergroup contact is randomly assigned. Most of these studies have focused on

settings such as college dormitory and roommate assignments, where increased proximity has been

shown to increase frequency of inter-race contact via email (Marmaros and Sacerdote, 2006) and

Facebook (Baker, Mayer and Puller, 2011). This approach has been used by Boisjoly, Duncan,

Kremer, Levy and Eccles (2006) and Laar, Levin, Sinclair and Sidanius (2005), who exploit the

random assignment of black roommates to examine the impact of intergroup contact on the racial

attitudes of white college students, as measured by responses to surveys. Both find that racial

attitudes improve as a result of increased exposure to black peers.

    While these papers offer compelling causal evidence on the impact of increased intergroup

interaction on racial attitudes, data limitations have left some important questions unanswered. The

first is whether (randomly) increased intergroup contact and the improvement in racial attitudes

leads to meaningful changes in behavior toward new and different members of the other racial group.

In addition, relatively little is known about whether it is the type (i.e., quality) or the number (i.e.,

quantity) of members from the minority group that influences racial attitudes of the majority group.



                                                   1
This is an important limitation, given that in Allport’s (1954) formulation of the contact hypothesis,

increased contact only improves attitudes when participants have equal status. Similarly, given the

economic literatures on statistical discrimination and Bayesian updating, one would expect that

individuals would update their statistical or taste-based discriminatory preferences based on the

characteristics of the individuals to whom they were exposed.

   This paper directly addresses the question of whether the racial attitudes and behavior of white

males change based on either the number or type of black peers with whom they interact. To

do so, we exploit data in which freshman students at the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) are

randomly assigned to peer groups, called squadrons, with whom they live, eat, and train. We ask

whether exposure to more or higher aptitude black peers affects white males’ subsequent stated

or revealed preference for African Americans. Stated preference is measured by the response to a

survey question that asks how personal acceptance of African Americans has changed since arriving

at the academy. Revealed preference is measured by the likelihood of a white male rooming with a

black student in their sophomore year, when students are randomly reassigned to a new squadron

with a different set of black peers.

   This approach to assessing the contact hypothesis contributes to the existing literature in several

ways. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use random assignment to examine how racial

attitudes change based on both the number and type of individuals from the minority group with

whom one interacts. In addition, rather than relying solely on surveys and their potential pitfalls

to measure racial attitudes, we ask whether increased intergroup contact in the freshman year

leads to meaningful changes in subsequent behavior toward a new and different set of black men in

the sophomore year. This enables us to determine whether increased exposure to more or higher

aptitude black peers leads white men to spend significantly more time with new African Americans

they meet in the future. Thus, the effects we find are more likely to reflect a fundamental change in

racial attitudes compared to the previous research that has primarily focused on survey responses.

   Results show considerable evidence that racial attitudes and behavior are malleable. Both

the number (quantity) and the aptitude (quality) of the black peers to whom white males are

exposed play an important role in changing racial attitudes and behavior toward African Americans.

Specifically, white males who are exposed to higher-aptitude black peers during their freshman year


                                                  2
report more favorable attitudes toward African Americans generally. Additionally, exposure to more

black peers and blacks with higher academic aptitudes significantly increases the likelihood that a

white male matches with a black roommate in the following year. Estimates indicate that a one

standard deviation increase in black peer aptitude increases a white male’s likelihood of rooming

with a black male by 15 percent. Importantly, this impact on roommate pairings in the sophomore

year is robust to excluding the small proportion of white-black pairs who by chance were also in

the same freshman squadron.

    Interestingly, the impact of higher aptitude black peers on the roommate choices of white males

is primarily driven by white males from southern states, where racial prejudice has historically been

most prevalent. Estimates are striking; moving a southern white male from the first quartile to the

fourth quartile of the peer black aptitude distribution increases the probability he will room with

a black roommate by 35.2 percent.

    These findings have important implications for our understanding of how people form, and

change, racial attitudes. Results from this study indicate that not only can racial attitudes change

based on the type and number of people with whom they interact from other racial groups, but

they can do so even for people from regions that have exhibited historically high levels of racism.

Furthermore, our results indicate that these changes in racial attitudes can lead to meaningful

changes in behavior toward new and different members of the minority group.

    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents the theoretical framework

for our study. Section III describes the data. Section IV discusses the methods and presents results.

Section V concludes.



2    Theoretical Framework

Incoming freshman students at the US Air Force Academy are placed into military squadrons of

around 35 members without any input from the affected students according to a stratified random

sorting algorithm (Carrell, Fullerton and West, 2009; Carrell, Sacerdote and West, 2013). This

algorithm uniformly distributes females, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, recruited

athletes, and alumni of the Air Force Academy Preparatory School across each squadron without



                                                 3
any regard to academic ability. At the end of the freshman year, students are removed from their

freshman squadron and placed by the same stratified random sort algorithm into a new squadron,

which we will denote as Si , where i = 1..36. Following Chung’s (2000) model of roommate matching,

let squadron members sj ∈ Si have preferences over possible roommate choices sk ∈ Si k 6= i. We

assume preferences to be complete, reflexive, and transitive, but formed under limited information

on the set of possible roommates.

   Our primary point of interest in this paper is the evolution of preferences under limited infor-

mation. The literature on learning in game theoretic experiments provides useful guidance. In this

literature, two broad approaches exist; belief-based learning (Cheung and Friedman, 1997; Craw-

ford, 1995; Cooper, Garvin and Kagel, 1997) in which players form beliefs about what players will

do in the future based on past play, and reinforcement learning (Roth and Erev, 1995; McAllis-

ter, 1991; Sarin and Vahid, 1999) in which strategies are reinforced by payoffs in previous rounds

of the game. Camerer and Ho (1999) develop a more general framework of which both belief-based

learning and reinforcement learning are special cases. In their ‘Experience-Weighted Attraction’

model, “strategies have attractions that reflect initial predispositions, are updated based on payoff

experience, and determine choice probabilities according to some rule, ” (Camerer and Ho, 1999).

   Adapting this approach to preferences under limited information, we assume student sj enters

the Air Force Academy with initial attractions to various observable group attributes g ∈ G, Agj (0).

The set of group attributes, G, can include members of an academic major, classmates from previous

coursework, residents of a given state, members of an athletic team, or of particular interest in this

study, a member of a given racial or ethnic minority group. As in Camerer and Ho (1999), we

assume these initial attractions are functions of pre-Academy experiences or introspection. During

the freshman year, group attraction Agj (1) updates based on discounted own experiences with

members of group g and observed experiences of others with group g.

   We propose that sj determines the extent to which he believes potential roommate sk is a

member of group g, mj (k, g) ∈ [0, 1]. Let the weighted attraction of sk to sj at the beginning of




                                                  4
the sophomore year (period 2) be


                                                             mj (k, g)Agj (2)
                                                       X
                                           Wjk (2) =
                                                       g∈G


and let the preferences of sj be informed by a rank ordering of Wjk (2) over possible roommate

choices sk ∈ Si .

        Given the rank ordering of weighted attractions at the beginning of the sophomore year, room-

mates are matched. A matching µ is a function Si −→ Si such that for all {sj , sk } ∈ Si , µ(sj ) = sk

if and only if µ(sk ) = sj . As single rooms are not allowed, we assume that a triple occupancy room

must exist if Si contains an odd number of members. We assume individual rationality, i.e., that

no students are forced to be roommates in the sophomore year.



3        Data

3.1        The Dataset

Our primary dataset is comprised of the USAFA graduating classes of 2002 and 2004-2007. We omit

the graduating class of 2003 from our sample because members of this class were not reassigned to

new squadrons at the beginning of their sophomore year. These data contain four individual-level

measurements of pre-Air Force Academy ability: SAT scores1 , an Academic Composite, computed

by USAFA Admissions as a weighted average of high school GPA, class rank, and the quality of the

high school attended, a Leadership Composite of high school and community activities, and a Fitness

Score. In addition, our data contain the state of residence and basic demographic information. In

Table I, we present summary statistics at the individual by semester level for white male students.

Column 1 shows statistics for all white male students.

        To these data we match our primary outcome of interest: roommate matches in the sophomore

year. The Air Force Academy does not maintain official records on roommate assignments. How-

ever, we were able to obtain the official key log, which contains records on the issuing and returning

of keys to dorm rooms. By matching records, we were able to determine individuals assigned to
    1
        For students who took the ACT, we report converted SAT scores.



                                                             5
the same dorm room for a variety of lengths of time. In columns 2 through 4 of Table I we report

statistics for white males for whom we were able to identify roommate[s] for one or more days. This

comprises 99.4 percent of all white male students. Column 2 reports statistics for all white male

students for whom we identified roommate[s] for one or more days. Column 3 reports the subset of

white male students who were paired with a non-black roommate and column 4 reports for those

with a black roommate. For the main specifications in our analysis, we define a roommate pair as

anyone assigned to the same dorm room for at least 90 days during the academic semester, though

we also report robustness results using a range of definitions. For the 90 day definition, we were

able to identify roommates for 96.9 percent of white males. Using a more restrictive definition of

at least 240 days within the academic year, we were able to identify roommates for 88 percent of

white male students.

   Since roommate matches occur within squadrons, we report demographic and pre-collegiate

aptitude statistics at the squadron level in Table II. Due to the small number of black students per

squadron, the standard deviations of all variables are considerably larger for black students than

white male students, although the squadron-level mean values are quite similar.

   Our secondary analysis uses data from a climate survey administered to students at USAFA

during the spring semester of 2010. This survey asked respondents whether their acceptance towards

certain groups (e.g., blacks) has changed since entering the Academy. See Appendix 1 for a copy

of the survey. Due to anonymity of the survey, responses were only made available for white males

with identifiers by squadron for the graduating class of 2013. To these data we matched squadron-

level group characteristics. Survey response rates were just under 50 percent. Although we cannot

completely rule out selection into survey taking due to anonymity concerns that prevent us from

having respondent-level covariates other than squadron, we can test whether there is selection in

response rates at the squadron level. To do so, in Appendix Table A.1 we show that the number

of survey responses by squadron is uncorrelated with squadron-level mean black or white male

characteristics (p = 0.432 on a joint significance F-test).

3.2      Squadron Assignment and Variation in Black Peer Characteristics

Squadrons at the Air Force Academy are comprised of approximately 35 members each of the

freshman through senior classes. Members of a squadron share rooms, dine together, play intramural

sports together, and undergo military training together. Freshmen members of a squadron have

very limited contact with members of other squadrons through the end of March outside of academic

classes and intercollegiate sports team participation.

       Prior to the start of the freshman and sophomore years, administrators at USAFA implement a

stratified random assignment process in which females are first randomly assigned, followed by male

ethnic and racial minorities, then white male recruited athletes, then white males who attended a

military preparatory school, and then all remaining white male students. This critical feature of

our data set enables us to overcome bias due to self-selection into peer groups.

       To be a viable test of whether inter-race contact affects racial attitudes and behavior, our

research design relies on random sampling variation in the attributes of black peers across squadrons.

Figure 1 shows the variation in our academic aptitude measures at the individual and squadron-

level for both blacks and white male students. While blacks and white males have similar means

and standard deviations in individual SAT and academic composite scores, there is considerable

heterogeneity in average peer characteristics across squadrons. The average squadron-level mean

SAT score of black students is 1205. The standard deviation of squadron means within cohorts

is 94.2. Mean SAT scores range from 920 to 1,465 across squadrons. Likewise normalized mean

squadron-level academic composite scores range from -2.39 to 3.71 standard deviations.2

       Due to the stratified nature of the random assignment process, the variation in the number

of black peers across squadrons is less than one would expect under pure random assignment.

However, there still remains considerable variation in the within-cohort number of blacks across

squadrons. The average squadron has 1.59 black peers, with a range from zero to four. The mean

within-cohort standard deviation in the number of black peers is 0.876. The within-cohort variation

in the number of black peers across squadrons comes from three sources of exogenous variation.3
   2
    These statistics exclude the eleven squadrons in our sample that had zero black peers
   3
    There is also considerable variation in the number of black students across cohorts, which ranges from 79 blacks
in the graduating class of 2004 and 41 blacks in the class of 2007. We include cohort fixed effects in all of our models
and thereby exploit only the within-cohort variation in the number of black peers across squadrons.



                                                           7
First, the squadron assignment algorithm places female students into squadrons irrespective of race,

allowing for a non-uniform placement of black females to squadrons. Second, USAFA administrators

determine assignments to squadrons well prior to matriculation and the start of basic military

training. Thus, attrition from the sample through students failing to matriculate either by changing

their mind and not showing up, suffering an injury during basic training4 , or quitting during basic

training offers an additional source of exogenous variation in the number of black peers across

squadrons. Third, late admits and students who suffered injuries or illness during the previous

year’s basic training (called “turnbacks”) are randomly assigned to squadrons irrespective of race

and after the completion of the initial assignment process. These three processes which affect the

number of black students assigned to each squadron occur without regard to the characteristics of

white male students. For this reason, we do not expect to find any systematic correlation between

the number of black students per squadron and the characteristics of white peers.

       The integrity of our research design critically depends upon the random assignment of students

to squadrons conditional on the stratified random sorting algorithm and matriculation. Carrell and

West (2010) and Carrell et al. (2013) provide empirical evidence consistent with random assignment

into squadrons with respect to academic ability, athletic ability, and leadership ability. In Table

A.1, we provide additional tests of whether there is any systematic correlation between attributes

of white males and the average attributes of black peers assigned to the same squadron during the

freshman and sophomore year.

       For this and other regressions in the paper, we determine statistical significance using empirical

p-values5 from 1000 draws of the relevant process, here the squadron assignment algorithm. The

empirical p-values represent the fraction of draws where the actual coefficient estimated from our

data is greater than the estimated coefficients from the 1000 simulated draws. Hence, this procedure

compares correlations between white male attributes and average attributes of black students with

the counterfactual of white males from the appropriate class year being distributed among squadrons

according to the USAFA stratified random sorting algorithm. Of the 65 selection coefficients, 11

are significant at the 10 percent level, six of which are significant at the 5 percent level, and one
   4
     Students who are injured and cannot finish basic training are not allowed to matriculate into the fall academic
semester.
   5
     This approach to inference is similar to that used by Chetty, Looney and Kroft (2009)



                                                         8
of which is significant at the 1 percent level. One group of five coefficients (out of 13) is found

to be jointly significant at the 10-percent level. We interpret these results as broadly consistent

with a random draw from the USAFA stratified random sorting algorithm, which by design does

not create systematic correlation between attributes of white and black students assigned to the

same squadron. Importantly the magnitude of all the correlates is quite small and the coefficients

vary in sign. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in average squadron black academic

composite is associated with a mere 0.037 decrease in white male academic composite.



4        Methods and Results

4.1        Methods

To determine whether white males are significantly affected by variation in the quantity or quality

of the black peers they are exposed to during their freshman year, we estimate the following linear

probability model:6

                                    P µit (sW      B             B
                                                    
                                            j ) = sk = φ1 + φ2 X̄jt−1 + γt + ijt


where P[µit (sW      B                                                                      W    W
              j ) = sk is the probability that in squadron i at time t, white male student sj ∈ Si

and black male student sB    B                             B
                        k ∈ Si are matched as roommates. X̄jt−1 are the black peer characteristics

that individual j is exposed to during his freshman year, t − 1. The primary peer characteristics

of interest measure the academic aptitude of the black peers (mean SAT scores and Academic

Composite) and the number of black peers by squadron. Because white males are exogenously

assigned to black peers in the freshman year, estimates of these φ2 coefficients are free from selection

bias. γt is a cohort fixed effect and ist is the error term.


4.2        Main Roommate Results

Table III presents our main results. Here, we define a roommate match as any two individuals who

were assigned to the same dorm room for a period of at least 90 days during the fall or spring

semester. Specification 1 begins by estimating a parsimonious specification that only includes
    6
        Our results are robust to a Probit specification. See Table A.2




                                                             9
the main explanatory variables of interest and a cohort fixed effect. Due to the design of the

assignment process, which places students into squadrons, adding additional control variables to

the model should not, in theory, significantly affect the magnitudes of our coefficients of interest.

The remaining specifications in Table III sequentially add control variables to the model.

      The pattern of results in Table III provides significant evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis.

White males are significantly more likely to room with a black student in their sophomore year

after increased exposure in their freshman year to more black peers and black peers with higher

academic aptitude. The magnitudes of the effects are quite sizeable. Using the coefficients from our

preferred Specification 6, we find that a one-standard deviation increase in the number of freshman

black peers (0.876 persons from column 3, Table II) is associated with a statistically significant

0.79 percentage point increase in the probability of having a black roommate, which represents a

14.5 percent increase over the sample average of 5.45 percentage points from Table I.

      Likewise, a one standard deviation increase in peer black academic composite is associated

with a 19.5 percent7 statistically significant increase in the probability of a white male matching

with a black roommate. On the contrary, we find no statistically significant relationship between

peer black SAT scores and the probability of a roommate match, though the estimated effects are

positive.8

      Importantly, the effect sizes we find remain virtually unchanged in Specification 2-4 as we

add controls for own demographic characteristics, non-black freshman peer characteristics, and

characteristics of the black upperclassman in the freshman squadron. This is consistent with our

expectations given the absence of selection in the squadron assignment process.

      In Specification 5 we include controls for the academic attributes (SAT scores and academic

composite) of the black peers in the sophomore squadron within which roommate matches are

made. In Specification 6 we include a sophomore squadron fixed effect to control for any unob-

servable differences in sophomore black peer characteristics. In both specifications our estimated

coefficients of interest again remain virtually unchanged. These results indicate that exposure

during the freshman year to more and higher aptitude black peers increases the probability of a
  7
    0.0105/0.0545 = 0.195
  8
    We note that the academic composite effect may dominate the SAT effect because academic composite is a much
better predictor of grade performance at USAFA, particularly for blacks.



                                                      10
white-black roommate match in the sophomore year irrespective of the academic aptitude of po-

tential sophomore black roommates. Hence, these results suggest that the effects we find increase

the relative attractiveness of all black students at the Air Force Academy, not just those blacks

with higher academic aptitude.

   In Specification 7-10 we conduct a series of robustness checks. Specification 7 reweights the

estimates by the inverse probability of a roommate match to rule out the possibility that the

results are driven by selection into the roommate key file. Specification 8 excludes all white males

who were randomly assigned to the same sophomore squadron as a black peer from their freshman

squadron. We do this to ensure that the results are not driven by the small fraction of white

sophomore men who happened to be able to room with black men from their freshman squadron

with whom they are likely personally acquainted. In Specification 9, we control for other black peer

characteristics that are potentially correlated with academic aptitude (military preparatory school

attendance, recruited athlete, leadership composite and fitness score). Finally, in Specification 10,

we control for state of residence fixed effects. In all these robustness specifications the effects we

find in support of the contact hypothesis remain virtually unchanged.

   In Table IV, we test the robustness of our preferred estimate (Specification 6) to various room-

mate definitions. Across all definitions of roommates from one day to 240 days we again find

consistent evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis. Exposure in the freshman year to more

black peers and black peers with higher academic aptitude significantly increases the likelihood

that a white male matches with a black roommate in the sophomore year, regardless of roommate

definition. In the most restrictive definition of a roommate, 240 days assigned to the same room,

higher SAT scores of black freshman peers now increases the probability of a bi-racial roommate

match in addition to the Academic Composite.


4.3   Heterogeneous Effects

A natural question is whether the effects we find are heterogeneous across incoming attitudes

towards race. Although we cannot directly measure incoming attitudes or levels of racial prejudice,




                                                 11
our dataset does contain information on each student’s home state of residence.9 Research has

shown that the level of racial bias varies considerably across the United States, with southern states

exhibiting the highest levels of racial prejudice(Mas and Moretti, 2009; Stephens-Davidowitz, 2013).

    Therefore, in Table V, we estimate separate coefficients for our main variables of interest for

students who come from southern or northern states.10 Results indicate that while there are few

differences by region in the impact of the number of black freshman peers, the magnitude of the

academic aptitude effect is roughly two times larger for white males who come from southern

versus northern states. For Specification 6, the estimated coefficient of 0.0116 indicates that a one-

standard deviation increase in peer black freshman academic composite is associated with a 22.3

percent increase in the probability of a southern white male matching to a black roommate in the

sophomore year. On the contrary, the estimated effect for northern white males is approximately

half as large and statistically insignificant at 11.5 percent. We do not have the ability to carefully

identify the cause of this observed difference in the magnitude and significance of effects. But we

are intrigued by the possibility that the effect of higher freshman black peer academic composite

on the probability of a bi-racial roommate match is the result of southern white males favorably

updating their priors regarding African Americans.


4.4    Results on Stated Attitudes

As an alternative measure of racial attitudes and to shed light on why intergroup contact affects

roommate pairings, we exploit data from a 2010 USAFA Climate Survey in which students were

asked to, “Please rate how your acceptance towards African Americans/Blacks has changed since

you came to USAFA.” Possible responses included: “Much less accepting”, “Somewhat less accept-

ing”, “No Change”, “Somewhat more accepting”, and “Much more accepting”. We use responses

to this question to analyze how the quantity and quality of black peers affect stated attitudes of

white males towards blacks. Unfortunately, this survey question was only administered in one
   9
     The military academies are unique in the fact that admissions are made within each congressional district and
state. Each member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate is allotted five total slots at each service
academy in any given year. This process ensures the student body is representative of population centers throughout
the United States.
  10
     We define southern males as those whose residence is in the original fifteen confederate states: AL, AK, FL, GA,
KY, LA, MS, MO, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, and WV. Northern males by definition come from all other states and
territories.

year (2010), thus our analysis of these data is limited to the freshman students who formed the

graduating class of 2013.

       In Table VI we report results from a series of linear probability models in which we regress

the stated probability of white males being either more or less accepting of blacks on our three

primary measures of peer black characteristics (academic composite, SAT score, and number).

Though limited by small sample size, results from this analysis are broadly consistent with those

previously shown on roommate choices. The estimate from Specification 3 indicates that a one-

standard deviation increase in peer black academic composite leads white males to report that they

are 2.4 percentage points (14.2 percent) more likely to report they are “more accepting” of African

Americans generally, though the estimate is not statistically significant. Likewise, being exposed to

a one-standard deviation increase in the number of black peers leads white males to be 7.7 percent

more likely to report being “more accepting” of African Americans.

       Results in Specification 6 show larger and more precisely estimated effects for negative responses

to the survey. A one-standard deviation increase in peer black academic composite is associated

with a statistically significant 49-percent decrease in the probability a white male reports being

“less accepting” of blacks.11

       Although this survey analysis is limited by the lack of power (i.e., a single graduation cohort of

2013) and potential non-response bias (approximately 50 percent response), the broadly consistent

findings offers evidence that the effects on roommates is not likely driven by either the uniqueness

of the outcome variable or the particular cohorts of students in the roommate study (graduates

from 2002-2007). Rather, evidence from both sets of outcomes provides evidence that exposure

to more and higher ability black peers leads white men to have more favorable opinions of blacks

generally, and to reveal those improved attitudes when making important choices about whether

to spend significant amounts of time with African Americans in the future.
  11
    Of the 427 survey respondents, 16.86 percent (72 students) reported being “more accepting”, 3.04 percent (13
students) reported being “more accepting”, and 80.28 percent (342 students) reported “No Change”.




                                                      13
4.5      Generalizability to Other Groups

A final question remains regarding whether the effects we find are limited to blacks or whether

there is evidence in support of the contact hypothesis across other groups as our theory section

would suggest. To answer this question we repeat our roommate analysis for Hispanics, Asians,

members of the football team, and recruited athletes. Results are reported in Table VII. For

comparison purposes, Specification 1 repeats results for blacks reported in Specification 6 of Table

III while Specifications 2-5 report results for these additional groups. Consistent with our findings

for blacks, we find that increased exposure to Hispanics, Asians, football players, and athletes

during the freshman year significantly increases the probability of a roommate match during the

sophomore year between white male students and members of each under-represented group. For

the football players, we also find a significant relationship between the probability of a roommate

match and average football player academic composite during the freshman year. This is the only

group other than African Americans for which the academic composite is significantly correlated

with the probability of a roommate match.12 Overall, these results provide evidence consistent

with the contact hypothesis for additional groups.



5        Discussion and Conclusion

This study provides an empirical test of whether white males’ racial attitudes are affected by either

the quantity or type of black peers to whom they are exposed. Using data from the U.S. Air Force

Academy (USAFA) in which students are randomly assigned to peer groups in their freshman year

and subsequently reassigned into different peer groups in their sophomore year, we show that white

men’s stated and revealed preferences for African Americans improve significantly after exposure to

more and higher ability black peers. Specifically, we find that exposure to more and higher ability

black peers leads white men subsequently to choose to spend considerably more time with African

Americans – as measured by roommate matches –and report feeling more favorably about African

Americans generally. We find evidence that these effects are applicable to other non-majority

groups.
    12
    Since 12.9 percent of football players are African American, we believe it unlikely that this result is driven by
black football players alone.


                                                         14
       These results provide several important takeaways. First, while we add to the evidence sug-

gesting that exposure to more members of the minority group improves racial attitudes, we also

document that the type of members from that group affects racial attitudes. These latter effects

are important; a one standard deviation increase in black peer aptitude has the same impact on

revealed preference for blacks as does a one standard deviation increase in the number of black

peers. This highlights the importance of the type of individual with whom one interacts, as well

as the frequency of interaction, which is consistent with models in which individuals update prior

attitudes regarding other groups. In addition, the importance of the type of individuals with whom

one interacts also speaks to the tradeoff between increasing exposure to members of historically

disadvantaged groups, and changing the composition of those members.                     13


       Finally, our results also illustrate that exposure to more and higher aptitude African American

peers can lead to significant changes in subsequent behavior. Importantly, these changes in behavior

are toward an entirely new and different set of African Americans. This provides rare causal

evidence that increased contact does more than change self-reported attitudes; it also leads to

meaningful changes in behavior toward African Americans.




  13
     For example, by design affirmative action policies increase the number of individuals from disadvantaged groups
with whom one interacts, while presumably lowering the average ability levels of members of that group at the
institution. While our estimates are not well-suited for predicting the net impact of a major affirmative action policy,
we can perform back-of-the-envelope calculations regarding the impact of adding a black student with below-average
academic aptitude to a squadron without any black students. Estimates from Table III indicate that the net impact
of adding the marginal student would increase net revealed preference for blacks so long as academic ability were not
reduced by more than 1.33 standard deviations.
