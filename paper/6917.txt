for service. Or they may expect significant increases in the co-payments in the fee-for-service

Medicare plans to encourage patients and their doctors to reduce the demand for care.

         Whatever the reason, the assumed slowdown in spending is very substantial. To understand

just how optimistic this assumption is, note that between 1980 and 1995 Medicare costs per enrollee

rose 5.5 percent more per year than average hourly earnings, reflecting increasingly expensive

technology and more intense utilization of services. If this 5.5 percent relative annual increase in

Medicare costs per enrollee is cut in half after 2020, instead of being driven to zero as the Medicare

actuaries assume, the implied Medicare spending in 2070 would rise from the current projection of

seven percent of GDP to 26 percent of GDP.1

         A high level of spending on health care for the aged should not be seen as a bad thing in an

increasingly affluent nation. If we as individuals or as a nation want to spend more on prolonging life

or on improving health in old age, why should that be objectionable? Coronary by-pass surgery is

expensive but it prevents unnecessary deaths and permits more active lifestyles.             The new

technologies of knee and hip replacements and of cataract surgery make aging a less fearful prospect

than it used to be. Moreover, even if Medicare spending rises from 2.5 percent of GDP now to seven

percent of GDP in 2070, the increased spending will be less than ten percent of the increased GDP.

         Of course, our ability to afford much more real spending on health care for the aged does not

diminish the importance of trying to balance the extra cost of each instance of care against the value

of that care to the patient. Such a balancing would imply that not every test that provides some




         1
        These projections exclude the even more rapidly rising Medicaid outlays for long-term
care and other services that CBO estimates will rise from about one percent of GDP now to 3
percent of GDP by 2050.

                                                  2
information and not every surgical procedure that improves patient health is worth doing. Our current

system, by making such tests and treatments essentially free to patients at the time of care, is certainly

likely to lead to the over-consumption of health services.

I.       Revenue Costs and Deadweight Loss

         The problem of the increasing cost of Medicare is not just the extra real resources that will

be devoted to improving the health of the aged but also the deadweight loss of the higher taxes that

would be needed to finance that spending if we continue to rely on the pay-as-you-go tax system.

With quite conservative assumptions about the behavioral response to marginal tax rates, the

incremental deadweight loss due to tax finance of the increased Medicare costs would be about two

thirds as large as the additional health resources, making the total burden of the extra spending nearly

twice as large as the additional health resource costs.

         If the future Medicare cost is limited to 7 percent of GDP and the entire incremental amount

above the current 2.5 percent of GDP is financed by a payroll tax on all wage income, the additional

payroll tax would be 9 percent of payroll.2 If instead the 4.5 percent of GDP increase in Medicare

outlays were financed by an across-the-board increase in personal income tax rates, all of the tax rates

would have to rise by 46 percent, with a typical marginal rate jumping from 28 percent to 41 percent.

Since the existing Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes as well as state income taxes would

be in addition to this 41 percent, the combined marginal tax rate for a middle income employee would

be more than 60 percent.


         2
         The health insurance (HI) component of the OASDHI payroll tax is levied on all wage
income, not just income up to a ceiling. The wages taxed under the Social Security (OASDI)
portion of the tax are approximately 40 percent of GDP while total wage income for the HI tax
base is 25 percent higher or 50 percent of GDP.
MedicPrefund.010599
                                                    3
         These marginal tax rates understate the rate increases that would be needed to finance the

higher Medicare outlays because they ignore the taxpayers’ responses to higher marginal tax rates.

To the extent that taxpayers respond to the higher marginal tax rate by reducing their taxable income,

the increase in the tax rate must be greater to generate the same net revenue. In the long run, such

induced declines in taxable income can reflect lower working hours, decreased labor force

participation, reductions in effort, shifts to more pleasant but less remunerative occupations, and

changes in the form of compensation from taxable wages to fringe benefits and nicer working

conditions. If the income tax is used, the higher marginal tax rates will also induce increased spending

on tax deductible goods and services.

         Even a moderate response elasticity could significantly raise the tax rate needed to finance the

higher projected Medicare outlays. With no behavioral response at all, the extra tax required as

Medicare outlays go from 2.5 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP would be 9.0 percent of the initial

payroll (because taxable payroll is half of GDP). But if taxpayers respond to the reduction in the after-

tax marginal wage with an elasticity of just 0.3, the payroll tax rate would have to rise by 14.3

percentage points (instead of by 9 percentage points) to yield the necessary extra revenue.3 A value

of 0.3 for the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the after-tax wage implies that taxable wage

income would fall by 8 percent, a quite conservative estimate of the response to a 24 percent decline

in the after-tax wage rate (see Feldstein, 1995a). (Since a married couple with combined wage income

of $60,000 now pays about one-fourth of that income in Federal and state taxes, the additional tax




         3
        The calculation of this and other values reported in this paper are presented in the
Appendix I of the NBER Working Paper version of this paper (Feldstein, 1999) which can be

would reduce disposable income by 19 percent at the initial level of pretax earnings.)         T h e

deadweight loss associated with the rise in the marginal tax rate can be quite substantial. An

uncompensated behavioral elasticity of 0.3, together with the assumption that the income effect of

a nontaxable dollar of lump sum income is to reduce taxable income (by increasing leisure and the

consumption of excludable or deductible forms of consumption) by 30 cents, implies that raising the

payroll tax rate by enough to finance additional Medicare spending equal to 9.0 percent of payroll

would raise the deadweight loss by 6.2 percent of the initial gross wage income.4 The total cost of

the additional Medicare spending, including the 9 percent of payroll real resource transfer and the six

percent additional deadweight loss, would therefore be more than 15 percent of the initial taxable

payroll. (If the income tax were used instead of the payroll tax, the deadweight loss would be even

greater.)

II.      Life Cycle Financing

         The fact that Medicare is a separate program for the aged is both a major problem and the

basis for a solution. Unlike the population of working age, retirees cannot be expected to finance their

own health care out of current earnings or through employer payments. In the days before Medicare,

when health care was far less expensive, the aged financed their care out of their savings or relied on

payments by their children. But a system that worked in 1960, when the average cost per patient day

in a hospital was $22, can hardly work now when the cost in those same hospitals exceeds $1,000

a day, a ten fold increase even after adjusting for the general rise in consumer prices.




         4
         The deadweight loss depends on the elasticity of taxable income to the after-tax wage
rate and not just the distortion in labor supply as traditionally measured. In the relevance of the
 taxable income response, see Feldstein (1995b).
MedicPrefund.010599
                                                   5
          In most other industrial countries, the health care of the aged is financed by taxes as part of

a general national health care system. Although these foreign systems keep health care costs down

by exercising their monopsony power over doctors, hospitals, nurses and other suppliers of goods

and services, the rising cost of health services in those countries is contributing to very high overall

national tax rates that keep unemployment rates high and inhibit entrepreneurial activity. The aging

of their populations and the increases in medical costs will make their problems even worse in the

future.

          Because the United States does not finance the health care of the aged as part of an overall

public health care system, it is natural to ask what the best way is to deal separately with this

increasingly expensive activity. The fact that most of the aged cannot finance their care through a

current employment relationship or out of other retirement income does not imply that the

government must finance that care through a pay-as-you-go tax financed program that will become

inordinately expensive and burdensome in the future.

          The natural life cycle alternative is to have individuals accumulate funds during their working

year with which to finance their health care in retirement.5 Now that the institutional structure for

universal personal retirement accounts to supplement Social Security retirement pensions may

become a reality (see, e.g., Feldstein and Samwick, 1998a), it is not difficult to imagine how a parallel

structure would work to supplement or replace the pay as you go financing of Medicare.

          I will first describe the basic magnitudes of such a plan and then discuss how the accounts

might be administered, how the burden of finance might be distributed, and what precautions should




          5
           Rattenmaier and Saving (1998) have proposed such a plan.
MedicPrefund.010599
                                                    6
be taken against the risk that future market rates of return will be less than they have been in the past.

III.     The Economics of Prefunding

         Andrew Samwick and I (Feldstein and Samwick, 1998a) analyzed how annual deposits equal

to two percent of wages would accumulate during an individual’s lifetime and what size annuity could

be purchased at retirement with the accumulated funds. Our analysis assumes that 60 percent of the

funds in the Personal Retirement Accounts (PRAs) are invested in the S&P500 stocks with the

remainder in corporate bonds. The logarithmic rate of return on such a portfolio has averaged 5.9

percent in the half century from 1946 to 1995 (and was similar in the longer interval from 1926 to

1997.) We subtract 0.4 percent for administrative costs and treat the remaining 5.5 percent

conservatively as the money rate of return even though that implies a lower rate of return than the

history of the log return indicates. At retirement age, these funds are converted into a variable annuity

that is invested in the same 60:40 mixture of stocks and bonds. For a related analysis, see Feldstein

and Samwick (1998b).

         The returns on stocks and bonds reflect corporate earnings after the corporate taxes paid to

the federal, state and local governments. Poterba (1997) has shown that the marginal rate of return

on nonfinancial corporate capital has averaged 8.5 percent over the years 1959 to 1996. We

conservatively assume that the federal government collects about 25 percent of these profits as

corporate taxes, about two-thirds of the corporate tax rate; we do this to take into account the fact

that not all PRA balances may be incremental saving and that some incremental saving would go

abroad or into investments (like owner occupied housing) that do not generate corporate taxes. With

this assumption, the incremental corporate tax revenue is 2.1 percent of the PRA balances in each

year,.

MedicPrefund.010599
                                                    7
         To calculate the amount of saving needed to fund the future Medicare benefits, I have used

an updated version of the Feldstein-Samwick analysis that incorporates the economic, demographic

and mortality assumptions contained in the 1998 Social Security Trustees Report (instead of the 1995

Trustees’ assumptions used in the earlier Feldstein-Samwick studies.)

I focus on the long run properties of the program as indicated by the projected situation for the year

2070, the most distant year for which we have Medicare cost projections. I assume that the new

system of Retiree Health Accounts (RHAs) begins in the year 2000.

         If each employee contributes one percent of total wages in every year from age 21 to age 66

and earns the assumed 5.5 percent net rate of return, the life annuities paid in the year 2070 to all

retirees in that year would be equal to 4.67 percent of total wages in that year. In addition, the

incremental corporate tax associated with the funds accumulated in the Retiree Health Accounts

would be 1.84 percent of total wages. Together the funds available for financing Medicare type

expenditures in 2070 would therefore be 6.5 percent of payroll for every one percent of payroll that

has been saved over the years. Although data limitations prevent projections much beyond 2070, it

appears that this number remains stable during the next decade.6

         Comparing this 6.5 percent of payroll with the official projection that the total cost of

Medicare in 2070 will be seven percent of GDP or 14 percent of payroll mplies that the Retiree

Health Account system could finance the entire future Medicare benefits with RHA savings of 2.15

percent of payroll or about one percent of GDP. The 9 percent of payroll projected increase in the

cost of Medicare could be financed by saving only 1.4 percent of payroll in Retiree Health Accounts


         6
         Appendix II of the NBER Working Paper version of this paper (Feldstein, 1999) shows
the Retiree Health Account balances and annuities for selected years.

instead of the 14 percent additional payroll tax that would otherwise be needed.

         The efficiency gains (i.e., the reduced deadweight loss) that would flow from lower tax rates

exceeds the gains that might be achieved by reducing the cost of care itself.

IV.      Issues of Administration, Financing and Risk

         At retirement age, the individual would use the annuity produced by the Retiree Health

Account to purchase an approved health plan. Such a plan could be a fee for service plan like the

current typical Medicare arrangement, or membership in an HMO, or a high deductible plan like the

Medical Savings Accounts. If the annuity produces more income than is required to purchase the

plan that the individual chooses, the additional funds might be available for consumption or reinvested

in part or in whole in the Retiree Health Account.

         There are a variety of ways in which a system of Retiree Health Accounts could be designed

and administered. If the Personal Retirement Accounts that augment Social Security pension benefits

are established as individual accounts managed by private fund managers, operating the two types of

accounts together would reduce administrative costs. Individuals could have a single fund manager

with separate accounts for health and pension benefits. Although a system of centrally administered

accounts (like the Federal Employees Thrift Saving Plan) or the accumulation of the funds in a single

government health insurance trust fund would be technically feasible, either approach would create

the same political problems that such arrangements would if used for retirement accounts. By 2070

the RHA funds would be about $18 trillion (in the prices of 1998), nearly equal to that year’s GDP.

The potential power that would come with distributing and regulating those funds would present

enormous temptations for political interference and abuse.

         Although Personal Retirement Accounts are designed, like Social Security, to provide

MedicPrefund.010599
                                                  9
retirement pensions that are related to past earnings, the basic benefits of Medicare are presumed to

be equal for all and independent of past earnings. While a reasonable system would allow individuals

to supplement their Medicare outlays with additional personal spending, there is a broad consensus

that Medicare should finance a high level of medical care for all those of retirement age. This in turn

implies that the funds deposited in the RHAs would be equal for all. The 2.1 percent of payroll

needed to fund Medicare should be understood as implying that the annual deposit into each

individual’s account should be 2.1 percent of average earnings. For the year 2000, that would be

about $600 per adult between the ages of 21 and 64.

         There is no painless source of these funds. Although Personal Retirement Accounts that are

adequate to stabilize the Social Security payroll tax rate at 12.4 percent while meeting all future

benefit commitments could be financed from the projected budget surpluses and the subsequent

incremental corporate tax receipts (Feldstein and Samwick, 1998a), these budget surpluses are not

sufficient to finance the 2.1 percent of total earnings for RHAs as well. There would be no alternative

to cuts in spending or increases in taxes. The distributional consequences of raising extra funds or

reducing projected outlays are no different in this context that in other issues of financing incremental

government spending.

         The key point to bear in mind in thinking about the distributional aspects of RHAs is that in

the long-run they would eliminate the need for massive taxes that would otherwise reduce the

disposable income of low and middle income workers by 20 percent and impose an extra deadweight

loss equal to more than six percent of existing wages.

         It would of course take a long time until the RHA annuities are sufficient to meet a large

fraction of the projected Medicare costs. The need for additional financing or benefit reductions

MedicPrefund.010599
                                                   10
along the way cannot be avoided by adopting a plan that will eliminate those problems in the long run.

It is unfortunate that the shift to an investment based system did not begin sooner.

         Although the analysis here assumes that the RHAs earn a 5.5 percent real rate of return, there

would in practice be variations in rates of return. The simplest way to deal with this uncertainty is to

raise the RHA saving rate by a modest amount to provide a “cushion” of protection against adverse

variations in returns. Elena Ranguelova and I (Feldstein and Ranguelova, 1998) have analyzed this

in the context of Personal Retirement Accounts and shown that modest oversaving can achieve a low

probability of having less than the projected amount.

         The greater source of uncertainty in planning for the future of Medicare is likely to be about

the future of medical technology and the appropriate level of health care spending. This is a problem

that affects pay-as-you-go as well as investment based systems. Perhaps all that can be done is to

plan for a given level of future spending and expect that the government will augment individual RHA

annuities if the investment results are less than history implied or if the opportunities for productive

health care spending are greater than had been expected. A nation that has not burdened itself with

a high mandatory payroll tax to fund basic Medicare benefits would be in a better position to provide

such protection and flexibility.

         This section explains the derivation of the revenue and deadweight loss calculations in section

I of the text.

         Medicare spending is projected to increase from 2.5 percent of GDP now to 7.0 percent of

GDP in 2070. Since the ratio of total wage income (“payroll”) to GDP is approximately 0.5 (with

no ceiling on the wages subject to the Medicare portion of the payroll tax, this implies that the

additional payroll tax revenue required to pay for the increased Medicare outlays would rise by an

amount equal to 9 percent of payroll. If the payroll tax is used to raise this revenue and if there is

no behavioral response to higher tax rates, the increase in the payroll tax rate would also be 9 percent.

         Consider instead the implication if a higher tax rate causes a decline in labor supply from L1

to L2 when the marginal tax rate is raised from θ1 to θ2 . The increase in revenue is therefore

(1)      ∆ Rev = ( θ2 − θ1 ) w L2     − θ1 w ( L1 - L2 ) .

where w is the wage rate. L2 may be approximated by

(2)     L2 = L1 - [ dL1 / d w(1- θ1 )] (θ2 − θ1 ) w

or

(3)     L2 = L1 - [ dL1 / d w(1- θ1 )] {w(1- θ1 )/ L1 } { L1 / w(1- θ1 )}(θ2 − θ1 ) w

which implies

MedicPrefund.010599
                                                   13
(4)      L2 = L1 [ 1 - η (θ2 − θ1 )/ (1- θ1 )]

where η is the uncompensated elastiticity of “labor supply” evaluated at θ1 . Although I refer to this

as “labor supply” it is actually the supply of taxable wage income (wL), a point emphasized in

Feldstein (1995a, 1995b). Therefore

(5) ∆ Rev = ( θ2 − θ1 ) w L1 [ 1 - η (θ2 − θ1 )/ (1- θ1 )]        − θ1 w L1 η (θ2 − θ1 )/ (1- θ1 ) .

          The initial marginal tax rate θ1 reflects the federal personal income tax, the payroll tax, and

any state income (or sales) tax. Consider a typical married employee in the 28 percent federal

personal income tax bracket whose earnings are below the Social Security (OASDI) payroll tax

ceiling ($68,400 in 1998). If such an individual earns $100 more of gross wages, the cost to the

employer is $108.28 (since subjecting the $108.28 to the employer’s portion of the payroll tax at 7.65

percent leaves a gross wage to be paid to the employee of $100.) This $108.28 is the employee’s

marginal product of labor. On the $100 additional gross taxable wage the individual pays $28 of

personal income tax, $7.65 of additional payroll tax, and a typical state income tax of $5 for a total

tax payment of $40.65. The overall tax, including the employer’s portion of the payroll tax is $40.65

+ $8.28 = $48.93 or 45.2 percent of the $108.28 marginal product of labor.

         Substituting θ1 = 0.45 and η = 0.3 into equation 5 implies

(6)    ∆ Rev = {( θ2 − θ1 ) [ 1 - 0.55 (θ2 − θ1 )] − .45(.55)(θ2 − θ1 )}w L1 .

If the additional revenue is 9.0 percent of the initial payroll

(7)       ∆ Rev = .09 w L1,

equation 6 implies

(8)    0.09           = .7525 ( θ2 − θ1 ) - 0.55 ( θ2 − θ1 )2



MedicPrefund.010599

or

(9) ( θ2 − θ1 ) = .132.

         Thus θ1 = 0.452 and η = 0.3 imply that the increased tax rate must be 13.2 percent (of the

initial total labor cost equal to 14.3 percent of the gross pretax wage) to raise revenue equal to 9

percent of the initial payroll, raising the total marginal tax rate of the marginal product of labor to

0.584.

         The after-tax wage rate falls from the initial (1 - 0.452) $108.28 = $59.34 per unit of time to

(1 - 0.584) $108.28 = $45.04, a decline of 24 percent. With an elasticity of 0.3, this reduces the

“labor supply” (i.e., the pretax income) by 8 percent, i.e., (45.04/59.34)0.3 = 0.92.

         The incremental deadweight loss caused by the rise in the marginal tax rate from θ1 = 0.452

to θ2 = 0.584 is

(10)     ∆ DWL = 0.5 ε (1 − θ1 )−1 [ θ2 2 − θ12 ]       w L1 (1 − 0.0765)−1

where ε is the compensated “labor supply” elasticity with respect to the after-tax wage rate.1 The

final term, (1 − 0.0765)−1 , appears because the tax rates are relative to the full marginal product of

labor which is equal to the gross wage before the employer’s payroll tax.

         The compensated and uncompensated elasticities are related by

(11)     ε = η − (1 − θ1 ) dwL/dy

where wL is taxable wage income and dwL/dy is the income effect, i.e., the response of taxable

income to an exogenous bit of income. With the assumed income effect of dwL/dy = - 0.3 and with

 θ1 = 0.452, it follows that

(12)     ε = η + 0.16 = 0.46.


MedicPrefund.010599
                                                   15
         Substituting this value of ε = 0.46 into equation 10 implies

(13) ∆ DWL = 0.062 wL 1.

         To calculate the net effect of this on the taxpayer’s disposable income, assume a couple with

initial gross wage income of $60,000. They initially pay personal income tax of $8994 (based on a

standard deduction of $3450 and two personal exemptions of $2650 each), a payroll tax at 7.65

percent of $4590, and state income taxes of approximately $2500 for a net income of $43,916. The

$60,000 gross wage corresponds to a pretax marginal product of labor of $64,970. Raising the tax

rate on this $64,970 by 0.132 implies an additional tax of $8571, reducing the net income from

$43,916 to $35,345 (with some of this coming in the form of a lower gross wage because of the extra

tax paid by the employer but shifted on to the employee.) Together this represents a reduction in

disposable income of 19.5 percent.

         This calculation ignores the incremental deadweight loss of 6.2 percent of the initial gross

wage or 0.062 ($60,000) = $3720. In assessing the reduction in overall real income, this deadweight

loss must be added to the real resource transfer of 9.0 percent of the initial gross wage. The

combined burden of 15.2 percent of the gross initial gross wage of $60,000, i.e., $9120, is 21 percent

of the initial disposable income.

         This excludes the decline in money income that results from the individual’s reduction in labor

supply. Although that does reduce gross earnings from $60,000 to $55,206, this is not an additional

loss of individual welfare since it is partly compensated by the increase in leisure and in nontaxable

consumption. To the extent that this is a net loss, it is already reflect in the dead weight loss

calculation.
