       Price   Flexibility, Credit Rationing, and Economic Fluctuations:
                         Evidence from the U.S., 1879—1914

     The reawakening of interest in links between price flexibility and
fluctuations in economic activity calls for a reconsideration of models of
price and quantity adjustment. We examine relationships between credit
disturbances and real activity under flexible prices, using monthly data on
real and financial variables over the period from 1879—1914.

     Recent theoretical and empirical work has focused on models and
institutions of the post World War II period. Historical episodes of
pronounced business cycles, however, challenge our present formulations of the
causes of fluctuations in output and employment. In this paper we pursue two
goals: (1) to demonstrate that substantial price flexibility existed during
the period to point Out that models of economic fluctuations relying on sticky
prices are not appropriate for analyzing the period, and (ii) to consider the
effects of deflationary shocks on real variables in such a world. Our
principal findings are two. First, we present evidence from several empirical
tests to corroborate the stylized fact of price flexibility during our period
of study (relative to patterns of flexibility observed in postwar data).
Contrary to conclusions of many models applied to postwar data, we find that
shocks to inflation rates produce positive and persistent effects on output.
Second, extending earlier examinations of credit rationing as an outcome under
imperfect information, we motivate this link by considering the impact of
deflation on credit availability. The addition of measures of credit
rationing accompanying deflation contributes substantially to our empirical
explanation of output fluctuations during the period.

I. INTRODUCTION

     Much of modern macroeconomics grapples with the implications for

policy of how markets clear. Indeed, the adjustment of prices and

quantities lies at the heart of analyses of business cycles and the

effectiveness of stabilization policies.' Variations in cyclical

patterns provide a natural focus for economic analysis, because of their

importance for understanding how public policy and the organization of

markets ——   for   labor, products, and credit —   figure   in explanations of

business cycles.2 In this paper, we examine the importance of price

flexibility and credit availability in explaining cyclical fluctuations.

     In a textbook, "perfect—markets' model of aggregate price and

quantity adjustment, inertial price adjustment must lead to market

clearing through greater movements in output in response to demand

shocks. Institutional motivations for increasing wage and price

rigidity during this century have been discussed by Okun (1981), and

Sachs (1980) has provided empirical evidence of a trend toward sticky

wages and prices. Institutional changes notwithstanding, some

observations about the business cycle remain surprisingly robust over

time. Gordon (1980) and James (1985) find a consistent Phillips—curve

pattern of association between prices and output for the U.S. in the

nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The robustness of the Phillips

curve to changes in the product aix, structure of markets, and degree of

price stickiness presents a puzzle for those who interpre-t the Phillips

curve as a measure of price rigidity.

    The emphasis on price flexibility is particularly important for

analyzing these effects of the organization of markets on fluctuations

in economic activity. Recent theoretical and empirical work has focused
                                          —2--


     primarily on models and institutions of the post World War II period.

     Quantity fluctuations are amplified by price rigidity stemming from

     institutional or contractual arrangements in labor and product

    markets. Alternatively, confusion related to government policy

    uncertainty produces departures from desired outcomes. Historical

    episodes of pronounced business cycles in the U. S. and Europe challenge

    our present formulation of the causes of fluctuations in output and

    employment. Indeed, little attention has been directed toward

    explaining the existence of business cycles in an environment where

    prices are flexible and where policy uncertainty is not important.

         Understanding cyclical fluctuations in a regime of flexible prices

    may contribute substantially to our understanding of the modern

    economy.3 It is often asserted, for example, that greater price

    flexibility would reduce the economic costs of adverse aggregate demand

    and supply shocks, or of disinflationary monetary policy. Any positive

    link between price flexibility and output fluctuations raises questions

    about the supposed stabilizing effect of wage and price flexibility.

    Keynes (1936) himself discussed aspects of this channel, emphasizing the

    likely increase in real interest rates accompanying wage deflation.

         In particular, we argue that such flexibility can have adverse
•
    effects on macroeconomic performance through constraints on the

    availability of- credit in the presence of nominal contracting in

    financial markets. In section II, we examine links between price

    flexibility and credit rationing within the imperfect—information models

    suggested by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) and others. Our principal

    findings there are two —   that   (1) price flexibility makes worse the

    potential rationing of credit to "information—intensive" borrowers noted
                                   —3—

 by Stiglitz and Weiss, and (ii) the coexistence of Wairasian "full—

 information" credit markets and "information—intensive" bank credit

 markets complicates the definition of a sufficient statistic for credit

 scarcity (i.e., "'the' interest rate" is not enough) and sharpens credit

 rationing to information—intensive borrowers when the supply of funds to

 that market is reduced.

     We test these hypotheses and the potential real effects of bank

credit rationing in section III. Throughout the paper, we use vector

autoregressions (VARs) to focus on short—run dynamics of inflation,

output, and credit—market variables. We need, of course, a period in

which prices are flexible, and we constructed a monthly data base on

real and financial variables covering the period from 1879 to 1914 (see

the detailed description in the Appendix).4 The period from the late

nineteenth century to the creation of the Federal Reserve System

provides an excellent laboratory for testing alternative models of price

adjustment, financial—market equilibrium, and economic fluctuations.

Fluctuations in output were pronounced in the last half of the

nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century, with

much greater variability of output than in the extensively studied

modern period (see Sachs, 1980; Gordon, 1980; DeLong and Summers, 1984;

Taylor, 1984; James, 1985).

     We demonstrate that substantial price flexibility existed during

the period, to point out that models of economic fluctuations relying on

sticky prices are not appropriate for analyzing the period. Contrary to

the conclusions of many models applied to postwar data, we find that

shocks to inflation rates produce positive and persistent effects on

output. The finding of a negative effect of deflationary shocks on
                                   —4—

 output, consistent with the recent results of Delong and Summers (1984),

 suggests the importance of isolating structural channels.

     We motivate this link by considering the impact of deflation on

credit availability. The special role of banks in financial

intermediation for information—intensive credit can create real effects

of bank credit rationing. We do not argue for a strict "banking panic"

view of credit rationing (see also the arguments of Cagan, 1965; DeLong

and Summers-, 1984; and Bordo, 1985);6 we explore local changes in credit

under a regime of flexible prices rather than extreme cases associated

only with systematic collapse. Specifically, we focus on the potential

real effects of deflation and credit rationing, given imperfect

information in credit markets.

     We find strong support for the importance of credit rationing and

its links to deflation. Output fluctuations are predicted by a set of

credit—market indicators. Deflationary shocks in our VARs provide

additional evidence, with negative effects on loans and output, and a

positive effect on interest rates in "price—clearing" credit markets.

     It is important to note that these arguments are made against a

background of a passive monetary policy. The active presence of a

lender of last resort might forestall much of the credit rationing and

illiquidity accompanying deflation in our model.7 We abstract from the

role of a central bank for two reasons. Conceptually, we ant to

illustrate the role of market failures in credit markets in explaining

the potential destabilizing effects of flexible prices. In addition, we

argue that these effects were present in the period prior to the

creation of the Federal Reserve System, the period we study here.

 II.    PRICE FLEXIBILITY, CREDIT MARKETS, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

Background
       Previous   discussions of links between banking system Instability

and output fluctuations during our period of study can be divided into

two principal camps with respect to their assumptions about price

flexibility. The first——the "monetarist" approach associated with

descriptions in Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Cagan (1965) —

considers Thank panics" important because of their effect on the nominal

money stock and hence (if prices are sticky) on real activity. Friedman

and Schwartz, and Cagan focus on the decline in public confidence in the

banking system attendant to panics, which raised the currency—deposit

ratio8 and the reserve—deposit ratio, and precipitated a decrease in the

nominal money supply.

       A second school of thought——identified with Fisher (1933), Minsky

(1975) and (1977), and Kindleberger (1978)——focuses on price flexibility

and "debt deflation" as a link between financial crises and economic

activity. Emphasis is placed on an irrational boom and bust cycle, in

which upswings encourage excessively sanguine views, "overindebtedness,"

illiquidity, and eventually banking crises, as deflationary pressures

from liquidation raise the real value of nominal debt commitments.

Reductions in the price level bring about increases in real interest

rates and decreases in net worth and profits. Recovery is brought about

when overindebtedness is eliminated or policy stimulus is applied. The

cycle then repeats itself.

       Neither of these lines of inquiry provides a convincing explanation

of the relationships among contractual arrangements (in labor, product,

and credit markets), banking panics, and output fluctuations. For
                                  —6—

example, against the Fisher—Minsky school, Cagan (1965) finds that U.S.

panics did not in general foreshadow cyclical downturns; see also Bordo

(1985). Fisher and Minsky do not explain the persistence of

irrationality or the precise channels through which the degree of price

flexibility in the economy and the way in which banks adjust to shocks

are related. The monetarist approach depends on price rigidity to

transform nominal shocks into real effects. This liquidity—preference

transmission mechanism is, however, difficult to econcile with the

evidence for price flexibility in the nineteenth and early twentieth

centuries .

     Aside from the problem of reconciling itself with the stylized fact

of price flexibility, the monetarist school has been challenged by Fama

(1980) and others who point out that, under the Modigliani—Miller

theorem, banks are powerless to fix even the nominal supply of money.

Of course, a world which includes financial intermediaries suggests de

facto the implausibility of the Modigliani—Miller theorem; still the

challenge to macroeconomic theory remains identifying which assumptions

necessary to the Modigliani—Miller theorem are violated in practice.

If, as many recent authors suggest (e.g., Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981;

Bernanke, 1983), banks are information—intensive financial

intermediaries involved in costly monitoring in a world of asymmetric

information, then banks are more than passive mutual funds a la Fama.

It follows that their importance is related to the real costs of

intermediation and their role as least—cost suppliers of credit, rather

than their role as nominal money creators in a world of flexible

prices.10
                                     —7—

      DeLong and Summers (1984) challenge the two schools of thought by

 emphasizing a link between deflation and the real interest rate. That

 is, to the extent that nominal interest rates are sticky, deflationary

shocks would raise real interest rates. If the interest rate examined

represents the full—information cost of capital, a decline in aggregate

demand should follow. While their argument focuses on the important

link between price flexibility and connections between financial—market

outcomes and real activity," three qualifications are in order. First,

while long—term rates did not respond significantly to inflationary

shocks (because of the price—level—reverting characteristic of the gold

standard), we present evidence that, ceteris paribus, the sort of short—

term rate examined by DeLong and Summers did exhibit a Fisher

effect.12 Second, interpretation of the real—interest—rate effect

described by DeLong and Summers is difficult in a world with capital—

market imperfections. As we wiLl. argue later, movements in commercial

paper rates may reflect, inter alia, credit rationing to the banking

sector, indicating that the DeLong—Summers reduced—form model may be

consistent with several competing hypotheses regarding links between

price shocks and economic activity. We present additional evidence in

section III to distinguish among these hypotheses. Finally, the notion

that sticky nominal interest rates caused changes in real rates seems

inconsistent with the historical gold—standard regime in which interest

rates across countries responded to one another's changes to preserve a

common risk—adjusted real rate (Calomiris and Hubbard, 1985).

    Our approach follows Bernank&s (1983) attempt to provide an

analytical foundation for the debt—deflation view of financial crises by

focusing   on the role of price flexibility in linking financial
                                         —8—



disturbances   and real activity, tinder fixed nominal contracting, price

flexibility with the possibility of deflation can exacerbate

fluctuations in real interest rates and aggregate demand and their

persistence.13 In addition, deflationary pressures can reduce aggregate

demand and supply through reductions in bank credit, the erosion of

borrowersT collateral and the failure of financial intermediaries as

fears of potential debtor insolvency rise. This view, however, does not

depend on "financial crises;" it can describe localized movements along

credit supply and demand schedules.



Deflation, Bank Credit,      and Economic Activity
     To motivate our examination of the effects of price flexibility on

macroeconomic performance, we begin with the following simple stylized

macroeconomic model. Income and prices are expressed in logarithms.

Let real aggregate demand be determined according to



               —
                   8(i   —
                             (Ep+i   —
                                               82 t + tyt' 8i' 82 > 0,



where p and I denote the (log of the) price level and the nominal cost

of funds under full information, respectively. Etp÷i denotes the

expectation at time t of the price level during period t + 1. The first

term represents the standard negative impact of higher real interest

rates, on aggregate demand (through, say, the interest sensitivity of

business investment and spending on consumer durables).

     In the simplest possible model, no information problems exist, and

the competitive equilibrium in a Walrasian credit market involves

clearing through "price." Firms borrow to finance projects until the
                                   —9—

 marginal return on new projects no longer exceeds the cost of borrowed

 funds in the market. That is,
                                 is— (Ep+i —         is   an accurate proxy

 for the scarcity of credit. If, however, capital markets operate under

 imperfect information, then banks and other intermediaries may play a

special role; that is, they may enjoy an advantage relative to potential

or actual centralized securities markets in certain forms of

Intermediation due, for instance, to differences in information cost.

Thus, variables which proxy for rationing of real bank credit will be

marginally significant as indicators of capital scarcity when bank

credit is costly to "produce" and imperfectly substitutable with other

methods of intermediation. The presence of P    in   the aggregate—demand

equation is designed to capture this "special" role of bank credit.

     The observation by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) that lenders ("banks")

cannot necessarily distinguish "good" borrowers from "bad" borrowers

implies that adverse selection will render unprofitable a price—only—

clearing credit—market equilibrium. That is, with a nonzero probability

of default, banks consider the potential for loan repayment as well as

the interest rate charged when assessing the profitability of a loan.

Past some critical interest rate, banks will be selected against by

borrowers with a high probability of default; quantity rationing will be

part of a competitive equilibrium in the credit market.

     This story Is complicated by the fact that many markets for credit

exist side by side, differing in quality of borrowers and the terms of

loans. These markets effectively sort borrowers along dimensions of

"Information intensity." Borrowers with significant financial resources

and reputations (e.g., the federal government and large, publicly traded

corporations) have access to "full—information" Wairasian credit markets,
                                 — 10 —



(such as those for commercial paper or for long—term bonds), while
information—intensive borrowers (e.g., small businesses and households)

require more monitoring and are typical of the transactors in the most

basic version of the Stiglitz—Weiss model.'4

     Information—intensive and Walrasian markets exist side by side,

with borrowers of the highest quality able to participate in all

markets, and so on down to the restriction of borrowers in the lowest

class to the confines of the bank market. Borrowers allocate their

borrowings according to portfolio considerations, as do suppliers of

credit. In the price—clearing markets, we expect the interest rate to

decline with the risk class. There is no presumed risk relationship

between the bank interest rate and the rates charged in the Wairasian

markets.

     Suppose for simplicity that one can divide the credit market into

three categories: (i) banks (servicing information—intensive

borrowers), (ii) a Wairasian market servicing risky full—information

borrowers (W1), and (iii) a Walrasian market servicing full—information

borrowers (W2). The sequential—market—clearing approach outlined above

implies that there is no single sufficient statistic to describe credit

conditions. To assess real effects of credit rationing, one must look

at changes in three components of the "state of the credit market": the

full—information risky rate i, the quantity of credit provided in the

information—intensive sector, and the spread between the risky and safe

Wairaslan rates (i — 1w2)• This last consideration measures the

portfolio reallocation effect on the supply side of the credit market

(see the related discussion of this point in Bernanke, 1983).

        We   illustrate our discussion of sequential market clearing in

Figure 1.         For simplicity, we consider the case of two Wairasian

markets, for risky and riskless securities. The first panel represents

the market for information—intensive credit per the Stiglitz—Weiss

model. In that panel,           P and Z represent the maximum return to banks

from making loans and the extent of credit rationing, respectively. i

and i represent the "Walrasian" and "rationed equilibrium" interest

rates. Interest rates in the full—information, Wairasian credit markets

are determined by the intersection of su-pply and demand schedules.

       The mechanism linking price flexibility and credit rationing can be

formalized as follows. First, nominal project returns available for

debt    service will be riskier in a regime where there is uncertainty over
both prices and real project returns. Second, the value of collateral
will vary in a regime of flexible prices both because of variation in
the    price level and because of the likely correlation between project

returns and the value of collateral (particularly with "specific"

industry capital or farm land).

       As in the Stiglitz—Weiss model, let the banks nominal gross return

p represent the minimum        of   the sum   of   the realized return R and the

collateral value V and the nominal payment contracted for. That is,

under nominal contracting, with a debt of B,

             p =   mm   (R + V, (1 + i)B).

Of course, both R and V are random variables so that the expected return

EP   is just
             EP     mm (ER + EV, (1 +    i)B).
       Price flexibility increases the nominal riskiness of R and V (which

was a constant ex ante and ex post in the Stiglitz—Weiss model), so that
                                  — 13 —



for   any quoted interest rate i on loans, the likelihood of default is

higher than under the case of uncertainty only over real project

returns. That is, the p function in the lower—right—hand quadrant of

Figure 1 becomes more shallow, magnifying the credit rationing for

borrowers with access to only the information—intensive market in the

model outlined above. For such borrowers, more projects with positive

net expected value ex ante will not be undertaken. Credit rationing to

information—intensive borrowers is likely to be more significant in a

regime of flexible prices.

      In addition, within a flexible—price regime, credit allocation will

be affected by deflationary shocks. The process of sequential market

clearing and credit rationing in response to deflationary shocks can be

described as follows. In the presence of nominal financial contracting

in the information—intensive ("banking") sector the financial system is

prone to instability. In particular, unanticipated deflation weakens

confidence in the viability of information—intensive loans, causing a

shift in the supply of funds from the banking sector. That is, the LS

schedule in Figure 1 shifts in, further restricting bank credit.

Supplies of funds to the Walrasian markets increase. The tightening of

bank credit causes those borrowers with comparatively large stocks of

information capital who need additional loans to move into the Wairasian

market (although at higher interest rates ex post). Bank loan rates may

or may not rise; increased quantity rationing allocates bank loans.

Interest rates in the risky full—information market rise because of the

spillover from the bank market. Rates on safe assets may even fall,

because of the influx of funds to that market.
                                  — 14 —



     Stated differently, a deflationary shock increases the debt burden
of borrowers and decreases their net worth. The resulting increased

probability of default leads to a rise in the reserve—to—loan ratio as

banks attempt to reduce the riskiness of their portfolios and brace

themselves for potential deposit liquidation. At the same time,

depositors react to increased risk by reducing their deposits. The

depletion of collateral increases the cost of monitoring loans or,

alternatively, reduces the availability of collateralized debt. If some

banks do fail, the idle information capital of failed intermediaries

will disrupt the flow of credit to certain borrowers. All of these

channels cause backward shifts of the real loan supply function. The

increased scarcity of bank credit may not lead to higher interest rates

if, as Sti.glitz and Weiss (1981) suggest, higher interest rates are

associated with greater risk taking; deflationary shocks which reduce

collateral may lower the upper bound on Interest rates and increase

excess loan demand.

     These links among deflation, price flexibility, and the provision

of bank credit were not lost on contemporary chroniclers; indeed

illustrations of the transmission mechanism abound in the scholarly

literature.'5 Three economic themes emerge from the historical

discussion. First, there appears to be sequential market clearing, in

which credit markets close down, starting with those for lowest—quality

borrowers and moving to those for higher—quality borrowers. Second, the

use of short—term credit is one means of rationing available credit to

some high—quality borrowers. These phenomena are particularly visible

during the Panic of 1907 when credit became increasingly quantity—

rationed and short—term, as Exhibit 1 shows. Note that the market for
                                     — 15 —



 short—term bank loans was the only market cleared by interest rates

 rather than quantity rationing in November of 1907. Perhaps most

 important for our analysis, there appears to be a recognized linkage

between deflationary shocks and the rationing of credit —      (I)   from the

public to the banking system (through a decrease in deposits) and (ii)

from the banking system to the public (through a reduction in loans

relative to reserves, and quantity rationing to low—quality borrowers).

        In the next section, we test for the real effects of this

rationing, examining links between price flexibility and economic

fluctuations and the importance of credit channels. We first present

evidence that prices were   indeed   "flexible" during our period of

study. Estimates of time—series relationships among inflation,

financial variables, and real variables follow.



III •   MEASURING REAL EFFECTS OF PRICE FLEXIBILITY

?deling the Relation Between Output and Price

     Evidence for price flexibility and for persistent effects of
deflationary shocks on output would fit well with neither the
Keynesian" nor "new classical" views on the origins of business

cycles. For example, implicit in the Keynesian model is the view that

shocks to money supply or demand, or to autonomous expenditure are

transmitted through changes in real balances or interest rates to cause

fluctuations in aggregate demand. Because aggregate output adjusts more

rapidly than price in that framework, changes in the movement of the

price level are revealed only after output movements. The price level

is assumed to respond to its own lagged values and the level of nominal

demand. Such a view could not explain a significant positive link from
                                   — 16 —




prices   to output (e.e., deflationary shocks followed by a reduction in

output).

     An alternative classical theory associated with Phelps (1970) and

Lucas (1973) suggests that if the economy were composed of a large

number of scattered markets and information flows among them were

costly, suppliers of goods would have difficulty distinguishing relative

price changes from general movements in the price level. The presence

of imperfect information leads to a positive association of price and

output. changes in the short run as suppliers misinterpret general price

level changes for relative price changes. For the nineteenth century

when transportation and communication were significantly more costly

than today, such a characterization of markets may be appropriate. In

its empirical formulation, the new classical approach holds that lagged

price changes should be useless as predictors of current deviations of

the price level from its expected level, and hence of current output

movements.



Evidence on Price Flexibility

     Early evidence on price flexibility for many commodities during the

period is presented in Mills (1927).16 The lack of short—run price

predictability during this period has been demonstrated by Klein (1975),

who notes significant negative autocorrelation in rates of price

change. In Calomiris and Hubbard (1985), we show that prices were

linked to international markets even over reasonably short periods, and

commodity price arbitrage between the U.S. and England was quite

rapid. Below we present some of that evidence.
                                  — 17 —




     Measuring price flexibility directly is problematic because
"flexibility" refers to the responsiveness of wages and prices rather

then simply to their volatility. In the traditional interpretation of

the Phillips curve, wage and price rigidity is the sine gnon of the

explanation of the relationship between prior deviations of output

growth from trend and subsequent departures from "core" inflation. The

Phillips curve relation is necessary but not sufficient evidence of wage

or price rigidity. It must also be shown that statistical information

flows from quantity deviations to price deviations rather than vice—

versa. We estimated traditional specifications of the Phillips curve

using monthly data and found contemporaneous correlation between output

and price deviations,'7 but the pattern of intertemporal priority

between output and prices was reversed from that of the post World War

II period.

     To explore formally the role of price flexibility more carefully,

we estimate a reduced—form vector autoregression18 with eight (monthly)

lags of the commercial paper rate, the rate of change of the wholesale

price index, and the growth rate of output. For output we use pig Iron

production.'9 The well—known Persons (1931) index of industrial

production relies mainly on bank clearings and other variables of

questionable relevance for output. Another alternative, the level of

imports, is unattractive for our purposes because price effects on

imports are contaminated by the terms—of—trade effect. Our sample

period, 1879—1914, runs from the end of the "Greenback Ear" to the

origins of the Federal Reserve System. This is a peacetime period for

the U.S. during which counter—cyclical fiscal and monetary policy

intervention was negligible.
                                   — 18 —



     In   this reduced form model, if the short—term nominal interest rate

contains ex ante inflation expectations, then a Lucas confusion effect

would imply significant marginal predictive power of output for

inflation in a VAR which includes inflation, output growth, and the

interest rate. Moreover, there should be no marginal information from

inflation for output growth changes. Alternatively, in a sticky price

model, aggregate shocks would influence quantities before prices, and

the predictions for the VAR are broadly the same as in the Lucas model.

     The estimation and simulation results in Tables 1A and lB indicate

that inflation and interest rates are (1) statistically significant in

the determination of output, and (ii) important contributors to the

forecast variance of output. In addition, lagged coefficients on the

inflation variable are positive and statistically significant, so that

shocks to inflation exert a persistent effect on output. Current and

lagged output levels are neither significant nor important in predicting

inflation; note, for example, that while inflation accounts for 6

precent of the long—run forecast variance of output growth, output

growth accounts for only 1 percent of the forecast variance of

inflation. These findings are not consistent with either the confusion

or the sticky—price model.

     Additional evidence for the flexibility of wages and prices is

provided by examining the intertemporal linkages between factory

employment and the real wage. Using quarterly data for 1889—1914 and

1953—1984 on factory employment, manufacturing wages, and wholesale

prices, we estimated reduced—form equations for inflation, employment,

and the real wage; data sources are given in the Appendix. The results

are presented in Table 2.
                                  — 19 —



     The significance and importance of patterns of prediction among

these series differ substantially between the two samples. In the

recent period, all three variables contain significant and important

information for predicting prices, while in the historical sample prices

are, for all intents and purposes, unresponsive to past movements in

prices, employment, and real wages. Moreover, in the modern period,

employment is a far better predictor of real wages than in the

historical sample, while variation in real wages iS   important   and

significant for employment only in the historical sample.

     Though not reported here, we also considered the importance of

price—clearing channels in international markets (specifically between

the United States and England) as evidence for price flexibility. In a

vector autoregression of interest—rate differentials for commercial

paper of similar maturity and quality in England and the U.S., gold

f lows into England, gold flows out of the U.S., the U.S. trade balance,

and the log of relative prices between the two countries, we find the

lagged quantity variables are not significant predictors of relative

prices. In addition, relative prices are both statistically significant

and economically important contributors to explaining movements in the

trade balance..



Evidence   on Credit Rationing
     The evidence from Tables 1A and 13 indicates that the positive

association between output and price for the period 1879—1914 Is mainly

explained by shocks which originate in price. This result is supportive

of the debt—deflation view, and suggests extending the empirical model

to include variables more directly related to credit rationing.
                                  — 20 —



     From our discussion in section II, two transmissions of rationing

are important: (1) depositors' rationing to banks, and (ii) banks

rationing to borrowers. In the former, because information—intensive

bank loan portfolios are most Sensitive to fears about deflationary

shocks, the public's supply of funds to the banking sector will be

curtailed, reducing deposits, and forcing more conservative behavior by

banks. As depositors ration banks, even the full—information cost of

credit from banks goes up — as reflected in the "double—name, choice"

commercial paper rate.2° Commercial paper rates probably reflect the

full shadow price of funds to borrowers in that segment of the credit

market. If historical highs are indicators of the latitude for price

clearing In the high—grade commercial paper market, then the commercial

paper rate was well within the range of price—clearing levels during the

late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.2'

     Second, as noted before, in a world with capital—market

imperfections, focusing on one interest rate is inappropriate. Banks

will charge even higher rates to less desirable borrowers, and employ

quantity rationing for least desirable borrowers. That is, borrowers of

differing "quality" will have differential access to credit, with credit

rationing of distressed firms and individual borrowers (see Stiglitz and

Weiss, 1981; Friedman, 1981; and Bernanke, 1983). The two transmission

mechanisms we emphasize can be independent. For example, Bernanke

(1983) notes that banks held substantial excess reserves during the

depth of the Great Depression of the 1930s, indicating that the second

mechanism served as the binding constraint.

     In our empirical work, we construct a set of instruments which

proxy for the credit scarcity effect (Y) .    These instruments
                                    21 —




approximate the difference between the cost of capital under full
information and the actual cost of borrowed funds. In addition to the

commercial paper rate, our price indicator of credit scarcity due to

depositors' rationing of banks, we consider three types of measures:

(i) interest rate differentials on commercial papers of different

"quality," 22 (ii) indicators of quantity rationing in the banking

system, and (iii) proxies for the influence of nonfinancial business

failures. Detailed descriptions of the construction of the variables

are presented in the Appendix.

     First, we include the differential between 60—90 day averages of

highs and lows for end—of--month "single—name, good" commercial paper of

4—6 months maturity (i') and "single name, prime" commercial paper of

4—6 months maturity (jCP) This spread reflects the interest premium

charged on paper of lower quality but with similar maturity.23

Inclusion of such interest differentials permits a test of effects of

credit availability on output.24 That is, if interest rate movements in

response to deflatio[iary shocks reflect only adjustment in the full—

information cost of capital, interest rate differentials (on securities

with similar maturities) should be unaffected. Responses of the

differentials to such shocks reflect credit rationing in securities of

low quality and the movements of borrowers with access to multiple

sources of credit.

     That the various commercial paper rates may be imperfect indicators

of bank credit crunches implies that quantity flows may contribute

explanatory power at the margin above that contributed by the price of

funds. For this reason we include the real change in loans

(( Lt —   Li)   I      where L and P denote the stock of loans and the

price level, respectively).25
                                     — 22 —



      Finally,   we also consider the monthly percentage change in the

 liabilities of business failures (Lf) ; this variable is constructed

 from the monthly series reported by Dun and Company. To the extent that

 the rate of change of prices and proxies for credit channels are still

 statistically significant and economically Important factors in

explaining output movements, the "credit—availability explanation" is

strengthened.26 Indeed, the use of Lf         in   the models we estimate

uniformly improves the statistical significance and economic importance

of the effects of inflation on output.27

     To test for the effects of price flexibility and credit

availability on output described above, we examine vector

autoregressions of inflation, output, and financial variables. While

such models are not structural, they are well suited for. examining the

dynamic properties of the interactions. Though not reported here, we

also estimated the regression models suggested by Bernanke (1983), and

obtained similar results —    (i)   that current and lagged "price

surprises" are important for explaining deviations of output from trend,

and (ii) that the addition of real changes in loans provides additional

explanatory power for output.

     In Table 3 we present results illustrating the four credit measures

suggested in section II. The reduced—form model includes eight lags of

the following variables: the real flow of loans, the commercial paper

rate, the interest differential between "single—name, good" and "single—

name, prime" commercial paper of 4—6 months maturity, the rate of change

of the wholesale price index, the growth rate of pig iron production,

and the percentage change in the liabilities of business failures.

Measures of statistical significance and of the importance of variables
                                   — 23 —




in   accounting for long—run forecast variance are reported in Tables 3A

and 3B, respectively. The contemporaneous correlation matrix of

residuals is also presented in Table 3B. In estimations and

simulations, we find statistically significant and economically

important effects connecting credit proxies, inflation, and output.

      As before, inflation is statistically exogenous to the other

variables, as Indicated by the results in Table 3A. Inflation predicts

output significantly, and accounts for 10.7 percent of the long—run (40

month) forecast variance of output growth in simulations. The

percentage contribution of inflation shocks to output growth forecast

variance reaches a peak of 14.3 percent at the three—month time

horizon. Inflation is also statistically significant in predicting the

interest differential. The near significance of the commercial paper

rate for predicting short—run Inflation is probably best explained by

the Fisher effect, while the small contribution of shocks to the

commercial paper rate to the forecast variance of inflation indicates

the "causes" of inflation are not channelled through interest rates.

      Output growth is predicted by our credit—market indicators —      the
commercial paper rate, the real flow of loans, and the percentage change

in liabilities of business failures —   all   of which turn out to be

Important in simulation. The percentage change in the liabilities of

business failures is predicted by the real change in loans, the

commercial paper rate, and the Interest differential. The lack of

significance and Importance of the interest—differential proxy is to be

expected since it is endogenous and not an independent source of credit

rationing.
                                  — 24 —




     Examining the contemporaneous correlation matrix of residuals
permits some identification of shocks. While   these   are results from

reduced—form models, the pronounced negative correlation (—0.41) between

interest—rate and loan shocks indicates the predominance of shocks to

the supply of bank credit over shocks to credit demand. That the debt—

deflation—cum—credit—rationing effect is important is also reflected in

the negative associations between shocks to output growth and the change

in liabilities of failures, between shocks to inflation and the change

in liabilities of failures, and between output growth and the comjnercial

paper rate; and in the positive association between output growth and

inflation.

     Results from the impulse—response functions for the model reported

in Table 3 are broadly supportive of the dominance of credit supply

shocks. First, positive loan shocks exert persistent negative effects

on the commercial paper rate and positive effects on output. Shocks to

interest rates exert effects in the same direction for the liabilities

of business failures and in the opposite direction for output. Positive

shocks to the interest differential have a persistent negative effect on

loans. Perhaps most interesting, shocks to inflation provide an

impressive corroboration of the credit channel, with positive effects on

loans and output and a negative effect on the interest differential.

     Our results presented here strongly suggest the importance of

deflationary shocks for financial markets and of constraints on the

availability of credit for real activity. That these effects are both

economically important and persistent emphasizes the Importance of

studying more carefully the dynamics of market clearing across various

credit markets in the presence of nominal financial contracting. Hence
                                   — 25 —



the   banking panics occurring during our period of study may be best

studied as symptoms of the problems of providing credit in a world of

flexible prices. Our approach is relevant for localized changes in

aggregate supply and demand due to small changes in credit quality and

information, so that we avoid any dependence on "panic" explanations.



IV. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

      Modern theoretical and empirical research on U. S. business cycles

has in general relied on models with limited ability to explain cyclical

fluctuations when prices are flexible and little uncertainty exists

about government policy. In particular, the existence of pronounced

swings in economic activity during the period between the Civil War and

World War I, a period in which prices exhibit little rigidity, does not

fit well with these approaches.

      In contrast to many recent conclusions about links between price

rigidity and the adjustment of output to demand and supply shocks, we

put forth an approach in which such flexibility can be destabilizing

through market failures in credit markets. We present a model of credit

markets in which "imperfect—information" markets of the sort put forth

by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) coexist with "full—information" Walrasian

credit markets. The potential for deflation magnifies credit rationing

for information—intensive borrowers and projects, and deflationary

shocks precipitate a sequential market clearing among classes of lenders

in which the supply of credit to borrowers in information—intensive

markets is reduced.

      In section III, we test for price flexibility and for aggregate

real effects of our credit—rationing channel. Three conclusions
                                   — 26 —



underscore the principal findings of the paper. First, we demonstrate

that prices were.lndeed flexible during our sample period relative to

their behavior in the post World War II period studied by modern

macroeconomists. Second, contrary to the predictions of current

theories about the sources of business ccles, we find that shocks to

the rate of change of prices produce positive and persistent effects on

output. Finally, we analyze ways in which deflationary pressures can

affect real activity through disruption of the information—intensive

financial intermediation involved in the provision of bank credit.

     We are currently pursuing two extensions of this research. First,

the issue of why nominal financial contracts were used (given the

frequent realization of substantial losses ex post) is of particular

interest. Though it lies beyond the scope of this paper to show why

nominal debt contracts might be optimal ex ante, there are several

possible explanations. For example, fully contingent contracts may be

costly to monitor and enforce; indeed, as Bernanke (1983) points out,

the very existence of bankruptcy indicates the costliness of contingent

contracting. Why nominal debt contracts are superior to indexed
                                                                         -
contracts, however, remains to be demonstrated.28 Our approach to

analyzing   credit rationing lends itself well to extended analyses of

models in which short—term instruments along with quantity rationing

serve as equilibrating mechanisms when access to longer—term nominal

financial contracts is restricted.29

     Second, although our emphasis is on a historical episode of price

flexibility, our results do not imply that credit rationing may not be

important for economic activity in a world with substantial price

rigidity. One sector of the modern economy for which our approach is
                                   — 27 —




particularly   relevant is the farm sector. Agricultural prices (and

hence farm land values, the principal asset of farmers) are relatively

flexible. If the sort of market failures discussed in this paper have

aggregate effects, a likely place for them to be observed is in a link

between farm bank failures and credit rationing and farm incomes. More

broadly, to the extent that banking—system difficulties and loan

restrictions have important real effects, important implications for

monetary and regulatory policy may follow.

Notes
 1
     See the survey and review of alternative theoretical models in Gordon
        (1981). As discussed in Zarnowitz (1985), the search for
        "universal" models of business cycles which do not rely on
        institutional factors has proven to be difficult.

2See the discussions by Burns (1960), Baily (1978), and DeLong and
     Summers (1984) of the changing extent of cyclical variability in
     the U.S. economy.

3Many recent contributions in macroeconomics (e.g., Fischer, 1977; and
     Taylor, 1979) have emphasized the economic costs of wage and price
     rigidity.

4Previous uses of annual data, of course, make studies of cyclical
     fluctuations difficult. The more frequently collected, data
     reported by the Comptroller of the Currency (see for example
     Gorton, 1984) are not evenly spaced.

5Romer (1985) has challenged the view that early business cycles were so
     volatile. Her reinterpretations of the data on employment, output,
     and industrial production provided by Lebergott, Kuznets, and
     Frickey, respectively, have in turn been challenged by Weir (1985)
     and Lebergott (1985). None of Romer's suggested adjustments,.
     however, would indicate that historical business cycles were less
     or equally severe than those of the post World War II era.

6Historical accounts (e.g., the classic studies of Bagehot, 1873;
     Sprague, 1910; and Mitchell, 1913) usually point to "financial
     panics" before the creation of the Federal Reserve System, though
     little effort is made to connect instability in financial markets
     per se with macroeconomic variables.

70f course, as the l930s show well, nothing about the existence of a
     central bank per se guarnatees that these problems will be
     mitigated.

8Gorton (1984) emphasized the predictability of bank panics, as changes
     in the perceived riskiness of bank deposits affects the currency—
     deposit ratio.

9Contemporary accounts emphasized the credit (as opposed to the
     liquidity preference) transmission mechanism. Brown (1910)
     notes: "...it is not the saving of capital in the form of coinage
     which brings after it a lower rate of interest. Rather is it, that
     either is absolutely conditional on the other, that the lower
     interest charge made possible by the banking function enables bank
     credit, in open competition, to substitute itself for cash, or
     induces among banks the policy of lending in general only their own
     credit." (p. 748)
'0Greenbaum, Kanatas, and Deshmukh (1984) discuss the importance of bank
     credit rationing for small businesses in the current environment.

11DeLong and Summers do note that increases in price flexibility magnify
     the impact of deflationary shocks on output, though the result
     comes from a model of gradual price adjustment based on labor
     contracts, a model not as well suited for the nineteenth century as
     for the post World War II period.

       finding Is consistent with a model of financial contracting in
     which short—term price variability exceeds long—term price
     variability (as it would under a gold standard), leading to more
     "indexed" rates in the short run.

13Discussion of a model emphasizing the problem of destabilizing
     deflation accompanying price flexibility is also useful for
     analyzing the behavior of aggregate demand during the Great
     Depression of the 1930s. Researchers like Temin (1976), who blame
     declining "animal spirits" lack a convincing motivation.
     Furthermore, that real Interest rates rose In the face of a decline
     in aggregate demand confounds explanation without analyzing the
     contributions of deflation.

      is, "informatIon capital" can also be considered a factor of
    production, so that reductions In the availability of bank credit
    will reflect real effects on aggregate supply as well as aggregate
    demands. Hence Increases In    unambiguously reduce real output.
    Blinder (1985) considers working capital in a similar context,
    emphasizing the notion of a "credit multipller' (see also Bernanke,
    1981): "Firms may have a desired or 'notional' supply based on
    relative prices, expectations, and other variables. But they may
    need credit to produce the goods. If the required credit is
    unavailable, there may be a 'failure of effective supply' in which
    firms fail to produce as much as they can sell?" (p. 2)

'5For example, Persons (1920) discusses the link between deflation and
     credit market instability, and Brown (1910) identifies links from
     deposits through bank credit to economic activity. Analyses in the
     Commercial and Financial Chronicle are typified by the following:
     "The effect of the unstable paper currency in checking the credit
     system, and forcing cash transactions upon the business community,
     is very apparent in the returns made by the number of failures, and
     the amount of their liabilities, In the past few years."
     (February, 1865, p. 113)
     Furthermore, evidence of rationing of credit to worthy borrowers
     appeared frequently in the writings of contemporaries. Stevens
     (1894, p. 133) notes that many solvent businesses closed during the
     panics of 1884 and 1893, and (p. 140) that wholesale business done
     on a credit basis prior to the panics was done on a cash—only
     basis. That the rationing longer—erm loans accompanying deflation
     in commodity prices led to more extensive and expensive reliance on
     hort—term paper is noted as far back as 1865 by the Commercial
     Chronicle and Review of Hunt's Merchants' Magazine.
     Sprague (1910)'s work reflects these same themes: "It would seem,
     then, that business distress from lack of credit facilities was due
     to at least three influences: The restriction of cash payments by
     the banks increased the requirements of borrowers; the supply of
                                 — 30 —



     loans was reduced by a moderate amount of contraction; and the
     shifting of loans involved considerable uncertainty and
     inconvenience." (pp. 302—303) Examples of the importance of
     credit rationing and credit market segmentation appear frequently
     in Sprague. "Their loans also must have been of high average
     quality after four years of thoroughgoing liquidation and
     recuperation in the business world." (p. 217, emphasis added)
     "....it is certain that the demand for additional capital was
     outstripping current savings seeking investment. Increasing
     difficulty was experienced in marketing securities of the very
     highest class. (p. 237, emphasis added)
     "Whatever the causes, the inability to secure capital by the sale
     of securities in a period of active business should have been
     enough in itself to inspire unusual caution in the management of
     banking institutions. When corporations of the highest standing
     are obliged to resort to short—term notes it may be assumed without
     question that other corporations are expanding upon an insufficient
     foundation of working capital, that current obligations are
     increasing, and that bank credits are being used to their utmost
     extent." (p. 238)
     "Borrowers are forced to resort almost entirely to their own
     banks....This shifting of loans involves much strain and uncertainty
     and in many instances it is not possible to carry it out at all."
     (p. 302)

16Mills notes substantial differences in price flexibility across
     individual commodities, presenting evidence for price flexibility
     on average.
               Prices of the large bulk of commodities at wholesale are
               affected to some extent during general business revivals
               and recessions...The number of commodities sharing in
               business revivals has constituted, on the average, 79.7
               percent of the commodities studied in specific cycles.
               This proportion has fluctuated, from cycle to cycle
               during the period since 1890, between 67 percent and 95
               percent. The proportion affected by general price
               recessions has averaged 77.7 percent, and has ranged in
               different cycles, between 70 percent and 95 percent.
               (pp. 434—435)
     He also, however, describes an overall decline in the monthly
     variability of wholesale commodity prices in the U.S. over the
     1890—1913 period.

171n our estimates of the Phillips curve for 1879—1914 we employ monthly
     and quarterly data on wholesale prices and pig iron output (see the
     Data Appendix) to test for contemporaneous correlation between
     devlationsfrom trend in prices, on the one hand, and those in
     output on the other hand. We estimate equations with inflation as
     the dependent variable and two lags of inflation, monthly dummies,
     and deviations of output from trend as independent variables. In
     monthly data, the coefficient on the output variable is 0.013 with
     a coefficient standard error of 0.010 and a significance level of
     0.19. This implies a .01 percent response in inflation to a 1
     percent contemporaneous output deviation. The coefficients on
                                  — 31 —



      lagged inflation imply a long—run coefficient for output deviations
     of 0.017. In quarterly data, the output coefficient is 0.047 with
     a coefficient standard error of 0.020 and a significance level of
     0.02. The long—run coefficient for output is 0.040.

'8For this and all subsequent VAR models, time, time squared, the tariff
     on pig iron, and seasonal dummies are included as independent
     variables in the estimation equations.

'9For a description of the cyclical properties of various output
     measures over our period of study, see Eckler (1933). Following a
     suggestion from Larry Neal we also used bank clearings outside New
     York as a substitute output proxy. In the VARs, this substitution
     did not change any of the results qualitatively.

20Conunercial paper rates, may, then, fully reflect the shadow price of
     funds — that is, if quantity rationing is absent in the commercial
     paper market, and there are players, for whom the choice is
     relevant, who elect to raise funds through commercial banks.

21Earlier in the nineteenth century commercial paper rates were
     frequently much higher than any level reached subsequently. For
     example, in October 1857, the commercial paper rate averaged 24
     percent and in October 1873, it averaged 16.5 percent. In post—
     1879 data, the monthly average is always below 11 percent.

22Descriptions of the various commercial paper securities can be found
     in Myers (1931) and James (1978). Essentially, single—name paper
     is the liability of an individual borrowing to secure working
     capital. Double—name paper is usually the liability of both
     parties involved in a commercial transaction for which trade credit
     is needed.

     also experimented with two other Interest—rate spreads — between
     "single—name, good" and "double—name, choice" commercial paper of
     4—6 months maturity and between bank time loans of 60—days maturity
     and "double—name, choice" conimercial paper. As the results were
     similar In character to those discussed in the text, we did not
     report them here.

24We also experimented with the differential between the commercial
     paper rate and the railroad bond yield as an indicator of the
     shadow price of credit. While this is admittedly a rough measure
     of loan scarcity, it captures a key feature of credit rationing due    -

     to asymmetric information. Riskiess (demandable) loans would not
     be rationed as term loans would be during credit crunches; thus the
     interest rate differential reflects, in part, the extent of
     rationing in the term loan market. The results were not promining,
     possibly because the interest rate differential may reflect
     maturity differences unrelated to rationing (although long—term
     rates are smooth throughout the period).
                                 — 32 —



25As a further indication of the cost of intermediation, the reserve—
     loan ratio serves as a measure of credit rationing, of bankers'
     desires to reduce the supply of credit given the reserves
     available. The variable contains information on shocks to the
     banking system; disintermediation will likely lead to an increase
     in the reserve—loan ratio. In addition, the shortfall of bank
     reserves relative to desired levels signals the potential for loan
     contraction and liquidation. In our empirical work, we obtained
     similar results using the aggregate bank reserve—loan ratio instead
     of using the real flow of bank loans.

26Gorton (1984) finds the liabilities of faiied businesses to be a
     significant factor in explaining the riskiness of bank deposits and
     the banking system's currency—deposit ratio.

27For example, adding f to the model reported in Table 1, roughly
     doubles the contribution of shocks to inflation to the explanation
     of the long—run forecast variance of output.

28Reasons for nominal contracting in general include, inter alia.
     transactions costs Involved with auction markets and risk aversion
     on the part of one or both parties (see Canton, 1979; and Hubbard
     and Weiner, 1984). In addition, institutional restrictions on
     indexed contracts due to limited enforcement of negotiability under
     common law may have been important (see Nussbautn, 1939).

29That nominal financial contracting may lead to large losses ex post
     calls into question why borrowers and lenders did not index debt
     commitments ex ante. We are pursuing this issue as a topic for
     future research, and offer a couple of preliminary thoughts
     below. First, within the framework of the adverse selection model
     of Stigiitz and Weiss (1981), an indexed loan contract will in
     general lead to increased risk taking by risk—neutral borrowers.
     This is true since in "good times" (high price level realization),
     net cash flow after debt service is reduced, and in "bad times"
     (low price level realization), net cash flow is relatively
     increased. Such increased risk taking would lead to greater credit
     rationing in the Stigiitz—Weiss model, so that both borrowers and
     lenders might prefer nominal contracting. A second way to think
     about the choice of nominal contracting (outside of a credit—
     rationing model) is in the context of its insurance value in a
     world in which lenders are risk—neutral and borrowers are risk—
     averse. Consider two types of uncertainty — that relating to
     costs of intermediation services provided by banks and that related
     to the cash flows of borrowers' projects. Under plausible
     assumptions, as long as intermediation cost uncertainty Is greater
     than cash flow uncertainty, nominal financial contracting is
     optimal.

                                DATA APPENDIX


      In   order to capture short—run intertemporal linkages among credit,

deflation, and output, it is necesary to employ fairly high—frequency

data, but the shortage of comprehensive data on output and bank balance

sheets requires the use of rough proxies. For output we use pig iron

production; data are obtained from Historical Statistics of the United

States, 1789—1945. We construct a single index of wholesale prices by

splicing the Warren—Pearson index (for 1879—1890) and the Bureau of

Labor Statistics index (for 1890—1914). In Calomiris and Hubbard

(1985), we discuss results using more disaggregated data.

     Our quarterly wage data over the 1879—1914 period are from those

collected for cotton textile workers by Layer (1955). Quarterly factory

employment data are drawn from Historical Statistics of the United

States, 1789—1945.

     We construct monthly loans and reserves data from the weekly

reports of the Commercial and Fthanciai. Chronicle for banks in New York

City, Phithdelphia, and Boston. Though these series represent only part

of the banking system, they are the only available monthly data of their

kind of which we are aware.

     The commercial paper rate series used in Tables 1A and lB is taken

from Macaulay (1938), and are monthly averages for 1879—1914. End—of—

month interest rates used in Tables 3A and 3B for 1894—1909 — on (1)

60—90 day average of high and low for double—name choice commerical

paper (analogous to Macaulay's measure), (ii) single—name, good

commercial paper of 4—6 months maturity, (iii) single—name prime
commerical paper of 4—6 months maturity, and (iv) bank time loans of 60—

days maturity — are from Statistics for the United States, 1867—1909

published by the National Monetary Commission in 1910.

     Dun's series on the liabilities of business failures is from
