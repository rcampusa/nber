         This paper provides a formal setting for the analysis of

the capital adequacy of an institution with deposits insured by a

third party. An insured depositor has a claim against the institu-

tion and a contingent claim against the insurer. This paper analyzes

the effect of the riskiness of the asset mix and the relative amount

of deposits and capital on the potential liability of the insurer.

It shows that an increase in asset risk, holding value constant,

increases the value of equity and raises the potential liability of

the insurer.

In troduc t ion


      Since the first owner of a gold depository discovered that profits could

be made by lending some of the gold deposited for safekeeping, there has been

a concern for the "capital adequacy" of depository institutions. The idea is

simple enough. If the value of an institution's assets may decline in the

future, its deposits will generally be safer, the larger the current value of

assets in relation to the value of deposits. Defining capital as the differ-

ence between assets and deposits, the larger the ratio of capital to assets

(or the ratio of capital to deposits) the safer the deposits. At some level

capital will be "adequate" --   i.e.   the deposits will be "safe enough".

      In most countries depository institutions are regulated and examined

frequently by regulatory authorities, and much of this effort is directed

toward insuring capital adequacy, broadly construed.

However, the concept of capital adequacy is generally left undefined,

making it impossible to specify an explicit criterion by which one can judge

whether capital is adequate or not.

     This paper provides a formal setting for the analysis of the

capital adequacy of an institution with deposits insured by a third party.

We emphasize the case in which the insurer charges a fixed premium per dollar

of deposits, since this is the policy of Federal insurance agencies in the

United States. However, most of the analysis is applicable to cases in which

insurance premiums vary with deposit risk. Much of the analysis can also be

used to examine cases in which deposits are uninsured, although we will not

consider such situations in detail.

     To avoid circumlocution, we will refer to the depository institution as a

bank, but the analysis applies as well to savings and loan companies and other

depository institutions. Similarly, we will refer to the insurer as the FDIC

(Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), although the analysis applies as well

to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and similar agencies.

     This paper is designed to serve as an introductory analysis in a book

reporting the results of a number of studies of capital adequacy undertaken by

the National Bureau of Economic Research for the National Science Foundation.

     Although much of the material is not new, the paper does bring together

a number of aspects that have previously been discussed separately and attempts

to provide a unified framework for dealing with the issues involved. In addi-

tion, new results are obtained and old ones given a more substantial theoretical

basis.

The Value of the Insurer's Liability

     A highly simplified view of the balance sheet of a bank at time t is the

following:
                                             bank

                              Asset =           Deposits
                                        At                     Dt
                                                Capital =
                                                             C
All amounts are economic values --           the prices that the assets (At) or claims
on assets (Dr, C) would sell for in a free market. Throughout this paper we

will assume that values are calculated in this manner and that we are dealing

with economic balance sheets, not traditional (accounting) balance sheets.

     If there is any risk that the bank might not pay its depositors' claims

in full and on time, the economic value of such claims will be less than it

would be if there were no such risk. Define DF as the amount the deposit

claims would be worth if they were default-free. An insured depositor has,

in effect, two claims: one on the bank and another on the FDIC. One way to

portray the situation is the following:

             bank

                    Dt

                    Ct                                       depositors

                                                claims on
                                                bank = D
                                                         t                net   worth
                                                                            DFt
                                             claims on
                                         FDIC =    =            -
                                                    Lt   DFt        Dt
                FDIC

    reserves             liability
                         depositors
                    =Lt=DFt_D
                         net worth
                                                     -4-


        The depositors consider their claims default-free, with a corresponding

value of DFt. Since the bank may in fact default, its liability to the deposi-

 tors is only worth D. The difference Lt =                 -
                                           DFt                 D,    is the present value of
 the FDIC's Liability.

        Another way to portray the situation is the following:


       bank                            FDIC                          depositors
                         —                           — — — — DF
  At                             Dt            DFt               t       net worth = DF
                                                                                       t

              C          reserves net worth


To avoid a negative net worth, Cx ante, the FDIC should charge a premium

that will bring in reserves equal to the present value of its liability.

Conversely, if the premium is pre-deterinjned, the FDIC should require that

the value of the deposit claims (Dt) differs from the default-free value (DF)

by no more than the premium.

       Assume that for the relevant period the insurance premium is
                                                                                  pDF. Then
the required Condition is:


                         pDF + Dt              DFt

                  or:

                         DF -
                             t
                                       D
                                           t
                                 DFt

If this condition is met, capital is adequate; if not, capital is inadequate.

As we will see, the ratio on the left is a function of capital Coverage and

asset and liability risk. The determination of a bank's capital adequacy thus

requires both an assessment of the economic values of all assets and liabilities
                                                                                               )

(including intangible assets such as the value of a charter, monopoly power and/

or superior management and options such as acceptances, lines of credit, etc.)

and the estimation of all relevant risks.

     The second depiction of the relationships among the three parties is partic-

ularly useful in one respect: it highlights the fact that the FDIC has the major

interest in monitoring and policing the behavior of the bank, since it must bear

the consequences of any default.

     In the United States there is both explicit and implicit deposit insurance.

The FDIC insures only some deposit claims; excluded are foreign deposits, claims

owned by other banks (most of the "Federal funds") and portions of deposits above

$40,000 per private account and above $100,000 per government account. However,

the Federal Reserve System often provides a kind of de facto insurance for its

member banks by furnishing liquidity to a troubled bank so that uninsured deposi-

tors can be paid off before the bank is actually closed. Moreover, the FDIC tries,

wherever possible, to avoid actually closing a bank; arranging instead for another

bank to assume all the deposit claims. One way or another, almost all deposits

are insured.

     The cost of such insurance is the explicit FDIC premium --   a   percentage of

(virtually) all deposits, including those nominally uninsured --   plus   at least

part of the interest forgone on reserves required to be held at a Federal Reserve

bank by members of the Federal Reserve system.

     We will ignore these complexities, assuming that all deposits are insured

and, where relevant, that the premium is a fixed amount ( p) per dollar of de-

posits (measured at their default-free values). In fact, this is quite an accu-

rate characterization of the actual situation in the United States.

                                                                                      )
A One-period Case

        We deal here with an extremely simple case in which there is only one rele-

vant period. This makes it possible to focus attention on asset default risk,

More complex cases in which there is also interest rate risk will be analyzed

in a subsequent paper.

        A bank issues a certificate of deposit (CD) which promises a payment of

P1 dollars one year hence. The CD is "sold" for D0 dollars (thus D0 is the

current value of the bank's deposits). In addition, the bank issues common

stock for which it receives C dollars (C is thus the current value of the
                            0           0
bank's capital). The total amount is invested in an asset mix with a current

value of A (= D + C ), and the balance sheet is:
          0    0   0



                          assets = A       deposits = D
                                      0

                                           capital = C
                                                         0


     At the end of one year, the assets will have a value of l =
                                                                      (l+?01)A,
where       is the rate of return on the asset mix between time zero and time 1

and tildes indicate variables whose actual values are uncertain ex ante. If

A1 exceeds P1, the CD holders will be paid in full and the stockholders will

retain the difference (      - P1).   Otherwise, the CD holders will receive all

that is available (r1) and the stockholders will receive nothing.

     Two decision variables are of interest: (1) the relative amounts of

deposits and capital and (2) the riskiness of the asset mix. Both affect

the value of the deposits.

    We will use two different approaches to analyze this case. The first

relies on a probabilistic analysis and stochastic dominance arguments but
                                          —7—


is somewhat incomplete due to the absence of a general equilibrium model of

capital asset prices. The second approach does not suffer from this drawback,

since it does utilize a general equilibrium model (the time-state preference

paradigm). It also suggests a simple yet potentially valuable empirical

relationship between deposit risk and changes in capital value.


    A Probabilistic Approach

     Given a probability distribution for       and an initial asset value A0,

the cumulative distribution of A1 is determined. It is shown by curve OXY

in Figure 1. Given the nature of the certificates of deposit, the cumulative

distribution of l' the amount paid to the depositors, is shown by curve OXQZ

in Figure 1. The expected payment, E(D1) is a weighted average of the likely

values, using the probabilities as weights. The expected value can never

exceed P1, and will generally be less.

     What will be the effect of a ceteris paribus increase in assets relative

to deposits? A will be larger relative to P1 and the cumulative distribution

of A1 will have moved to the right, increasing the probability that P1 will

be paid and decreasing the probabilities associated with smaller payments.

As shown in Figure 2, the cumulative distribution of D1 will shift from OXQZ

to OX'QZ, increasing the expected payment from E(D1) to E(D).

     If assets are very large relative to deposits and risk is small enough,

it may be virtually certain that deposits will be paid in full and on time.

In such a situation the expected value of the payment will equal the promised

amount (i.e. E(D1) =         and the deposits will be default-free. Let
                       P1)
represent the market rate of interest at time zero on default-free securities

maturing at time t.   Then the present value of a certificate of deposit promis-

ing to pay } t   periods   hence will be:

      Deposits that are risky will be worth less than their default-free value

for two reasons. First, their expected payments will be less than promised.

Second, the expected return required by investors on such securities may be

greater than that required for default-free investments. In general, the

greater the difference between E(D1) and P1. the greater will be the difference

between D0 (the true value of the deposits) and DF (their default-free value).

      This is illustrated in Figure 3. For generality all values are expressed

as proportions of the initial default-free value of the deposits. The primary

scale for the horizontal axis is the ratio of assets to the default-free value

of deposits but monotonic transformations can be used to obtain scales for

capital-deposit and capital-asset ratios, if the 'book value of capital" --

the   amount obtained by subtracting the default-free value of deposits from the

economic value of assets --    is    utilized:

balance, since the sum       of    the claims on a set of assets is worth neither more

nor less than the assets. Thus C0 must equal A0 -

(A -     D )/DF ,     as shown. The distance between the curve and the horizontal

quate; if not, it is not.

        What would be the effect of a ceteris paribus increase in the riskiness

of the asset mix? The answer depends on the specification of the ceteris

paribus conditions. Most relevant for present purposes is a change in which

the value of the asset mix does not change while the "spread" of end-of-period

asset values increases. We will term this a value-preserving spread.

        Denoting the new situation by primes, we have (by assumption):

                         A' = A
                          o    0
        and thus:
                         C'+D'=C
                          o  o  0
                                  +D0

        Figure 4 shows the situation before and after the change. The new cumu-

lative distribution of             is assumed to cross the old distribution at only one

point (At). Thus the increase in "spread" can be considered unambiguous.



*
    The point at which the distributions cross need not be the mean of the initial
    distribution. For example, increasing the spread, holding the mean constant
    may well decrease value; if so, the new distribution must have a higher mean
    in order to keep value constant. A plausible situation would thus have the
    new distribution cross the old one below the p = .50 level. This contrasts
    with the more familiar construct of a mean-preserving spread. It corresponds
    more closely to the notion of a utility-preserving spread, but to apply the
    latter concept one would have to invoke a social utility function or assume
    a limited degree of variation in individuals' utility curves. The concept of
    a value-preserving spread is more general and leads to economically (and empir-
    ically) more interesting implications.

        rwo cases need to be considered. First, assume that P1 < A .            As shown

in Figure5, when asset risl increases, the cumulative distribution              shifts

from curve OXQZ to curve OX'QZ. The change clearly makes depositors worse off,

for the probability that       X is greater or equal to the former value for all

X. Thus       will be smaller and C larger as a result of the increase in asset

risk.

        Now consider the other possible case --   i.e.   one in which P1       4 .    Figure
6 shows the cumulative distribution of l -- the amount paid to shareholders --

before and after the change. Clearly the shift from curve OP1XZ to curve OP1X'Z
makes equity holders better off, for the probability that C1        X is less than or

equal to its former value for all X. Thus C will be larger and D smaller as
                                          0                    0
a result of the increase in asset risk.

        Both cases lead to the same conclusion. An increase in asset risk, holding

value constant, generally increases the value of equity and decreases the value

of deposit claims. The riskier the asset mix, the lower will be the D /DF curve
                                                                    0   0
in Figure 3. For any given ratio of assets to the default-free value of deposits,

a larger portion of value will be represented by capital (C0) and a smaller

portion by deposits (D) as the risk of the assets increases.
                                                                      -
        Recall that the FDIC liability per dollar (Lt) equals DF0         D0   •     Other

things equal, the greater the asset coverage (A0/DF0) and the smaller the asset

risk, the safer the deposits and the smaller this ratio.

many of the qualitative conclusions obtained by analyzing a transactions- and

information-Cost-free market may apply as well to real (competitive) financial

markets.
       Assume that there are S possible states of the world one year hence, and

that the return on a bank's assets from time zero to time 1 in state s is r1.

Then the payment to depositors in state s will be:


                                    =   mm
                                             [Ao(l÷rois) 1]

and the payment to stockholders will be:


                            =
                                A(l+ri)         -   mm
                                                         [Ao(l+r015) 1]

If,   by buying arid selling existing securities, an investor can obtain any desired

proportions of payments in different states, the financial market is said to be

complete. Equilibrium in such a market is characterized by a series of implicit

or explicit prices for state-contingent claims --              prices   which are the same whether

one wishes to purchase or sell such claims (since transactions costs are assumed to

be zero).

       Now, let:

                     P
                      ols
                                =   the price in time zero certain dollars of a

                                    if state s occurs one year hence


Then the pure interest rate                  is defined by:

             s=i


In such a market, the value of the bank's CD would be:



             D0 =                                                                        (3)
                          s1           {tnin [A0(l+r1), 1] }

and the value of its common stock would be:


                      =
                          sl           {A0l0i

Clearly:

             Co +Do =                  p
                                           ols   JA(l+r

Thus an uninsured bank could raise just enough capital to pay the market value

for its assets, no matter which mix of deposits and stock it elected to employ.

Moreover, each source of capital would be priced appropriately. While this is

almost tautological, it does show that in a complete financial market, there is

no "optimal" financing mix.




*
    This assumes that no resources are lost in the event of bankruptcy. If this
    assumption is dropped, with all others maintained,     situation that could
    lead to bankruptcy in any state would be suboptimal, as shown in John H. Kareken
    and Neil Wallace "Deposit Insurance and Bank Regulation: A Partial Equilibrium
    Exposition", Staff Report #15, Research Dept., The Federal Reserve Bank of
    Minneapolis, January 1977.

        Given this formulation, we can show how the information required to draw

Figure 4 could be obtained and how the curves would actually appear. Note

that:
                           S
                 DF0 =                                                                (6)
                          s=l
                                ols 1


and thus:


                 D0 =                                             DF                  (7)
                         s1 p1{min [A(l+r1) 1]}

        Without loss of generality, we will assume that the S states are numbered

sothatr
     ols
         r ol,s+l
        Given A and P1, there will be a set of states 1, ..., K in which the CD's

will receive less than promised, and a set of states K+l, ...,          S   in which they

will receive the full amount promised. Moreover, as A/P1 grows, K will decrease

(but only at discrete points).

        The definition of K insures that:


                 (l+rlk)A < P1 for k = 1,          ... K



                 (l+rOlk)A       P1
                                      for k =   K+l,   ... S



Thus:


                                                  +
                 D0 =

Now, define:

 1,   s..,   K.    Then:

                                s1    [P015 (1l)]                                           (9)



And:


         (1)      SK
                       is    constant for ranges of asset values over which K is unchanged

         (2) SK             1 (by    (9)   and (2))


         (3) SK        is   smaller, the smaller is K

These relationships imply                  that the curve relating D to A (and thus the curve
relating     D/DF to A/DF) is piecewise linear, concave, and bounded by both the
45° line from the origin and the horizontal line for which D =

trated in Figure 7.

       The larger the number of states, the larger the number of linear segments,

and the closer the piecewise linear
                                                      curve in Figure 7 will approach the smooth
curve in Figure 3.

     Now consider a change in the risk of the asset mix unaccompanied by
                                                                         any

change in the default-free value of the deposits. As in the previous section,

we wish to keep the value of the assets unchanged while increasing the "spread"

of the outcomes in an unambiguous manner. The most straightforward approach is

the following. Let primes denote the new values. Then:



              r'
               ols
                   =r
                    ols
                        +As                                                                             (10)


     where:

              AS Ofors=l, ..., s*
              A           0 for s = s* + 1, ...,                  S
                  S

     and:
                      S
                              Pols As           0
                                                                                                        (11)
              s=1


Note that these relationships imply that:


                  k
                              (p
                                   ols s )           0 for all K                                        (12)
              s=1


    Now, consider a spread small enough so that default still occurs in the

same states (1, ...,                    K).     Then:

                              K                                         S

But, from (12), D            and such an increase in asset risk will generally
                        D0
decrease the value of the deposit claims.


     Deposit Risk and Change in Capital Value

     Formula (13) can also be used to show an empirically useful relationship

between the effect of a shift in asset risk and the initial riskiness of the

deposits.

     The change in deposit value is:

                                     K
                = D'   - D   =
                                 s=l
                                             ols )A                                  (14)




Given a vector         the parenthesized expression is related to K as shown in

Figure 8. To the left of some s*, the function is monotonic downward; to the

right it is monotonic upward. Recall that K is the number of states in which

default occurs. Unless this is large (K> s*), the following relationship

holds:

            The larger the initial risk of the deposits (number of states
            in which default will occur), the larger the decline in deposit
            value due to an increase in asset risk.

Recall, however, that D +        C       =   A.   Since a value-preserving spread leaves

A0 unchanged, C =      - iD.         The relationship between C and K (shown in

Figure 9) is thus the mirror image of that shown in Figure 8. Unless the

number of states in which default occurs is large (K> s*):


            The larger the initial risk of the deposits, the greater the
            increase in capital value due to an increase in asset risk
            unaccompanied by a change in asset value.

Within limits, it may be possible to measure the effect on the economic (market)

value of capital of a change in asset risk, holding asset value constant. The

greater the magnitude of the "risk shift" in value from the FDIC to a bank's

stockholders, the greater the initial value of the FDIC liability. The magni-

tude of this observed responsiveness may thus be an observable surrogate for

the value of the FDIC liability. Subsequent studies will attempt to exploit

this relationship using both time-series and cross-sectional data.
