     OBSTACLES TO TRANSFORMING CENTRALLY-PLANNED ECONOMIES:
                   THE ROLE OF CAPITAL MARKETS

                              ABSTRACT
     This paper identifies obstacles hindering the transformation
of centrally-planned economies (CPEs) into well-functioning
market economies. The analysis is motivated by the recent
experience with economic transformation and restructuring in
Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. The economic system in CPEs is
highly distorted. Prices do not represent real social costs,
incentives systems are absent, losses of unprofitable state-owned
enterprises are automatically financed, legislations vital for
the functioning of markets are not in place, private ownership
and property rights are underdeveloped, bankruptcy laws are
absent, markets are missing, shortages prevail and, occasionally,
inflation is high.
     The obstacles identified relate to (i) anticipatory
dynamics, (ii) monetary overhang and the budget, and (iii)
underdeveloped credit markets. It is demonstrated that these
obstacles inhibit the effectiveness of price reform, monetary and
credit policies, and trade liberalization. The analysis focuses
on various ways to remove the obstacles. In this regard, a
special examination is made of the implications of cleaning the
balance sheets of enterprises and banks from nonperforming loans,
as well as ways to enhance credibility. In the absence of such
measures, privatization will be difficult since the necessary
information about creditworthiness of firms is lacking. The
paper concludes with a brief discussion of sequencing, safety
nets. and their associated obstacles.

     This paper identifies obstacles hindering the transformation of

centrally-planned economies (CPEs) into well-functioning market economies.

The analysis is motivated by the recent experience with economic

transformation and restructuring in Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. The

economic system in CPEs is highly distorted. Prices do not represent real

social costs, incentives systems are absent, losses of unprofitable state-

owned enterprises sre automatically financed, legislations vital for the

functioning of markets are not in place, private ownership and property

rights are underdeveloped, bsnkruptcy laws are absent, markets are missing,

shortages prevail and, occasionally, inflstion is high.

     During the transition period the old central-planning system is

dismantled (or is collapsing) while the new market system (and its

associated institutions and policies) is still not in place. During this

transition, the economy is not any more a CPE but has not yet become a

fully-functioning market economy- -   it is referred to as being a "previously
centrally-planned economy" (PCPE).

     The obstacles identified in subsequent sections relate to (i)

anticipatory dynamics, (ii) monetary overhang and the budget, and (iii)

underdeveloped credit markets. We demonstrate how thase obstacles inhibit

the effectiveness of price reform, monetary and credit policies, and trade

liberalization. We explore various ways to remove the obstacles. In this

regard, we examine the implications of "cleaning" the balance sheets of

enterprises and banks from nonperforming loans, as well as ways to enhance

credibility. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of sequencing,

"safety nets," and their associated obstacles.
                                    -2-


1.   Anticipatory dynamics

     The proceas of economic tranaformation and restructuring is long and

complex. The pre-reform period typically starts with a lengthy delay

between the tiae of the political decision to launch a transformation

program, and the time of its actual implementation. During this pre-reform

period, economic policies are negotiated and designed, political consensus

is cemented, and key features of the institutional infrastructure are

developed. In the pre-reform period actual policy reform measures are not

yet implemented, and many of the basic features of the economic system are

still of the CPE variety. However, the private sector, being clearly aware

that fundamental changes are planned, modifiea the patterns of its

consumption and assets holdings. As illustrated by the recent experience in

Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the U.S.S.R., the private sector's

behavior during the pre-reform period is governed by the expectations of the

reform rather than by the policy measures themselvea. Such anticipatory

actions reflect themselves in prices, exchange rates, rates of interest,

foreign exchange reaervea and other important economic variables.

     Such anticipatory changes are not without cost. Since many of them

occur prior to the removal of administered prices, they may aggravate the

welfare cost of existing distortions. In addition, since the private sector

and policymakers are not fully familiar with the workings of market forces,

they may get confused observing that key economic variables exhibit sharp

changes, while economic fundamentals (policy measures and institutions) have

not yet changed. Faced with these realities, policymakera, whose mentality

and attitude mmy still reflect the legacy of central planners, may be
tempted to offset the undesirable consequences of anticipatory dynamics.

However, in order to succeed in offsetting such disruptions, policymakers

would need to adopt an extremely complex fine-tuning strategy requiring a

detailed and precise knowledge of the economic system. Since such knowledge

cannot be assumed, the fine-tuning strategy is likely to add to the "noise"

in the economic system, amplify the confusion, and erode credibility (Calvo

and Frenkel (1991a)).

     These considerations suggest that the transitional pre-reform period

characterizing the early stages of transformation should be as short as

possible. The most effective way to remove the obstacle of anticipatory

dynaaics is through quick articulation and implementation of the program- -

thereby reducing the likelihood that anticipatory dynamics aggravates the
distortions- -and through the adoption of clear policy rules- -thereby enhance

credibility and reduce the likelihood of noisy fine-tuning.

2.   Monetary overhang and the budget

     One of the features of PCPEs, especially during the early stages of

transformation, is the presence of a "monetary overhang." Thia overhang has

accumulated over the years. Governments in the CPEa have financed their

budget deficits through money creation, and enterprises have enjoyed "soft"

budget constraints as losses were automatically financed through credit

creation. At the same time, the shortages of goods were not allowed to

result in an open inflation, which was suppressed by the governments'

adainistered-pricing strategy.
                                    -4-


     Saddled with tha monetary overhang, transactions in the economy became

inefficient, as individuals have spent excessive time and resources in

"chasing" goods and standing in queues, rather than engaging themselves in

socially-productive activities. This has disrupted the production process

as workers and managers have had to divide their attention between their

jobs and "shopping" activities. Furthermore, the shortages reduced the

ability to exchange money for goods, eroded the liquidity and "moneyness" of

money, and encouraged costly barter transactions. Thus, the overhang

distorts the allocation of resources. In addition, it is an obstacle to the

adoption of other desirable measures like price liberalization and currency

convertibility.

     There are essentially three mechanisms to reduce the liquidity

overhang. First, by increasing the attractiveness of domestic liquid assets

through a rise in the rate of interest paid on domestic-currency deposits;

second, through a rise in prices associated with the price liberalization;

and, third, through a reduction in liquidity. The first mechanism raises

the demand for real liquid assets, while the latter two lower their real

supply. These mechanisms have been emphasized in the recent debate on the

means to reduce the monetary overhang in the U.S.S.R., and, to some extent,

in Bulgaria and Romania. In what follows, we argue that a successful

implementation of each of the above-mentioned mechanisms must overcome some

of the obstacles related to tax incidence.

     Regarding the first mechanism, we note that a rise in the deposit rate

(especially in PCPEs) has adverse implications for the government budget.

In such economies the banking system is "owned" to a large extent by the
                                    -5-


government. Therefore, a rise in the rate of interest paid by banks is a

drain on the budget. In fact, in many respects bank deposits may be

regarded es public debt, snd interest on deposits may be viewed as public-

debt service. From this perspective, credit and budget policies are linked

to each other, as the rise in the deposit rete needs to be financed through

new tsxes. The budgetary drain is higher, the lower is the interest

elasticity of the demand for reel liquid assets. The effectiveness of this

mechanism in alleviating the overhang depends on the capacity of the tax

system to generate the necessary tax revenue, and on the distributive end

efficiency implications of the associated incidence of the tax.

     The second mechanism for eliminating the monetary overhang- -a rise in

the price level- -carries with it the danger of igniting inflation.

Therefore, the effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the capacity of

the government to prevent the slippage of what should be a once-end-for-all

price rise into en inflation spiral. Furthermore, since the rise in the

price level represents a tax on the real value of domestic liquid asset, its

desirability also depends upon the specific incidence of the tax, end on its

effects on the efficiency of resource allocation, and on the capacity of the

government to secure its political support.

     The third mechanism for eliminating the monetary overhang is a

reduction in the nominal stock of money. This reduction can be effected

through either e direct confiscation of money (e.g., e monetary reform), or

en absorption of money by open market sales. Each of these two methods

confronts important obstecles.
                                        -6-


     Monetary reform may be highly effective in bringing about a rapid

elimination of the overhang. Indeed, there have been several historical

episodes in which such reforms were implemented successfully, especially in

the context of a comprehensive program dealing with hyperinflation.

However, since the incidence of the tax associated with a monetary reform is

not distributed evenly across the population, it may erode the political

support necessary for its successful implementation. Safety nets in the

form of appropriate income policies may need to be designed to secure the

political support. Furthermore, the direction of the effects of this

confiscatory policy (along with the accompanying income policies) on

economic efficiency and on credibility is not unambiguous.

     The reduction of liquidity through open market sales also confronts

obstacles. In PCPEs the possibility of conducting open market sales are

limited by the absence of conventional financial instruments and by

underdeveloped capital markets. However, since the government owns a large

portion of the economy's assets and, in many cases, wishes to undertake a

privatization program, it can absorb the excess liquidity through sales of

houses and state enterprises. In addition, the increased size of the market

economy resulting from such privatization may raise the demand for liquidity

and reduce the size of the overhang as transactions shift from the barter to

the monetized sector.

     The obstacles to privatization are well known (see, for example,

Borensztein and Kuaar   (1991),   Frydman and Rapaczynski (1990) and Lipton and

Sschs (1990)). They include the problems of establishing a "fair" market

price for an enterprise without the help of a well-functioning market place,
                                    -7-


developing the legal infrastructure necessary for the effective use of

entrepreneurial drive, adopting bankruptcy laws, developing domestic credit

and financial markets necessary for intermediation, the redistribution of

rents, the potential for corruption, etc.

     In addition, privatization has profound implications on the budget, and

its effectiveness also depends on the incidence of the tax. On the one

hand, sales of state enterprises generate (nonrecurring) revenue (which

cannot be spent for, otherwise, a new monetary overhang would be generated);

on the other, the transfer of income-producing assets to the private sector

results in a (recurring) loss of future revenue. To make up for this loss

of revenue the government must find new sources of recurring income.

     In searching for such new sources, the obstacle of "time inconsistency"

needs to be overcome. The government will be tempted to levy new

(previously unannounced) taxes on the enterprises that were just sold to the

private sector. The strategy of levying such surprise taxes, however, may

prove to be counterproductive. For, potential buyers, in setting their bids

for state enterprises, will take into account the possibility that the

government will be tespted to raise taxes. Such anticipations tend,

therefore, to lower the market price of state enterprises, reduce the

proceeds from privatizstion, end leave the monetary-overhang problem

unsolved. To prevent the erosion of privatization proceeds, the government

must provide reliable and believable signals that such surprise taxes will

not be levied. To produce such credible signals, the government must

demonstrate its capacity and unequivocal commitment to tap jg sources of

tax revenue. These new sources of tax revenue must cover the entire loss of
                                      -8-


recurrent revenue induced by the privatization program, thereby reducing the

likelihood that, after the event, the government would levy new taxes. To

reduce uncertainty such sources of revenue should be secured prior to

privatization. The privatization program will succeed in eliminating the

monetary overhang if the government replaces the lost revenue by levying new

taxes on entities other than the newly-privatized enterprises.

       Similar considerations apply to proposals of absorbing the monetary

overhang by sales of housing. Unless the government reduces significantly

the rent-control provisions, there will not be great incentives for tenants,

who pay ridiculously low rents, to offer high price for housing. Thus, the

reduction in the rent-control provisions represent a specific incidence of

the tax (falling entirely on the tenants). The adoption of such a tax,

however, signifies a major political obstacle.

       The foregoing analysis of the various means to eliminate monetary

overhang reveals that in all cases the private sector ends up being taxed by

the full amount of the overhang. The choice among the alternative means

would reflect the relative desirability of the differenr incidence of the

tax.

3.     Credit markets and economic transformation

       The difficulties associsted with the early phases of transformation

reflect the unprecedented changes in the policy environment superimposed on

the collapsing central-planning system. The fundamental transformation

induces large-scale dislocations as inefficient sectors are expected to get

out of business, while other sectors are expected to expand in response to

market incentives. In addition, faced by market prices and positive real
                                    -9-


interest rates, enterprises thst accumulated large inventories under the

administered-price/low-interest-rate regime ere likely to find their

inventories stock to be excessive. While running down inventories,

production declines (as firms sell from inventories rather than from new

production) end the demand facing inventory-producing firms falls.

     In this section we focus on the special role played by credit and

financial markets, and argue that the imperfections prevailing in PCPEs are

major obstacles to an effective transformation. They can give rise to a

"bad" equilibrium in which growth is low and the incentives to undertake

efficient investments are stifled. We also argue that the removal of these

obstacles yields a distinctly superior "good" equilibrium.

     To motivate the analysis, it is worth recalling the main features of

credit and financial markets in PCPEs. These markets lack depth and

breadth. The complex information system necessary to assess risk and

creditworthiness is underdeveloped. For, in the past, while being a CPE

there were no incentivea to accumulate such information. In the CPE losses

of enterprises were automatically financed and the government, being a

"lender of last resort," provided comprehensive insurance without charging

the appropriate premium. In many cases this implicit insurance also

encouraged overextension of interenterprise credit.

     The interdependence among the balance sheets of enterprises is one of

the key obstacles impeding the operation of the market system. It makes it

very difficult to distinguish between enterprises that are efficient and

viable and those that are inefficient and nonviable, thereby adding to the

complexity of assessing creditworthiness of individual firms. The lack of
                                     - 10   -




information   is especially pronounced, since the dramatic structural changes

associated with the transformation process in PCPEa render the limited

available information largely obsolete. Furthermore, in PCPEs policymakers

are typically untested, the structure of property rights is not fully

defined, and the private sector is unaccustomed to "market rules." These

factors contribute to the uncertainty about policy response, and about the

behavior of economic agents. The overall uncertainty is likely to affect

adversely the profitability of enterprises, to reduce the market value of

installed capital and, thus, to limit the capacity of enterprises to borrow

against collateralized capital.

     The imperfect information structure which makes it difficult to assess

the creditworthiness of enterprises, superimposed on the complex web of

interfirm credit which links the fortunes of efficient and inefficient

enterprises, are major obstacles to a successful transformation. They may

result in a "bad" equilibrium in which socially profitable long-term

investments are crowded out by less profitable short-term investments. Such

a "bad" equilibrium could arise if potential lenders lack the confidence

that other lenders will stand ready to extend credit to cover enterprises'

liquidity needs. This lack of confidence may especially prevail in PCPEs

since there the information concerning the risk characteristics of specific

enterprises ia missing or is not widely available to potential lenders.

     In addition to the lack of information about specific firma, the POPEs

exhibit a relatively high degree of economy-wide (systemic) risk due to the

large structural changes and the unpredictability of the policy response.

The likelihood of systemic risk is enhanced in POPEs since their capital
                                    - 11   -




markets are underdeveloped: risk which could be diversified in fully-

developed capital markers may remain undiversified. Furthermore, the

network of interfirm credit increases the risk that firm-specific shocks are

spread across enterprises and, thereby, are transformed into economy-wide

shocks. All of these factors taken together contribute to shortening the

planning horizon of lenders and borrowers, and account for the tendency to

undertake short-term rather than long-term investment projects (like

infrastructure investment)--even though the latter might be more desirable

from the social point of view. Thus, a "bad" equilibrium ensues.

4.   Removing the obstacles

     The preceding discussion indicates that a major obstacle hindering

transformation end yielding a "bed" equilibrium is the underdevelopment of

capital markets. Policies aimed at reducing the likelihood of a "bad"

equilibrium include measures that (i) improve the information system and the

legal instruments available to lenders and investors, and "clean" the

balance sheets of enterprises and banks from "bad" debts, and (ii) enhance

credibility. In what follows, we address these issues.

     a.   "Cleaning" the balance sheets

     An improved information system provides a better assessment of

creditworthiness of individual firms and thereby removes an important

obstacle to lending. The development of a legal framework provides the

instruments for the enforcement of contracts and the protection of property

rights, thus removing another important obstacle to lending. Furthermore,

the protection provided by the legal system encourages prospective lenders

to engage in ventures that are socially desirable but that are deemed to be
                                     - 12   -




too   risky in the absence of the legal safety net. Put differently, the

legal protection reduces the need of prospective lenders to engage in self-

insurance by the accumulation of "excessive" (and socially-costly)

information.

      Finding appropriate ways to "clean" the balance sheets of enterprises

and banks from "bad" debts would delink the fortunes of enterprises that

ought to go out of business from those that should continue operations (see

Brainard (1991)). A major challenge is to achieve this objective without

imposing excessive costs to the budget and without hampering the incentive

structure. The "cleaning" of books can be effected through either a

cancellation or a socialization of debts. In doing so care should be taken

to avoid the "moral hazard" that "cleaning" operations may introduce into

the capital market.

      Debt cancellation reduces the availability of working capital to

creditor firma, and carries with it the danger of choking "good" enterprises

whose cash-flow requirements depend critically on debt-service receipts.

The government should consider, therefore, extending credits to such "good"

firms. The identification of creditworthy economically-viable enterprises

should be made simpler once the balance sheets have been "cleaned."

      An additional difficulty with debt cancellation is that it may give

rise to moral hazard problems. To avoid setting the precedent that

interenterprise debts are not honored and are cancelable in what may seem to

be mn arbitrary manner, it is critical that this operation be viewed as a

pure book-keeping device. In fact, since in many cases (prior to

privatization) the debtor and creditor enterprises are not privately owned,
                                       - 13   -




the   cancellation of interenterprise debts need not alter the distribution of

income and wealth within the private sector. It could be argued, therefore,

that such a cleaning operation helps to reduce the "moral hazard" that might

be present once the enterprises, whose balance sheets are heavily loaded

with such debts, are privately owned.

       Delinking the fortunes of debtor and creditor enterprises through debt

socialization, transforms the nature of debt and alters its risk

characteristics without changing its magnitude. In socializing the debt,

the government engages in debt-for-debt swaps in which government

obligations (e.g., treasury bills) are swapped for the claims that creditor

firms end banks hold against other enterprises. In a sense, this operation

serves to recapitalize creditor firms and banks by issuing government

obligations in place of the non-performing assets. At the same time, the

liabilities of debtor firms to other enterprises and banks are transformed

into liabilities to the government. By assuming the role of a financial

intermediary, the government (directly, or indirectly through a bank acting

on its behalf) helps to delink the fortunes of different enterprises. By

servicing its own   debt,   the government ensures that the availability of

working capital for the creditor enterprise does not depend upon the debtor

enterprise's capacity to pay. However, to secure its own capacity to pay

when debtor enterprises get into debt-service difficulties, the government

must have overcome an important obstacle: it must have at its disposal a

functional tax system capable of financing the debt-service obligations

without resorting to inflationary finance. This underscores the urgency of

an early development of an efficient tax system.
                                     - 14   -




     In   analogy with the earlier discussion of debt cancellations, it could

be argued that the socialization of debt may also introduce "moral hazard"

problems. For, a precedent may be set that the government steps in to bail

out firma in financial difficulties, thereby reducing the incentives for

firma to run their affairs prudently. However, as indicated earlier, prior

to privatization the various enterprises are, in fact, owned by the

government; therefore, the socialization of debt amounts to making explicit

what is already implicit. Indeed, one of the benefits of undertaking debt

socialization prior to privatization is that it reduces the risk that moral-

hazard problems would arise in the post-privatization stage.

     A successful program of "cleaning" the balance sheets reduces the

difficulties in pricing enterprises. This removes an important obstacle to

an effective privatization program and enables the PCPE to reap the benefits

from privatization. The beneficial effects of privatization on the

efficiency of resource allocation may be significant if the privatization of

state enterprises and the housing sector provides incentives for higher

productivity and better maintenance of the capital stock. Such benefits are

especially pronounced in PCPEs where, as argued above, domestic credit

markets are in their infancy. In this regard, the opening of the economy to

foreign investment can be highly beneficial. In addition to providing

financial and managerial capital, privatization programs that encourage

direct foreign participation can be useful in providing access to

international capital markets. Foreign investors bring with them know-how,

contacts, and information. Their presence and active participation yield

the added benefit of improving the functioning of domestic capital markets.
                                    - 15   -




     b.     Enhancine credibility

     A major obstacle to a successful transformation is the lack of

credibility. To acquire credibility, policymakers must demonstrate that

they are willing to introduce a fundamental change in the manner by which

policy is conducted. The adoption of a rule-based policy framework, rather

than discretion, might reduce the perception of arbitrariness and, thereby,

strengthen confidence in the policy-msking process.

     The sdvsntsges of rules (especially those that are simple and not

excessively state-contingent) over discretion are particularly pronounced in

PCPEs in which policymakers start giving a greater role to market signals.

In this environment, discretionary actions may be counterproductive, since

the structure of prices and other market signals reflect the prevailing

distortions. Therefore, there is the danger that the discretionary actions

are guided by the wrong signals. Policy rules that are simple sre

especially desirable where policymakers are untested. Furthermore, since in

the CPEs discretion was the rule, a clear statement favoring rules over

discretion could go a long way in signalling a basic change in the policy

regime. The key challenge however, is how to make such a statement

credible.

     Two elements of credibility are needed. First, the economic program

must be credible. The program should be feasible, stand the test of

professional scrutiny, and reflect the experience of and lessons from other

episodes. Second, policy commitments must be credible. These commitments

should not be susceptible to the "time inconsistency" problem, providing

incentives to chsnge policy direction in mid-course. Economic authorities
                                      - 16   -




make explicit or implicit pronouncements that influence the response of the

private sector. In this sense, policymakers are the "dominant player" in

the economic arena. The private sector shapes its economic behavior on the

basis of expectations concerning the likely course of current end future

policies. With the passage of time, the government, observing the behavior

of the private sector, may be tempted to depart from the previously-

announced policy intentions which, in turn, have governed the private

sector's actions. This is the well-known "time inconsistency" problem which

may hsmper the credibility of policy commitments.

     The two elements of credibility- -of the economic program and of the

policy commitments--are interdependent. For exsmple, the likelihood that

policy commitments may face "time inconsistency" problems incresses, the

higher is the credibility of the economic transformation program. For, a

credible transformation program is likely to result in short-term hardships.

It is liable, therefore, to generate political pressures and interest groups

lobbying for mid-course changes, which may give rise to "time

inconsistency." This possibility, in turn, msy be anticipated by the

private sector already in the earlier stages of the economic transformation

process, mnd incorporated into its behavior. If this occurs, then market

participants may end up giving excessive attention to the near term while

discounting heavily longer-term prospects- -thus generating a "bad"

equilibrium. To avoid such difficulties and enhance the likelihood that s

"good" equilibrium ensues, policymakers may find it useful to "tie" their

own hands end thereby send a strong signal that the advantages of being the

"dominant player" will not be used.
                                     - 17   -




     It   is useful to classify the methods by which the authorities can "tie"

their own hands into four categories. First, the esrly steps of the new

policy regime must entail actions that are sufficiently significant to

provide a clear signal that a change in regime has occurred. Policy

pronouncements accompanied by actions indicating that the commitment of the

government to the transformation is "absolute" make policy reversals

politically costly. The higher the political coats of policy reversals, the

higher the credibility of policy pronouncements. Once a credible signal is

provided, it would influence the expectations of the private sector about

the future course of the new policy regime and, in forming such expectations

the private sector is likely to lower the weight given to past policy

failures. Thus, the quick building of a track record imposes internal

moliticel constraints on the ability of the government to reverse course.

     Second, the various branches of the policy-making apparatus can be

designed so as to provide effective checks and balances protecting from

"time inconsistency" problems. Examples are the establishment of a legally

independent Central Bank, or a legal prohibition on Central Bank financing

of government budget deficits, or a Constitutional amendment legislating

balanced budgets. Such mechanisms contribute to the credibility of policy

commitments by imposing internal lemal constraints on the ability of

governments to abuse their 'dominant player" role.

     Third, the credibility of policy commitments can also be enhanced if

the government "ties" its hands by entering into international agreements of
various sorts. Examples are exchange-rate conanitaenta, like those
undertaken by countries joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the

European Monetary System, or like those undertaken by countries joining the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (CAn). These commitments impose

external legal conatraints on the use of specific policy instruments: the

exchange rate in the case of the ERM, and tariffs or quotas in the case of

the CAfl.

     Fourth, credibility can be further enhanced if the government chooses

to "tie" its hands by adopting an economic program supported by an

international financial institution, like the International Monetary Fund or

the World Bank. The endorsement of experts representing the international

financial community enhances the credibility of the economic program.

Furthermore, by making the financial support to the program conditional on

the implementation of the prespecified policy measures, this form of

"tieing" the hands imposes external economic and leaal constraints, and

contributes to the credibility of policy commitments.

     The foregoing four methods by which the government can "tie" its hands

are not mutually exclusive. In many cases governments may find it useful to

employ some or all of these methods simultaneously so as to reinforce each

other and enhance credibility. In thia regard, however, the capacity of

PCPEs to employ the internal (political and legal) constraints is somewhat

limited. In these cases, therefore, the external constraints should play a

more prominent role in "tieing" governments' hands.

5.   Capital markets, price reform, monetary policy
     and trade liberalization

     In previous sections we have claimed that the underdevelopment of

capital markets in PCPEa is an obstacle hampering the success of the
                                      - 19   -




transformation    program. We have also identified measures that would enhance

the development of such markets. In this section, we argue that improving

the functioning of capital markets also enhance the benefits from other key

elements of the transforeation program. This point is illustrated by

reference to price reform, monetary policy and trade liberalization.

     The removal of subsidies, the freeing-up of prices end the dismantling

of administered-pricing machinery is likely to result in a higher price

level. Coupled with the tightened credit control and the segmentation of

the underdeveloped domestic credit markets, such price rise may have

profound negative supply-side effects. For, as noted earlier, in PCPEs the

ability of enterprises to offset the rise in input prices, and the

consequent fall in working capital by employing alternative sources of

finance, is limited. Therefore, great care should be taken to ensure that

"good" enterprises can replenish their eroded working capital so as to

maintain their productive activities during the price-reform period. Thus,

well-functioning capital markets enhance the benefits from price

liberalization.

     An early development of domestic capital markets also enhances the

effectiveness of monetary policy. By its nature, monetary policy has

aggregate effects on the economy. These effects impact on "good" and "bad"

firms alike. Well-functioning credit markets, however, facilitates a

separation between "good" and "bad" firms. While "good" firms can mitigate

the contractionary effects of monetary policy by relying on other sources of

finance, "bad" firms cannot. The latter do not have access to capital

markets and, therefore, they must either cease operations or restructure.
                                     - 20   -




Accordingly,   the capacity of monetary policy (which ia inherently unrefined)

to yield socially desirable outcomes is enhanced if it operates in an

environment of well-functioning capital markets. In addition, the

restructuring of capital markets should enhance the incentiva effects of

monetary and credit policies. Once enterprises are aware that access to

credit markets is limited and that credits can only be obtained by "good"

firms, it is likely that they will respond more promptly and effectively to

signals conveyed by monetary and credit policies.

     The benefits from trade liberalization also depend on the quality of

capital markets. Trade liberalization provides the economy with the "right"

price signals. Exposure to world prices helps to demonopolize the economy,

enhance competition, and improve the allocation of resources. However, in

adjusting to the removal of protection, even "good" and economically viable

firms may require credit. The adoption of "hard" budget constraints

eliminates the automatic financing of enterprises' deficits by the

government. Without sufficient access to capital markets such "good" firms

may be forced out of business, thereby reducing the benefits from trade

liberalization. Moreover, in attempting to protect themselves, the "good"

but endangered enterprises may be tempted to join the "bad" and economically

non-viable enterprises in lobbying against trade liberalization, thereby

reducing the likelihood that liberalization will be adopted. Furthermore,

for trade liberalization to succeed in providing the "discipline" of world

prices, unconstrained imports and exports should be permitted. Accordingly,

a significant degree of current-account convertibility should be adopted.

To enable the introduction of such convertibility, the financial system
                                    - 21   -




needs to be functional. These considerations imply that the benefits from,

and support for, trade liberalization can be enhanced by well-functioning

domestic capital markets.

6.   Sequencing and safety nets

     Attaining the conditions conducive to a transformation of a "bad"

equilibrium into a "good" equilibrium, is not an easy task. Many obstacles

need to be removed. Interest groups are well entrenched, the legal system

protecting private ownership and property rights is not fully developed,

managerial and technical know-how is limited, the banking system is

underdeveloped, and the fiscal and monetary systems are ineffective. In

addition, experience with the operation and "rules of game" of a market

economy is lacking, and policy credibility can only be earned over time.

     The foregoing difficulties have stimulated interest in the analysis of

the optimal pace and sequence of economic reform measures (see, for example,

Dornbusch (1990), Fischer and Geib (1990), Kornai (1990), Marer (1990) and

McKinnon (1991)). Experience suggests, however, that there is a danger that

a lengthy search for a perfect sequence of economic measures under

conditions of fast-changing circumstances, may result in the adoption of

outdated and irrelevant policies. Rather, it might be preferable to adopt a

timely, albeit somewhat imperfect, comprehensive reform program than to

search the "perfect" fine-tuned sequence of policy actions.

     In practice, however, there are circumstances in which the adoption of

a rapid and comprehensive reform are impeded by a significant obstacle: the

political support necessary for the adoption of such a program is lacking,

thereby reducing its credibility. Without credibility, it may not be
                                   - 22


desirable to undertake the "first-best" program, since the lack of

credibility amounts to a distortion, and calls for an application of the

theory of the "second best" (Calvo (1989)). Thus, choices need to be mmdc

as to the appropriata pace and sequence of reform measures. In this regard,

thare is no aeneral blueprint. Indeed, the basic insight of the theory of

the second best implies that the optimal pace and sequence of reform

measures depends on circumstances, and those, in turn, differ across

countries. These circumstances reflect diversities of historical

backgrounds, economic, legal, and political institutions, entrepreneurial

traditions, as well as attitudes towards the role of markets and incentives.

     Since credibility plays a critical role in determining the succeas of

the economic transformation program, it is important that the measures

implemented early in the sequence ara backed by a broad-based political

support. To secure such support, the positive results of these measures

should be quickly visible, and the appropriate "safety nets" necesaary to

protect the weak segments of society ahould be in place. These

considerations explain why economic transformation programs adopted by high-

inflation countries (like Poland in 1990), should give high priority to

achieving macroeconomic stabilization.

     In choosing safety nets, additional obstacles need to be overcome. In

addition to minimizing the welfare cost of taxation and income transfers,

the safety nets should not interfere with monetary and exchange rate

policies. In this regard, policies affecting the levels of interest rates

and the exchange rate should not be held hoataga to the objectives of

protecting specific sectors in the economy. Likewise, the benefits from the
                                       - 23   -




safety     nat of wage indexation should be weighed against the cost of

stimulating inflation. In general, expenditures associated with all safety

nets should not impede macroeconomic stability: these expenditures should

be accounted for, and be an explicit part of the budget process.

     In previous sections, we have argued that the success of economic

transformation in PCPEs hinges on the presence of well-functioning capital

markets. We have also argued that an early development of such markets is

desirable, as it removes numerous obstacles, Ideally, therefore, like

macroeconomic stability, financial-markets reform should also be given high

priority in the sequence of transformation measures. However, since

credibility plays a unique role in financial markets, the lack of

credibility is an obstacle hindering such reform. Therefore, a complete

reform of the financial market may need to await the buildup of credibility.

In this regard, however, a distinction should be made between liberalization

of transactions in the domestic capital market and in the external one. The

vulnerability of the latter to incomplete credibility is particularly acute

in economies undergoing transformation. This explains why the opening of

the capital account of the balance of payment (the adoption of capital-

account convertibility) should be undertaken late in the sequence of policy

measures, after trade liberalization (see, Edwards (1985) and Frenkel

(1983)).

     The focus of this paper has been on obstacles prominent during the

early stages of economic transformation. Excluded are obstacles prominent

in the late stages of transformation- -those that impede the resumption of

sustainable growth (for an analysis of this issue, see Calvo and Frenkel

(l99lb))
