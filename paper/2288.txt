                Intergenerational Altruism and Social Welfare:
                       A Critique of the Dynastic Model




                                  ABSTRACT




      In this paper, I show that, under relatively weak conditions,

dynastic equilibria are never welfare optima. If a social planner sets

policy to maximi.ze a social welfare function, then, except in extreme

cases where the planner cares only about a single generation, successive

generations will never be linked through altruistically motivated

transfers.     This suggests that the dynastic model is unsuitable for

normative analysis, and, to the extent governments actually behave in

this manner, the model is also inappropriate for positive analysis. In

addition, I show that, except in a few special cases, the planner's

preferences are dynamically inconsistent.           If the planner can

successfully   resolve this inconsistency, then the central result is

somewhat modified.

 1.    Introduction
       A substantial body of recent research has   established   that a
 variety of important   issues concerning national savings policy hinge

 critically upon the nature of economic relationships within families.

 If, in particular, parents and children are linked by altruistically

motivated resource transfers, then each family may behave as though it

 is a single, infinite lived, "dynastic" unit. This observation has a

variety of implications, including the well-known Ricardian equivalence

theorem (see Barro [1974]).

      Although the dynastic framework has become a standard analytical

tool for applied theorists, particularly in the areas of public finance

and macroeconomics, it has also been criticized on a variety of grounds.

Many economists have challenged the empirical relevance of this

framework (see e.g. Feldstein [1976] and Buiter and Tobin [1981]), while

others have noted certain logical difficulties (see e.g. Bernheim and

Bagwell 11987] and Abel and l3ernheim 119861).

      In this paper, I discuss a new criticism of the dynastic model:

under relatively weak conditions, I show that dynastic equilibria are

never welfare optima. If the social planner sets policy to maximize a

social welfare function, then, except in extreme cases where the planner

cares only about a single generation, successive generations will never

be linked through altruistically motivated transfers. To the extent one

believes that the government does not behave in this manner, the

dynastic model remains a legitimate tool for positive analysis. It is,

however, unsuitable for normative analysis. Accordingly, studies which
                                    —2—




contemplate   optimal government policies while uBitaining dynastic

assumptions (see e.g. Judd [1985] and Chamley [19851) may lack internal

coherence.

      The intuition for this result is quite simple. Suppose that the

social planner places some weight on the well—being of two successive

generations. In a dynastic equilibrium, the older generation is

indifferent   about marginal transfers to the younger generation. But the
planner will attach some importance to the younger generation's strict
preference    for receiving such transfers. Welfare optimal intergene—

rational resource distribution can therefore be attained only if the

planner first drives the older generation to a corner, and then

undertakes additional transfers.!"

      In the abstract, this result is not new: similar arguments have

been used to draw related conclusions in other contexts (see Roberts

 [19841 and Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers figssl).   Yet certain

peculiar aspects of the dynastic problem warrant further probing.

Specifically, except in a few special cases, the planner's preferences

are dynamically inconsistent. Resolution of this inconsistency requires

 that, at each point in time, the planner behaves as though he continues

 to place weight on the well—being of past (deceased) generations. This

 fundamentally alters the nature of his problem.

       I assume that the planner discounts the stream of utilities from

 successive generations at the rate p, while individuals discount the

 stream of felicities at the rate 5. Letting the number of prior
                                                                    to
 generations go infinity, I find that the welfare optimum converges
                                           —3—



 the dynastic equilibrium if and only if         iS   > p.   Accordingly, the

dynastic model turns out to be an appropriate normative tool as long as

 (i) the planner never disregards the preferences of deceased

generations, and (ii) individuals do not discount felicity more rapidly

than the government discounts utility. If, on the other

hand, p > 5, dynastic equilibria will always involve excessive levels of

current   consumption relative to the limiting welfare optima. Indeed, as
long as S < p, changes in the level of private altruism have absolutely
no   effect on the planner's preferences.

       The paper is organized as follows. I describe the model is

section 2. Section 3 contains the basic criticism of the dynastic

framework, along with a discussion of dynamic consistency. In section

4, I discuss the relationship between dynastic equilibria and welfare

optima in an economy where the planner successfully resolves dynamic

inconsistency.



2.     The Model

       The economy considered here corresponds quite closely to that

analyzed by Barro [1974]. There is an infinite sequence of periods,

labelled t =     0,1,2,...,    as well as an infinite sequence of consumers,

which I also label t =        0,1,2,...   in order to emphasized the fact that

generation t is born in period t. Each generation lives for two

periods. Accordingly, two generations are alive in each period, with

the exception of period 0, during which generation 0 is alone. This

special treatment of period 0 is for analytical convenience only (it
                                              —4-




allows   me to avoid carrying around special terms for the "first"

generation); one could easily add an "old" generation in period               0.


         Generation t is endowed with wealth, wt, in period t. In

addition, it receives a bequest, bt_i, from its immediate predecessor

(without loss of generality, I adopt the convention that b1                   0). In

period t, it divides its resources between consumption, c, and

investment. I assume for simplicity that production is constant—

returns—to—scale      for capital investments, so that saving yields          a fixed


gross    return,   8 > 1.      In period t +             1, generation t divides the
procedes from its investments between consumption, c, and a bequest to

its successor, bt. Thus, generation t faces the following

intertemporal budget constraint:

                                               y        -1 0
                                          =                    +
(1)                         bt_i +   wt       c+    8
                                                         (ct       bt)
         In addition, generation t must also respect non—negativity

constraints:


                                                          0
(2)                                  c, c, bt

         I assume that each generation cares about the infinite stream of

consumption enjoyed by itself and its descendents:


                            ut =
                                      yoy o
                                   u(ct,ct,ct+i,ct+i,...)
I take these functions to be non—paternalistic, and additively

separable. Formally, I assume that there exists a function v: ]R2 + IR

such that
                                                 —5—




 (3)                y     0
                                   =         y    0               y      0
                 u(ct,ct,...)          v(ct,ct)         +


       Barro's   analysis of the Ricardian equivalence theorem introduced a

notion of equilibrium for such environments. In subsequent work, this

notion has been termed a "dynastic" equilibrium. Formally,

is a dynastic equilibrium if it nximizes


                                        v  t yo
                                        L sS v(ct,c)
                                       t=o

subject   to (1) and (2).

       Note that in a dynastic equilibrium, (c,c) must solve, for

each t,

                    max
                                 y 0
                              v(ct,ct)
                    y 0
                   ct,ct
                                    —1 0
                   subject to cy + 8 c =                        c'y 8 c
                                                                  +
                                                                       —V'o


We can therefore simplify the description of an equilibrium as

follows. Let


                          v(c) =    max v(c,8(C —                c))
                                   C>c>O

and consider the solution to



(4)                                    max              Stv(c)
                                                  t=O


subject   to


(5)                                +   81bt = w             +
                                                                bti
                                     -.6—




and


(6)                             Ct,bt > 0


This solution, <Ct,bt>to, corresponds exactly to a dynastic
equilibrium, in the sense that       =
                                         c+            Henceforth, we will

work with this "reduced form" notion of an equilibrium.

      This definition becomes still more familiar if an equilibrium has

the property that bt > 0 for all t. In that case, <C>0 solves


(7)                          max            5tv(c)

                             t
                           <C >t=0


subject to


                                     w
                         0_tCt =


and


(9)                              c>o
That is, whenever transfers are positive for all generations,

is simply the solution to a standard programming problem. At this

point, it is useful to define


                    {<c>0 I (8)      and (9) are     satisfied}

I note for future reference that S is compact in the product

topology. I will use C to denote an element of S.
                                    —7—



        Throughout, I nke the following additional assumptions on

preferences.


        Assumption 1: V is differentiable, monotonically increasing,

strictly concave, and satisfies urn v'(c) =    +, urn     v'(c) =   0, and
                                c+O                C+co
v(o) > —.

All   aspects of assumption I are standard, except the final restriction,

which places a lower bound on the dynastic optimization problem. One

can dispense with this lower bound at the cost of some additional,

tedious analysis in section 4, below. Note that the more traditional

restrictions on V guarantee that consumption is strictly positive in

all periods.


       Assumption 2:   58 < I


This condition is also standard, and guarantees that the dynastic

optimization problem is bounded above. Under assumptions I and 2, one

can demonstrate that the objective function in (7) is continuous over

S in the product topology. Accordingly, the solution to (7) is well—

defined.

       Before proceding, it is worthwhile to reflect beiefly on the

justification for using this notion of an equilibrium. It is easy to

demonstrate that a dynastic equilibrium is subgame perfect (see Selten

11965, 19751).. However, Gale 119851 has shown   that   it is not the only

subgame perfect equilibrium for this model. Indeed, there is a

continuum of subgame perfect outcomes, and one cannot discard these
                                     —8—



alternative solutions on the basis   of    any natural criterion, such as

dominance. Why then focus on dynastic equilibria?

        There are at least three reasons for doing so. First, the

strategic structure of a dynastic equilibrium is particularly simple——

each agent simply expects that   everyone     will act to maximize the

dynastic welfare function, and assumes that this is common knowledge.

Other equilibria involve more complex history—dependent punishments.

Since all generations can never meet to discuss strategies, it seems

unlikely that such complex strategic behavior will arise. Second, the

dynastic equilibrium is analytically convenient, since it corresponds

to the solution of a simple programming nroblem. Third, dynastic

equilibria have certain well—known properties, such as Ricardian

equivalence. Other refinements of the equilibrium set may or may not

have these properties, depending upon whether punishments remain

feasible after policy changes (see Bernheim and Bagwell r1987 and

O'Connell and Zeldes r1986]). While the second and third points do not

validate the dynastic concept, they no doubt account for part of its

popularity as an analytic device (see e.g. Judd [19851).

        I now turn from consumers to the social planner. The planner has

a   social welfare function, , which I assume to be additively

separable :2"



                                          =
(io)                     *(u0,u1,...)

where
                                        —9—




 (ii)
                                  0t = i

and where U IS given by (3). The planner nximizes (10) subject to

 (3) and


                                   y     C
 (12)
                                  Ct, c

 (note   that he is not bound by the non—negativity constraint on

transfers).

         So far, there is no guarantee that the sum in equation (10)

converges. I therefore impose


         Assumption 3 There exists T and n         with   n   <   I such that


                                               T




forall I >T.


Again,    standard arguments suffice to establish that, under assumption

3, 4 is continuous on S in the product topology, and therefore

achieves a maximum (the reasons for this will perhaps become clearer at

the beginning of section 3).

         Our objective in subsequent sections Is to determine the relation-

ship between dynastic equilibria and welfare optima.



3.       Difficulties with the Dynastic Concept
         In many instances, dynastic   models have been used to study optimal

public policy. The main result of       this section suggests that, quite
                                         —10—



generally, the preceding sentence is logically inconsistent, since the

optimum necessarily entails the use of policies which lead to a

violation of the basic dynastic assumptions.

       I begin by deriving through recursive substitution a direct

expression for the utility of generation t:



(13)                         ut =
                                     T   =t

By assumption, this sum   converges on S. Next, I write out the
planner's objective function explicitly in terms of consumption. Since

welfare optimal plans must always satisfy

                                y 0                   V   0
                          vi(ct,ct)       =
                                              v2(c,c)
(where subscripts denote partial derivatives) for all t, I can, as

before, simplify by expressing welfare as a function of


                                                      T-t
                                 =
                            —                             v(c)
                                      t=0       T=t
(14)
                                 =
                                     T=O t=0
                                                  pttt)t)
(one can now see the basis for my claim that assumption 3 bounds

achievable social welfare on s).

       Suppose now that we have some dynastic equilibrium,

First order conditions imply that


(15)                        v'(c) =
                                             —11—




 wherever bt > 0. Suppose further that              Pt > 0 for some t > 0.

 Consider a transfer of consumption, a, from generation t —               I   to t*:


                      dC
                                        —1    if t=t*1
                                              If t=t*
                                        0     otherwise

What effect does this have on welfare? Differentiating,

                                   t*—I
                          =   —

                              +
                                  8ptt*_t)v,(ct*)

                      =
                              topt            )i'


                                  t*_1
                           —8(
                                  t=0
                                         pt6t*_t)vt(Q)


                      =                       > 0
                          Pt*BV'(Ct*)

(where the second equality follows from substituting equation (15)).

Accordingly, <>= could not be a welfare optimum. We have therefore
proven:


      Theorem I: Suppose that p > 0 for some T               >   0. Let

<ct,bt>to be a dynastic equilibrium. If b11 > 0, then this
equilibrium is not a welfare optimum.
                                                —12—




           The intuition for this result is extremely simple. When

       > 0, generation T —              I   must be indifferent between the

consumption of t —              I   and T, as must all prior generations.

However, T strictly prefers to receive and consume a larger bequest.

Future generations are simply indifferent. Since the planner attaches

positive weight to T' well—being, he must also prefer such a

redistribution.

           Theorem I has an immediate and important corollary:


           Corollary 1: Suppose that Pt> 0 for all t.

be a dynastic equilibrium. If <C>0 is a welfare optimun, then

bt=O forall t.

Thus, in the standard case where the planner cares about every

generation directly, successive generations would never be linked

through operative transfers.

           One   might,    of course, take the view that the planner is an elected

government, and that this government should only represent the

preferences of its current constituency. One might then argue that it
is appropriate to take P0 = 1 and Pt = 0 for t > 0 in period 0.
P1
     = 1    and           = 0   for   t > 1 in period 1, and so forth. This would
indeed      validate the dynastic framework. However, this argument is

faulty. In general, several generations coexist in each period, and the

government should be somewhat responsive to each of these. This is

precisely why I formulated the problem in the context of an overlapping

generations model: one would, at a minimum, expect to have p0 and
                                   —13—



p1 strictly positive in period 0 (similarly in subsequent periods).

As long as the concurrent government is responsive to both living

generations in every period, one should never observe positive private

transfers from old to young.

      In the following section, I provide a partial resolution to the

problem described above. I motivate this resolution somewhat indirectly

by, perhaps paradoxically, introducing a second problem. This concerns

dynamic consistency. Normative policy analyses which employ the dynamic

framework typically proceed by assuming that the social planner acts to

maximize welfare through an optimal sequence of choices. If the

planner's objectives are dynamically inconsistent, then this prescrip-

tion is inappropriate, since the planner should rationally anticipate

future deviations from the plan which appears optimal at each instant.

      I will consider two different notions of dynamic consistency. The

appropriateness of each notion depends upon whether one takes the social

planner to be a representative government (as in the immediately

preceding discussion), or a "social architect." I elaborate on this

distinction below.

      The program which maximizes (10) subject to (3) and (12) satisfies

stationary dynamic consistency if, for all t, the continuation program

maximizes




                                T=tTtT
This corresponds to the notion of dynamic consistency proposed by Strotz

t19561 and Pollak rig6el.   Alternatively,   the program which maximizes
                                            —14—



(10) subject to (3) and (12) satisfies non—stationary dynamic

consistency if, for all t, the continuation program maximizes



                                              Pu
                                               TT
                                           •r=t

            It is useful to think first about these notions of dynamic

consistency in the case where         iS   = 0     (i.e., all generations are

selfish). Strotz's well known result establishes that the maximizing

program satisfies stationary dynamic consistency if and only if the

welfare weights are geometric, i.e.

                                                      t
                                           Pt =   P



for some P C        [0,1),   and for all t. In contrast, the maximizing

program always satisfies non—stationary dynamic consistency when

iS =   0.
            When are these two notions appropriate? If we think of the

planner as a government which responds to current political pressures,

then, unless the relative political strengths of old and young change

systematically over time, stationary dynamic consistency is relevant.

If the maximizing program does not satisfy stationary dynamic

consistency, then a current government cannot count on its successor to

persue the same objectives by continuing the same policies. Successive

governments will then be forced to treat policy formation as a strategic

problem.
            If, on the other hand, we think of the planner as a social

architect, such as an infinitely lived dictator (i.e. a true dynasty, in
                                          —15—



the original sense of the world), then non—stationary dynamic

consistency is relevant. The planner simply attaches weights to

specific generations, and these relative weights do not change as time

passes. However, if the planner's objective function does not satisfy

non—stationary dynamic consistency, he may not be able to stick to an

optimal plan chosen in period 0. In particular, he would have an
incentive to deviate from this plan in subsequent periods on the theory
that   what previous (deceased) generations      don't know can't hurt them.

Anticipating    such thinking at time 0, he would then act strategically
vis   a vis himself, in general choosing an action which is inconsistent

with   unconstrained maximization of (10).

        Unfortunately, in the presence of altruism (t5 > 0), the planner's

problem is almost always dynamically inconsistent, in both senses. I

establish this through two theorems.


        Theorem 2: The maximizing program satisfies stationary dynamic

consistency if and only if for some y > ô


                             =   I—i
                        P0        —




and


                             =   t(   —


for    t > 1.


        Proof: Noting from equation (14) that       4' is   additively

separable, we apply Strotz' [19561 well—known theorem to conclude that
                                                   —16—




there must     exist         k and ' such          that


                                                    t
(16)                                     kIt   =
                                                   T=O


for    all t. Thus,

                                   ,yt+l —
                                             k-j

                                                             Pti 6—(t÷i)
Accordingly,

                                         t+1            t        t
                                  Pt÷i=kI —ky6=k(y—6)
for all t > 0. Pt > 0 implies                        > 6. Substituting t = 0          into (16)

yields         =   k.       The constraint that                  =   I then   implies that

k = (1 —   y)/(i        —   6).    This establishes necessity. Sufficiency is

trivial.                                                                                 Q.E.D.


        Note   that,        for stationary dynamic consistency to hold, the

planner's welfare weights must decline geometrically after generation

0, but that generation 0 must receive extra weight. I should also

emphasize that the planner's problem is never dynamically consistent in

the stationary sense for the class of welfare functions satisfying



                                         p0+p1=1
and        = 0     for t > 1, and that, within an overlapping generations

framework, this is the most natural class of welfare functions for a

representative government.

         I now turn to the second notion of dynamic consistency.
                                                —17-



       Theorem 3: The nximizing program satisfies non—stationary

dynamic consistency if and only if there exists some t* such that



                                         pt* +P÷ = I

and P =0 for t<t* and t>t*+1.

       Proof: Note that


(17)                                 =
                      t=s                T= t=spt6T_tJcT

Dynamic consistency requires that for each s, the weights on

T > s in (17) are proportional to the weights in (14). That is, for

each s there exists                      such that for all t > a,

                           T
(18)                  kspt6T_t =
                                             5ptT_t
There are three cases to consider.

       (i)     k5 = 1.      Then, by (18), Pt = 0             for all t < a.

       (ii)    k5 =   0.    Then, by (18), Pt = 0             for all t > s.

       (iii)    k * 0, 1. Using (18), we see that for all T > 5,

                               t+1                  r+1
                           k      p T÷1—t =                5t+1—t
                            st=0 t                  t=s


or, dividing by S

                                 T +1               t +1
                                            T—t =
(19)
                                 t=0                t=s

Subtracting (18) from (19) yields

                                           =p T+1

Thus,              forall t>s.
        Let t be the smallest t for which Pt is positive (note:

                      Then   k     1 for all S     > t. Thus,    = 0   for all

        This result is extremely ironic. The class of social welfare

functions satisfying non—stationary dynamic consistency include those

functions     described above as "most natural" for a representative
government within an overlapping generations framework. Yet non—
stationary dynamic consistency         is not a relevant concept if one

conceives     of the planner as a representative government. This concept

is appropriate when the planner is a social architect, but in that case,

the class of social welfare functions described in Theorem 3 are

extremely     unnatural.
        I conclude that, in the presence of intergenerational altruism,

social dynamic inconsistency is a serious problem regardless of how one

conceives of the planner.



4.      A   L'ärtial Resolution
        Let   us   reflect for   a moment on the plight of the social architect.

In his case, dynamic inconsistency arises not from the fact that

relative     welfare weights change over time, but rather from an inability
to commit in advance to respect the preferences of each generation after
                                      —19—



 its demise. In practice, societies may         well   develop techniques based

upon both laws and customs which allow the planner at each point in time

 to restrict his future choices (i.e. through the adoption of a

constitution), and which may therefore alleviate problems stemming from

dynamic inconsistency. I shall not investigate here the nature or

efficacy of such techniques. For the purposes of this study, I simply

assume that considerations of this sort allow the planner to resolve

intertemporal conflicts without loss of efficiency. Accordingly, I look

at first best welfare optima, and compare them with dynastic equilibria.

      Yet this discussion suggests that the comparison of equilibria and

optima should be conducted a bit differently than in the preceding

section. Specifically, if the planner continues to respect the

preferences of each generation after its demise, then, in period 0, it

should also recall and respect the preferences of prior generations. As

we shall see, allowing for memory of this sort partially resolves the

problem raised by Theorem 1 (i.e. the divergence of equilibria and

optima).

      Throughout this discussion, we will assume that welfare weights

are geometric:


                                            t
                                Pt =    P



for some p c (0,1), and for all t. Further, we will assume that the

planner honors the preferences of r past generations, so that the

social welfare function is given by
                                             —20—




                                   yr   =

where




                                    T =max (   t, 0)
(note that we are only concerned with the consumptions of generations

t =    0,1 , •.., even though the preferences of prior generations come into
play). As in section 3, we express social welfare directly as a

function of consumptions:




                              =         Pt                T_tv(c)
                                  t=—r t=max(t,0)

                              =   (/)r r=0 t=0         pt45T_tv(c)



         I will   assume that we are interested in an economy that has been

operating for quite a long time, so that r is large. Formally, I will

let r go to infinity, and investigate the limiting properties of

yr      In some cases, the welfare function may blow up in the limit.

Since multiplication by a scalar does not change the ordinal properties

of yr it is appropriate in such cases to select a sequence of

scalars, <A >        ,   such that A rpr(C) converges on S.
              rr=0
         I now turn to the results.

         The interpretation of Theorem 4 is as follows. If private

individuals discount felicity at the rate             CS, and if the planner

discounts utility at the rate CS, then, as r becomes large, the

planner discounts felicity at the rate 5. This result is somewhat

surprising since, for r = 0, the planner discounts felicity at a very

different rate. Intuitively, it holds for the following reason. In the

limit, I!r(C) fails to converge, so asymptotically r''(C) places all

generation r < 0 has the same preferences,                         v(C), regarding

      Theorem 5 tells us that if individuals discount felicity at the

rate 6, the planner discounts utility at the rate p, and p > 6, then,

as r becomes large, the planner discounts felicity at the rate p.

This result is surprising for two reasons. First, p is defined as a

discount factor for utilities, and not felicities. Second, in the limit

the private discount factor 6 completely disappears from the planner's

objective function. Thus, the presence, absence, or degree of private

altruism is completely irrelevant to the planner, as long as altruism is

not too strong (i.e. 6 > p). Since               does converge in this case, the

intuition provided following Theorem 4 does not apply.

f or all C C S.   Uniform convergence is thereby established.               Q.E.D.


       Theorem 6 tells us that if individuals discount felicity at the

rate t, the planner discounts utility at the rate p, and 5 > p, then,
as r becomes large, the planner discounts felicity at the rate              .
This   result is surprising since, in the limit, the planner ignores his

own discount factor ()      entirely.    Indeed, his preferences coincide in

the limit with those of generation 0 (the intuition is the same as for

Theorem 4). This suggests that dynastic equilibria are indeed optimal

when 5 > p
       To establish that this conclusion is in fact warranted, I argue as

follows. Let C denote the solution to the "dynastic" optimization

problem (i.e. equation (4)), and let C denote the solution to the

same problem when p is substituted for 5. Finally, let r denote

the solution to maximizing         (given compactness of S, this is well—

defined under assumptions I and 3). Noting that S is compact and that

convergence of           is always uniform over S, we have



        Corollary: If    '5 > p, then lim        = C'5.   If p > '5, then
                           —
                                        r+                      —

urn r =

        The striking aspect of this result is that, in the limit, either

p or     '5 matters, but not both. In particular, supposing that 6 > p

and taking r large implies that the dynastic equilibrium is

arbitrarily close to a welfare optimum.

      From the point of view of a social architect, the optimality of

dynastic equilibria therefore depends upon a comparison of p and 5.

It is important to acknowledge that there is no a priori reason for

expecting that the inequality will go one way or the other. The case of

p =    has no particular significance, since p measures relative

weights on utilities, while t   measures relative weights on

felicities. One cannot, for example, appeal to the literature on the

social rate of discount, arguing that, since the government ought to be

more "forward looking" than the private sector, p > 5. In fact, p > 0

is alone sufficient to guarantee that individuals are impatient relative

to the planner.

      However, this analysis does provide us with a useful framework for

thinking about the economic importance of intergenerational altruism.

As long as altruism is not too strong, it has absolutely no effect on

the preferences of a social architect, and optimal policy will in

general drive private transfers to zero. On the other hand, if altruism

is sufficiently strong, the social architect's preferences coincide with

those of the oldest generation in every period. A dynastic equilibrium

with operative linkages then generates a first—best optimum.

Technically, the planner could also achieve an optimum through
Pigouvian subsidies, in which case he would not need to drive
successive generations to coerners. In practice, it would be
extremely difficult to implement such a policy, in that the
planner would need to fine tune the subsidy separately for the
degree of altruism in each family (indeed, it may not possess the
necessary information). Note in addition that a policy of
subsidization would also remove us from the traditional dynastic
framework.

One could easily allow     to depend upon the current capital
stock, as in standard models. However, this would add an
additional layer of obscurity to the analysis without changing
anything of substance.

Theorem I only requires that 4    be stirctly increasing in certain
arguments.
