       Economists' productivity, as measured by publication in leading journals, declines very

sharply with age. Additional evidence shows that this is a rational response to economic

incentives and/or changing physical or mental abilities: There is no difference by age in the

probability that an article submitted to a leading journal will be accepted. The probability of

acceptance does show increasing heterogeneity with age that is related to the author's quality,

consistent with models of optimal investment in human capital and especially with occupational

matching models.

         Wages peak well before retirement. The usual explanation of the

wage drop late in the work life is that productivity eventually declines because

falling returns on marginal investments in human capital with age generate

decreases in the optimal amount of investment. A nonecononi.ist might admit

that this is correct, but would also note that another plausible cause is that

people eventually become physically and/or mentally less productive and less

capable of learning new skills. In this note I use some unusual data to

document the decline in productivity with age and to examine its causes.

I. Age and Publication among Economists

         There is substantial evidence that economists' incentives to publish

diminish with age. The additional lifetime earnings generated by an extra arti-

cle decrease at each ae and diminish as the horizon becomes shorter. Tuck-

man and Leahey (1975) estimate that the marginal payoff for economists in

their fifties may be one-tenth that for economists in their late twenties, and

Sauer (1988) demonstrates that this remains true accounting for the quality of

publications and their impact on other scholars. There is no direct evidence

that physical/mental deterioration occurs in this group, but there is some

evidence for the population generally (Lydall, 1968, pp. 113 passim.)

        Lehman (1953) demonstrates the early peak in productivity in a

variety of endeavors, and Diamond (1986) documents the pattern for several

scholarly pursuits. The first row in each pair of years in Table 1 presents a

similar exercise for economists, showing the ages of authors of full-length

                                       I
refereed articles in leading journals (the American Economic Review, Journal

of Political Economy and Quarterly Journal of Economics).1 The median age

of authors in the 1980s and 1990s was 36. Scholars over age 50 when their

studies are published are a minute fraction of all authors in these journals.

Creative economics at the highest levels is clearly a young person's game.2

        That is as true in the 1990s as it was in the 1960s, though the age

distribution of authors does seem to have shifted rightward slightly in the late

1970s. This may have occurred because the age when people write their

Ph.D. dissertations, thus effectively entering full-time scholarly research,

increased sharply during the 1970s due to later matriculation and longer

duration of graduate education (Ehrenberg, 1991).

         The second row in each pair in Table I shows the age distributions

of random samples of the membership of the American Economic Association

in years near those for which the authors' ages were tabulated.3 The

distributions are heavily concentrated between 36 and 50. Decadal variations

reflect rapid expansion of American universities in the middle and late l960s,

stagnation in the 1970s and much of the 1980s, and a possible fragmentation

of the profession in the 1980s as specialized associations expanded. A sub-

stantial percentage of AEA members is over age 50, implying that older

economists are greatly underrepresented among authors in major journals

relative to their presence among those who view themselves as part of the

economics profession.

                                       2
II. Rationally Declining Productivity
        The outcomes of the publishing process suggest that economists' beha-

vior is quite consistent with incentives, whether these arise from economic

considerations facing workers whose abilities do not diminish with age, or

from declining inherent capacities. The results are not informative, however,

about whether workers are aware of these incentives and/or changed

capacities. Information on age and productivity reflects outcomes, not the

process that generates them.

         One possibility for examining whether the outcomes reflect rational

responses by scholars to changing incentives and capacities is to examine

people's behavior as they age. That is, do older economists continue trying,

albeit with little success, to produce high-quality scholarly research? Or do

they instead recognize their diminished capacities and the decreasing economic

returns to scholarship and decrease their rate of production, presumably

optimally cutting investment in themselves?

        To distinguish between these possibilities I obtained data on a random

sample of initial submissions to one of the three major journals during a four-

month period in 1991. (Some of the data were initially supplied by the

journal's office for use in Hamermesh, 1994.) Refereeing at this journal is

double-blind, so that the chance that referees (though possibly not the editors)

were affected by authors' reputations is reduced. The ages of the authors of

these 313 papers are measured in 1993 to make them comparable to the other

                                       3
data and to account for the probable two-year average lag between submission

of a paper and its publication. Information on age is available for over 99

percent of all authors.4

        The first two rows of Table 2 show that the distribution of submitters

at this particular journal has many more older economists than are represented

by the data on publications in Table 1. Partly this may be because I cannot

separate notes (excluded from Table 1) from full-length articles. Partly too it

could just be an unusual random draw. The most important result in Table 2

is in the third row: The acceptance rate is remarkably constant across the

three age groups.5 On averaRe, there is no decline with age in the acceptance

rate of papers submitted to this major journal.6

         To check that this startling result does not reflect the influence of

other measurable effects I estimate a probit on the acceptance probability. In

addition to the pair of indicator variables, age less than 36, and age 36 to 50,

I also include variables indicating whether the author was a member of the

ABA, was in a top 20 department (as listed in Blank, 1991), was not resident

in North America, and was female. Also in the probit is an indicator of

whether the author was cited by other researchers at least ten times in 1991

(was well-cited), as listed in the Social Science Citation Index. This 1t is a

good proxy for the quality of the author's previous work (and presumably

predicts the quality of the submission).



                                       4
        Estimates of the probit in the first column of Table 3 corroborate the

results in Table 2. There is no difference in acceptance rates between authors

ages 36-50 and those over 50. This is not due to any nonrandomness in

submission propensities by age and quality of authors: The oldest authors are

as likely to be well-cited as the middle group, which reflects perfectly their

relative performance in the population of economists.7 The citations variable

is strongly and significantly positive. A well-cited author's work has over

twice the chance of acceptance as that of someone who is not well-cited.8

Other than that only residence outside North America has a significant

(negative) effect on acceptance, perhaps a reflection of the authors' relative

unfamiliarity with the kind of work the journal publishes.

Ill. Matching and Heterogeneity
        Taken together the results suggest that on avera2e scholars recognize

one or both of the possibilities that might reduce the quality or quantity of

output as they age. We can learn a bit more about the age-productivity

relationship from the following slight modification of Ben-Porath's (1967)

model of earnings and investment in human capital. The same point could be

made in a model of workers' matching to activities (e.g., Miller, 1984). At

each age the worker maximizes:


                  (1)          JT[W(1-&)      + ]e di,


                                      5
where the gross wage is the return on human capital, W = pHi, initial human

capital H(O) = H0 , and
               = øiwt - ad-It

where ô1 is the depreciation rate on human capital, T is the expected date of

retirement, 0 is the rate of investment, and U is an individual-specific term

with mean zero and some variance. The U term may reflect innate ability,

commitment to research, or any other individual-specific effect that does not

vary with age.

            It is easy to show that for the average person (0 = 0) optimal

investment declines as C increases and stops at some point, leading to an

eventual decline in productivity (and wages). This arises because the horizon

is getting shorter and because 6 may increase with t. For people with higher

O, however, the stopping point for investment is later. Economic incentives

continue for better scholars longer than for others, even if agents are identical

in all other respects. Thus we should expect the experiences of workers as

they age to become more heterogeneous, with successful authors coming

increasingly from the population of higher-quality scholars as the truncation

of the distribution of 0    moves   further right. Scholars with high O can be

viewed as having skills that match well those required for success in this

activity.

            To examine this possibility interaction terms between the indicator

variables for age and the extent of citations were added to the probit. The

                                         6
estimates are reported in column (2) of Table 3. None of the interactions is

significant; but they do show that, compared to the two younger groups,

potential authors over age 50 who are not well-cited are very unlikely to have

their papers accepted, while those who are well-cited are much more likely to

be successful.

          The result is shown clearly in Figure 1, which presents acceptance

rates for each age group disaggregated by citation status. (A simulation using

the probit coefficients yields a similar picture.) Comparing authors age 36-50

to those over 50, it is quite clear that heterogeneity is increasing. This appears

to be less true in comparing the oldest to the youngest group, but that

inference is due mainly to a very small sample: Only 6 authors under age 36,

the future superstars of the profession, were well-cited.

IV. Conclusion

          Remarkably few older people publish successfully in maj or economics

journals. That the acceptance rate for submitted articles is invariant with

respect to age implies that scholars recognize that incentives diminish as they

age and possibly that their capacities also decrease. The evidence of

increasing heterogeneity as people age beyond their mid-thirties is consistent

with a model of investment in human capital by agents with different inherent

abilities whose match to a particular activity — high-quality scholarship --

becomes   increasingly apparent with age.

                       FOOTNOTES

1.   No doubt other journals and non-journal outlets of
scholarly work are important. These are, however, the three
general journals in North America that have the biggest impact
on the profession (Stigler Qai. 1992). Included in the table
are all full-length articles except Nobel Prize and AFA
Presidential addresses. Comments, replies, notes, etc., are
also excluded.

2. Despite the documentation of the declining productivity of
scholars as they age the fact is apparently not well known
among economists. 118 economists were asked (by letter or
electronic mail) to give their best estimate of the distribution
of authors of full-length articles in major general journals.
The means of the 94 responses were 29.5, 47.8 and 22.7
percent for the three age categories listed in Table 1. The 13
respondents who were over age 50 differed only very slightly
in their perceptions of the relation of age and publication.

3. These data are based on 1000 randomly selected members
of the AEA in the particular year. From each issue of the
AEA Handbook (or its successor) the first 200 names listed
under the letters A, D, L, R and W were sampled.
Throughout I use chronological age rather than years since
receipt of the Ph.D., because not all authors have doctorates.

4. Roughly 75 percent of these authors were AEA members
in 1989 or 1993, and 70 percent listed their ages. Information
on the other 29 percent included in the tables was obtained
through telephone calls and letters.

5. Disaggregating into finer age categories, the acceptance
rates and numbers of submitters are: Age less than 30, .130
(23); 31-35, .120 (100); 36-40, .115 (104); 41-45, .147 (68);
46-50, .071 (56); 51-55, .100 (30); above 55, .148 (27). The
acceptance rates are nowhere nearly significantly different
from each other as a group; and the largest t-statistic
describing the 21 pairwise differences is only 1.33.

6. A large fraction of the papers were coauthored. If we
weight the data by the number of coauthors instead of
assigning each author the same weight, the results in this and
the next table change only minutely. It is also not the case
that successful young authors' work represents Ph.D. theses
or collaborations with senior colleagues. Only 2 papers by the
15 such authors were parts of dissertations; and only 3 of the
others were coauthors of papers with senior colleagues.

7. In random samples of 100 AEA members in each group,
15 of those 36-50 were well-cited and 16 of those over 50
were.

8. Of the 408 authors 19 were heavily-cited (50 or more
citations in 1991). The coefficient on an additional dummy
variable for this group was positive, but the difference
between the experience of this group and other well-cited
authors was insignificant.
