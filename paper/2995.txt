    Tied sales have a long history of scrutiny under the antitrust laws of

the United States. The primary basis for the condemnation of this practice

has been the court's belief in what has come to be known as the "leverage

theory" of tying: that is, that tying provides a mechanism whereby a firm

with monopoly power in one market can use the leverage provided by this

power to foreclose sales in, and thereby monopolize, a aecond market, In

recent years, however, the leverage theory has come under heavy attack. In

this paper, I reconsider the leverage hypothesis.     I argue that, in an

important sense, the models used by the critics of the leverage theory-

which all assume that the tied good market has a competitive, constant

returns-to-scale structure- are incapable of addressing the central concern

of the leverage theory, that tying can be profitably used to change the

market structure of the tied good market. I then demonstrate that when the

tied good market has an oligopolistic structure, tying can indeed serve as

a mechanism for leveraging market power through the foreclosure of tied

market rivals sales. The mechanism through which this foreclosure occurs,

 its profitability for the monopolist, and its welfare implications are

 discused in detail.

1. Introduction

    A firm engages in tying when it makes the sale (or price) of one of

its products conditional upon the purchsser also buying some other product

from it. Tying has a long history of scrutiny under the antitrust laws of

the United States, and throughout this history it hss been harshly treated

by the courts,' A primary basis for this condemnation haa been the

courts belief in what has come to be known as the "leverage theory" of

tying: that is, that tying provides a mechanism whereby a firm with

monopoly power in one market can use the leverage provided by this power

to foreclose sales in, and thereby monopolize, a second market.

     In recent years the leverage theory has come under heavy attack from

a number of authors (see, for example. Director snd Levi (1956], Bowman

(1957], Posner [1976], and Bork (1978]) whose arguments are traceable to

the University of Chicago oral tradition associated with Aaron Director.

A typical rendition of their criticism goes along the following lines:

Suppose thst a firm is a monopolist of some good A that a consumer values at

level VA and that costs cA to produce. The consumer also consumes some other

product B that she values at level 5, can he produced at a unit cost of

and is competitively supplied. Now, the monopolist jg require the consumer


1tying doctrine was originally developed in patent cases (Motion Picturiaa
Pstenta ç9,, y Universal flj, Manufac!:Mrjjig      243 U.S. 502 (1917)]. Since
then a long line of case law has deveoped both under section 1 of the Sherman
Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act [See, for example, International is z..
       332 U.S. 392 (1947) and Northern PacUk Railway Qg.,. y LL. 356 U.S. I
(1958)]. Similsr ideas have also been developed under Section 2 of the Sherman
Act (See, for exszsple ILL. L.  Griffith, 334 U.S. 100 (1948) and Q.J 2...
United       Machinery         110 F. Supp. 295 (D. Mass 1953).]. Two cases
involving less harsh treatment are Times-Picayune Publishing ct. i... ILL., 345
u.S. 594 (1953) and ILL. t. Jerrold Electronica          365 U.S. 567 (1961).


                                  I
to purchase good B from him if she wants good A, but what will he gain? The

consumer will only purchase such a bundle if its price is no larger than VA+CB

and so the monopolist can do no better than earning (vA.cA). the level it

earns selling good A independently. In short, there is only one monopoly

profit that can be extracted,

     Similar arguments are given for the case of complementary products.

?osner [1976], for example, comments that:



       [A fatal] weakness of the leverage theory is its inability
       to explain jy a firm with a monopoly of one product would
       want to monopolize complementary products as well. It may
       seem obvious..., but since the products are by hypothesis
       used in conjunction with one another. ., , it
                                                   is not obvious
       at all. if the price of the tied product is higher thsn the
       purchaser would have to pay on the open market, the
       difference will represent an increase in the price of the
       final product or service to him, and be will demand less of
       it, and will therefore buy less of the tying product. To
       illustrate, let a purchaser of data processing be willing to
       pay up to $1 per unit of computation, requiring the use of 1
       second of machine time and 10 punch cards, each of which
       costs 10 cents to produce. The computer monopolist can rent
       the computer for 90 cents a second and allow the user to buy
       cards on the open market for I cent, or, if tying is
       permitted, he can require the user to buy cards from him at
       10 cents a card- but in that case he must reduce his machine
       rental charge to nothing so what has he gained?
            As this example suggests, in the absence of price
       discrimination a monopolist will obtain no additional
       profits from monopolizing a complementary product.



     Thus, the critics contend, if a monopolist does employ tying his

motivation is not leverage but some other objective such as price

discrimination (Bowman [1957]). achieving economies of joint sales, protection

of goodwill, risk sharing, or cheating on a cartel price that has either

socially beneficial, or at worst, ambiguous consequences. This view has also

been reinforced by the more formal   economics literature on tying by   single

product monopolists because of that literatur&s exclusive focus on price

discrimination motivations for the practice (see, for exsmple, Burstein

[1960). Blair and Kaserman [l97B], and Scbmalensee [19821). Thus, Posner

                                 2
[1976] goes on to note that 'the replacement of leverage by price

discrimination in the theory of tie-ins haa been part of the economic

literature for almost twenty years", while Bork [19781 sums up his discussion

of tying,


       [the leverage] theory of tying arrangements is merely
       another example of the discredited transfer of power
       theory, and perhaps no other variety of that theory has
       been so thoroughly and repeatedly demolished in the legal
       and economic literature.

Though this conclusion may be worded a bit strongly, it is fair to say

that these criticisms have had a tremendous impact in both legal and economic
           2
circles.

     In an important sense, however, the existing literature does not really

sddress the central concern inherent in the leverage theory, namely, that

tying may be an effective (and profitable) means for a monopolist to affect

the market structure of the tied good market (i.e., 'monopolize" it) by making

continued operation unprofitable for tied good rivals. The reason lies in the

literature's pervasive (and sometimes implicit) assumption that the tied good

market has a competitive, constant returns-to-scale structure, With this

assumption, the use of leverage to affect the market structure of the tied

good market is actually imposeible. Thus, in contrast to a concern over the

effects of tying on market structure, the existing literature's focus is on a

demand-side notion of 'leverage': the idea that, taking the prices cherged by

tied good competitors as given, a firm might be able to extract greater



21n a recent antitrust textbook, for example, Blair and Kaserman [1985]
comment that "according to this view, somehow the seller expands or levers his
monopoly power from one market to another. This, of course, is not possible.
A seller cannot get two monopoly profits from one monopoly . . .Thus, the
leverage theory of tying is unsatisfactory." The 1985 Department of Justice
Vertical Restraints Guidelines state that "Tying arrangements often serve
procompetitive or competitively neutral purposes.... (They generally do not
have a significant anticompetitive potential." For a recent rebuttal to this
view in the legal literature, however, see Kaplow [1985].


                                  3
profits from consumers by tying.3'4

     In this paper, I reexamine the leverage hypothesis. In particular, I

examine several simple models which depart from the competitive, constant

returns-to-scale structure assumed in the existing literature. In contrast,

here I assume that scsle economies exist in the production process for the

tied good, and as a result, the structure of thst market is oligopolistic.

     In these mcdels I address three basic questions. First, can tying

succeed in altering the market structure of the tied good market, and if so,

how? Second, is it a profitable strategy? Third, what are the welfare

consequences? As we shall see, tying can lead to a monopolization of the tied

good market. Most interestingly, the mechanism through which this exclusion

occurs is foreclosure: by tying, the monopolist reduces the sates of its tied

good market competitor, thereby lowering his profits below the level that

would justify continued operation.

     Tying is frequently a profitable strategy for the monopolist in these

models, and is often so precisely because of its potential for altering the

market structure of the tied good market. The particular circumstances in

which tying is a desirable strategy for the monopolist, however, depend in

part on whether he is able to make a precommitment to tie. In many

circumstances this is indeed possible. One of the primary ways in which this


3lndeed, this is exactly the sense in which the existing literature can be
said to focus on price discrimination aspects of the practice; it analyzes
whether tying is a profitable strategy gjysn the prices of tied good
competitors (which can be thought of as creating an induced demand structure
for the monopolist). In contrast, here my focus is on the ability of tying to
change those prices, in particular, by making continued operation unprofitable
for competitors.

4Note that even in those existing models where the tying good is essential for
the use of the tied good (as in Bowman [19571), exit of the tied good
producers from that market is actually irrelevant as far as the monopolist is
concerned. For example, if a group of consumers exist who use the tied good
alone and rival tied good manufacturers continue to sell their product to
these consumers at the same competitive price, the monopolist's strategy is
equally effective (by way of contrast, see Section 4C below).


                                 4
can be accomplished is through product design and the setting of production

processes, both of which may involve significant sunk costs. By bundling

components of its system together, or by making interfaces between the

separately sold components incompatible with their rivals' components, firms

can precommit to their marketing strategy. IBM, for example, was accused of

incorporating increased amounts of storage into its central processing units

in order to prevent sales by plug compatible memory manufacturers and also of

trying to achieve interface incompatibility for the same purpose (Fisher.

McGowan, and Greenwood (1983], p. 332-3). Kodak was accused of designing its

new film and camera in a format incompatible with rival manufacturers'

products [Berkey     QSQL'. Eastman jg4g)s ç, 603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir.,l979fl.

     On the other hand, in a significant number of tying cases little more

than an easily changed marketing decision seems to be involved. For example.

                                     LI.. [345 U.S. 594 (1953)] the publisher

      Finally,   when tying does lead to exclusion of rivals, the welfare effects

 both for consumers and for aggregate efficiency are in general ambiguous. The

 potential gain for consumers arises for the usual reasons associated with

 price discrimination. The loss, of course, arises because when tied market

 rivals exit prices may rise and the level of variety available in the market

 necessarily falls. Indeed, in the models studied here, tying that leads to

 the exit of the monopolist's tied market rival frequently leads to increases

                                    5
in all prices, making consumers uniformly worse off. The effect on aggregate

welfare, on the other hand? is uncertain due to the usual inefficj.ences in the

number of firms entering sn industry in the presence of scale economies and

oligopolistic pricing.

      Though most tying cases involve products that are complements

 (particularly those where precommitment is involved), for expositional

purposes I begin below by considering the case of independent products. In

Section 2, 1 first analyze the simple case where all consumers have an

 identical valuation of the monopolized product, so that the monopolist, if he

chooses to price his goods independently, can fully extract all of the surplus

 from his monopolized good. I first show that, absent precommitment, tying is

not a useful strategy for the monopolist; any equilibrium outcome will be

equivalent to one where only independent pricing is allowed. Despite this

 fact, however, a preconitment to tying can be a profitable strategy for the

monopolist due to its potential for excluding his tied market rival. This

 exclusionary effect arises due to what I call "strategic foreclosure": tying

 represents a commitment to foreclose sales in the tied good market, which can

 drive its rival's profits below the point where remaining in the market is

 profitable. This strategic incentive to foreclose sales in the tied good

 market occurs because once the monopolist has committed to offering only tied

 sales, it can only reap its profit from its monopolized product by making a

 significant number of sales of the tied good. Thus, in this model, tying

 necessarily lowers the profits of the monopolist's tied good rival. I then

 discuss the implications of such a commitment to tying for the monopolist's

 profits, for consumers, and for aggregate efficiency, and present a simple

• example to illustrate these points.

      In Section 3, 1 investigate how the presence of heterogeneous preferences

 among consumers for the monopolized good affects these results. Two basic

 findings emerge. First, with heterogeneous preferences for the tying good,

                                   6
tying no longer necessarily results in strategic foreclosure snd the lowering

of the monopolist's tied good rival's profits (though it still doea in many

circumstances)- If, for example, a significant number of consumers in the

tied market have Low valuations of the tying good, tying (not surprisingly)

will be not be a successful exclusionary device. In addition, a more subtle

effect may prevent a commitment to tying from lowering the tied good rival's

profita   This occurs when tying substantially decreases the responsiveness of

the monopolist's demand to price changes relative to the level previously

prevailing in the tied good market.

     Second, with heterogeneous valuations, tying can now also be a profitable

strategy in the absence of precommitment. There are two senses in which this

is true. First, in a purely static sense, the monopolist may find tying to be

a profitable strategy given its rival's price. This motivation for tying is

analagous to that in the monopolistic bundling literature (e.g., Adams and

Yellen t1976]; McAfee, KcMillan, and Whinston (1987]), but here can have

important competitive effects: tied product market rivals can find their sales

foreclosed and continued operation unprofitable. Second, even when tying is

not profitable in this static sense, it may be in a dynamic sense when the

exclusion of rivals through predation is possible. In such cases, tying can

be a profitable strategy for the monopolist precisely because it forecloses

the sales of the monopolist's tied market rival.

      In Section 4, I turn to the case of complementary products used in fixed

proportions. I first consider a model of fixed proportions that is

essentially an extension of the simple example quoted above from Posner (1976]

 to the case where the tied good market involves scale economies and

 oligopolistic behavior. Despite these differences, Poaner's central

 contention continues to hold: a monopolist of one component never finds it

 worthwhile to tie in order to reduce the level of competition in the market

 for the other component. The reason lies in the fact that when the

                                  7
monopolized product is essential for at]. uses of the products, the monopolist

can always benefit from more competition in. the market for other components

through sales of its monopolized product. Nevertheless, I then show that in

two natural extensions of this model where the monopolized product is no

longer essential for all uses of the non-monopolized components, tying once

again emerges as a profitable exclusionary strategy. In one case, the

presence of an inferior, competitively supplied alternative to the monopolized

component leads to results that parallel those for independent products. In

the other caae, the existence of a second use for ths non-monopolized product

(such as a replacement part market) can give the monopolist an incentive to

tie in order to reduce competition in this other market.

     Finally. I conclude in Section 6 with a brief discussion of the

implicationa of these findings.



2. 1n&n       hi   Products

              I begin by considering an extremely simple model with independent

products. There are two markets, which I label A and B. Market A is

monopolired by firm 1 (say, due to a patent). Market B, on the other hand,

is potentially served by two firms, firm 1 and firm 2. The products of

firms 1 and 2 in market B are differentiated. Production in market B

involves fixed costa of K plus an expenditure of c8i per unit for firm i.

Unit costs for good A era CA.

              Consumers, who are indexed by d   [0,1]   with total measure I,

desire at most I unit of each good. All consumers have a reservation value

of y >        for good A, while a consumer of type d has a valuation of vzi(d)
         cA
for a unit of firm i's product B. Reeale of products by consumers is



5For expositional. simplicity, 1 ignore the possibility that there are fixed
costs for product A.

assumed to be prohibitively costly. In the absence of tying by firm         1.
consumers simply respond to individual product prices (PAPBISPS2). Firm

i's sales of product Si are then given by some function xL(P51,232) S I

which I assume to be everywhere differentiable and satisfy (subscripts

denote partial derivatives);




                                 0 if ji, >0 if 5i(.,.)          -(0,1)
                            —
                                ' sO if j—i, <0 if x (-.)         (0,1);


that is, products 31 and 32 compete with one another for consumer purchases.

When bundling is not permitted (which I will refer to below as an

"independent pricing game0) it is easy to see that firm 1 will always set

   — 1.   It is also useful for what follows to define each firm i's best

response correspondence in market S by P(P) which solves:



               max (2c)
                psi



I assume that this correspondence is single-valued continuous, and
                      *                  6
differentiable with P3(P3J) C (0.1).

     In the next two subsections I analyze the use of tying both for cases

where firm I can precommit to tie and where it cannot. For the case without

precommitment I analyze a simple two-stage game. In stage one, each firm

simultaneously decides whether to be active in market 5. If firm i decides to

be active, it incurs the cost K1. In stage 2. the firms pick prices

 (simultaneously if both are active) -       If   fiçm 1 is active in market B, it can

offer three different items for sale; good A at a price of A' good SI. at a


6Thus products are strategic complements in the sense of Sulow,
Geanskoplos, and Klemperer t195J    Also, note that under this
assumption there is a unique static independent pricing equilibrium.


                                    9
price of FEll and a bundle consisting of one unit of good A and one unit of

good El at a price of P. Throughout I assume that firm I. is unable to monitor

customer purchases; this assumption rules out the use of requirements

contracts (where a consumer agrees as a condition of buying good A not to buy

good E2) and also implies that a bundle will be purchased only if F ABl-

       To analyze the csse where precommitnient is possible, I extend this gsme

to three stages. In the (new) first stage of the game, firm 1 commits to

which subset of three possible products- good A, good El, and a bundle- it

will be able to produce. For example, firm I can commit itself to a

position where it will only be able to produce a bundle. The second and

third. stages are then identical to the no commitment game, but with firm 1

only able to offer for sale those items that it is able to produce.7 Thus1

as discussed in the introduction by setting its design and production

process, firm 1 is able to commit to a tying strategy.

       Finally, at various points below I make comparisons between the

outcomes of these two games and those of a game where firm I only offers

goods A and El independently (more precisely, a game that is the sans as the

no precommitment game but where bundling is prohibited). I refer to this

game   as the "independent pricing game."


A.   Ixjng !kthcut Precommitnent
       Consider first the no commitment game. In the sscond stage of this game,
if   firm 1   is active in market B it selects three (non-negative) prices:

 (FAlPBlF].
                 It is said to tie whenever it   sets P < Agl' that is, whenever
 it offers product A on more advantageous tens to a consumer who also
 7Note that as long as firm I can produce both goods A and 31 separately it
 can still offer a bundle for sale.

 Thus taking firm 2's price as given, firm 1. picks these three prices
 acting as a monopolist on its residual demand structure.


                                    10
purchases product Si. As the following proposition makes clear, however,

tying is not a useful strategy in this game.



     Proposition : Any subgame perfect equilibrium outcome of the no

commitment game is economically equivalent to a subgame perfect equilibrium

outcome in the independent pricing game.



     g9.f: The proposition is established by arguing that in the subgames of

the no commitment game in which firm I is active in market B, any Nash

equilibrium in prices is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium in the corresponding

subgame of the independent pricing game. Then, given the equivalence of the

equilibria in the pricing aubgames, firma' .decisions about whether to be

active in market B must also be equivalent in the two games.

     Consider the subgame where both firms are active in market B. The

equivalence of equilibria is demonstrated by arguing that for any set of

prices ((P,P1,F°); F2] that constitute a Nash equilibrium in the no

commitment game there is a set of independent prices 11A'1'Bl such that sales

and profits are the same for gft firms under prices ((PA.FBl); F52] as under

                                           and are the same for firm 2 for
prices [(P,P1,P°); F52] when
P62.9 This implies that               B2 is a Nash equilibrium in the

independent pricing game (note that firm 1 now has fewer possible deviations).

     The equivalence clearly holds if firm l's equilibrium strategy has

           so suppose that P°F+F1. There are three cases to consider.

First, suppose that F>-?. If this is firm l's best response then it must be

that all consumers are buying firm l's bundle since otherwise firm I could do

better by setting      while leaving all of its other prices unchanged: this


9while the text discusses economic equivalence in terms of identical sales
and profits for the firms, it is in fact easy to see that all consumers also
have identical consumption and expenditures in the two games.

price would make profitable sales of product A to those consumers not buying

the bundle, while having no effect on firm l's sales of either good RI or the

bundle (since consumers are indifferent about buying good A at this price).10

In addition, since all consumers are purchasing the bundle (and therefore none

sre purchasing either A or Ri alone) it cannot be that P°< since, if it were,

firm I could do better by offering only the bundle at a price of '.    But   if

this is so then setting A' •81 •y] yields identical sales and profits to

both firms given       and identical profits to firm 2 for all B2' Second,

          cannot arise in an equilibrium: since all consumers would be buying

firm l's bundle (all consumers would be willing to buy good A individually and

they can get good A cheaper by buying the bundle) firm 1 would increase its

profits by offering only the bundle at a price of 'y.   Finally, if      and

PP°J then each consumer buys either good A alone or the bundle from firm 1.

The basic idea behind Proposition 1 is fairly straightforward. First, it is

always worthwhile for firm I to make sure that all consumers purchase product

A either alone or in the bundle. Given that all consumers are consuming good

A, however, if firm I engages in tying then consumers choose between buying

only good A or the bundle from firm 1. They do so by imputing an effective

price (of either         or P1 depending on the configuration of prices) to

 the product 51 portion of the bundle, which makes tying effectively

     The negative reault of Propoaition 1 changes dramatically if firm 1 is

able to precommit to tying through its choice of which goods it will be

able to produce. In the three stage game that I have described above, firm I

can choose to produce seven different sets of goods: both goods individually,

both goods individually and also a bundle, the bundle only, the bundle and

product A, the bundle and product El, A only, and El only. The argument in

Proposition I implies that the first two options both yield outcomes

equivalent to those in the independent pricing game and so they are strictly

better for firm I than the last two (which yield lower profits to firm 1 in

any subgame where it is active and at least as large profits to firm 2 when it

is active). In fact, the following two lemmas indicate that firm l's choice

is essentially between producing independent goods and producing only the

bundle.




     L&mm   j:     Any subgame perfect equilibrium outcome in the subgame of

the commitment game where firm 1 can produce only the bundle and product A

is equivalent to a subgame perfect equilibrium outcome of the independent

pricing game.

     ft:         The argument is similar to that used to prove Proposition 1.

Suppose that both firma are active. First, if P-y in an equilibrium,

then all consumers must be buying the bundle,        must be at least t. and

independent prices of rPA—r P31—P°-,1 yield identical sales and profits for

Second, setting P°CPI7 again cannot occur in an equilibrium. Finally, if

profits for the two firms for sll P2. The argument when only firm I is

                                    13
active follows a similar line and the equivalence of the firms' decisions

regarding activity in market B then follows.

bundle to buying only product El if and only if              Thus, setting

        cannot be an optimal strategy for firm 1 if it results in e positive

level of sales since by setting            firm 1 makes exactly the same number

of sales of the bundle as it did of product El only (for any P62 if firm 2 is

active), but at a larger margin (since 1r>cA). Suppose first that firm 2 is

active. In any equilibrium, r(P;1,P°);P;,). either              or

and firm 1 makes no sales. If, instead, firm 1 sold only a bundle at a price

of Po in the former case and at a price of P1+ in the latter, then the

outcome for both firms is the same when P52—P2 and it is the same for firm 2

for all P62. A similar argument holds if firm 2 is not active. Therefore, any

perfect equilibrium outcome (including decisions regarding activity in market

6) ia equivalent to one that arises after firm 1 has committed to producing

only the bundle.

firm 2 earns less than it does in the independent pricing game.

effect at all: if fin 1 were charging independent prices of P--y and Pg11

a switch to bundling at a total price of             would not change the demand

good 81 is lower under bundling than under independent good pricing. The

reason is straightforward: when firm I is bundling, in order to make

profitable sales of its monopolized product, good A, it must also make

sales of good 51. This leads it to cut price in an effort to take sales

away from firm 2, an effect I call 'atrategic foreclosure". The effect on

the equilibrium can be seen in Figure 1, where the equilibrium effective

price for 51 and actual price for 82 both fall as a result of firm l's

bundling, thereby lowering firm 2's profits. Thus, by committing to tie by

producing only a bundle, firm I may make continued operation unprofitable

for its tied good rivalJ2 This point emerges particularly clearly in the

following simple example, which is a limiting case of the above model.

12Jean Tirole baa pointed out a nice analogy to situAtions in
which firm's can invest in cost reduction. Here, by bundling, firm I
can incur an investment cost' of (7cA) (the lost good A sales] but
 thereby lowers its effective marginal cost in market B by (7cA).
This lowering of marginal coat makes firm 2 more agrassive in market

with price competition (strategic complements) and entry deterrence/exit

 the potential entrant (firm 2) haa not.

     Note that, if both firms are active, firm l's profits are also lower in

the bundling regime than under independent pricing. This is true because

bundling not only loses some profitable sales of good A, but also causes firm

2 to lower its price.15 Thus, in this model, firm I would never commit to

tying unless this would succeed in driving firm 2 out of the market.16

     When tying would drive fins 2 out of the market, fins I may or may not

find it profitable to do so. The advantage of tying in such an instance is

the gain from converting market B from duopoly into a monopoly. The potential

loss, however1 comes from the fact that firm 1 will be a monopolist who can

only offer a bundle. Thus, the presence of a large number of consumers who

trembling-hand perfect equilibria (formally one examines discrete

 believes that firm 2 will be. If product A is very profitable, however, this
 effect is unlikely to occur. In fact, in situations in which market B can
 support only one firm under independent pricing, a commitment by firm 1 to
 bundling may also serve the strategic purpose of committing firm I to be
 active in market B.

 160ne special feature of this model, however, is that firm 2 can "concede" to
 firm I only by fully withdrawing from the market. In other models in which
 concession can be partial, this need not he true. For example, if market
 competition is of the form described in Kreps and Scheinlusan (1983] (product
 production followed by output constrained price competition) then market
 interaction will take a strategic substitutes form in which firm 2 will
 respond to firm l's more aggressive behavior by reducing its production leveL

strongly dislike product 31 may make a commitment to bundling unprofitable

even when it leads to exclusion. It is worth stressing one point, however: if

product 32 were supplied by a competitive industry under constant

returns-to-scsle. so that the price of product 32 could not be affected, firm

I would never have sn incentive to commit to bundling here (as the proof of

Proposition I indicates).

     At the same time, the welfare consequences of allowing tying in this

circumstance are unclear both for consumers and for aggregate efficiency.

First, consumers can lose both because of the price effects stemming from the

exclusion, and also because there is teas variety available in market 3. The

price effect, however, can potentially go either way. The reason is that the

same incentive to lower the effective price of good 31 that drives firm 2 from

the market is also present when firm I becomes a monopolist in market 3. In

general. though, one should expect that if the gains from monopoly in market B

are large the standard price movement should be upward, making consumers

uniformly worse off. The effect on aggregate efficiency is still less

certein. This is due to two different common welfare ambiguities. First, the

biases associated with the free entry process (e.g.. Spence (l976, Salop

 [1979], Mankiw and Whinston [1986]) imply that exclusion of firms does not

necessarily reduce aggregate welfare. Second, it is known from the

monopolistic bundling literature (e.g., Adams and Yellem (1976]) that bundling

 in a monopoly setting has ambiguous welfare consequences.

      The following example illustrstes these points more concretely, and also

 helps to set up the discussion in Section 3.



      Exsaole j: Suppose that a consumer of type d has a valuation for good Bi

 of v3 w -    i'   and that d is uniformly distributed on (0,11. Assuming that

given by,

2's profits fall as the surplus associated with good A, (y                            - CA).   rises.

In order to illustrate the other points made above I consider three

special cases of this model in turn: alO ala2. and

         Consider first the case where al_O. In this case, firm 1 always

increases its profits by excluding firm 2 (that is, monopoly profits with

bundling are greater than duopoly profits with independent good pricing).

This is because as a monopolist firm 1 suffers no loss from bundling.

Furthermore, ths monopoly bundle price of (w + i) necessarily represents

 en increase in the effective price of good 81, and in fact, leaves all

 consumers     with zero surplus. While all consumers are made worse off,
 aggregate welfare may rise or fall: if                   c3c31 aggregate           welfare must rise

3. Heterozeneous Consumer Preferences .L2s flQ4 A

     The results of Section 2 provide two important lessons. First tying

can be profitably used as an exclusionary device. Second, there may be

important differences in the likelihood of its use depending on whether

a commitment to tying is possible. Indeed, in the model of that section:

(i) tying is only used when commitment is possible, (ii) a commitment to

tying always lowers the profitability of tied market rivals, and (iii)

tying is only used when it leads to exclusion.

     An important feature of that model, however, was the strong

assumption that all consumers have the same valuation of the tying good.

In this section, I investigate the effects of relaxing that assumption.

two important points emerge. First, a commitment to tying need not always

result in foreclosure as it did in the model of Section 2. Second, when

consumer valuations for the tying good differ, tying can be a profitable

atrstegy for firm 1 even in the absence of an ability to commit, and when it

is, it may lower firm Vs profitability in a similar manner to that observed

earlier. In the following two subsections I consider first the case of

commitment and then that of no commitment.


A. Commitmant

     Recall that in the model of Section 2, if firm 1 moved from its optimal

independent prices of r'                      to offering only a bundle at a
                              Psc'mai(Psz)L
price of P — 1 +            then firm 2's sales and profits would be

unaffected; that is, tying had no direct foreclosure effect. Rather, firm l's

commitment to offering only a bundle lowered firm 2's sales because it created

en incentive for firm 1 to price more aggressively (strategic foreclosure).

When consumers have heterogeneous preferences, however, both direct and

strategic effects are generally present and a commitment to bundling by firm 1


                                  21
need not lower firm 2's profits: The net impact can be determined by asking

whether, at the bundle price F' such that firm l's sales equal its independent

                                                                         firm 1. has
pricing level [i.e., F' such that x2(P''i,P82) —    x2(F1(F2).P32)i.
an incentive to lower its price further.18 This will be true when




           —        d Bundle Sales          1 *
                                       +   x                    <   0.

                          dP



With homogeneous preferences for good A, for example, the inequality in

                                                                and
condition (3) was satisfied because (FtcAcB) >       l('B2)41
(d Bundle Sales! dP)— Xt(P;l(FB2).PBI).

      Condition (3) indicates that, with heterogeneous valuations for good A, a

commitment to only offering a bundle may fail to lower firm 2's profits for

 two distinct reasons. First, enough consumers may find good A unattractive

 (may have valuations below the coat of production) that firm 1 may have a

 lower, rather than a higher, margin at a bundle price of P'. In such a case,

 firm l's monopoly of good A is too weak for bundling to be an effective

 exclusionary threat in market B; bundling would help rather than hurt      firm 2.


 This effect, of course, is exactly what one should expect g priori.

      The second reason is a bit more subtle. As I noted above, with

 homogeneous valuations the derivative of demand at bundle price P'

 is identical to that arising in market B with independent goods pricing. With

 heterogeneous valuations however, this demand derivative can change when firm

 1 bundles, potentially counteracting the price-cost margin effect. The

 18Hers, unlike in Section 2, firm 1 may prefer to commit to producing the
 bundle plus one of the two goods independently as part of an exclusionary
 strategy (i.e., Lacunas 1 end 2 do not hold here).   I focus on the case of a
 commitment to pure bundling here to provide a comparison with the result in
 Section 2. These other strategies may also lower firm 2's equilibrium
 profits. If they do so sufficiently to exclude firm 2 from the market, then
 they will actually be preferred by firm 1 to pure bundling, since they
 restrict its pricing to a lesser degree when firm 2 is out of the market.


                                  22
clearest example of this occurs in the limiting case where products 31 and 82

are nearly homogeneousJ9 Then bundling essentially transforms the competitive

interaction from a nearly homogeneous market B into a setting with vertical

differentiation (since all consumers value the bundle more than 82, but they

differ in how large this valuation difference ia-- see, for example, Shaked

and Sutton [1982]) and can thereby raise firm 2's profits.

    The following example, which is an extension of Example 2,

illustrates these points.



Examols : The model I consider here is identical to that in Example 2

except that I now allow there to be different possible levels of

consumer valuations for product A. I assume that the distribution of y in

the population is described by F(y) and that for all d, Prob(ysId) —              F(s)
(i.e., types are independently distributed across the two markets). In

the discussion that follows, I assume that w is large enough so that (in

the relevant range) all consumers purchase product B from one of the

fins.

     Suppose that firm I commits to tying hy only producing a

bundle. To see how the distribution of tastes for good A can effect the

exclusionary effect of tying, it is useful to first assume that for any

level of 'y some consumers of that type are buying from each of the firms

("interior" equilibria). It is straightforward to show that, for interior

equilibrie, equilibrium profits for the two firms are given by,

where E —   f   s dF(s). Comparing firm 2's profits to its level under

independent goods pricing (derived in Section 2), we see that firm Vs

profits are lower in the bundling equilibrium as long ss E > cA.               Thus,

as one would expect, if there are enough consumers who dislike product A,

tying raises rather thsn lowers firm 2's profits.

     Relating this finding to condition (3), we see that bundling has no

effect on the demand derivative, but that P is now given by P'— lB2 +

so that the inequality in (3) holds if and only if E7).CA. It is worth noting,

however, that the lack of any effect on the demand derivative term in (3) now

relies heavily on the linearity of the demand structure assumed here. With

this structure, the aversge of the demand derivatives across consumers with

various levels of y at the bundled sales levels is identical to the average of

the demand derivatives at the sales levels that occur with independent

pricing. If, instead, bundling were to lower this average derivative (in

absolute value) this would work against the incentive for more aggressive

pricing that arises in this linear model.

     In fact, this is why interiority of the equilibrium is important for the

chsracterization above. Figure 2 depicts an example with two types of

valuations for good A, I17}J in which bundling causes all type 1H's to buy

from firm I (at the bundle price that keeps firm 2's sales unchanged). As is

cleat, this causes the derivative of firm l's demsnd function to fall, which

tends to make firm I less aggressive. Note that this effect intuitively seems

more likely to occur when the dispersion of valuations for good A increases,

and the differentiation between products 51 and 52 decreases.

        In order to investigate this effect further, consider the special case

where      is uniformly distributed on the interval (i-fl,i+8] where fisy

                                   In        this example, the issue addressed above, that

some consumers may value good A at less than its production cost, does not

arise (here E-PcA) .    Rather, the focus here is on the effects of the level of
valuation dispersion for good A and the level of product differentiation in

market B. Tedious calculations (an example of which is provided in Appendix

B) reveal that the effect of a commitment by firm 1 to offering only a bundle

on firm 2's profits can he summarized in the following way:

Examination of the condition in the lower left hand box (the only case where

firm 2's profits are not necessarily lowered by firm l's bundling) confirms

that high levels of dispersion of valuations for good A end low levels of

differentiation in market B are necessary for firm 2's profits to rise when

firm 1 bundles.    Interestingly,             though, even when n     is close   to zero, we need

   not to be too large for this to occur (so that the incentive to make sales




 20My investigation of this example is motivated in part by the example analyzed
 in independent work by Carbajo, DeMeza, and Seidmann (1987]. They illustrate
 the differentiation effect in an example with homogeneous goods in market B
 and valuations for goods A and B that are perfectly correlated and uniformly
 distributed across consumers. Earlier versions of this paper pointed out the
 implications of noninteriority for the derivative of demand in the context of
 a two-type (of 7) example.

of A does not outweigh the differentiation effect).21 Note also that firm l's

profits may now rise with bundling even if bundling does not drive firm 2 from

the market. In fact, in this example, whenever bundling causes firm 2's

profits to rise, firm l's profits rise as well and, further, firm l's rise in
                                                                      22

B.    Qitment
     The presence of heterogeneous valuations of product A can also cause

tying to be firm l's optimal strategy even in the absence of an ability to

commit to this strategy   To see this more clearly, conaider first the no

commitment game analyzed in Section 2. In that game, when both firma are

active in msrket B, firm 1 selects its prices taking firm 2's price as given

and acting ae a monopolist on the residual demand structure. Given the

literature on bundling by multiproduct monopolists, which has found bundling

to be a profitable strategy quite generally, it should not be surprising that

firm I may now find some form of bundling to be its beat-response to firm 2's




      reader may be puzzled by this point since it seems that when m—O firm 2's
profits would always rise with bundling. In fact, when m—O the upper left
box would have              and firm 1 making all sales when it bundles.


     is worth contrasting this result to that in Schmalensee [l982 .  There he
shows that if market B has a constant returns to scale competitive structure
(and homogeneoua goods), then pure bundling must lower firm 1 profits. Here
firm l's profits may rise even though firm 2's price falls as a result of this
bundling. The reason is thet in Schmalensee's model when firm 1 bundles it
necesaarily sacrifices sales in market A where sales margins are positive
while any changes in sales in market B are worthless since margins sre zero
there (due to competition). here, however, the sales gained in market B are
valuable because price-coat margins are poaitive (as in the multiproduct
monopoly bundling literature).

price choice.23 What is interesting from our perspective, however, is that

this tying strategy by firm I may have detrimental effects on firm 2's profits

since, when firm 1 does decide to bundle, it may have an incentive to

foreclose sales in market B in a manner similar to that discussed in Section

2,


     In Whinston [1987], for example, I considered the structure described in

Example 3 where there are two types of valuations for good A,        and    with

      and Prob(-iH)A. For this case I showed that any equilibrium of the no

precommitment game is equivalent to an equilibrium of a game where firm 1 is

allowed to either sell A and Dl independently or to offer only the bundle
                                  24
and product A at price PE(',7].          In addition, the equilibrium may involve

firm I pursuing the latter (bundling) strategy, though a necessary condition

for this is that        (see Whinston (1987] for details). When the

equilibrium does involve bundling and is interior" in the senee discussed

above, firm 2's profits are easily seen to be:25



                                                -               -
          11— (l/9(m1+a2))            (a1-m2)       (c52-c51)


Thus, when firm I does tie here it forecloses firm 2's sales in a similar


23The models of bundling by a multiproduct monopolist most relevant for the
model here are Adams and Yellen (1976] and McAfee, McMillan• and Whinston
[1987].

24That is. we can without loss of generality restrict firm l's pricing
strategy choices to one of these two forms. This equivalence actually holds
for any market S structure that satisfies the sssumptions made in Section 2 (a
proof of this fact is available from the author upon request). It is worth
noting that a bundling strategy of this sort, may not appear to be tying at all
since firm 1 does offer to sell product A at a price that some consumers are
willing to pay. For type L consumers, however, this offer is unattractive,
putting them in exactly the same situation as when firm 1 offers only a
bundle.

251n fact this follows for      given    level of
from requiring that tha prices of B2 and the bundle are best responses


                                 27
manner to that observed earlier. Note, though, that firm 2's equilibrium

profits are larger here than when firm I commits to only offering a bundle.

The reason is that when firm I also offers product A independently it is

assured of making sales of product A to all type H consumers regardless of

whethet they buy product El: thus, here the incentive for foreclosure arises

only from the L types and firm 2's profits fall only if      > c. When this

condition holds, however, even without the ability to precommit, firm I may

                                                                   exclude firm 2
find tying to be a profitable strategy, and by employing it may

from the market.

     Though the effect of firm l's tying here may be exclusionary (firm        2,


 anticipating that firm I will tie, may choose to be inactive), one might argue

 that its motives are in some sense "innocent' since its   decision to tie is

 never affected by the possibility that firm 2 might be excluded from the

 market. Such dynamic considerations, however. may be important even when firm

 1 cannot precommit to tying. For example, if firm 2 faces a financial

 constraint that it must meet in order to remain active in the market (as in

                                                               firm 1 may be led
 the work of Benoit (1984] and Fudenbsrg and Tirole (1986]),

 to use tying in order to lower firm 2's profits and increase the likelihood

  that firm 2 will be forced to exit the market, even when tying is not

 profit-maximizing in a static sense.

      To formalize this idea, consider a simple extension of the earlier

  no commitment model in which there are two production periods.    If firm

  2 decides to be active and incurs the set up cost K2 prior to period    1,


  it may face a financial constraint that it must meet after period I in

  order to be able to remain in the market in period 2. In particular,

  suppose that with probability 1-8 firm 2 will not face a financial

  constraint, while with probability 8f(fl) firm 2 will face a constraint that

  prohibits continued participation if first period profits were less than TI and

  assume that f'(U)O (there is a diminishing marginal return to predation).

                                   28
      In this setting, what is the effect of an increase in 9 on the

sttractiveness of tying for finn 1? It is not difficult to see that for the

two type example, if         (and outcomes are "interior") then increases in 9

make tying a relatively more attractive policy for firm I in period I for any

given level of P. The central (and very general) idea is that increases in

9 make firm I care more about foreclosure relative to current profits.

      To see this more formally, let C denote the benefit to firm I if firm 2

does not meet its financial constraint and fix some initial level of 9 and

       Suppose, first, that firm I pursues its best independent pricing policy

and that this results in a profit level for firm 2 of IT. Then, firm l's

price choices are equal to the level that it would choose in the simple one

period model if its marginal costs of production for BI. were

bundling strategy and thereby gives firm 2 profits of       then its prices are

equal to those it would pick in the static game if its marginal cost xas

c31.9Cf(fl)(P82.c82). Then since we have seen that the optimal bundling

strategy in the one period no precommitment game results in lower profits for

firm 2 than does the optimal independent pricing policy for any given level of

the marginal cost of El (since 1L>cA) it must be that           (that is,

bundling leads to foreclosure). But the envelope theorem then implies that a

 small increase in 9 raises the profits from the optimal bundling best response

by mote than it raises the profits from the optimal independent pricing     best

 response (since the derivative of firm I profits with respect to   9 is


 CF(112) ).   Thus, in this example, increases in 9 strictly increase the
 likelihood that firm 1 will find bundling to be its best response (aince

 26Note that in many environments some form of bundling is always firm l's best
 response in the one period no precommitment game (see McAfee, McMillan, and
 Whinston (1987]). In such cases, one would have to examine how increases in 9
 affected the degree of bundling.


                                    29
4. Complementary Products

     I now turn to the case of complementary products used in fixed

proportions.27 1 first consider a zodel of fixed proportions chat is

essentially an extension of the simple example quoted above from Posner (1976J

to the case where the tied good market involves differentiated products with

scale economies in production and an oligopolistic, rather than a competitive,

market structure. Despite chess differences, I show that Posner'a central

contention continues to hold: a monopolist of one component never finds it

worthwhile to tie in order to reduce the level of competition in the market

for the other component. The key point is that with complementary products

used in fixed proportions, the monopolist can actually derive greant profits

when its rival is in the market than when it is not because it can benefit

through sales of its monopolized product from the additional surplus that its

rival's presence generates (due to product differentiation).

     Nevertheless, I then show that in two natural extensions of this model

in which the monopolized product is no longer essential for all uses of other

components, tying once again emerges as a profitable exclusionary strategy.

In one case, the presence of an inferior, competitively supplied alternative

 to the "monopolized" component leads to results that parallel those of the

 independent products case. In the other case, the existence of a second use

 for the non-aonopolized product (such as a replacement part market) can give

 the monopolist en incentive to tie in order to eliminate competition in this

 other market.

      The discussion in the text focuses on the case of precommitment. In

 fact, for each of the models considered here, any no precommitment outcome is

 proportions where there is a required base product and an optional add-on
 component.


                                 30
equivalent to an equilibrium of the independent pricing game.28 Of course,

this is therefore also true when firm I produces A and 31 independently in the

commitment game. tn order to simplify the exposition, in Subsections 43

and 4C below I will use this fact and simply compare bundling outcomes to the

independent pricing game equilibria when investigating whether firm I would

find a commitment to bundling to be a profitable exclusionary device.




A. Th   Eais
     Consider the following simple model. There are two components needed to
comprise a system, A and B: a system consists of one unit of each. As before,

firm I is a monopolist of component A, and two different versions of

component S could potentially be available, 31 and 32. The production

technology for these products is as before.

     The set of consumers is also the same as before. Each consumer

demands at most one unit of the system. A consumer of type d's valuation

of a system with product Si is vA,Bi(d). When goods A, 51, and 82 are

independently priced, consumers' demand for an A/Si system is given by some

function xi(PAtPB1,PA+Psz), where x(',) 0 if i.j and is        0 if i—j with

strict inequalities whenever xi(,,.) G (0,1) and where (4(..)+x(.,'flS0

     In the case of independent products we implicitly assumed that production

of a bundled unit did not interfere with the independent use of either of

the products.29 Though natural in the case of independent products, this

assumption is less so when products must be used together. For example, the


28The proofs of this fact for the three models presented in this section are
available from the author upon request. For the model of subsection 4C, the
result requires the use of Selten's [1975] notion of trembling-hand perfection
in order to eliminate the use of weakly dominated strategies. It should also
be noted that in Sections 48 and 4C this equivalence does not have to do with
product complementarity, but rather is a consequence of the homogeneity of
valuations assumed there (as in Section 2).

29The proof of Lemma 1, for example, used this fact.


                                 31
bundling of a stereo tuner and a stereo amplifier into a stereo receiver may

not allow the buyer to use just the amplifier in conjunction with another

manufacturer's tuner. Thus, hers I assume that production of s bundled good

dccc not allow the user to use only part of the bundle.

     In thia model, since component A is essential to any system, firm 1 is

trivially able to exclude firm 2 by committing to produce only a bundle.

Nevertheless, as the following proposition indicates, firm I never finds it

worthwhile to tie in order Co exclude firm 2.



     àosition : If a commitment to tying causes firm 2 to be inactive,

firm 1 can do no worse- and possibly better- by committing to producing

only independent components.



             Suppose that firm l's precommitment to tying (by not producing

one or both of the components individually) causes firm 2 to be inactive. In

this'case, since only firm l's bundle price is relevant once firm 2 is

inactive, firm l's profits given its optimal bundle price of i'   are:

                (P cAcBl) x (P   ,c).

Suppose that firm I instead commits to only producing components A and BI.

 independently. Oxte pricing policy that it can always follow, regardless of

whether firs 2 is active, is to set individual component prices of

           (where c>O) and PA..r-PBl If firm 2 is inactive, this pricing

 scheme leads to exactly the same level of profits as did the bundling outcome.
/
    firm 2 is active,, however, firm l's profits will be at least as large as

 those in the bundling outcome since they are given by




    (p*cA.cBl) [xl(P* AB2 + s2(P        ;As2) + ' x2(PPA+P82)


                                  32
when firm 2 names price     (since x1+x2 weakly increases when prices fall and

   is non-negative).

                                                               C



     Thus, as in the arguments of the leverage critics, when firm l's good is
essential and components are used in fixed proportions, firm 1 does not find

it profitable to use tying to reduce competition in market B. The basic idea

behind this result is fairly simple to see. If firm 2 did not exist, firm I

could do as well as it does through bundling by setting independent prices

that had component RI priced at or below cost and component A's price set at a

high level; it would simply earn all of its profits on ssles of component A

(consumers purchases depend only on the sum of the prices) -       But, if pricing

in this manner leads firm 2 to be active, this can only raise firm l's profits

since firm 1 would then sell mote component A's (on which it mskes profits)

and fewer component B's (on which it has a negative margin). Intuitively,

firm 1 is able to benefit through sales of its product A from ths increase in

surplus generated by firm 2's presence.

     While firm I never gains from committing to tying here if this forces

firm 2 to be inactive, firm 1 may commit to tying in order to price

discriminate. For example, suppose that soms set of consumers get positive

benefits only out of an A/BI system, while the remainder get positive

benefits only out of an A/B2 system, and that the latter group's valuation of

its desired system is much higher. Then firm 1 will want to set a very high

price for good A in order to extract surplus from this latter group, and s

very low price for good Bl in order to get an optimal A/Bl system price       for

 the former group. If this attempt hits the non-negativity constaint on

 however, then firm I will find it worthwhile to tis by offering a bundle with

      Firm l's Lack of desire to use tying as an      exclusionary        device can change

dramatically, however, when fins l's Donopolized component is not essential

for all uses of product E2. I now consider cwo natural extensions of the

above mddel in which tying can prove to be not only an effective exclusionary

device, but also a profitable one.

supplied alternative to firm l's product A, denoted as product A2 (henceforth,

firm l's product A will be denoted by Al). The cost of component A2 is also

tAP but compared with the valuations described above for Al/Bl and Al/52

systems, a consumer's valuation for a system that has product A2 in it rather

than Al is (y    - cA)   lower [i.e., vA2IBi(d) —   vAl,,Di(d)

      Consider, first, the independent pricing game (which, as I noted above,

yields an outcome identical to that which occurs if firm 1 produces A and 81

 only independently). In this game, firm I always sets PAlSY and makes all

 component A sales. When firm 1 sets PAId in this equilibrium, the inferior

 alternative (product AZ) is irrelevant for pricing and profits. In the case

 where A1' however, the presence of the inferior product AZ constrains firm


 30This point is analogous to the observation that an upstream monopolist may
 wish to vertically integrate forward into one of the industries that uses its
 product in order to achieve price discrimination across users (see, for
 exampls, Tirole (1958, p. 141]). Note that precommitment is essential for
 this purpose since otherwise the second set of consumers would buy the bundle
 to get their component A when the bundle price is lower than the price of good
 A alone (resulting in an outcome that is identical to that which would occur
 with independent prices of P for component A end zero for component 51).

 311n fact, offering a bundle plus good A individually is always an optimal
 policy for firm 1. However, when the optimal bundle price exceeds the price
 for good A alone, the same outcome is achievable by offering goods A and 81
 independently.

l's equilibrium pricing and profits. This could mean that, contrary to

Proposition 3, firm 1 would prefer to have firm 2 out of the market (firm 1

can no longer necessarily benefit through its component Al sales from the

surplus created by the presence of firm 2).32 Example 4 illustrates this point

and shows how the presence of component A2 can make competitive interaction

       Now consider the commitment game. When firm 1 would prefer firm 2 to be

out of the market, but under independent pricing firm 2 would want to be

active, can a commitment to tying by firm I force firm 2 out of the narket

(note that firm l's component Al is not essential). The answer is "yes", and

for the same basic reason as in Section 2; when it is only able to sell a

bundle, firm 1 can only gain its profits from component Al if it also sells

component B1; this causes fins I to foreclose sales in the component B market.

To see this formally, suppose thst firm 1 can only produce a bundle. When the

presence of product A2 constrains firm l's pricing (so that             in an

independent pricing game, firm l's price for component 31 given firm 2's price

P32 is given by P;1(P82) such that,

The first ten of this expression represents the effect on sales of

component 31 of marginally changing P1, while the second is the effect on

 sales of component Al. Note that this second change is due solely to the

 aSa1 change     in system sates. In contrsst, when firm I commits to



 34Unlitce the independent products case, firm I suffers no loss from being
 restricted to bundle when it is a monopolist. Rather, here the cost of
 exclusion of firm 2 is that firm I is unable to capture any of the surplus
 created by firm 2 (through firm l's sales of component Al).

Note that x(..') does not appear in the second term of (5). This

represents the fact that when firm 1 bundles, only by increasing sales of

Al/SI systems does firm 1 increase the sales of component Al: firm 1 is

therefore led to foreclose sales in market B. Indeed, comparing (3) and

(5), it must be that (5) is strictly negative (since i>cA and x(-,-) >                  0)
and therefore, P(?52) <                        + -y.    As in the independent product case,

this lowering of firm l's effective price for component SI towers firm 2's

profits.35 Thus, by committing firm 1 to "strategic foreclosureTM, tying can

be an effective device for excluding firm 2 and thereby raising firm l's




 35This incentive for foreclosure is similar to the effects studied in Matutes
 and Regibeau [1986] - They study product compatibility in a symmetric duopoly
 and identify a collusive incentive to have compatibility. This corresponds to
 the "puppy dog" strategy in the Fudenberg and Tirole [1984] taxonomy for the
 case of accomodation under price competition, in contrast to the "top dog"
 strategy that I focus on here (see footnote 12)

bundles and forces firm 2 to be inactive, all consumers receive zero surplus

here (although, as usual, aggregate welfare may either fall or rise).

C.   An Alternative Qfl          for   Product : Direct Foreclosure

      bZext, consider an alternative variation in the basic model. Suppose that

there exists an alternative use for component B that does not rely on the

simultaneous purchase of component A. One example of such a use is a

replacement parts market for existing owners of a system who need to replace

only component B. Because component A is not essential for the use of product

B in that market, firm lis not able to benefit from firm 2's presence in this

36The discussion in the text has only compared producing A and BI independently
with committing to produce only a bundle. One might wonder about other
alternatives. It turns out that as long as the sort of price discrimination
motivation discussed in the previous subsection is not present, any of the
other alternatives are either equivalent to independent pricing (Bundle and
Al; Bundle, Al, snd BI). equivalent to producing only a bundle (Bundle and
El), or clearly inferior to these options (Al only; Bi only).

37A longstanding issue in the legal treatment of tying is when to trest
the tying and tied products as distinct products. One argument
sometimes made is that the tied product must be one which consumers
might want to purchase separately, without also purchasing the tying
product (see, for example, Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Jefferson
parish ti2nttal District t1a. A y_ fly, 466 U.S. 2 (1984) where she
argues this position because "When the tied product has no use other
than in conjunction with the tying product, a seller of the tying
product can acquire no additional market power by selling the two
products together."). Note though, that in the model analyzed here, this
statement is incorrect unless one defines "other uses', contrary to
Justice O'Connor's meaning, to include use with other producers' component



                                             38
market through sales of good A and the logic of Proposition 3 therefore breaks

down.38 Firm I may now find it worthwhile to exclude firm 2, if it can, in

order to monopolize this other market for product B. Furthermore, because

component A is still essential for certain uses of product B, firm 1 may have

the means to accomplish this end: by offering to sell component A only in a

bundle with component El. firm 1 directly forecloses firm 2's sales in the

joint use market (foreclosure of these sales is complete regardless of firm

l's bundle price), which may drive firm 2's profits below the level that

justifies its continued operation. The following simple example illustrates

these points.


Example : Suppose that there are two types of consumers. Type I consumers

desire a system. There are a continuum of type I consumers indexed by the

uniformly distributed variable d      tO,l) with total measure I. Consumer d has

valuations for the two possible systems of:


                     vA/Bl(d) w'd
                     vA/82(d) w•d +
                                         '1'
 Type II consumers, of which there are a total measure of 9. only desire

 product B. Each type IT consumer has valuations for products 81 and 82 of:




                          D + '2.

 The firms are unable to diecriminate across these consumers in their

 pricing. The cost structure has cA).O. c51c82c8>O, 1(2>0. and


 381n the replacement parts market example, component A is, in a sense,
 essential for the use of these replacement parts as well. One may therefore
 wonder why firm 1 cannot benefit from firm 2's presence through the initial
 price of component A. While this is true for future purchasers of systems, it
 is not true for those consumers already owning a system (which may have been
 purchased before firm 2 even existed).


                                    39
Finally, in what follows, I make two further assumptions: (A.l) (1+6)72>71>72

and (A.2) w>max{47271+c.s-c3. 7l+cA+CB).

      Consider, first, the outcome of the independent pricing game. Under our

assumptions, the unique equilibrium outcome when both firms    are   active
                      3940
involves prices of:



                                C3

                       p82'     ft +
                            —




In   this equilibrium, all consumers buying a component B buy product 82 and

profits for the two firms are given by:

                        o                    2
                       nl iw+(-rl--rz)-cA-cBl /4w

                        o              w+(7l7,)cAcB   -
                       2 2" +                 2w          K2

      Suppose, instead, that firm 1 commits to producing only a bundle and

product 81 alone. In this case the unique equilibrium prices when firm 2 is

active are given by:



                       PSI— CS

                       P52      C+

and profits are:


                        11_ (w-cçc3)2/4w


    am ignoring equilibria here that involve firm I pricing its component
31 below cost and making no sales. As earlier, these equilibria involve the
use of a weakly dominated strategy by firm I and can be eliminated through the
use of. Selten's (19751 notion of trembling-hand perfection.

40Assumption (A.2) ensures that the optimal price for 32 is not less than

Thus, by committing to tie, firm 1 denies firm 2 its profitable sales to type
I consumers, lowering firm 2's profits, and possibly forcing firm 2 to   be
inactive. Furthermore if tying does force firm 2 to be inactive, firm l's

profit is [(wcAc3)2/4w1 i- 8(-c). which is larger than its independent

pricing profits if - the gain from monopolizing the type II market- is

large.41 Finally, if firm I does exclude firm 2 in this manner, all consumers

are made worse off here, although aggregate welfare may either fall or rise.

5. Conclusthn

     The above results demonstrate, in my view, that the leverage

hypothesis can be formally modelled in a coherent and appeeling way. Once

one allows for scale economies and strategic interaction, tying-- by

leading to the foreclosure of tied good sales- -   can make continued operation

by a monopolist's tied market rival unprofitable. As the models above have

 indicated, such a strategy can be a profitable one for a monopolist, often


41The reader may be wondering about other alternatives available to firm 1, A
commitment to producing A only, 51 only, or just a bundle is worse as an
exclusionary strategy for firm I than committing to produce the bundle and 31
since firm 2's profits are higher when it is active under these strategiesthan
when firm 1 coits to produce the bundle and 81, and firm l's profits are
lower under these options if firm 2 is inactive. They also are less
attractive as an accomodation strategy for firm 1 than independent production
of A and El. Producing A, 81, and a bundle yields an outcome equivslent to
the independent production outcome (restricting attention to trembling-hand
perfect equilibria). Finally, producing a bi,indle and A is less effective as
an exclusionary strategy than producing a bundle and 51 (it gives firm 2
higher profits if it is active and firm 1 lower profits when firm 2 is not
active): Also, when firm 2 is active, no pure strategy (trembling-hand
perfect) equilibrium can give firm 1 higher profits than when it produces A
and 31 independently. However, e pure strategy equilibrium may not exist
hare. A sufficient condition for a pure strategy equilibrium to exist is that
   < (-c5). • Thus, when this condition holds, firm I can effectively limit
 itself to the two options considered in the text.

                                 41
precisely because of this exclusionary effect on market structure.

     While   the   analysis vindicates the Leverage hypothesis on a positive

level, its normative implications are lees clear. Even in the simple models

considered here, which ignore a number of other possible motivations for the

practice, the impact of this exclusion on welfare is uncertain42 This fact,

combined with the difficulty of sorting out the leverage-based instances of

tying from other cases, makes the specification of a practical legal stsndard

extremely difficult.

     Finslly, it should be noted that the leverage issue is not limited to

the practice of tying1 but rather is widespread in antitrust analysis. With

the practice of reciprocity, for example, a zeonopsonistic buyer of some

product refuses to buy from its suppliers unless they also buy a product from

him (in which he may face competition). Alternatively, when a vertically

integrated monopolistic input supplier can sell its input to both its own

downstream manufacturer and to a rival manufacturer, a refusal to supply this

rival manufacturer is similar to the tying of complementary goods. The models

analyzed above can frequently be reinterpreted to apply to these other

settings as well.3




421t should be noted that this is not a problem limited to tying, but is
pervasive in the area of anticompetitive exclusion (see, for example, Ordover
and Saloner (1987] and Schmalensee [1982b]). If one puts relatively more
weight on consumer welfare, however, these ambiguities become somewhat less
severe as exclusion typically does hurt consumers.

 43The extent to which commitment is possible, however, may well vary by
 practice. In addition, in some instances additional contracting possibilities
 may be available. For instance, in the example of vertical integration
 described above, the monopolist may be able to use more elaborate contracts
 with the downstream rival than contracts that just specify a linear wholesale
 price (which would yield results similar to those above).

Here I work out the example for the cases where $?n. In this class of

cases, the division of consumers between the two firms           can be     represented

diagrammatically as follows:

                                                                              (P3+a)

Consider first equilibria that are in Region (i), i.e., that satisfy

p (7-$)+(P52+o). In this region, the first-order coditions for the two
              I
firms are:




     fl j:           lea$ -   (l/2)[P   -(i-fl)-
                                                      -   P   [1' -@r-$)-
                                                                                       —




     can easily be shown that these are sufficient for a global maximum; at
 any point where the first-order condition holds, the firms' profit
 functions are concave.



                                               A-2
    fin 1:            [P                 -a)]   - 22   —



From firm 2's first-order condition we see that we are in Region (i) if

and only if P2- Solving the two first-order conditions for P32 yields

the following expression:



       8(P32)2 + 2[a-(-$)J P52 + 4o$              — 0.


This expression is strictly concave and is non-negative at P32—0. Hence,

        if and only if the value of this expression is non-positive at

         Substituting yields the requirement that i3($-a). Firm 2's

profits in this region under bundling are (l/2a$)(P32)3 compared with

its profits of (a/2) under independent goods pricing. Since P32a in this

region. firm 2's profits must fall.

       Consider now bundling equilibria that fall in region (ii), i.e.!

where P E                         +a),             -a)]. Straightforward analysis of the

firms' first-order conditions reveals that in equilibrium we must have

IF82 — 3$   -
                -y.        In   addition, to be in region (ii), P52 must satisfy

2$-a    P82 a a, or substituting for PB2: 3($-a) a -y a 3(a-$). The first

of these inequalities is just the reverse of our region (i) condition,

while the second, which assures that we are not in region (iii) is always

satisfied since $aa (in fact, the bundling equilibrium can never be in

region (iii)). Fir's 2's profits under bundling in this region are given

by (l/2$)(P32)2 compared with (a/2) under independent goods pricing.

 Substituting for 52 yields the condition in ths text. Firm l's profits

under bundling in this region are given by:




                                                 A-3
          —?   (   I - (l/2$)   [P

            P$-'-1   Ii +
            l 3J12 6$

while   under the parameter values of this region its independent goods

pricing profits are given by (o/2) +                 (1/2$). Bundling then yields
                                             [1?]2
firm I larger profits than independent pricing (assuming that firm 2

remains active) if and only if:




But, the expression on the left side of this inequality is strictly larger

than {?7)2, which implies that whenever firm 2's profits are higher

under bundling so are firm l's. There is also clearly an area of the

parameter space where firm 1 is better off while firm 2 is worse off under

bundling compared to independent goods pricing.

        The analysis of cases where m > fi   proceeds in a similar manner.
