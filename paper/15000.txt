                                            ABSTRACT

We document the impact of the AIDS crisis on non-AIDS related health services in fourteen sub-Saharan
African countries. Using multiple waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for each country,
we examine antenatal care, birth deliveries, and rates of immunization for children born between 1988
and 2005. We find deterioration in nearly all of these dimensions of health care over this period. The
most recent DHS survey for each country collected data on HIV prevalence, which allows us to examine
the association between HIV burden and health care. We find that erosion of health services is highly
correlated with increases in AIDS prevalence. Regions of countries that have light AIDS burdens have
witnessed small or no declines in health care, using the measures noted above, while those regions
currently shouldering the heaviest burdens have seen the largest erosion in treatment for pregnant women
and children. Using semi-parametric techniques, we can date the beginning of the divergence in health
services between high and low HIV regions to the mid-1990s.

1. Introduction

In the past twenty years, the AIDS crisis has had crippling effects on the health care systems of

many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. On the supply side, the pandemic may have compromised

the ability of health systems to deliver care, as health professionals fell ill, or chose to leave for

less-risky work elsewhere. The increase in morbidity that accompanies HIV may also have

changed the nature of care offered by clinics and hospitals, reinforced by health budgets that

shifted resources toward AIDS and the vertical delivery of care for those infected with HIV

(Lancet 1995, Jones et al. 2003, Colvin 2005, Easterly 2008). A recent World Bank evaluation

(2009) also reports changes in its funding for health, nutrition and population programs (HNP)

over the decade from 1997 to 2007, noting that “while the overall levels of lending in HNP have

not changed much over the past decade, the composition of the portfolio has shifted rather

dramatically toward communicable disease projects, particularly AIDS…” (page 23).

        AIDS may also have affected the demand for health services, by placing a large tax on

households’ budgets. Prime-aged adults who fall ill may need to leave the labor force. Other

family members may also find it necessary to change their work patterns, in order to care for the

sick. These costs, together with the financial costs of covering illnesses associated with AIDS,

can lead to ‘medical poverty traps’ (McIntyre et al. 2006).

        These strains on health systems and households have taken their toll. In this paper, we

document the impact of the AIDS crisis on non-AIDS related health services in fourteen sub-

Saharan African countries. Using multiple waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for

each country, we examine antenatal care, birth deliveries, and rates of immunization for children

born between 1988 and 2005. We find deterioration in the delivery of nearly all of these

dimensions of health care over this period. The most recent DHS survey for each country

                                                   1
collected data on HIV prevalence, which allows us to examine the association between HIV

burden and health care. We find that erosion of health services is highly correlated with increases

in AIDS prevalence. Regions of countries that have light AIDS burdens have witnessed small or

no declines in health care, using the measures noted above, while those regions currently

shouldering the heaviest burdens have seen the largest erosion in treatment for pregnant women

and children. Using semi-parametric techniques, we can date the beginning of the divergence in

health services between high and low HIV regions to the mid-1990s.

       We begin in Section 2 by introducing the DHS data we use to examine the impact of HIV

on health care delivery. We discuss our estimation strategy in Section 3. We present evidence on

the associations between HIV and health services in Section 4, and explore explanations for our

findings in Section 5. Section 6 discusses ways in which future health service delivery may be

affected by the arrival of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and notes that the design of AIDS care

should take into account the fact that persons living in regions most affected by AIDS may not

have been receiving adequate medical care for the past 20 years.



2. Demographic and Health Survey Data

Demographic and Health Surveys are large, nationally representative household-based surveys

conducted at approximately four to five year intervals in low and middle income countries. Their

focus is primarily on population, health and nutrition. Women in the household aged 15 to 49 are

asked about their fertility histories, including information on prenatal care, delivery assistance

and children’s immunizations. In some survey waves, information on antenatal care is available

for a woman’s most recent birth, and in others it is collected for all births that occurred within a

particular time window (within the past three years for some surveys, within the past five years
for others). Appendix Table 1 provides a guide to survey years. Information on these surveys is

also available on line at http://www.measuredhs.com/aboutdhs/.

        We analyze data from 41 DHS surveys conducted between 1988 and 2006 in fourteen

countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We have data from eight West African countries where HIV

prevalence rates are relatively low – Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea,

Mali, Niger and Senegal – and six countries in East and Southern Africa where rates are higher –

Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 1 (The exception to this geographic

generalization is Ethiopia, where prevalence rates are much like those observed for Burkina Faso

and Ghana.) We selected these countries because they have conducted multiple DHS surveys

since 1988, and because their latest round of DHS data collection included HIV testing. We do

not use the 1988 survey from Ghana and the 1991-92 survey from Tanzania, because the geo-

coding of within-country regions changed between these and later surveys.

        Table 1 reports on the DHS data we use, including survey years, the birth years of

children covered in each survey year, and the number of observations in each survey. 2 For each

birth year from 1988 to 2005, we have observations from at least seven countries we are

studying. For 1988 and 1989, 7 and 8 countries are represented. In all years beyond that,

information is available from at least 9 countries for each birth year.

        Our analysis will focus on the association between health service delivery on one hand,

and HIV prevalence rates on the other. For this, we match HIV prevalence at the region level.

All countries are divided into regions that can be consistently identified across survey years.




1
  All results presented here are robust to the exclusion of Zimbabwe, which may have seen more upheaval and
displacement of persons than other countries examined.
2
  We exclude 133 cases where information on mother’s education is missing and 3509 cases where information on
the HIV prevalence in the region of birth is unknown for the child’s birth year.
Countries vary in the number of regions (3 in Cameroon and in Malawi for example, 10 in

Zimbabwe, 20 in Tanzania), and in total we analyze data from 119 regions.



Antenatal Care

Outcome measures for antenatal care are presented in Table 2. We present averages for each

country, taken over all DHS waves, on women’s reports that they received any antenatal care (in

the form of at least one antenatal visit). For women who report antenatal care, each is asked

whether their urine and blood was tested, and whether measurements of their blood pressure and

weight were taken. With the exception of Ethiopia, over 90 percent of women surveyed in East

and Southern Africa report some form of antenatal care, true for a smaller fraction of women in

West Africa. In most countries in our sample, more than 90 percent of women report that they

were weighed, conditional on reporting prenatal care, and the vast majority report their blood

pressure was taken. Blood tests and urine analysis are much less likely to be reported in some

countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Zambia) than in others (Cameroon, Ghana,

Zimbabwe).

       Figure 1 shows a marked decline in the tests and measurements taken during antenatal

visits in East and Southern Africa, by country and birth year, particularly for tests involving

bodily fluids. Results for urine and blood tests during antenatal care, shown in the upper panel of

Figure 1, suggest that use of these tests declined in all high HIV-prevalence countries we are

following (Kenya, KE; Malawi, MW; Tanzania, TZ; Zambia, ZM; and Zimbabwe, ZW). In

Malawi, for example, the percentage of women reporting that their blood was tested as part of

their prenatal care declined from 54 percent in 1995, to 20 percent in 2005. Reports that blood

pressure was taken during an antenatal visit held constant in West Africa (estimated but not
reported in Figure 1), but fell in East and Southern Africa, as can be seen in the bottom left panel

of Figure 1. In Kenya, for example, reports of blood pressure being taken fell from 88 percent in

1998 to 80 percent in 2003, and in Tanzania from 75 percent in 2000 to 64 percent in 2005. Even

reports of being weighed, an inexpensive measure that takes little clinic time, declined over this

period (although from a very high base – note that the graphing scales used are different for

different procedures.) We do not know how declines in these services have translated in to

declines in health outcomes for women and their children—for example, it may be that the

measurement of weight during pregnancy has little effect on birth outcomes. However, declines

in blood testing during pregnancy may be a particular problem, if a lack of blood tests prevents

HIV positive mothers from being identified and vertical transmission of AIDS from being

prevented.



Birth deliveries

Outcome measures for birth deliveries are presented in Table 3. In almost all countries under

study, approximately half of all births are attended by a trained professional. Approximately a

third of all births occurred in public clinics, and ten percent in private clinics. (The largest outlier

here is Ethiopia, where reports of clinic births and having a trained professional at the birth are

substantially lower.)

        That these patterns have been changing over time in high prevalence countries can be

seen in Figure 2, which presents delivery details, by country and year, for the five high

prevalence countries we follow in East and Southern Africa. The top left graph presents trends in

whether the birth occurred in a clinic (public or private) and the top right on whether it was

attended by a trained professional. All of these countries saw a decline in the presence of a
trained professional at the delivery. In Zambia, this declined from 51 to 37 percent between 1988

and 2002. In Malawi, the attendance of a trained professional fell from 72 percent to 59 percent

between 1988 and 2005. Private clinic delivery in high HIV-prevalence countries held fairly

steady over this period, while reports of delivery in public clinics declined.



Childhood immunizations

The rates of childhood immunization against polio, measles, BCG, and DPT are reported by

country in Table 4. DHS evidence on vaccinations is categorized as: no vaccine; mother reports

vaccine (no card); vaccine recorded on card (no date); and vaccine is dated on card. There are

many ways to categorize these reports. Our interest is in children missing vaccines, and for this

reason we code variables equal to ‘1’ if the child is reported – either by the mother or on the

health card – not to be vaccinated , and equal to ‘0’ if the mother reports the vaccine, or evidence

of the vaccine is recorded on the child’s health card. Table 4 shows that approximately half of all

children were reported not to have had a polio vaccine shortly after birth, but that this lack of

vaccination falls to between 10 to and 30 percent of children at older ages in most countries.

Between a 30 and 50 percent of all children are not vaccinated against measles, and between 10

and 20 percent have not received BCG vaccines. Non-vaccination rates are generally higher in

West African countries.



HIV prevalence

The HIV prevalence rates we use in our analysis were calculated using HIV test results from the

most recent DHS surveys listed in Table 1. We use this information to calculate prevalence rates

at the country-region level. Differences in prevalence between countries, and between regions
within countries, can be seen in Figure 3, where weighted averages of HIV prevalence are

presented by region for eight of the countries in our sample. HIV prevalence varies a great deal

both across countries, and across regions within countries. The lowest prevalence rates are in

Niger, Senegal and Mali, with values in all regions under 2.1 percent. There is substantial

regional variation in HIV rates in the higher-HIV countries of Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and

Zambia. In Zimbabwe, rates are uniformly high (12 percent or more). We turn, in Section 3, to

the methods we will use to examine whether health services for pregnant women and children

deteriorated in regions in which HIV prevalence grew most quickly.



3. Methods

Our key concern is whether higher HIV prevalence within regions is associated with lower

quality health care for mothers and their children. As noted above, we do not observe HIV

prevalence over multiple years, but only in the year in which the most recent survey was

conducted. We follow two general strategies for estimating the relationship between prevalence

and health care. Our first strategy is to regress each health care measure on imputed HIV

prevalence in the region in the child’s year of birth, and on other control variables, including

indicators for year of birth and country-region fixed effects. We impute HIV prevalence by

assuming that regional HIV prevalence has increased linearly from a value of 0 in 1980 to the

value observed in the most recent survey. 3 Our second strategy is to regress each health care

measure on a set of interactions between the child’s year of birth and the measure of HIV

prevalence in the most recent survey. This permits us to examine whether the evolution of health


3
  Although it is difficult to date the beginning of the AIDS crisis in Africa, there is evidence of a “marked increase in
cases in Africa during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s” (Quinn et al. 1986). The countries we study reported their
first cases of AIDS in the early- to mid-1980’s. Below, we discuss how our results change if we use a later date, of
1985 rather than 1980, to impute regional HIV prevalence.
outcomes from the late 1980s to the early 21st century is different in regions with high HIV

prevalence rates when compared to regions with low prevalence rates. As we show below, the

second of these strategies is simply a less restrictive variant of the first: it does not require an

assumption about the start of the epidemic, nor does it rely on the assumption that HIV

prevalence increased linearly.

         The first step is to impute HIV prevalence in each year in which children’s births are

observed. Let 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 denote the prevalence of HIV measured in region 𝑟𝑟 in year 𝜏𝜏, where 𝜏𝜏 is the

most recent survey year (which exceeds 1980) and 𝑟𝑟 denotes a country-region. The estimated

prevalence of HIV in region 𝑟𝑟 in year 𝑡𝑡, denoted ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 , is assumed to be:

                                                                   𝑡𝑡−1980
                                        (1)      ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 �𝜏𝜏−1980 �.

We then estimate regressions of the following form for each of the health outcomes discussed

above:

                            (2)    𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a health care measure associated with child 𝑖𝑖, either a measure of the quality of the

care the child’s mother received before or at the birth of the child, or a measure of the quality of

care the child has received. In addition to the prevalence measure, equation (2) contains a set of

region fixed effects (𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟 ), which capture time invariant features of the region, including

determinants of quality of care that do not change over time. As seen in Figures 1 and 2, there

are pronounced differences in the levels of the measures we examine, even though many have

similar trends. We also include a set of birth year effects (𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 ), which capture changes over time

that are common to all regions, and a set of controls for characteristics of the mother and child

(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). These controls include the mother’s years of education, her age in years, the child’s age in

months (or, if the child has died, the age in months the child would have been at the time of the
survey had he or she lived), an indicator for the child’s sex, and an indicator for whether the

household lives in an urban area. The parameter of interest, 𝛽𝛽, provides an estimate of how

changes in HIV prevalence in a region influence health care outcomes. 4

         Equation (2) incorporates two assumptions: one, that HIV prevalence increased linearly

from 1980 to the current time period, and two, that HIV prevalence has a linear effect on health

care quality. These assumptions can be loosened, by estimating models of the following form:

                                 (3) 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟∗ + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡∗ + 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡∗ 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + 𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where all variables are defined as above, only the actual prevalence in year 𝜏𝜏 has replaced

estimated prevalence in year 𝑡𝑡, and the coefficient on actual prevalence is permitted to vary by

year. Because the prevalence measure does not vary over time within regions, and region fixed

effects are included, the value of 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡∗ must be set to zero for one of the years.

         In what follows, we present estimates of (2) and (3). It is straightforward to see that (3) is

a less restrictive version of (2). First, substitute (1) into (2) to obtain:

                                           𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 1980                   𝛽𝛽
                   𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = �𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟 − 𝛽𝛽               � + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + �          � 𝐻𝐻 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                           𝜏𝜏 − 1980                𝜏𝜏 − 1980 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟

which, if:

                                                                           𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 1980
                                                    𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟∗ = �𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟 − 𝛽𝛽                 �
                                                                           𝜏𝜏 − 1980

and

                                                                          𝛽𝛽
                                                           𝛽𝛽 ∗ =
                                                                     𝜏𝜏 − 1980

can be expressed as:

                                (4)        𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟∗ + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡∗ + 𝛽𝛽 ∗ 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .



4
 All results reported in Tables 5, 6 and 7 are robust to additionally allowing unobservables to be clustered at the
region level.
In (4), the inclusion of an interaction term between the prevalence in year 𝜏𝜏 and the year of birth

permits a linear trend in the outcome (over and above the year effects 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡∗ ) that varies with HIV

prevalence. The only difference between (4) and (3) is that, in (3), different time patterns in areas

with high and low HIV prevalence are not restricted to a linear trend. In the results that follow,

we test whether this linear restriction can be rejected.

        To see how estimates of equation (3) should be interpreted, consider predicted values of

the outcome at two time periods, 1 and 2. Ignoring the control variables 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , the difference in

the predicted value of the outcome in region 𝑟𝑟 will be:

                           (5)    𝑦𝑦�𝑟𝑟2 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑟𝑟1 = (𝛾𝛾�2∗ − 𝛾𝛾�1∗ ) + (𝛽𝛽̂2∗ − 𝛽𝛽̂1∗ )𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 .

The year-to-year change in the outcome contains a component that is common to all regions, and

another component that is scaled by the region’s HIV prevalence in year τ.

        One concern is that not all outcomes are observed in all countries in all years of birth. For

example, the indicator that a child did not receive a polio vaccine at birth is available only in

Niger in 1988. By a birth year of 1993, information on this vaccine is available for four

countries, and by 1995 it is available for 13 countries. To prevent the birth year effects from

reflecting the experience of only a few countries, we “trim” the sample for each outcome, so that

regressions exclude birth years that do not have observations from at least four countries. As a

result of this trimming, estimates of models for specific antenatal care procedures cover the

1995-2005 period; and polio at birth covers the 1993 to 2005 period. All other estimates cover

the 1988-2005 period.
4. Results

Table 5 presents estimates of equation (2), which measure the association between estimated

HIV prevalence in the year of birth and antenatal care. We present the coefficient on HIV

prevalence from OLS regressions for whether a woman reports having had prenatal care (column

1) and, conditional on reporting care, that she reports having had a urine test, a blood test, blood

pressure measured, and her weight measured (columns 2 to 5). The first row presents estimates

from equation (2) where, in addition to estimated HIV prevalence, the only other controls are

birth year indicators. The second row presents estimates from regressions that also include

country-region fixed effects, and mother and child characteristics. 5 HIV prevalence is also

associated with fewer Women in regions with high HIV prevalence are significantly more likely

to report prenatal care. Relative to living in a region with zero prevalence, women living in a

region with 10 percent HIV prevalence are 26 percentage points more likely to report antenatal

care (top panel, column 1). However, when we include country-region fixed effects, so that

identification comes from change in HIV prevalence within a region over time, we find that

higher HIV prevalence is associated with a significantly lower probability of reporting antenatal

care. This suggests that, on average, higher prevalence areas started from higher levels of

prenatal care, and that HIV has taken a greater toll on service delivery there than in regions with

low levels of HIV prevalence. 6

            Increases in HIV prevalence are also associated with declines in the the types of

procedures conducted during antenatal care. Conditional on reporting antenatal care, women in



5
    Estimates using probit models yield similar results.
6
    Our result on reporting any antenatal care is also robust to the inclusion of country-by-year fixed effects.
regions with higher HIV prevalence are observed with lower probabilities of having urine tests,

and of reporting that their blood pressure was taken. Controlling for country-region fixed effects

magnifies these differences, so that all four of the measures of quality of prenatal care are

significantly lower over time within a region as HIV prevalence rises. For example, within a

region where HIV prevalence increased by 10 percentage points between 1995 and 2005, a

woman is 21 percentage points less likely on average to report that her blood pressure was taken

during prenatal care if she was pregnant in 2005, relative a woman who was pregnant in 1995.

Because antenatal care is itself negatively associated with HIV prevalence (controlling for

country-region fixed effects), these effects are magnified when we estimate models that do not

condition on the receipt of antenatal care. For example, as shown in Table 5, the coefficient on

HIV prevalence for having had a urine test is –2.22 when we restrict the sample to those who

reported antenatal care. It falls to –5.96 when we use the full sample of all births.

        Table 6 presents results on the association between estimated HIV prevalence in the year

of birth and the quality of birth deliveries. Specifically, we estimate the association of HIV

prevalence with an indicator that the birth occurred in a clinic (column 1) and, conditional on a

clinic delivery, whether the clinic was public (column 2). In addition, we estimate the association

between HIV prevalence and a trained attendant being present at the birth (column 3). Again, the

results are markedly different with and without country-region fixed effects. In the absence of

fixed effects (row 1), we find delivery at a clinic is significantly more likely in regions with high

HIV prevalence. However, over time within a region (row 2), we find clinic delivery is

significantly less likely to be reported as HIV prevalence increases. Without fixed effects,

conditional on being a clinic birth, delivery is are significantly less likely to be at a public clinic.

This coefficient, while still negative and significant, falls by two-thirds when country-region
fixed effects are included. A disturbing finding in Table 6 is that, within regions over time, those

with higher HIV prevalence see a significant drop in the probability that a trained birth attendant

was present for the delivery. On average, a region that experienced a 10 percentage point

increase in the rate of HIV prevalence witnessed a 14 percentage point drop in the probability of

a trained attendant at the birth. Part of this drop is due to the lower probability that the delivery

took place in a clinic (column 1), and part of this drop is due to the lower probability of an

attendant, even conditioning on clinic delivery (column 4).

           Table 7 turns to children’s health care outcomes, and presents estimates of the association

between HIV prevalence and children not reported to have had a polio vaccine soon after birth

(column 1), or to have ever been immunized against polio, measles, BCG and DPT (columns 2 to

5). With the exception of the polio vaccine at birth, high estimated HIV prevalence in the year of

birth is significantly associated with ever having been immunized – remembering that a negative

number is associated with higher vaccination rates (row 1). However, within regions over time,

children in regions of high HIV prevalence are significantly less likely to be vaccinated against

any of these diseases. Relative to children born in a particular region with zero HIV prevalence

in 1988, those born in the same region in 2005 would be almost 30 percentage points less likely

to be immunized against polio, measles and DPT, and 20 percentage points less likely to be

immunized against BCG if the prevalence rate had risen to 10 percent in 2005. 7 This lack of

immunization is occurring in areas in which individuals are quite vulnerable – in Kenya, for

example, news has been released of the first reported case of polio in the past 20 years

(Associated Press, February 25, 2009).

    Our results on vaccines are robust to additionally including country-by-year fixed effects.
        In summary, it appears that regions that are bearing the heaviest HIV burdens have

become less able to care for pregnant women, provide trained attendants for birth deliveries, and

immunize children.

        These results are built on the assumptions that HIV prevalence has increased linearly

over time since 1980, and that prevalence has a linear relationship with our health care measures

of interest. To check the robustness of our results to the assumption that the epidemic started in

1980, we repeat the analyses described above, but assumed that HIV prevalence increased

linearly from 1985 rather than 1980. In models with country-region fixed effects, this change has

the effect of reducing the coefficients (in absolute value) so that HIV prevalence has a smaller

association with each of the health outcomes. However, the reductions are not large. For

example, the coefficient on prevalence in the regression for antenatal care declines in absolute

value from –1.73 (as shown in Table 5) to –1.42. The coefficient on prevalence in the regression

for “no polio vaccine at birth” falls from 7.02 (as shown in Table 7) to 5.56. All coefficients

remain statistically significant.

        Next, we completely relax these assumptions of linearity, by estimating models of the

form of equation (3), reproduced here for convenience:

                            (3) 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟∗ + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡∗ + 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡∗ 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + 𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

        Our estimates are shown graphically. Specifically, after estimating equation (3) for each

health outcome, we predict what the value of the outcome would be in each birth year, for four

HIV prevalence rates (𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 equal to 0, 5, 10 and 20 percent.) For these predictions, the region

fixed effects 𝛿𝛿𝑟𝑟∗ are averaged across all regions, and values of 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are replaced by their grand

sample means. We then graph the predicted values of the outcomes over time, at the four

prevalence levels. To interpret these graphs, it is important to note that we have set 1997 to be
the omitted birth-year category for both 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡∗ and 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡∗ , so that predicted values are equal, by

definition, in 1997 for all prevalence rates. Specifically, the predicted value in 1997 will equal:
                                                         𝑅𝑅
                                                    1
                                         𝑦𝑦�1997   = � 𝛿𝛿̂𝑟𝑟∗ + 𝛼𝛼� ∗ 𝑋𝑋�
                                                    𝑅𝑅
                                                        𝑟𝑟=1

Although this normalization vertically “centers” the graphed lines around realistic values of the

outcomes, it should be kept in mind that this normalization is arbitrary. Indeed, as shown in

Tables 2 through 4, average values of the health care outcomes differ widely across countries.

Our interest is not particularly in the levels of predicted values, but rather how predicted values

change over time, and how these changes vary with 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 . It is also important to keep in mind that,

in the discussion of these estimates, “HIV prevalence” refers to 𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 , the actual prevalence in a

region, measured using data from the most recent DHS survey.

        Figure 4 shows results for the indicator of whether the mother received antenatal care.

Consistent with the estimates of equation (2), the figure indicates that in low prevalence regions,

the use of antenatal care increased over time—by approximately 20 percentage points from 1988

to 2005. However, this upward trend is less pronounced for higher prevalence rates. At 20

percent prevalence, antenatal care is relatively constant from 1988 to 1995, and then declines by

approximately 5 percentage points. Test statistics from the regression underlying Figure 4 are

shown in the first row of Table 8. These indicate that the hypothesis that the birth year effects 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡∗

are jointly insignificant can be rejected, as can the hypothesis that the birth year/HIV prevalence

interactions 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡∗ are jointly insignificant.

        The last column in Table 8 shows the results of tests of the hypothesis that the birth

year/HIV prevalence interactions follow a linear trend—or, in other words, that the parameter

restrictions imposed in equation (4) are valid. This hypothesis is rejected. This is not surprising,
given that the changes in antenatal care at different prevalence rates shown in Figure 4 do not

begin to diverge until the late-1990’s. The rejection of the hypothesis of a linear trend could be

due to two factors. First, it could be that the evolution of HIV prevalence was non-linear.

Second, it could be that the adverse effects of HIV on antenatal care have increased since the

mid-1990’s. Without data on HIV prevalence over time, we cannot distinguish between these

two factors.

       Results for the procedures women receive during antenatal care are shown in Figure 5.

Consistent with the results in Table 5, differences in all of these procedures are apparent across

high and low HIV prevalence regions, with the largest differences observed for urine tests and

blood pressure. The use of blood tests is predicted to decline for all HIV prevalence rates shown,

although more so for high HIV regions. The linearity restrictions are also rejected for these

measures of care.

       Results for delivery care, in Figure 6, indicate that the largest differences across higher

and lower HIV prevalence regions occur for the presence of a trained birth attendant. At 20

percent prevalence, the presence of a trained birth attendant declines almost continuously, by

more than 15 percentage points from 1988 to 2005. At zero prevalence, the presence of a trained

birth attendant declines from 1988 to 1993, before leveling off and then increasing after 1999.

Consistent with the results in Table 6, there are smaller differences across high and low

prevalence regions for the indicators for whether the mother delivered in a clinic, whether clinic

deliveries occurred in a public clinic, and whether trained attendants were present for clinic

deliveries.

       Results for children’s vaccines are presented in Figures 7 and 8. In high HIV regions,

mothers were increasingly likely to report that their child had not received a polio vaccine
shortly after birth. For example, at 10 percent prevalence, the fraction of mothers who report no

vaccine is estimated to have increased by 20 percentage points from 1993 to 2005. In contrast,

low HIV prevalence regions made gains in vaccinating children against polio shortly after birth.

The figures for the other vaccines are noisier, but show the same general pattern.

        Overall, the estimates of the less restrictive models, using equation (3), are consistent

with those reported in Tables 5 to 7: regions with high HIV prevalence rates experienced greater

deterioration in antenatal care, and larger declines in the use of trained birth attendants and

vaccinations, relative to low HIV regions. Estimates of the less restrictive models also allow us

to date when health care quality began to diverge across higher and lower HIV regions. For both

the use of antenatal care and for children’s vaccines, this divergence began in the mid-1990s.

This timing is also consistent with reports issued about deterioration in health care delivery in

sub-Saharan Africa in the mid-1990s, summarized by the Lancet (1995).



5. Discussion

There are several possible, non-competing explanations for the deterioration of non-HIV related

health services observed in high prevalence regions. AIDS may have affected access to care.

AIDS may also have reduced the demand for non-HIV related health services through its effect

on households’ incomes. Alternatively, AIDS may have had little effect on demand for care, or

access to care, but have had a large effect on the quality of care available. We discuss these in

turn.



Access to care
AIDS-related illnesses may have crowded out access to medical care between 1995 and 2005.

This would have been prior to the arrival of antiretroviral therapy in nearly all regions, and it is

possible that the high morbidity rates among those infected with HIV took an ever larger toll on

access to care. High HIV burdens may have reduced funding for non-HIV-related medical care,

producing closures of clinics or reductions in the range of services offered. Alternatively, high

HIV burdens could put upward pressure on user fees charged for non-HIV related services.

       The DHS surveys provide some information on the problems women experienced with

access to services. Specifically, in the most recent surveys for all countries we examine (with the

exception of Kenya), mothers are asked about problems they face accessing medical care.

Specifically, they are asked which of the following items were “a big problem with access to

medical care”: (1) not knowing where to go for care; (2) the distance required to get to care; (3)

the lack of money to pay for medical care; and (4) the lack of transportation to get to a facility. If

HIV burdens were responsible for forcing women to travel farther, or spend more to attend

clinics, we would expect to see a difference in responses among women in West Africa, where

HIV rates are low, and those in East and Southern Africa, where rates are high.

       Tabulations of responses to these questions are in Table 9. For each outcome, we find a

uniform pattern across countries. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of women report not knowing

where to go for medical care; 40 percent report that distance is a problem; 60 percent say money

is an issue; and 40 percent say transportation is a problem. However, there is no divide between

high and low HIV countries. We also ran regressions of each of these variables on HIV

prevalence in the region, and a set of country indicators, and found no evidence that mothers

living in high-prevalence regions within countries reported worse access to care.
       This result—that access to care measures are similar across low- and high-HIV countries

and regions within countries—provides suggestive but not conclusive evidence that HIV has not

altered access to care. It is possible that high-HIV countries (or regions within countries) had

better access to care prior to the HIV crisis, and that they have experienced more rapid

deteriorations in these measures of access. Indeed, our results on health care use presented

earlier indicate that, without controlling for region fixed effects, health care measures often look

better in high-HIV regions. However, once country-region fixed effects are included—so we are

essentially looking at changes over time within regions—we see a negative association between

HIV prevalence and health care. The same could be true for access to care. As more rounds of

DHS data are collected, it will be possible to examine within-region changes in access measures.



Demand for health services

Households in high-HIV regions may have become poorer, because of lost income due to illness,

increases in funeral expenses, or greater demands on household resources that result from having

to care for orphans. Lower wealth could, in turn, be responsible for the deterioration in health

care in high-HIV regions. If so, we would expect that the estimated associations between

regional prevalence and health care will become smaller, in absolute value, when we control for

household wealth.

       The DHS surveys do not contain measures of financial wealth. However, they do collect

information on household assets – ownership of bicycles, refrigerators, and radios, for example.

We construct a measure of household assets equal to the sum of indicators for the ownership of a

radio, television, refrigerator, bicycle, motorcycle and car. We first examine whether asset

ownership declined with HIV prevalence within regions. To test whether the HIV-prevalence
effect might be working through household resources, we re-ran equation (2), including a control

for the number of assets. We also estimated variants that included indicators for ownership of

each of the six assets separately.

       Our results do not support the hypothesis that declines in wealth (as measured by assets)

in high-HIV regions account for the deterioration in the quality of health care. It is not the case

that the asset index declined significantly over time in high-HIV regions. Using a sample of

mothers (rather than births), we regressed the asset index on a set of survey year indicators,

country-region indicators, mother’s age and education, an indicator for urban status, and

estimated HIV prevalence in the survey year. The coefficient on HIV prevalence was positive

(0.919) rather than negative, although not significantly different from zero. The samples are

somewhat smaller than those used previously, since some waves of data did not contain

comparable asset information. However, in all cases, the addition of asset information has only

small effects on the coefficient on HIV prevalence.

       Our results might be explained by HIV positive mothers being less likely to seek

antenatal and other medical care, either because they are ill, or because they are poorer due to

illness, or because clinics do not welcome them. We can explore this, using the last round of

DHS data for each of the countries in our sample, because in those datasets we know whether

mothers are HIV positive. We estimated regressions as in equation (2) for antenatal care, birth

deliveries and children’s immunizations, which included a set of country-region fixed effects and

an indicator for whether the woman was HIV positive. We find that HIV positive mothers are 1.5

percentage points more likely to report having had antenatal care, with or without a control for

the estimated regional HIV prevalence in the child’s birth year. Similarly, with or without

controls for regional prevalence, HIV positive mothers are also significantly more likely to report
having had urine and blood tested, and blood pressure taken. They are 3.5 percentage points

more likely to report a clinic delivery, and 3 percentage points more likely to report the presence

of a trained professional at the delivery. Children of HIV positive mothers are no more or less

likely than other children to have been immunized against polio, measles, BCG and DPT. We

take this as evidence against lower demand for health care by HIV positive mothers. If anything,

the results suggest that HIV positive women are more likely than others to seek medical care

during pregnancy, or are given higher priority and better service in clinics.



Quality of health services

Our parametric and semi-parametric results suggest that the quality of services available plays a

large role in the decline in care we observe in our data. Women who attend antenatal care clinics

are receiving significantly fewer diagnostic tests during their visits – even tests as inexpensive as

having weight taken. Those who report delivering children in clinics are significantly less likely

to have a trained attendant at the delivery.

       These declines in quality could be due to a reduction in the supply of trained personnel as

a consequence of the pandemic, or to a redirection of funds for supplies and trained medical

professionals to care for HIV patients. The latter interpretation is consistent with findings of a

qualitative-quantitative study conducted in Malawi and Ethiopia among health workers and

NGOs, which found the introduction of support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria

and Tuberculosis has led “to an increasing focus on the three focal diseases, rather than increased

attention to broader health systems strengthening. As a result, existing health system challenges

have been overlooked in many cases, and to some extent, other health priorities have been

overshadowed” (Schott, Stillman and Bennett 2005, page 39).
       Grépin (2009) examines whether the influx of foreign aid earmarked to HIV/AIDS

exacerbated a diversion of resources away from non-AIDS health care. Using data from 1990 to

2006, she finds a negative association between country’s receipt of foreign aid for HIV/AIDS

and measures of the quality of care. However, it is unlikely that the expansion of AIDS-targeted

foreign aid explains a large part of what we see in our data. Grépin’s numbers indicate that

foreign aid for AIDS grew little until the year 2000, and then escalated rapidly as funds for ART

became available through PEPFAR and other programs. This pattern is consistent with increases

in access to ART. The number of people in Sub-Saharan Africa receiving ART is estimated to

have been only 100,000 in 2003, but then rose to 1.375 million in 2006, and 2.12 million in 2007

(World Health Organization, 2008). Our results indicate that the divergence in the quality of

care between high- and low-AIDS regions began in the early- to mid-1990’s, before foreign aid

for AIDS was significant, and when very few Africans were receiving ART. The expansion of

ART is so recent that the data needed to examine its effects on health services are not yet

available.



6. Conclusions

       The next round of DHS data sets will be in the field after the arrival of ART in many

regions of Africa. When these data sets become available, it may be possible to assess whether

ART improves the quality of care received by pregnant women and children– either directly,

through provision of resources for medical care more broadly – or indirectly, through a reduction

in morbidity among HIV positive patients, or whether it crowds out non-AIDS-related medical

care. Unfortunately, women and children in sub-Saharan Africa cannot wait for another round of
DHS surveys to come on line. We must find alternative ways to investigate the roots of this

erosion in services.

       In the interim, care providers should take into account the fact that medical care in high

prevalence regions has not been adequate since the mid-1990s, which may affect the diseases

children face (measles, polio, DPT) and the quality of the care their mothers receive during

pregnancy and delivery.

Notes. Means are presented by country over all DHS waves, with the exception of the measure of “no polio vaccine at birth.” Because
only 2 DHS waves conducted earlier than 1992/1993 collected information on this vaccine, means are computed over children born
from 1993 onward. Means are weighted using sample weights. Observations are the number responding to the question of whether the
child had received a DPT vaccine.

Note: Each row shows test statistics from a regression of the dependent variable on a set of mother and child controls, regions/country controls,
birth year indicators, and interactions between the birth year indicators and the HIV prevalence in the country/region from the most recent DHS
survey (equation 3 in text). The results of these regressions are graphed in Figures 4-8.
