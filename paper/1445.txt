The Use of Expected Future Variables in Macroeconometric Models



                             ABSTRACT


         A more sophisticated expectational hypothesis than is tra—

ditionally used in the specification of macroeconometric models is

tested in this paper. Economic agents are assumed to use a vector

of variables Z in forming their expectations for periods t+l and

beyond. These expectations may or may not be rational in the Muth

sense. The results provide some evidence in favor of the more sophisti-

cated hypothesis, but they are not strong enough to allow much weight to

be put on the hypothesis as yet. The evidence in favor of the hypothesis

is strongest for households' response to future wages and prices in their

consumption and labor supply decisions and for the Fed's response to

future inflation rates.

         The sensitivity of the policy properties of my macroeconometric

model to the more sophisticated hypothesis is also examined in the paper.

The properties are not sensitive for a policy action in which government

expenditures are changed. They are somewhat sensitive for an action in

which personal tax rates are changed. In the latter case the properties

are also sensitive to whether or not the policy action is anticipated.

I. Introduction

         It is common practice in traditional macroeconometric model build-

ing to use current and lagged values as proxies for expected future values.

It is well known that this procedure may not approximate well the way in

which expectations are actually formed. The purpose of this paper is to

consider an alternative procedure. Economic agents are assumed to use a

vector of variables Z in forming their expectations for periods t+l
and   beyond.   These expectations may or may not be rational in the Muth

sense.

         If expectations are rational in the Nuth sense, the most efficient

estimation technique is full information maximum likelihood (FIML). This

technique accounts for the cross equation restrictions that are implied

by the rational expectations hypothesis, which is where most of the test-

able implications of the hypothesis lie. Unfortunately, the estimates are

expensive to compute. For nonlinear models the only known computational

method is the Fair-Taylor (1983) method, and this method is not currently

coniputationally feasible for large models.

         There are limited information alternatives to FIML, and these are




                                      1
                                                                             2




the techniques used in this paper. These techniques are relatively inex-

pensive. They are also more robust than FINL in that unlike FIML they

retain their consistency when expectations are not rational. All they

require for consistency is that       be among the variables used by the

agents in forming their expectations. Agents can use variables other than

those in Z. .   Also,   the complete set of variables used by the agents need

not include all the predetermined variables in the model.

       The two main limited information techniques are those of Hansen

(1982) and Hayashi and Sims (1983). The application of these methods to

the present problem is not completely straightforward, and so the exact

way in which these methods were used is explained in Section II.   In par-

ticular, some of the equations that are estimated in this paper have a

first order autoregressive error term (in addition to the moving average

error term that arises from the expectational assumptions), and the way

in which Hansen's method was set up to handle this problem needs to be ex-

plained.

       The expectational hypothesis is tested in Section III using my U.S.

macroeconometric model (Fair (1984)). The basic version of this model

merely uses current and lagged values to proxy for expected future values.

The aim.of the work in Section III is to see if a more sophisticated ex-

pectational hypothesis leads to better results. Section IV examines the

sensitivity of the properties of the model to the alternative expecta-

tional hypothesis. The properties of the basic version of the model are

compared to the properties of the version of the model that uses the more

sophisticated hypothesis. Section V contains a brief conclusion.

II. The Limited Information Techniques

The Basic Model

       Consider the model



                  =
(1)
                      X1a1
                             +
                                 t-l    t+ia2      + Ut


(2)          u =      pu1    +         , t   =    1,    ...,   T


X1 is a 1 xp-l vector of non expectational explanatory variables, a1

is a p-i xl vector of unknown coefficients multiplying these variables,

t—l 2t+i   is the expectation of X                       made at the end of period t-l
                                                 2t+i
a2 is an unknown coefficient multiplying this variable, and                       Is an

error termthat is assumed to follow a first order autoregressive process.

It is easy to generalize the following discussion to have the model include

more than one expectational variable and include a higher order autore-

gressive process for the error term. Many structural equations in macro-

econometric models have autoregressive errors, and this is the reason for

including (2) as part of the basic model. The length ahead parameter i

is assumed to be fixed. Again, it is easy to generalize the model to in-

clude more than one value of i for the same variable. The y and X

variables can be nonlinear transformations of endogenous and predetermined

variables, and so equation (1) can be nonlinear in variables.


The Case of No Autoregressive Structural Error (p = 0)

       Let the expectation error for t-lt+i be


                       =           -
(3)
                           x2t+i        1x2+1

where X2. is the actual value of the variable. Substituting (3) into
                                                                                    4



(1) yields

(4)             =
                    xiti ÷ x2t+2 + ut       -



                = Xtc& +


where X =
          (X1 X2t.) ,              = () ,           and   v =   u - t-l6t+i2
        Consider first the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation of equa-

tion (4).    Let Z be a vector of dimension k of first stage regressors.

A necessary condition for consistency is that Z and v be uncorrelated.

This will be true if both u and                           are uncorrelated with Z
                               t        t-l t÷i
                                                c
                                                                                t
The requirement that       and u be uncorrelated is the usual 2SLS require-

ment. The requirement that           and                   be uncorrelated involves an

additional assumption, which is that the variables in Z have been used

(perhaps along with others) in forming the expectation of X2 . As

noted in the Introduction, this assumption does not require that the expec-

tations be rational. It merely requires that all the information contained

in the Z variables be used. Given this assumption (and the other stand-

ard assumptions that are necessary for consistency), the 2SLS estimator

of ct   in equation (4) is consistent. This estimator (denotes             2SLS )   is:

(5)          2SLS =
                      (xz(zz)_1ztx)xIz(ztz)_1z?y

where 2SLS is pxl ,        X   is Txp, Z is Txk, and y is Txl
The application of the 2SLS estimator to models of this type is due to

McCallum (1976).

        The standard formula for the covariance matrix of 2SLS is not

correct for i greater than 0 because in this case v IS serially
                                                                                          5




correlated. If, for example,     i is 2, an unanticipated shock in period

t will affect t_lEt÷2        -2÷1 ,         and            ,   and SO Vt will be

a second order moving average. In general, v will be a moving average

of order    •l Both the Hansen (1982) and Hayashi-Sims (1983) methods ac-

count for this moving average process.

       Consider first the Hayashi-Sims estimator, which will be denoted

HS •   Let V be the covariance matrix of v                                       v   is
                                                          (v1, ...,   VT)'   •



T x 1 and V is T x T .      The idea of Hayashi and Sims is to find an upper

triangular matrix W such that %VVW' =           I    and then to transform the data

using W .   Let y' =   Wy   and Xk =   WX   .       The HS estimator of a is simply

2SLS applied to y and X



(6)
            aHS   (x*tz(z?z)_1zIx*)x*tz(z?z)_1zty*


The estimated covariance matrix for    aHS is


(7)
            (x*z(z?z)_1z?x*)

Taking W to be upper rather than lower triangular means that the trans-

formations are with respect to current and future values rather than cur-

rent and past values. This allows the transformed error term Wv to

remain uncorrelated with all the current and past values of the variables

in Z

       Computing aHS is straightforward once an estimate of V is avail-

able. Given V ,   W    can be computed numerically, and the rest is simply


1Note that it is assumed here that expectations are based on information
through period t-l , not t .      If
                                   information through period t were
used, the order of the moving average would be i-l

            Two versions of Hansen's estimator are considered in this paper,

denoted               and           .    The estimators differ in the estimation of the

M matrix below. The estimators are



(9)              aHl = aH2 =
                                        (xtzM_1ztx)xz}4_1zty

where H is some estimate of lim TEIZ'vv'Z]                                 .   The estimated covariance

matrix of Hl and aH2 is

                 T.(XtZH_'ZX)

            The general way of estimating H is as follows. Let                                =      ®
where           is computed from (8). Let                   R =                           ,   where

j    = 0,   1, ...,    i    ,   where     i is the order of the moving average. The

estimate of H is                (R0 + R1 +   R + ... + R. + R!)        .    The estimator based on

this way of estimating M is denoted                         ciHl .     In many cases estimating H
in this way does not result in a positive definite matrix, and so
                                                                                                  ctHl

cannot be computed. Fortunately, there is an alternative estimate of H

available under the assumption that

depend on Z .     The HS estimator is based on this assumption. This assump-

tion is implied by the assumption that E[vZ5] = 0                    for t > s      if norm-

ality is also assumed. Under this assumption M can be estimated as

        Hayashi and Sims (1983) show that without more information on the

determination of Z ,         it   is not in general possible to determine the rela-

tive efficiency of their estimator and Hansen's estimator. Both estimators

are consistent under fairly general regularity conditions. Hayashi and

Sims show that consistency of their estimator is retained when the popula-

tion V is replaced with a consistent estimate and that consistency of

Hansen's estimator is retained when the population M is replaced with a

consistent estimate.

that were not known as of period t-2 .                           This   is an important additional

restriction in the autoregressive case.2



2Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1983), p. 341, incorrectly assert that
the instrument set must be moved backward in time as the order of the mov-
ing average process for v. increases and that higher order autoregressive
properties of u. can be handled merely by appropriate quasi differencing.
In fact, the instrument set must be moved backward in time as the order
of the autoregressive process increases. It need not be moved backward
as the order of the moving average process increases.

          The estimator that is based on the minimizing of (15) is Amemiya's

 (1974) nonlinear 2SLS estimator. In the general case (15) can be minimized

using a general purpose algorithm. In the particular case considered here

a simple iterative procedure can be used, where one iterates between esti—

mates of a and p .                  Minimizing v'Dv with respect to a and p re-
suits in the following first-order conditions:



(16)             =
                     {(X-X1)'D(x              -
                                                  X1)](X X1)'D(y-y1)
                                                               -




                          (y1
                                 - X i&) 'D(y - X&)
(17)             =   1-
                               - X1a Dy1 - X1ct)

where the -1 subscript denotes the vector or matrix of observations                          lagged

one period.3 Equations (16) and (17) can be easily solved iteratively.

Given the estimates &               and   S       that   solve (16) and (17), one can compute

the 2SLS estimates of               v ,   which are

                 =         -              - X&                       t
(18)                                                +
                                                         X1&   ,
                                                                         =   1,   ...,   T


         Now, given             ,    one can compute M for Hansen's estimator in

either of the two ways discussed above. These calculations simply involve

       and Z ,   t    =   1,    ..., T            Given M ,        Hansen's estimates of a and
p are obtained by minimizing4


(19)          v'ZMZ'v = v'Cv


3Data for period 0 are assumed to exist so that y1 can be taken to be
Txl and X1 can be taken to be Txp

4The estimator that is based on the minimization of (19) is the 2S2SLS esti-
mator in Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1983). Since this estimator is
a special case of Hansen's generalized method of moments estimator, I have
simply referred to it as Hansen's estimator in this paper.

Minimizing (19) with respect to    cz and p results in the first order con-

ditions (16) and (17) with C replacing D .            The estimated covariance

matrix is

                   (X-X1    y1 -X1&)


        To summarize, Hansen's method in the case of a first order autore-

gressive structural error consists of: 1) choosing Z so that it does

not include any variables not known in period t-2 ,          2) solving (16) and

(17), 3) computing         from (18), 4) estimating M in one of the two ways,

and 5) solving (16) and (17) with C in (19) replacing D .            The two esti-

mators, based on the two estimates of M ,       will   be denoted cHlR and

H2R
        The possible application of the Hayashi—Sims estimator to the case

of an autoregressive structural error is not pursued here; only aH1R and

H2R have been used for the results in Section III.

        As a final note on all the methods, one can iterate further than

the discussion in this section has so far indicated. Given HS
                                                                          aHl

or H2           in (8) can be recomputed, and then the estimation procedure

can be repeated for the new values of       .   The new coefficient estimates

can then be used to compute new values of         ,     and so on. The whole pro-

cess can be repeated until convergence (assuming the process converges).

Similarly, given ctHlR or H2R             in (18) can be recomputed, M can

be recomputed, and then (19) can be minimized for the new estimate of M

This whole process can also be repeated. This further way of iterating

has not been used for the results in this paper.

III. Tests of the Expectational Hypothesis

        The   hypothesis that agents use Z in forming their expectations
is   tested in this section within the context of my macroeconometric model
(Fair   (1984)). The theory behind the model is that agents make decisions

by solving multiperiod optimization problems. Before solving these prob-

lems agents must form expectations of future values of a number of vari-

ables. The key decision variables for households are consumption and

leisure, and the key decision variables for firms are prices, wages, pro-

duction, investment, and employment demand. A typical estimated equation

in the econometric model has a decision variable on the left hand side and

variables that are assumed to affect the decision on the right hand side.

Current and lagged values of variables are used as proxies for expected

future values. The tests in this paper consist of adding future values

to the right hand side of these equations. Before discussing the tests,

however, the use of lagged dependent variables and the treatment of pos-

sible constraints on the decision variables in the model should be explained.


Use of Lagged Dpendent Variables

        Lagged dependent variables are important explanatory variables in

the model. The use of these variables can be justified by appeal to the

simple partial adjustment model. Assume that equation (1) in Section II

holds with no error term and with y replacing y on the left hand

side, where y is the "desired" value of y .         Assume   that y only
partially adjusts to y each period, with adjustment coefficient y


(21)             -      =     - t-l   + Ut



The equation for y and equation (21) can be combined to yield
                                                                                 12




(22)           =
                   X1cy    +
                               t-l    t+i2 +                 + Ut


This procedure has simply added               to the right hand side of equation

(1). If expectations are such that _i÷ is simply proportional to

X2. (say,   t-l4t+i   =          ),   then   (22) becomes


(23)        y = X1a1y + X2ct2y + 1-tl +

Equation (23) is in a form that can be estimated. It is not possible to

identify     and 2 separately, but for many problems this is not impor-

tant.

        It is well known that there is another justification for the use

of lagged dependent variables, which is that expectations are a geometric-

ally declining function of current and past values. Assume that


                      =          +            ÷          +
(24)                      xX2

Equations (1) and (24) yield


(25)        y (X1 - Xit         1A)c1 + X2a2A + t—l + t -           xutl
Equation (25) differs from (23) in that it has a different error term and

it has X1 -   X11X        in place of X1. .       In   practice these two differences

are sometimes ignored, and one appeals rather casually to either the par-

tial adjustment model or the model in which expectations are a geometric-

ally declining function of current and past values as a justification for

using the lagged dependent variable as an explanatory variable. It should

be clear in the present case, however, that appeal must be made to the

partial adjustment model. The basic expectational hypothesis of this paper
                                                                               13




will be tested by adding future values to equation (22). This procedure

is incompatible with the assumption that expectations are a geometrically

declining function of current and past values.


Treatment of Constraints

       Expectations of individual agents in the model are not assumed to

be rational, and expectation errors can lead to situations of disequilib-

rium. The main form of disequilibrium is that households may be constrained

from working as much as they would like. This constraint was handled in

the following way in the empirical work. Consider as an example the con-

sumption of services, denoted CS .            Let CSUNt denote the consumption
of services that the household sector would choose if it were not constrained

in how many hours it can work. CSIJNt is a function of the variables that

influence the households' optimization problems:


(26)                 f(
             CSUNt


where the variables in f are assumed to be observed. If the household

sector is not constrained, then CS equals CSUNt ,            and there is no

estimation problem. If the household sector is constrained, then CS.

is less than CSUN. if, as in the theoretical model, binding labor con-

straints cause the household sector to consume less than it would have

unconstrained. Now, if one can find a variable, say            ,   such that


(27)         CS. = CSUNt +    ,   y   >   0


then one has immediately from (26) and (27) an equation in observed vari-

ables. Given this setup, the problem for the empirical work is finding

a variable       for which the specification in (27) seems reasonable. The
                                                                           14




variable Q should take on a value of zero when labor markets are tight

and households are not constrained and a value less than zero otherwise.

When the variable is less than zero, it should be a linear function of the

difference between the constrained and unconstrained decision values. For

the empirical work      was taken to be a particular nonlinear function of

a measure of labor market tightness.


Household Equations

       Explanatory variables in the decision equations for the household

sector that are meant to be proxies for expected future values are:

1) the after-tax nominal wage rate, 2) the price level, 3) the after-tax

short-term or long-term interest rate, and 4) after-tax nonlabor income.

These variables enter the equations with either no lag or a lag of one

quarter, depending on which gave the better results. Other variables in

the equations include the initial value of wea1th, the labor constraint

variable, and the lagged dependent variable. The equations are estimated

by 2SLS, where the first stage regressors include the main predetermined

variables in the model.5 The tests in this paper consist of trying future

values of the relevant explanatory variables in place of the current or

lagged values. The variables used for Z are simply the first stage re-

gressors used for the original estimates.6

       The after-tax nominal wage rate and the price level are entered

separately •in the household equations. Since these variables are highly


5
 See Fair (1984), Table 6-1, for the list of first stage regressors for
each equation. The number of first stage regressors per equation varies
from 34 to 43.

6The only exception to this is for equations in which the structural error
term follows a first order autoregressive process. In this case all one-
period lagged endogenous variables were moved back one period.
                                                                         15




collinear, it is not possible to include, say, the current value of each

variable and a future value of each variable in the equations together and

expect to get sensible results. What was done instead was simply to in-

clude each set of values (lagged, current, or future) separately and ob-

serve how the properties of the estimated equations change as different

values are included.

       It is not clear in the present context how the estimated equations

should be compared. If the FIML technique could be used, one could merely

compare the likelihood values. For the limited information techniques,

however, there is no obvious measure of goodness of fit. The procedure

used in this paper is to compare the equations on the baiss of the t-

statistics of the coefficient estimates of the variables in question. This

procedure is somewhat crude, but in most cases it should give a fairly good

idea of the explanatory importance of each variable. The results for the

household sector are summarized in Table 1.

       All the equations in Table 1 except the 11'h equation have been

estimated by the H2 technique. The IHh equation has a first-order auto-

regressive structural error, and it has been estimated by the H2R technique.

The Hi and H1R techniques did not work in the sense that the estimates of

M were not positive definite. In no case with a moving average error of

order one or greater was M positive definite. On the other hand, no

computational problems were encountered in the use of H2 and H2R. In par-

ticular, the method discussed in Section II of computing H2R worked well.

For example, in the case of H2R applied to the 111h equation for the wage

and price variables led one period, the initial solution of equations (16)

and (17) required 13 iterations. The second solution (using C in place

of D in (16) and (17)) required 14 iterations.        The tolerance

level between successive estimates of p was .OO1.7

       The data base used in Fair (1984a) was updated through 1984 I for

the results in this paper. The estimation period for all the equations

in Table 1 was 1954 I - 1983 I. The estimation period had to end four

quarters before the end of the data set because future values of up to

four quarters ahead were needed for the estimates in Table 1. It should

also be noted that the order of, the moving average process of the error

term was increased as the length ahead of the future values was increased.

For t+1 the order was one, for t+2 the order was two, and so on. For

t-l and t the order was zero.

       The estimates using the HS technique were very close to the esti-

mates using the H2 technique, and there seemed to be no need to present

both sets of results here. For example, the t÷l wage and price t-sta-

tistics for the CS equation were 1.45 and -1.23 for the HS estimator,

which compare to 1.30 and -1.08 in Table 1. For the CN equation the values

were 2.06 and -1.98, which compare to 2.12 and -2.04 in Table 1. The

t+4 wage and price t-statistics for the CD equation were 3.46 and -2.44,

which compare to 3.68 and -2.67 in Table 1. It seems clear that similar

conclusions would be drawn using either the H2 or HS technique, and so for

simplicity only the H2 results are presented here.

       Consider first the wage and price results in Table 1. All equa-

tions except the IHh equation have better t-statistics for values led

one or more periods than for current or lagged values. An asterisk in

the table indicates my choice for the best lead for the equation. These



7All the estimates in this paper were computed using the Fair-Parke (1984)
program.

are the specifications that have been used for Version 2 of the model in

Section IV. The final pair of t-statistics for each equation in the table

is for a specification in which coefficients of certain lead values are

constrained to be equal. Except for the L3 equation, this specification

was not an improvement over the best individual lead value. The coeffi-

cient estimates for the IHh equation for t+l and beyond are not sensible

because they are of the wrong sign.

       The interest rate results in Table 1 do not show any evidence that

future values are better than current or lagged values.8 The coefficient

estimates are of the wrong sign for t+3 and t+4 for the CS equation,

for all the leads for the CN equation, and for t+4 for the IHh equation.

Otherwise, the t-statistics for the future values are smaller in absolute

value than those for the current or lagged values. For the nonlabor in-

come variable, only the results for the CN equation had a future value

better than a current or lagged value.

       The wage and price results thus provide some evidence in favor of

the more sophisticated expectational hypothesis for households. One should

be careful, however, not to make too much of the results. In general the

results are fairly close across lags, current values, and leads, and in

some cases even the best results are not significant by conventional sta-

tistical standards.




8The wage and price explanatory variables that were used for the interest
rate regressions for the CS, CN, and CD equations are the ones indicated
by an asterisk in Table 1. For the IHh equation the t-l values of the
wage and price variables were used.

Firm Equations

       There are six main estimated equations of the firm sector, explain-

ing: 1) the price level, 2) the wage rate, 3) production, 4) investment,

5) number of workers employed, and 6) number of hours worked per worker.

The price and wage equations have been extensively examined elsewhere (see

Fair (1984c)), and these equations will not be considered in this paper.

For the remaining four equations, the current value of sales appears in

the production equation as in part a proxy for expected future sales, and

current and lagged values of production appear in the investment, employ-

ment, and hours equations as in part proxies for expected future production.

For the tests in this paper future values of sales are added to the produc-

tion equation and future values of production are added to the other three

equations. The results are summarized in Table 2.

       The results for the firm sector provide no evidence in favor of the

more sophisticated expectational hypothesis. In the production equation

future values of sales are not significant in the three specifications

tried. In the investment equation the three future values of production

are significant when the coefficients are constrained to be equal, but the

coefficient estimates are of the wrong sign.   (The three lagged values of

production are marginally significant in the investment equation when their

coefficients are constrained to be equal.) In both the employment and

hours equations. the future values are not significant except for the two-

quarter-ahead value in the employment equation, which has a coefficient

estimate of the wrong sign. The results are thus uniformly negative for

the firm sector.

Term Structure and Stock Market Equations

       There are two term structure equations in the model, one explaining

the bond rate and one explaining the mortgage rate. In both equations cur-

rent and lagged values of the short-term interest rate are taken as proxies

for expected future values. (The three-month Treasury bill rate is used

as the short-term interest rate in the model.) For the tests in this paper

future values of the bill rate were added to these equations. The results

are summarized in Table 3.

       In the bond rate and mortgage rate equations it is difficult to dis-

tinguish between the use of lagged values and future values of the bill

rate. In the bond rate equation the current and one-quarter-lagged values

are significant when they are included together in the equation. When the

lagged values are dropped and three future values are included, the current

value looses its significant and the first two future values are signifi-

cant. The specification that was chosen to be used for Version 2 of the

model is the one with the first three future values included. In the mort-

gage rate equation the current value is always significant, and the speci-

fication that was chosen for Version 2 is the one with the current value

and the first three future values included.9

       In the stock price equation the current and one-period lagged values



91n earlier work (Fair (1979) and Chapter 11 in Fair (l984a)) I have experi-
mented with a version of my model in which there are rational expectations
in the bond and stock markets. This work is different from the present
case in that in the earlier work the term structure and stock price equa-
tions were not estimated. In the case of the term structure equations,
for example, the expectations theory of the term structure of interest
rates was merely imposed on the model along with the assumption that ex-
pectations are rational in the Muth sense. In the present study the equa-
tions that have been used for Version 2 are all estimated equations.

The results of adding future values to this equation are also summarized

in Table 3. The results do not support the use of future values. The

future values have coefficient estimates of the wrong sign.


Interest Rate Reaction Function

       The behavior of the Federal Reserve is explained by an interest rate

reaction function in the model. The left hand side variable is the bill

rate. The right hand side variables include:   I) the rate of inflation,

2) a measure of labor market tightness, 3) the rate of growth of real out-

put, and 4) the lagged value of the rate of growth of the money supply.

The equation is a "leaning against the wind" equation in the sense that

as these four variables increase the Fed is estimated to allow short term

interest rates to increase. For the tests in this paper future values of

the rate of inflation, the measure of labor market tightness, and the rate

of growth of real output were tried in the equation. The results are sum-

marized in Table 4.

real output growth variable gave the best results. For the labor market

tightness variable the t-statistics are lower for the future values, and

for the real growth variable the coefficient estimates are of the wrong

sign for values t+2 and beyond. For the inflation variable the future

values are better than the current value. The best results were obtained

using the first three future values with their coefficients constrained to

be equal (equation (8) in Table 4). This is the specification used for

Version 2 of the model. There is thus some evidence in favor of the more

sophisticated expectational hypothesis for the Fed's expectations of future

 IV. Fiscal-Policy Effects in Two Versions of the Nodel

       The results in Section III provide some support for the hypothesis

that agents use a vector Z of variables in forming their expectations

of future variable values. In particular, the results support this for

households' expectations of future wages and prices (and in one case of

future nonlabor income), for financial market participants' expectations

of future short term interest rates, and for the Fed's expectations of future

inflation rates. The purpose of this section is to examine the sensitivity

of fiscal-policy effects to the use of this expectational hypothesis. Two

versions of the model are considered. Version 1 is the basic version of

the model, where no future values are used as explanatory variables.U



'0In an earlier study (Fair (1984b)) using an earlier data set, I examined
the question whether Fed behavior is influenced by expected future federal
government deficits. A number of future values of the ratio of the feder-
al government deficit to GNP were tried in the interest rate reaction func-
tion, and the best results were obtained using a lead of four quarters.
The equations were estimated by the H2 and HS methods. The coefficient es-
timate of the deficit variable was around 22.0, with a t-statistic of around
2.5 (see Table 1 in Fair (1984b)). With the updated data set used in this
study the best results were still obtained for a lead of four quarters,
but the coefficient estimate is now only 11.6, with a t-statistic of 1.27.
The results in the earlier study were highly tentative, and the current
estimates reinforce this. It is still too early to know how much, if
any, the Fed is influenced by expected future deficits. With respect to
the policy experiments in Fair (l984b), two values of the coefficient of
the deficit variable were used: the estimated coefficient of 21.9 and a
value half this size. Given the current estimate of 11.6, the second ex-
periment seems more indicative of what might be the case. The deficit
variable has not been included in the interest rate reaction function for
the results in this study.

ll noted in Section III, the data base in Fair (1984a) has been updated
through 1984 I for the results in this paper. The estimation period for
Version 1 was 1954 I - 1984 I.
                                                                          26



Version 2 uses the equations in Section III that have an asterisk beside

them. These equations consist of three consumer expenditure equations,

three labor supply equations, two term structure equations, and the inter-

est rate reaction function of the Fed. The remaining equations of Version

2 are the same as those of Version 1.

       Four fiscal-policy experiments have been performed. The first two

are a sustained increase in federal government purchases of goods in real

terms GNP beginning in 1970 I. For experiment 1 the change is unanticipated

and for experiment 2 the change is anticipated as of 1968 I. The second

two experiments are a sustained decrease in the personal income tax rate

beginning in 1970 I. For experiment 3 the change is unanticipated, and

for experiment 4 the change is anticipated as of 1968 I. The results are

presented in Tables 5 and 6. The row 1 results are for Version 1. Since

this version is not forward looking, there is no difference between the

unanticipated and anticipated results. The numbers in row 2 are the unan-

ticipated results for Version 2, and the numbers in row 3 are the antici-

pated results.

       The calculation of the results in Tables 5 and 6 will first be

described, and then the results will he explained. The calculation of the

row 1 results is easy to describe. The actual residuals were first added

to all the estimated equations in the model and were taken to be exogenous.

(The actual residuals are the residuals that were computed at the time of

estimation.) This means that when the model is solved using the actual

values of the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained.

In other words, the ?tbaset values of the endogenous variables for the ex-

periment are merely the actual values. The policy variable was then changed

and the model was solved. The difference between the predicted value of

         The tax rate change was made to be comparable to the change in government spending in Table 5 with respect
                   of funds into the system.  See Fair (1984a), pp. 312-313, for the exact way in which this was done. The units

a variable from this solution and its actual value is the estimate of the

response of the variable to the policy change.

       Version 2 has expected future variables on the right hand side of

some of the estimated equations. Two assumptions have been made for the

solution of this version. The first is that agents use my model in form-

ing their expectations, and the second is that the expectations of the

exogenous variables in the model are equal to the actual values. These

two assumptions imply that agents' expectations of the future values are

equal to the model's predictions of them.

       The numerical solution of Version 2 is more difficult than that of

Version 1 because of the existence of future variables among the explana-

tory variables. What this means is that future predicted values of the

endogenous variables affect current predicted values for Version 2, and

so the standard way of solving models period by period cannot be used.

One must instead iterate over solution paths of the endogenous variables.

The exact method for doing this is presented in Fair and Taylor (1983),

and this is the method that has been used for the row 2 and row 3 results.

Unlike the estimation method in Fair and Taylor (1983), which, as mentioned

in Section 1, is expensive, the solution method is fairly routine.12 A

perfect tracking solution for Version 2 was also obtained before the ex-

periments were performed.

       A final point about Version 2 should be noted before discussing the

results. Although the assumption has been made that the agents' expecta-

these values, the model is not a rational expectations model as this term

is sometimes used. Within the context of the model the expectations are

rational in the Muth sense, but there is nothing in the model, for example,

that precludes there from being disequilibrium in the labor market. The

labor constraint discussed in Section III can be binding on the household

sector. The model is not an equilibrium model even though agents' expec-

tations of some of the variables in the model are rational in the specific

sense of Muth.

          Consider first the results in Table 5. The main feature of these

results is that the values in the three rows are quite close to each other.

The main reasons for this are the following. (1) Although the Version 2

interest rate reaction function has the Fed responding to expected future

inflation rates one, two, and three quarters out rather than in the cur-

rent quarter only, it also has smaller estimated coefficients for the labor

market tightness variable and the real output growth variable.13 The net

effect of this is that the bill rate increases in row 1 are slightly higher

than those in rows 2 and 3. In other words, the Fed leans slightly more

against the wind for Version 1 than it does for Version 2.

          (2) Although the bond rate and mortgage rate predictions for Version

2 are a function of the bill rate predictions one, two, and three quarters

out, the sum of the coefficient estimates across the three quarters is not

that large (see Table 3). The net effect is for the bond rate and mort-

gage rate increases for Version 2 to be about the same as those for Ver-

sion 1.

          (3) Interest rates have an important effect on consumer expenditures

in both versions of the model, but given that the interest rate increases

13                                               .
     Equation (8) in Table 4 has a labor market tightness coefficient of .027
and a real growth coefficient of .052. For the Version 1 equation these
two coefficients are .035 and .065.

are about the same for the two versions, there are no large differences

in effects here. This means that the main differences for consumption,

if any, must come from the different responses to prices and wages. It

can be seen from the results for the GNP deflator and the after-tax nomi-

nal wage, however, that the increases in these two variables are about

the same, especially for the first few quarters after the policy change.

Since households respond primarily to the difference between the two var-

iables, the effects from price and wage changes for this experiment are

small. It is true for nondurable and durable consumption that the increases

are larger (or the decreases smaller) for Version 2 than for Version 1,

but this is primarily due to the fact that interest rates are slightly

lower for Version 2 than for Version 1.

       The slightly larger nondurable and durable consumption predictions

for Version 2 lead to slightly larger increases in real GNP for Version

2. This in turn leads to slightly larger increases in the GNP deflator

for Version 2. The labor supply responses are about the same in the two

versions because of the small changes in the real wage, and so the unem-

ployment decreases are about the same.

       It makes little difference for Version 2 whether or not the policy

change is anticipated. In the anticipated case the bill rate is slightly

higher two quarters before the change because of the expected future in-

flation. The bond rate is slightly higher one quarter before the change

and the mortgage rate is slightly higher one, two, and three quarters be-

fore the change because of the higher future bill rates. These higher

interest rates lead to GNP being slightly lower before the change. This

in turn leads to the GNP deflator being slightly lower and the unemployment

rate being slightly higher. The changes before the policy changes are,
                                                                      32




however, quite small.

       Consider now the results in Table 6. When the personal income tax

rate is decreased, this has a direct positive effect on the after-tax nomi-

nal wage. This is thus one of the best experiments for seeing the differ-

ences between the two versions of the model because one of the main dif-

ferences between them is the households' response to after-tax real wage

changes. Comparing the increases in the GNP deflator in Table 6 with those

in the after-tax nominal wage, it can be seen that the present experiment

corresponds to a large increase in the after—tax real wage. The initial

increases for consumer expenditures are larger for Version 2 because of

the positive households response to the future real wage increases. This

leads to higher initial increases in GNP for Version 2. The interest rate

differences are again small for this experiment, and the main differences

in effects come from the real wage effects. In this experiment there is

also more of a difference between the unanticipated and anticipated results

for Version 2. There is more initial expansion for the anticipated results

because of the positive response of the households to the future wage in-

creases.

       Labor supply in both versions of the model responds positively to

real wage increases. This, other things being equal, has a positive effect

on the unemployment rate. For the experiment in Table 6 the positive effect

dominates in that the unemployment rate changes are positive rather than

negative in all three cases. The unemployment rate results are quite close

between Versions 1 and 2. The positive real wage response is larger for

Version 2, but Version 2 also has more output response, which has a nega-

tive effect on the unemployment rate. The net effect is that the changes

in the unemployment rate are about the same for the two versions.

V.   Conclusion

       This study has demonstrated that it is possible with the limited

information estimation techniques discussed in Section II and the solution

method applied in Section IV to use a more sophisticated expectational

hypothesis than has traditionally been done in the specification of large-

scale macroeconometric models. Although this is now possible, the results

in this paper to some extent leave open the question whether it is neces-

sary. The evidence in favor of the more sophisticated expectational hy-

pothesis is strongest for households' response to wages and prices in their

consumption and labor supply decisions. No evidence in favor of the hypoth-

esis for firms could be found. The term structure results are about the

same whether lags or future values are used. There is some evidence that

the Fed responds to future inflation rates. It is clear that a stronger

set of results would need to be found before one could put much weight on

the hypothesis.

       The results in Section IV are interesting in that they show that

the policy responses in a model like mine are not necessarily sensitive

to the use of the more sophisticated expectational hypothesis. The results

in Table 5 are very close. The differences are larger in Table 6, and it

is clear for this policy change that it makes a difference which version

of the model one believes and whether or not one assumes that the
                                                                    policy
change is anticipated.
