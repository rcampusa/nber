         THE INVISIBLE HAND AND MODERN WELFARE ECONOMICS


                            ABSTRACT

     This paper reviews and puts into perspective recent work
reassessing the first and second Fundamental Theorems of Welfare
Economics. It assesses the implications of the

Greenwald-Stiglitz fheorem establishing the (constrained) Pareto
inefficiency of market economies with imperfect information and
incomplete markets as well as recent work on endogenous
technological change. The information theoretic limitations to
the Second Fundamental Theorem are also discussed, including the

inability to separate out issues of equity and efficiency. The
final sections of the paper consider the consequences of these
problems for economic organization, economic policy, and the role
of ideology in the belief in the Invisible Hand.

              The Invisible Hand and Modern Welfare Economics1

                               J. E. Stiglitz

     Somewhat more than two centuries ago, Adam Smith delivered at this

University a set of lectures, later written down   in   his monumental work, The

Wealth of Nations, which perhaps had more influence on the development of

our discipline than any other work in the history of the subject. And among

the ideas presented there, perhaps none has held such sway, not only over

professional economics, but also over all those who concerned about how best

to organize society to promote the General Welfare than his concept of the

invisible hand: this, in spite of the fact that he explicitly used the term

only once in The Wealth of Nations.

     Smith argued not only that individuals were led in the pursuit of their

self interest by an invisible hand to pursue the Nation's interest, but

also that this pursuit of self interest was a far more reliable way to

ensure that the Public Interest would be served than any alternative- -surely

better than relying on some government leader, as well-intentioned as that

leader might be.

     Much of the subsequent history of our discipline has been a search to

understand the sense and conditions under which Smith's essential insights

are valid. His perspective has provided the intellectual basis for a theory

of economic organization- -competitive markets provide an efficient way of

organizing economic activity- -and economic policy- - to ensure that efficiency

George Stigler Is quoted (by A. Skinner, 1976) as having said, on the

occasion of the celebrations marking the two hundredth anniversary of The

Wealth of Nations, that Smith is alive and well and living in Chicago.

Whether Smith really would be as happy at Chicago as he would be, at say,

Stanford or MIT need not detain us here.       He certainly recognized the

existence of what today we would clearly describe as important classes of

market failures.2

     The Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics are generally viewed as

the culmination of this search for a precise interpretation of what I shall

refer to as the Smithian view. (The form in which these theorems are stated

today is generally attributed to Kenneth Arrow (1951) and Gerard Debreu,

1959.)   The first theorem states that (under certain conditions) the

competitive economy is always Pareto efficient3; the second theorem says

that every Pareto efficient allocation can be attained through the price




     2lndeed, in that single passage in The Wealth of Nations in which he
uses the term invisible hand, he invokes the notions of risk aversion and
(implicitly) imperfect risk markets to explain why capital was imperfectly
mobile across national boundaries. And for him, this market imperfection
was a good thing, for it ensured that the savings of the nation, its
capital, would be used to increase the wealth of the nation, rather than the
wealth of some other nation. This passage seems to suggest that Smith did
not have in mind a notion of a perfect market.
     If he had been born a little later, he might have used evolutionary
ideas to explain how it was that economic and social institutions evolved
which had the property that the common good was attained as a result of
individuals pursuing their own self interest.    As it was, the general
principle behind the invisible hand was left rather vague; the numerous
instances in which it manifested itself (although without using the term)
made it clear that there was some general force or principle at work.

     3That is, no one can be made better off without making someone else
worse off.

system.     A11(!) the government needs to do is engage in some initial lump

sum transfers (taxes and subsidies).4

     The conditions under which the First Theorem are true turn out to have

important economic interpretations.            Interpreting those conditions and

identifying policies by which Pareto efficiency can be restored provides the

basis of what has come to be called the Market Failure approach to Modern

Welfare Economics.      Early discussions of market failure (e.g. F. Bator,

1958) focused on externalities, natural monopolies, and public goods.        But

the conventional wisdom held that even when such market failures arose,

only limited government intervention was needed:         for instance, fines for

pollution, congestion tolls for the externalities associated with crowding.

Only in the case of pure public goods did government have to be actively

involved, if not in producing the goods, at least in financing them (there

remained a debate about the advantages of government versus private
production.).5 6     Later   discussions (reflected in this essay) focused on



     4Lump sum transfers are transfers, the magnitude of which do not depend
at all on variables which cannot be altered by the individual.           When
transfers depend on variables which can be altered, the individual has an
incentive to distort his behavior, in order to increase the magnitude of his
subsidy or reduce the magnitude of his tax.

     5There were, to be sure, other market failures, where price
interventions did not seem to work so well: zoning might be required to
deal with the externalities associated with urban living, though zoning,
like other forms of government intervention, had its problems as well.
     6
          The most recent manifestation of this discussion is the debate over
privatization.  While there is a large literature discussing when there
should be public provision of a good, there is very little analytic
discussion of public production.  See, for instance, Vickers and Yarrow
[1988) and the Summer 1987 issue of the Journal of Policy Analysis and
Management, in particular, the article by Sappington and Stiglitz, proving
what they call the Fundamental Theorem of Privatization.

problems of incomplete markets, imperfect information, and the pervasiveness

of imperfect competition.

     Of course,    the distribution of income which emerged from the
competitive market may not be to a society's liking7. And this is where the

second Welfare Theorem enters.       It says that every Pareto efficient

allocation of resources can be attained by means of the market. All the

government needs to do is to engage in some initial redistributions, and

then leave the rest to the market process.       It says, for instance, that

capitalism cannot be criticized on the grounds that it results in the

accumulation of too much wealth in the hands of too few individuals. If you

don't like that particular outcome, simply impose redistributive taxes. The

government does not have to take over firms; it does not have to nationalize

the basic industries.

     The Second Fundamental Theorem of welfare economics has fundamental

implications for how we think about economic organization. It says that we

can separate out issues of economic efficiency from issues of equity.

Economists need not concern themselves with value judgments; whatever the

government's distributive objectives, it implements these through initial




     71n this part of my discussion, I am being deliberately vague in the
use of terms like, "society's liking" or "common welfare" or "public
interest."  Society does not have preferences; individuals do. As Arrow
[1951] has emphasized, there must be some way of going from individuals'
preferences to statements concerning society's, some way of aggregation.
Arrow showed that there was no such way which satisfied a certain minimal
set of properties which one would like a social welfare function to satisfy.

     At a somewhat looser level, there is still a broad social consensus
about some attributes of society which are desirable- -a consensus to which,
admittedly, not everyone will subscribe.     For instance, were society to
leave 50 % of its citizens unemployed, there would be a view that "something
was wrong."

itself.




     The past quarter century has seen a closer examination of Adam Smith's

invisible hand.   The theoretical research has taken two different strands

(reflecting two ideological strands within the profession, a point to which

I shall return later.)   The first has attempted to show that the economy is

Pareto efficient under much more general conditions than those originally

used by Arrow and Debreu. The second has attempted to show that there were

assumptions in Arrow and Debreu's analysis which, while perhaps mentioned,

did not receive the attention they deserved.     These assumptions make the

Theorems of limited relevance to modern industrial economies. In this view,

Adam Smith's invisible hand may be invisible because, like the Emperor's new

clothes, it simply isn't there; or if it is there, it is too palsied to be

relied upon.



                                  PART I.

                  Four Objections to The Invisible Hand:

                  Pareto Inefficiency of Market Economies



     The Welfare Theorems are just that: theorems, the conclusions of which

follow inevitably from the assumptions.      The research of the last two

decades has not detected any major flaws of logic. The Theorems stand, as I

have said, as one of the triumphs of modern mathematical economics.      The

question is not the logical status of these propositions, but their

empirical relevance, the inferences which we make concerning how society


                                        5
should be organized and about the design of economic policy. These are, to

be sure, matters of judgment.

     The earlier analyses of market failures basically agreed with the

underlying conception of the market economy that was reflected in the

assumptions of the Welfare Theorems. I am not so convinced.8

     Smith was undoubtedly right that individuals' pursuits of their private

interests lead to social consequences which may be quite different from

those they intended. But whether it leads to (Pareto) efficient outcomes is

a far different manner.



                                A. Unemployment 10



     The persistence and pervasiveness across countries of periodic episodes

of high industrial unemployment should at least Induce skepticism concerning

the Smithian vision. Surely, the economy can do better than the widespread

misery which afflicted the major industries economies in the Great

Depression. Are Hoovervilles and unemployment queues manifestations of the

Invisible Hand? Can't we do better than that!




     81 touch on several aspects of this below. See also Stiglitz (1989a).

       In many discussions of market failure, unemployment is not treated as
a market failure in its own right, but rather as a consequence of some other
market failure (e.g. imperfect information or incomplete markets).

     10This section draws heavily on my joint work with Bruce Greenwald, to
whom I am greatly indebted, in particular, Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986 and
1988).

                                          6
Two Schools of Economics.

     The importance attached to this phenomena of unemployment has lead to

two distinct views of capitalism.      One view, tracing its origins to Smith,

has stressed the efficiency properties of capitalism.        Unemployment was

viewed as but a temporary aberration from a norm of a well functioning

economy.      It has emphasized its virtues, reflected in the Fundamental

Theorem of Welfare Economics. It has provided the intellectual foundations

for the ideological commitment to market economies.

     The second strand, which can perhaps be traced by to Maithus, earned

our discipline the name of the dismal science.          It was concerned with

unemployment which seemed endemic in capitalist economies.''

     Little love was lost between the practitioners of these two sub-

disciplines, who had such different conceptions of how capitalism

functioned.     They     hurled epithets at each other; the micro-economists,

adopting the Smithian view, charged the macro-economists, the latter day

descendants of Maithus, with that most base of all academic crimes, ad

hocery (and sometimes, even worse, inconsistency.) The other side responded

in kind- - irrelevance    was the charge which perhaps stuck with greatest

force.

     Lest students be confused by the seeming schizophrenia within the

profession, we offered different courses, taught by different faculty, on

macro-economics and on micro-economics.        The students' usual ability to

compartmentalize their learning into neat categories, with little spillovers

from one course to another, had a last found a use!



     ''Malthus was also concerned with problems of over population, which
will not detain us.

                                           7
     The two schools of thought are reflected in two styles of papers

commonly found in the literature. Each begins, after a brief introduction,

by writing dowii a simple model; one then proceeds to show chat the market

allocation is Pareto efficient, even though the standard Arrow Debreu

assumptions do not hold; the others show that the economy is not Pareto

efficient, even though all but one of the Arrow Debreu assumptions are

valid, and the one assumption which is altered is one which is not very

plausible.



The Neoclassical Synthesis

     Adam Smith was right about the power of self interest and the profit

motive. Publishers saw an incentive in packing these two disparate subjects

between hard covers. One of Paul Samuelson's greatest strokes of genius was

the invention of the Neoclassical Synthesis, which argued that once the

Keynesian problems of unemployment were dealt with, the neoclassical world

reigned supreme.   This proposition was put forward with such clarity and

such conviction that it became virtually universally subscribed to within

the profession. But let us be quite clear about the epistemological basis

of the Neoclassical Synthesis.       It is not a deductive proposition:

Samuelson did not formulate a general theory which explained unemployment,

and from which it followed that the elimination of unemployment would lead

to Pareto efficiency. He did not have an explanation of wage rigidities or

the other factors that might lead to Keynesian unemployment.            The

neoclassical synthesis was put forward as a dogma, an article of faith. It

was believed because we wanted to believe it.




                                        8
     We wanted to believe It for two reasons. First, it meant that we did

not have to throw out the accuiulated wisdom concerning how markets lead to

resource allocations, the Insights into economics which a century and a half

of social thinkers had brought to the subject.

     And most of us also believed in the market system: the record based on

attempts at alternatives has hardly made these alternatives inviting.

     But on the face of it, it was an incredible hypothesis.      To give an

analogy:   it would be like suggesting that individuals who are not in the

hospital with a fever of 105 degrees must be in perfect health.         We have

learned from medicine that the study of pathology, of how the system behaves

when all is not well, provides us with many insights into how the human

system functions normally.     So too, we should learn from the economic

pathologies- - the less developed economies in which more than three fourths

of humanity lives and the periodic episodes of unemployment which plague the

more developed countries- -something about the functioning of capitalism.

     To put it another way, it seems far more plausible to me that the

economy is always slightly inefficient:     it is only the extreme cases of

inefficiency which can easily be detected.        There is other evidence

corroborating this view. Most of us are not in a position to judge whether

General Motors is efficient; we simply do not know the technology of car

production. We might think that we can do a better job than Roger Smith12,

but he would tell us that we are not fully aware of the difficulties of the

job. The one aspect of technology which is relatively publicly available is

the 'tax technology"- -the set of rules which determine the liabilities which

individuals and firms must pay.      These are summarized in a scant few

volumes, with a few more volumes of court interpretations. With this data

we cannot test the much more general principle with which Smith was

concerned, with whether the rational pursuit of self interest would lead to

Pareto efficiency; but we can test the more limited hypothesis of whether

market forces lead firms to behave in a (privately) efficient way.          The

resounding evidence is negative- -if they learn, they learn with remarkable

slowness. (See Stiglitz, 1973a, l982b, 1983, for a discussion of these tax

"paradoxes."13)



A Digression on Methodology

        The appropriateness of assumptions and the relevance of models to "real

world" situations is inevitably a matter of debate. Models are not perfect

reflections of reality. And it is not even clear how we measure the extent

to which they depart. Closeness of fit may be one test- -but in time series

data,        R2   are typically high for almost any specification.        Naive

extrapolation models do almost as well- -sometimes better- - than          more

sophisticated models which are allegedly theoretically well specified.

Today, indeed, the soundness of the theory behind the empirical testing is

supposed to be an important element in persuading us concerning the

        13
         The literature on tax paradoxes shows that firms and individuals
could take actions which reduce their tax liabilities- -and had no further
consequences.   The most longstanding of these paradoxes is the dividend
paradox:    firms could, by buying back their shares rather than issuing
dividends, substantially reduce the cumulative amount of corporate plus
individual income taxes paid on income earned within corporations. Other
paradoxes include the choice of LIFO versus FIFO accounting, the failure to
use accelerated depreciation, and the use of stock options as part of the
compensation schemes for senior management.
     It is difficult to distinguish among alternative explanations of these
paradoxes:   (a)  managers are irrational and/or do not take actions which
maximize the welfare of their shareholders; (b) managers are rational, but
they believe shareholders are irrational.

                                           10
plausibility of the results. That is why it is the fashion to begin applied

econometric papers with detailed discussions of theory. Unfortunately, much

of the theory is hardly worthy of the name- -and I am not referring here to

mathematical niceties which may have been slipped over.            Consider the

neoclassical investment theory.'4 Modiglianl. and Miller [1958) purported to

show that financial policy was irrelevant.              Thus,   the theoretical

specification precluded including the kinds of cash flow and balance sheet

variables that earlier studies (such as Meyer and Kuh, 1957) had established

to be relevant. Yet that theory was indeed a special, and I would argue,

largely irrelevant theory (as useful as it was for the theoretical

development of the discipline):      it required no bankruptcy, no information

asymmetries, no transactions costs, and no differential taxation of

dividends and interests, all assumptions which were far from the mark, and

whose implications drastically changed the theory.          Financial variables

should have been included in the analysis.'6



     In the end, certain critical experiments are likely to be more

information than a general goodness of fit test.        In the contest between

Newtonian mechanics and Einstein's relativity theory, no one proposed that

     14
          See,   e.g. Jorgenson (1968) or Hall and Jorgenson (1969).

     1it is worth noting that more recent studies, such as those by Hubbard
and his co-authors, reconfirm the importance of balance sheet and cash flow
variables.

     16Another example are those studies of aggregate consumer behavior
which impose restrictions, derived from the analysis of utility maximization
behavior of single individuals. Imposing the restriction of the symmetry of
the Slutsky terms makes the empirical study theoretically sound- -though
aggregate demand curves need not satisfy the Slutsky relationship (or the
other restrictions which are derived from individual behavior)  See, e.g.
Mantel (1974)

                                          11
the two should be compared on the basis of how well they did on every day

data.     Newtonian mechanics would have done at least as well as relativity.

But there were critical experiments (in particular, the solar eclipse

experiment of March 29, 1919 done by the Royal Astronomical Society of

England in Northern Brazil):       a predication of relativity theory, which

distinguished it from the Newtonian mechanics.



Unemployment as the Critical Test of the Invisible Hand

        The pervasiveness and persistence of unemployment is, in my mind, the

most telling "critical experiment" which should lead to the rejection of the

basic competitive equilibrium model which (depending on how you view it)

either predicts or assumes full employment.

        Economists, like other individuals, have developed a variety of ways of

responding to facts with which they do not like to deal.'7 It is sometimes

suggested, for instance, that the data may not really mean what they say.

(Of course they don't, but while we may not be sure whether there was 20 or

22% or 30% unemployment in the industrial sector in 1933, we know it was

large )

        The response which I find most peculiar is somewhat akin to Senator

Aitken's response to how to deal with the unpleasantries facing the US as a

result of the Vietnam war: how to withdraw with honor. His suggestion was

that we should simply declare that we had won, and go home. So, too, those

who want to believe in the Smithian vision:       they simply declare that the


        '7This general phenomenon is sometimes called cognitive dissonance, a
characteristic of human behavior which, with few exceptions, modern
economics has systematically ignored, in spite of the strong evidence of
its importance in the psychological literature, for an important exception,
see Akerlof and Dickens.

                                          12
unemployed are all voluntarily unemployed. We take it as a dogma within the

profession that we do not ask how tastes are formed:      they are treated as

exogenous. Evidently, there are periodic shifts in the demand for leisure,

no more explicable than other periodic shifts in tastes: why do consumers

like yogurt and pizza today, goods for which there was little taste but

fifty years ago.    And who are we to question then how they spend their

leisure: if it happens to be in job queues, why should we question that any

more than we question how many hours they spend watching TV? 18

     As you can tell, I am not sympathetic with this view.          Indeed, the

macroeconomic evidence against the competitive paradigm is, by now,

overwhelming.   (See, for instance, Hall, 1988) and Greenwald and Stiglitz,

l988b.)   It touches not only on the presence of unemployment, but also on

movements in real wages, employment, output, etc.

     I have been troubled- -and puzzled- -by the popularity of those macro-

economic schools (new classical and real business cycle theory) which have

been based on the competitive paradigm, and the corollary propositions that

there is no unemployment, extreme views which, while restoring the

generality of the Invisible Hand, Adam Smith, I am sure, would have looked

upon with horror.   I ask myself, would they view the world this way had they

or their parents experienced a long episode of unemployment?

     A part of the popularity of these views is a result of the ability of

these models to reconcile macro-economics and micro-economics.       I referred

earlier to the schism in economics between the two branches of economics,

and the associated two views of capitalism.         The desire to resolve the


    '8By the same token, other indicators of distress, such as suicide
rates, which increase in recessions and depressions, would be taken as

intellectual tension was strong. We have already commented on the failure

of the "neoclassical synthesis" to do so.      This left two alternatives:

making macro- like micro- ; or making micro- like macro.

     The former approach had one strong advantage.         Through the work of

Arrow and Debreu and a host of other neo-classical economists, micro-

economics had been formulated on a rigorous basis.         (Never mind that it

produced few testable propositions, or that the testable propositions which

it offered were rejected!'9) It had just the right amount of mathematical

difficulty and sophistication: easy enough to be mastered by a hard working

student, difficult enough to present a challenge.

     But the curious aspect of this intellectual episode is that these

versions of the neo-classical model became adapted to macro-economics just

as micro-economists were coming to look upon them with suspicion, as they

realized that slight changes in its assumptions of perfect and costless

information and complete markets dramatically altered the conclusions.20

     Indeed, among the motivations for these reformulations of micro-

economics was the development of theories which could be made consistent

with macro-economic evidence.

     At the same time, micro-theorists came to realize that the standard

competitive model provided relatively few restrictions on market demand

(e.g. consumption, savings, and labor supply) functions. Any set of excess

demand functions satisfying Walras' Law could be shown to be consistent with

rational utility maximizing individuals, given particular preferences and

                                        14
endowments.2'     Thus, macro-economists who took the methodological position

that postulated aggregative behavior be derived from rational utility

maximizing behavior were not really insisting on rationality, but on much

stronger--and generally unacceptable-- hypotheses, such as that it should be

derived     from rational     utility maximizing behavior of        a   single,

representative individual.      Indeed, many adherents of these views have put

so much stress on the ability to calculate the derived savings/consumption

functions that they have been willing to postulate utility functions- -such

as those with constant absolute risk aversion- - for     which there is strong

empirical evidence that they provide a bad description of the behavior of

most individuals 22



            B. Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets

        If, as I have argued, the persistence and pervasiveness of periodic

episodes of unemployment provides the critical test of the conclusions of

the standard competitive paradigm, we need to identify what are the precise

properties of the standard competitive model which are wrong. Which of the

assumptions have to be dropped to yield the macro-economic phenomena

described in previous paragraphs? These remain unresolved questions.        But

among the suggestions that look promising are those which lay at least part


        21See, e.g. Debreu (1973), Mantel (1974), or Sonnenschein (1973).

        22Thus, the constant absolute utility function (the exponential utility
function) predicts that all individuals will hold the same portfolio of
risky assets, and that the wealth elasticity of demand for risky assets is
zero.      The fact that the utility function has other predictions- -that
consumption increases linearly with wealth- -which are not so easy to reject
does not make the utility function any more persuasive. A theory must be
evaluated in terms of all of its (verifiable) predictions. A theory based
on constant absolute risk aversion utility functions is simply a non-starter.

of the blame at the feet of imperfect and costly information and incomplete

risk and futures markets.

     Much work in the past fifteen years has been concerned with examining

more precisely how imperfect information and incomplete markets affect the

standard micro-economic results.        We now know that they alter them in

fundamental ways23; not only may they provide part of the explanation for

unemployment, but they provide much of the explanation for many of the

institutions we see in our society, institutions which otherwise are hard to

explain (e.g. sharecropping, credit rationing, equity rationing, etc.).

Standard results, such as the Law of the Single Price, do not hold. They

explain why the simple model of price-governed economic behavior provides art

inadequate description of market economies. Reputations and contracts play

an equally important role, one not captured by the Arrow-Debreu model (see

Stiglitz, 1989b) 24

    Most important for our purposes is the result that in general. when

risk markets are incomplete and information is imperfect, markets are not

constrained Pareto optimal: the Invisible Hand does not work. There exist

market interventions, which respect the limitations on information and risk

distribution opportunities, which can make everyone better off.    (Greenwald

and Stiglitz, 1986, 1988a)25 26 27 28


     235ee Stiglitz (1985) for a description of how the central standard
results of competitive analysis are altered.

     24The failure to recognize this provides part of the explanation for
the failure of market socialism.

     25There are other reasons that imperfect information is likely to lead
to the invisible hand not being satisfied:   imperfect information leads to
imperfect competition (Scitovsky (1945, 1950), Diamond (1971a,b), Arrow
(1958), Salop (1979), Stiglitz (1989b)).    Perfect competition is an
essential assumption in the standard proofs of the Fundamental Theorems of

                                          16
      Of course, imperfect information is pervasive in the economy. We know

that different individuals differ in their abilities, but we cannot tell

perfectly who is the more productive.     We know that different investment

opportunities will yield different returns, but we cannot be sure which will

yield the highest.    We know the some individuals are more accident prone

than others, but we cannot tell for sure who is the most accident prone. We

know that default probabilities differ among borrowers, but we cannot be

sure about the default probability of any particular individual.

      Risk markets are far from complete. Many of the important risks which

we face are uninsurable.

      Given the pervasiveness of imperfect information and incomplete

markets, it would seem that the model that Greenwald and Stiglitz describe- -

in   which the invisible hand is, at best palsied--is far more relevant than


Welfare Economics. See below for more on imperfect competition.

      I focus my discussion here on the first of the Fundamental Theorems
of Welfare Economics.  I shall come shortly to a discussion of the Second
Fundamental Theorem. For now, we simply note that an essential assumption
in the standard proofs of the second theorem is the convexity of the
relevant preferences and technologies. Those convexity assumptions are not,
in general, satisfied with imperfect information.   See Arnott and Stiglitz
(1988) and Radner and Stiglitz (1984) and below.

     27Arnott and Stiglitz (1989) have provided a general taxonomy of the
market failures associated with moral hazard, as well as an analysis of the
use of Pigouvian corrective taxes in this context (Arnott and Stiglitz,
1986). They have illustrated the pervasiveness of these market failures by
examining the inefficiency of implicit labor contracts (Arnott and Stiglitz,
1985).

     26Since Stiglitz's (1972, 1982a) papers showing that stock market
equilibrium will, in general, be constrained Pareto efficient, there has
developed a vast literature on this subject.            See, for instance,
Ceanakoplos, et.al., forthcoming.
     For an application to labor markets- -showing that the implicit contract
between workers and their employers will not,in general, result in an
efficient risk distribution (see Newbery and Stiglitz, 1987).


                                         17
the model which Arrow and Debreu described, in which the invisible hand

works perfectly.      From this perspective, Arrow and Debreu's great

achievement was not to prove a general result- -it is a very special model

indeed.   But rather, it was to find those special and limiting conditions

under which the Invisible Hand theorems hold.      Their contribution can be

seen as a negative contribution--as showing how limited Adam Smith's

original conjecture was.

     Let me try to describe the intuition behind our result, perhaps seen

most clearly in the case of an adverse selection model, like Akerlof's

Lemons model (1970), applied here to the labor market (Greenwald, 1986).

Individuals have different qualities of labor; the market cannot distinguish

who is good.   Firms pay a wage corresponding to the average productivity;

and the average productivity is a function of the wage.      As the wage or

price of a good which is a complement or substitute to leisure changes,

individuals change their labor supply; this has no direct welfare effect,

because of the envelope theorem:   at the old wages and prices, individuals

were choosing their labor supply to maximize their utility.     As the wage

increases, firms are worse off, consumers are better off, but this is simply

a transfer effect: under the hypothesis of market clearing, the gains of

one are equal to the losses of the other.29 But an increase in the price,

say, of alcohol has a direct externality effect. Assume that alcohol leads

lower ability individuals not to show up for work as much, so that the

quality mix of job applicants improves.30 This improvement in the quality


     291n Creenwald and Stiglitz (l988b) we show how the analysis can be
extended to the case where markets do not clear.

     30We assume that neither the alcohol consumption, nor the absenteeism
which is a consequence, can be observed by employers.

                                        18
mix acts as an externality; at any wage, employers gain. And it is easy to

show that the gain to employers is sufficiently great that, were an output

or profits tax imposed on them, it would more than pay for the subsidy

required to lower the price of alcohol.



Criticisms of the Greenwald-Stiglitz Theorem

     There have been two responses to this theorem by those who want to

retain their faith in the invisible hand. The first recognizes the logical

validity of the conclusions, but questions the empirical significance. How

do we know that slight deviations from perfect information lead to any more

than a slight deviation from Pareto optimality?

     In a sense, we cannot be sure- -but neither can we be sure that slight

deviations do not cause large deviations from market efficiency.         (Slight

deviations in some of the informational assumptions have been shown to lead

to marked deviations in the qualitative properties of equilibrium; epsilon

search costs may lead to monopoly prices (Diamond, 1971a,b), price

rigidities (Stiglitz, 1987c), price dispersion (Salop and Stiglitz, 1977) or

non-existence of equilibrium (Salop and Stiglitz, 1982).31

     Nor is there any evidence that the market has only a slight amount of

imperfect information, or that risk markets are virtually complete.         What

the Creenwald Stiglitz theorem has done has been to remove the long standing

presumption that markets are efficient, except for those well defined market

failures--externalities, public goods, etc. --which we dealt with earlier.

The Creenwald-Stiglitz conception of the market economy is fundamentally

different from that of Arrow and Debreu:       the latter is seen as a limiting,


     31For a survey, see Stiglitz (1989b).

                                          19
but uninteresting case of the former.         In the Creenwald-Stiglitz view,

market failures, rather than appearing as isolated and easily correctable by

government intervention, appear to be all-pervasive.        Whether, and how,

governments should intervene to correct these market failures is a question

to which I turn later in this lecture.

     The second line of defense of the invisible hand theorem has been to

revert to the ideological position that "anything the government can do, the

private sector can do at least as well." Thus, if we obtain a result that

the government can institute a Pareto improvement, we must have- -somehow- -

introduced   an artificial distinction between the information or transactions

costs facing the public and private sectors. We have, so to speak, compared

apples and oranges, or perhaps more aptly, caviar and shad roe.       We have
made an irrelevant comparison.     This point is reinforced by the results of

Prescott and Townsend (1984), who establish that the market economy with

adverse selection or moral hazard is Pareto efficient. Never mind that they

have failed to show what is wrong with the simple examples which we have

constructed which show precisely how the government can improve welfare.

They have established a general theorem, of which ours must(!) be a subcase.

     In our work analyzing the efficiency of market economies, we have been

particularly attentive to this criticism.32        We have shown that this
criticism is simply not valid. We have shown, for instance, how governments

can, in the presence of imperfect risk markets, impose taxes on observable


    32This is true not only of my work with Bruce Creenwald, but also of my
work with David Newbery, analyzing the efficiency of economies with
imperfect risk markets (1981, 1985) (see also Stiglitz, 1982a), with Richard
Arnott, analyzing the inefficiency of markets with moral hazard (1986,
1989), with Carl Shapiro, analyzing the inefficiency of markets with
reputation effects (1984), and with Andrew Weiss, analyzing the inefficiency
of markets with credit rationing (1981).

                                         20
variables     (like the level of investment), which result in Pareto

improvements.33       Similarly, Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986) and Arnott and

Stiglitz (1986) observe that U the private sector could observe the level

of consumption of each good and service35 and the total level of purchases

of insurance for each contingency by each individual, then, even though

effort were unobservable, the market would be Pareto efficient; it would

make insurance premia depend on these variables. But they argue that these

variables are not realistically observable. On the other hand, the levels

of aggregate sales of various commodities (such as cigarettes) may be

observable.      (Essentially, sales on secondary markets are unobservable.)

The government is in a unique position to impose taxes and subsidies on

total sales.      A private insurance firm might try to insist that those who

purchase insurance from it also purchase cigarettes from it, at a higher


           Thus, Newbery and Stiglitz (1985), in their model with no equity
markets, show that Pareto improvements can be obtained even if there cannot
be taxes and subsidies imposed on outputs. Note that unobservability (or
verifiability) of outputs is only one of the reasons for the failure of
equity markets to function.   Moral hazard and adverse selection provide
alternative explanations (see, e.g. Myers and Majluf [1984] or Greenwald,
Stiglitz, and Weiss (1984]).

           Grossman and Grossman and Hart attempted to provide an alternative
definition of efficiency, "social Nash Optimality" or "SNOP". Market
economies, they showed, had the property of SNOP. This definition had the
property that in the first period, the government took the level of
interpersonal transfers in each state of nature from one individual to
another as given, unaffected by government actions.    But tax/subsidy
policies in the first period could affect relative prices in the second (or
later) period(s), and thus affect the level of transfers.       Hence, SNOP
provided an inaccurate description of the constraints facing the government
in market economies.   There is, by now, a consensus that SNOP does not
constitute a re-establishment of the Invisible Hand theorem for incomplete
markets.       Indeed, it can be viewed as showing the strong kinds of
constraints that the government would have had to have faced for the market
economy to have been (constrained) Pareto efficient.

     35Total labor supply, total borrowings and savings, etc. all have to be
observable. See also Arnott and Stiglitz (1986).

                                         21
than market price (as it tries to simulate the effect of a government

imposed cigarette tax). But it would find it difficult to stop individuals

from buying cigarettes from others.     And even if all insurance companies

agreed on the level of "tax' to impose on cigarette consumption, and they

took over the cigarette industry, they could not stop the entry of a new

cigarette firm.       The government has the power to prevent entry and to

enforce taxes.36       Prescott and Townsend, in their discussion of moral

hazard, in effect focus on the case in which quantities purchased were

observable, a case for which we had already established the optimality of

market allocations.

     Thus, there are some circumstances- -beyond the Arrow Debreu model- -in

which the market economy is constrained Pareto efficient.     By the time we

published our 1986 paper, most of these special cases had been discovered.

Unfortunately, in many cases, they represent the most easy cases to analyze.

Thus, the lack of risk markets presents no problem if (i) there is only one

commodity, so commodity taxation cannot affect relative prices (the case

studied by Diamond (1967) in his classic paper37; or (ii) there is no need

for a complete set of risk markets, for instance because all individuals are

identical (in which case there is no role for markets to transfer risks),

the case focused on by macro-economists using representative agent models;

or (iii) because individuals are risk neutral, in which case risk is


     36 The government's powers are, of course, limited. If there were   not
significant economies of scale in cigarette production, it could not     stop
bootlegging in cigarettes; the threat of black markets puts a limit on   the
magnitude of the taxes that can be imposed. But evidently, these taxes   can
be quite high without significant black market activity developing.

        Diamond made some other essential assumptions, such as no bankruptcy
and multiplicative risk.


                                        22
irrelevant. The point of our paper was to show precisely how special those

cases were.

     The government has powers that are different from those of the private

sector (Stiglitz, 1989c). Our paper showed that there were a large variety

of circumstances in which those powers could be used to achieve a Pareto

improvement. Whether government would, or could, use those powers in this

way is a question to which I return in the concluding section of this

lecture.




                          C. Technological Change



     An objection to the invisible hand theorem that is closely related to

that presented in the previous section (incomplete markets and imperfect

information) is that the model on which it is based assumes a fixed

technology (or more accurately, changes in technology are exogenously

determined.)38   Technological change--the result of deliberate attempts by

firms to develop new products andto reduce costs of production-- is one of

the hallmarks, if not the hallmark of the twentieth century.              Can one

really believe that one has described well modern industrial countries

without taking into account technological competition?

     The processes by which technology is improved- -   learning   and R & D- -can

be viewed as a special form of information acquisition, and, as in our

earlier analysis of information, the fundamental theorems of welfare

economics- - the modern representations of the Invisible Hand- -do not apply.



     38The same applies to information:  the Arrow Debreu model does not
assume perfect information, only that beliefs do not change endogenously
within the model.

                                         23
      Technological change (whether it occurs as a result of explicit

expenditures on R & D or as a result of learning by doing) gives rise to

economies of scale.    R & D expenditures are fixed, sunk costs. Industries

where R & D is important will naturally, then, be imperfectly competitive.

(Stiglitz, 1987a, 1988a).

      This is not a new insight:     Schuinpeter argued this point forcefully

several decades ago.        But both Schumpeter and Smith might have been

concerned with my raising questions concerning the invisible hand results:

though neither used the notion of Pareto Efficiency, both thought that the

spur to innovation was one of the main virtues of market competition.

      They may have been right. Yet it is a view of competition which is not

at all embraced by the Arrow-Debreu model of competitive market economies,

and it is not embraced by the Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics,

which has been taken to be the modern embodiment of Smith's conception of

the invisible hand.

      While Smith and Schumpeter may have been right in spirit (a point which

we have emphasized, for instance, in Dasgupta and Stiglitz, 1980), they were

clearly not correct in detail. Depending on the precise assumptions, patent

races can result in excessive expenditures on R & D (Dasgupta and Stiglitz,

1980) or insufficient expenditures (Stiglitz, l988a, Dasgupta and Stiglitz,

1988. )39



      39The use of the patent system as an institution for providing rewards
for innovative activity is not just a happenstance.          It has certain
efficiency properties, given the limitations on information. It avoids the
necessity of screening applicants for government grants:    those who have
confidence in their ability to do research better than others (and can
convince others to provide the necessary capital) undertake the research.
It is difficult if not impossible to measure "marginal contributions"--how
much sooner an innovation becomes available as a result of the activity of a
particular individual. It is possible to tell who is first, but not easy to

                                        24
                                D. Human   Nature
     My final query concerning the Invisible Hand Theorem and the model on

which (modern renditions of) it are based is perhaps more fundamental and

philosophical.     The Arrow-Debreu model is based on a particular conception

of individual and group behavior.       The previous sections have criticized

particular assumptions, and have slown how reasonable modifications of those

assumptions lead to quite different results.          I now want to raise some

questions about the appropriateness of that basic conception.

     The Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics, like the invisible hand,

makes use of each individual's pursuit of his own self interest. Whether

individuals are rational or not, surely an individual's self interest is

more "reliable" as a guide to action than other motives of human behavior.

But while self interest is, undoubtedly, an important aspect of human

behavior, it is not the only aspect which has a consistent and persistent

effect on economic behavior.

     In my Marschak lecture          (l987b),"°     I referred to two other
characteristics, human fallibility and human sociability.          One of the
benefits of growing older         is the growing recognition of others'

fallibility.      It is not only that mistakes get made:        differences in

judgments are what makes life in organizations both so interesting and so

difficult.     (Human fallibility can be viewed as another aspect of imperfect

information; but what is at issue is not just that individuals have


ascertain who "almost made it."

     40This work was based on joint work with Raaj Sah (l985a, 1985b, 1986,
1987, 1988).


                                           25
incomplete information, say, concerning any project, but they have limited

abilities to process that information and limited capabilities to

communicate information: in the process errors are inevitably introduced.

     Human fallibility means that an organization's decision making

structure makes a difference.      It also makes a difference who- -which

particular individuals--have decision making powers, a subject which
engrosses much of the time of those who have had the good fortune to assume

decision making positions.

     Note the marked contrast between the conception of market economies,

and in particular the firms within those economies, embodied in the Arrow

Debreu framework and that reflected in the Human Fallibility perspective.

In the former, decision making is indeed a boring task: managers do nothing

more than follow the textbook prescriptions of how to behave; they simply

set marginal cost equal to price, and, to borrow Joan Robinson's phrase,

they look up in the Book of Blueprints the appropriate page corresponding to

current factor prices.

     Human Sociability--the fact that individuals are social animals, and

care about their relations with others- -also plays an important role in

determining economic behavior.   For instance, there is convincing evidence

that individuals' perceptions of whether they are fairly treated affects

their work effort; fairness is largely a social concept- -one compares one's

wage with others in one's orbit of comparison. The recognition of this has

important consequences both for levels of wages and distribution of wages
within firms.41 42 43



     See, e.g. Akerlof (1980, 1984).    For an early articulation of what
is known as the "morale" basis of efficiency wages, see Stiglitz (1973b,
l974a).   For a general survey of efficiency wage theory, see Stiglitz
                                       26
             Two Problems with the Second Fundamental Theorem

     We have come to recognize that the second Welfare Theorem, too, is

plagued with difficulties, the two most important of which I will now

briefly describe.



                         Absence of Lump Sum Taxes

     The first is that the government cannot, and does not, rely on lump sum

taxes as a basis of redistribution.           This, too, can be viewed as a

consequence of imperfect information:        the government does not have the

information available to decide who should (given society's ethical values)

pay a lump sum tax, and who should receive a lump sum benefit.        It must,

accordingly, make its judgement based on observable characteristics,

characteristics which, in almost all cases, are alterable, such as income.

But basing redistributions on these variables necessarily introduces

distortions. Individuals alter the alterable characteristics, to reduce the

payments they make or to increase the payments they receive.


(l987d)

     421c ha further consequences as well.  Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983)
showed, for instance, that contests have major advantages, in providing
strong incentives with limited risk bearing.    Further, they allow for
"incentive flexibility," an automatic adjustment

     "3Thus, Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983) identify some distinct advantages
of contests as incentive devices. The fact that they are not as extensively
employed as the theory suggests          is     partially accounted   for by
sociological/psychological considerations.

     "'This has been the basis of the literature growing out of Mirrlees'
(1971)  seminal paper.      The information interpretation of the tax-
redistribution problem is contained in Stiglitz (1987c), who coins the term
"the New New Welfare Economics" to distinguish between the Old New Welfare
Economics, where equity and efficiency considerations were separated,

                                        27
     One of the central consequences of the Second Welfare Theorem was the

ability to separate efficiency issues from distribution issues.        In the

absence of lump sum taxes, this separability is not possible.



                          Principal Agent Problems

     One of the major advances of the economics of the past fifteen years is

the recognition of the importance of incentive problems. Incentive problems

do not arise, in an interesting way, in the traditional Arrow Debreu model,

which forms the basis of the Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics:

individuals perform in the contracted way, or they do not get paid.

     The issue of providing incentives for workers is one of the central

problems facing managers; the issue of suppliers of capital providing
incentives to those to whom they have entrusted their funds, to use those

funds wisely, is one of the major problems facing investors. Some would go

so far as to say that the incentive issue is the central issue of economics.

     Incentive   issues   arise,   fundamentally,    because    some   of the
consequences of one's actions affect others: the employer is benefited if I

work hard, the landlord is benefited if his sharecropper exerts greater

effort.

     We now understand why these problems arise, and what assumptions of the




through the use of the concept of Pareto Optimality, but in which lump sum
taxes were employed, and the New doctrines, which explicitly recognize the
absence of lump sum redistributions. Stiglitz (1982c, 1987c) identifies the
set of Pareto Efficient tax structures, i.e., given the limited information
available to the government, the tax structures which maximize the welfare
of one group, given the welfare levels of other groups.

                                        28
standard Arrow Debreu model account for its unrealism in this dimension.45

What concerns me here are its consequences for the Invisible Hand.



     To see these most clearly, let me turn to the example which
represented one of the earlier articulations of the principal agent problem-

-sharecropping (Stiglitz, l974b).      There had been a long tradition

criticizing sharecropping as an inefficient social arrangement; because the

worker typically had to pay a third or a half of his output to the landlord,

his incentives were attenuated.    Those who believed in the efficiency of

market institutions found this a puzzle.        What Stiglitz showed was that,

given the limitations on risk markets, and given the limitations on

landlords' abilities to monitor workers (or the costs of monitoring),

sharecropping was an efficient institution.46

     But it is an efficient institution given the distribution of wealth--

given the disparity between endowments of labor and endowments of capital

(land). The incentive problems associated with sharecropping simply would

not arise if all tenants owned the land upon which they worked.              A

redistribution of land from landlords to peasants would probably not be a


     45Again, this problem can largely be viewed as a problem of imperfect
information, the inability of the manager, say, to specify fully the actions
to be undertaken by the worker, and of imperfect risk markets, the
unwillingness of the worker to undertake contractual arrangements which
would give him better incentives, but at the cost of greater risk bearing.
       For an analysis of the profound consequences of moral hazard problems
on the nature of competitive equilibriuni, see Arnott and Stiglitz (1983,
1988a)

     46Actually, he only showed that it was locally efficient, that is, the
sharecropping contract was the solution to the problem of maximizing the
expected utility of the landlord, given a particular expected utility of
tenant-farmers.    In general, the market equilibrium is not general
equilibrium Pareto efficient, a result which follows as a corollary of the
Greenwald-Stiglitz (1986) analysis.

Pareto improvement: landlords would be worse off. But, to borrow a phrase

from Smith's classic work, the Wealth of the Nation- -the annual flow of

output- -would be increased, so long as the labor supply curve was not

backward bending.

     And because, as Creenwald and Stiglitz have shown, economies in which

principal agent problems arise are almost never Pareto efficient, the

inequality of land ownership means that the economy not only will not be

maximizing national income, but also that It is, in fact, Pareto

inefficient.

     Once again, we see that we cannot separate out issues of distribution

from efficiency.47




                                   Part III.

                     Implications for Economic Organization



     We care about the Invisible Hand, not only because of its Inherent

intellectual interest, but because it affects our views concerning how

society should organize the production of its goods and services and our

attitudes towards a wide range of government policies. In this section, I

illustrate this with several examples.




     "7Exactly the same result was obtained in the Shapiro-Stiglitz (1984)
analysis of workers' incentives in industrial economies, with costly
monitoring.

                                          30
     One of the results- -one could almost state it as a corollary- -of the

Arrow Debreu/Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics perspective on

economics is the Lange-Lerner-Taylor proposition concerning the equivalence

between market socialist economies and capitalist economies. Anyone who has

visited one of the so-called market socialist economies would suspect

something is amiss; and indeed, the model provides neither a good depiction

of the market socialist economies nor of modern capitalist economies.'8

Among the more important of these are two to which we have already called

attention:

     In the Lange-Lerner-Taylor paradigm of market socialism, managers are

well brought-up dutiful servants of the state. They carry out their tasks

of maximizing profits at the prices presented to them by the State, without

need for incentives.    Perhaps if the world were as simple as the model

presented it, this might be a relevant possibility: the manager is little

more than an engineer, looking up (as we have said) the relevant page in the

book of blueprints.    Presumably, it would be relatively inexpensive to

monitor him.

     But the complexities of decision making, wrought by the imperfections

of information and the pervasiveness of human fallibility, particularly in

environments where managers are responsible both for innovation and for

responding to changing circumstances, make such a model of economic

organization irrelevant for modern societies.

     Economic organization matters.     The extent of decentralization in

society matters.   Sah and I have spelled out a number of the ways in which

it matters.    Here, let me just illustrate the general principle:        if


     '8See Stiglitz (l989d) for a discussion of some of the relevant issues

                                        31
decision making is centralized, and the person responsible for making

decision making is competent, the economic organization may perform well;

but if he Is incompetent, it will perform badly. Centralization is like

putting all of one's eggs in one basket:          just as we now recognize the

greater advantages of portfolio diversification in allocating one's wealth,

so, too, there are great advantages of diversification in allocating

decision making powers.       We need only dwell a few minutes on the evils

wrought in this century as a result of the concentration of power in the

hands of a few individuals.




                                    Part IV.

                                Economic Policy



     The Invisible Hand touches upon almost every aspect of economic policy.

Here, I shall have time to comment on only one aspect, anti-trust.           A

central assumption of the Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics is the

existence of competition.      Without competition, there is market failure- -

monopolists will exploit consumers by producing too little, charging too
high prices.

     Traditional theory emphasized that, in the absence of government

imposed barriers, markets would be competitive, except if there were

increasing returns.

     I referred earlier to a strand of literature which has been concerned

with showing that the Invisible Hand theorem is, in fact, stronger than the

earlier proofs might have lead one to believe.            The analysis of the


                                          32
consequences of natural monopoly provides perhaps the best illustration of

this.

        Following a long Chicago tradition (see, e.g. Demsetz, 1968), Baujuol

Panzar, and Willig (1982) have put forth the view that all that is needed is

potential competition, not actual competition to ensure that the invisible

hand works effectively- - that prices will be driven down to average costs and

that economic efficiency will be attained.

        As we put it on another occasion, this view, while it may be well

funded, is not well founded (Dasgupta and Stiglicz, 1988).          Of course,

businesses who dominated a market found this idea attractive. Were it true,

it would have profound implications:       it would imply not only that anti-

trust policy was unneeded, but attempts to break up monopolies might
actually be welfare decreasing, since the smaller units could not take

advantage of the economies of scale.

        Elsewhere, we (Dasgupta and Stiglitz, 1988, Stiglitz, 1988a) have shown

the contestability doctrine not to be robust: all it takes is an epsilon of

sunk costs to act as an effective barrier to entry.                 Under some

circumstances, profits may be bid away, but even then, prices remain at an

economically inefficient Level; profits are dissipated in excess entry. The

point is a simple one:      firm decisions to enter are based not on current

prices, but on their judgments about what would happen to prices if they

enter.     If they think the incumbent firm will lower his price, then entry

may be unattractive.       And we have shown that, in equilibrium under a

variety of conditions, that is precisely what the incumbent will do.         Of

course, in the limiting case of no sunk costs, the entrant has nothing to

lose:     he enters for a second, and if the incumbent lowers his price, he


                                          33
simply leaves. But there is hardly an industry in which there aren't some

sunk costs (if only the sunk costs associated with learning about the

industry), and in many cases they are substantial.

     In the days before airline deregulation, airlines were held up as the

example par excellence of an industry with no (sic) sunk costs. (Of course,

if you want to make money, customers must know that you are flying; you must

advertise, and those are sunk costs.)        The post-deregulation era has

provided convincing refutation of the contestability doctrine: at the very

least, it cannot be taken as a general proposition.         In market after

market, prices have tumbled as entry occurred; as incumbents matched

entrant's fares, customers chose the familiar brands; entrants were forced

to leave; and prices were quickly restored to levels far higher than

marginal costs. Potential competition simply did not suffice.49

     As I remarked earlier, R & D involves fixed, sunk costs, and the

discussion of potential competition thus has an immediate bearing on

industrial sectors in which research places an important role.     Potential

competition does not ensure that the level of R & D expenditures will be

socially efficient.   Indeed, under some circumstances, a firm which has a

technological leadership can behave almost as it would were it an unfettered

monopolist:   for it can establish a sufficient lead that competitors will

credibly believe that, were they to enter, the incumbent would respond by


     491t has also been argued (Baumol, Bailey and Willig) that multi-
product firms (say an unregulated utility) will charge the same structure of
prices that the government would charge, were it faced with running the
enterprise. Both would employ Ramsey-Boiteux prices.     But there is only a
superficial resemblance between the two.         For example, unless the
unregulated utility is protected against entry, he will take into account
the supply responses of potential competitors, should he charge too high a
price for some service.    There are several other differences between the
two. See Sappington and Stiglitz (l987b).

                                        34
speeding up his research program. Given that, entrants have no incentive to

enter. (Dasgupta and Stiglitz, 1988, Stiglitz, l988a). °



    This poses the fundamental question:       can we have much confidence in

the invisible hand working well in modern industrial economies? At this

juncture, any belief in the invisible hand must be taken as an article of

faith, not a scientifically established proposition.




                                    Part V.

                        Ideology and the Invisible Hand



     Economists want to believe in the invisible hand.      Or at least many

American economists do.      The quest for generalizing the invisible hand

theorem--an unsuccessful quest, in my view--has been a central focus of much

of the profession during recent decades. Results abound in the literature--

results which, upon closer examination, simply don't hold up.

     Not all of this is motivated by ideology. Some of it is motivated by

fashion and academia's reward structure (the invisible hand at work again,

though now not necessarily promoting the general welfare):         it may be

relatively easy to write a paper following the standard formula, which



     50This analysis also throws into doubt Schumpeter's views concerning
the effectiveness of competition as a driving force for innovation, and his
characterization of market economies as a succession of innovators.
     At the same time, I do not want to underestimate the importance of
competition as a stimulant for innovation: our objective here is only to
recognize its limits.

                                          35
begins with a (very) brief introduction stating a limitation in previous

writers' work, a model which is a slight modification of the well-accepted

competitive model, and then the theorem:         under the stipulated (often

uninterpretable) conditions, market equilibrium is Pareto efficient.

     And finally, some of it is motivated by "honest error." A natural

research strategy is to begin with simple models, and then extend them by

making them more complex.     The natural simplifications employed to get
easily tractable models turn out to be the special conditions under which

markets are sometimes Pareto efficient.



     Let me illustrate these quests for a Stronger Invisible Hand by three

more examples (in addition to the Contestability example given in the

preceding section).

     Imperfect risk markets. When Arrow and Debreu originally proved their

result, they assumed that there was a complete set of risk markets- -a

clearly unsatisfactory assumption.        A natural question was, would the
economy be efficient if there were fewer risk markets, say a stock market;

or, more particularly, would the market be constrained Pareto efficient,

taking into account the limited availability of risk markets.          Diamond

(1967) showed that it would be.    But he found the (essentially) singular

case where that result holds- - there must be only one commodity. With two or

more commodities, the market is constrained Pareto inefficient, except in

the singular case where the two commodities are the same (or where all

individuals are identical, so no risk markets are really needed [see

Stiglitz, 1982a]).




                                          36
     Moral hazard.      Following Stiglitz (1974b) and Ross (1973), principal

agent problems have typically been characterized as the solution to a simple

problem:    maximize the utility of the principal subject to the agent

receiving a particular level of expected utility. Shavell (1979) used this

framework to analyze insurance markets, and to conclude that the market

equilibrium is efficient.      But this result too is terribly special- -it

requires, for instance, that there is a single good.            (See Arnott and

Stiglitz, 1989).




Real Business Cycles.      The misleading nature of the earlier optimality

results on moral hazard and incomplete markets discussed in the previous

paragraphs is perhaps understandable: the single commodity assumption was a

natural assumption to begin the analysis of an admittedly complex problem.

     I am, however, far less sympathetic with the special nature of the

optimality results reported in recent work in macro-economics. One of the

central objectives of research in that area is to understand unemployment,

its causes, its consequences, and how it varies over time. Little insight

into that question is obtained by assuming market clearing- -   that   there is no

unemployment. Even if one claims little more than this is the first stage

of a long term research programme, which eventually is aimed at contributing

insights into this phenomenon, it seems a peculiar way to begin such a

research programme.

     Similarly,    it   should seem obvious that the consequences of
unemployment- -at least the social consequences- -are far different than an




                                         37
equi-percentage reduction in the hours worked by and the income of each

individual.

     Elsewhere, we have argued (Creenwald and Stiglitz, l988b) that many of

the central macro-economic phenomena can be traced to asymmetric information

in labor, capital, and product markets.     If that is the case, it makes

little sense to begin macro-economic analysis with representative agent

models, for in their very formulation they preclude most of the central

problems of asymmetric information.

     But even if one does not agree on the importance that we ascribe to

asymmetric information, how can one, in good faith, use a representative

agent model to conclude that the economy is efficient (the invisible hand)

and that therefore government intervention is counter-efficient:        true

enough, the conclusions follow from the assumptions. But by now, we know

how special those assumptions are, that with incomplete risk markets and

imperfect information, markets are essentially never constrained Pareto

efficient (except in singular cases, such as when all individuals are

identical, when no trade would occur on markets for trading risks, were they

to exist.)

    We have also shown that market equilibrium with just a little bit of

information can be markedly different from equilibrium with perfect
information.   Why, then, make a pretense of "theoretical rigor" for such

models? The structures of theoretical rigor are imposed to add confidence

in the conclusions of the analysis. But what confidence can we have, if we

already know that the results are not robust to slight alterations in the

assumptions?




                                       38
     A research programme, the objective of which is to show that the

observed fluctuations in employment and output could be the outcome of

shocks to technology in a perfectly competitive economy with perfect (or at

least symmetric) information seems to be sufficiently flawed as to raise

questions why it has been pursued with such enthusiasm: could it be that the

policy conclusions of such a theory- - that the outcomes of market processes

that we observed, however peculiar and unattractive they might seem, are in

fact efficient and that government action is unnecessary- -satisfy some

ideological programme?

     Although real business cycle theory, and its cousin the new classical

theory, claim to follow in the tradition of classical economics, they have

gone far beyond what the classical economists (or Adam Smith) would have

claimed.    These economists did not claim that the economy instantaneously

adjusted to full employment, only that there was a long run tendency for

full employment.    Pigou postulated a mechanism- - the real balance effect- -

which would restore the economy to full employment, but the mechanism was a

slow one:    even at the maximum rate at which prices fell during the Great

Depression,51 it would have taken more than a century for the economy to

recover!




                             Concluding Remarks

     The two hundred years since Adam Smith wrote his masterpiece has

witnessed an unprecedented increase in living standards within capitalist



     51And even ignoring the Barro-Ricardo arguments suggesting that the
elasticity of consumption with respect to changes in the real value of
outstanding government bonds is much lower (perhaps zero) than the
elasticity of consumption with respect to wealth in general.

                                        39
economies.      The fruits of this growth have, moreover, been widely
distributed.      I suspect that Smith would have been astonished at how

effectively the invisible hand had worked, how well it had served to

increase the wealth of nations.

     But in the face of such achievements, he would, I think, have looked on

at astonishment at those exaggerated claims - -meant to be interpretations of

his invisible hand conjecture- -that the market economy was Nirvana on earth,

that resources were always and instantaneously allocated in a (Pareto)

efficient manner.    Such exaggerated claims do a disservice, even to those

who would like to see government play a very limited role in economic

activity.

     We now recognize that it is only under highly idealized circumstances

that the market economy is constrained Pareto efficient.         Some of the

inefficiencies of the market economy are small, and some- -like the periodic

episodes of massive unemployment that have plagued capitalist economies

during the past two century--are not so small. Whether, or how, democratic

governments can best improve matters, and whether they are likely to do so,

are questions which take us beyond the scope of this paper.         When the

central result of economics was that no government- -no matter how well

designed--could possibly improve upon market allocations, there was no need

to enquire into these matters of political economy.      There was a simple

prescription:       government activity should be limited to lump sum
redistributions and correcting a well defined and limited set of market

failures.      But now that we see that market failures (in the sense of

constrained Pareto efficiency) are pervasive, that they arise in all aspects

of economic life, and that issues of efficiency and equity cannot be neatly


                                       40
separated, these issues of political economy cannot be ignored.     But these

issues- -and not the issue of whether the market economy attains the ideal of

Pareto Efficiency--are, or ought to be, the focus of debate and discussion

in democratic societies.
