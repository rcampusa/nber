                                               Abstract

            Many political markets are essentially uncontested, in the sense that one candi-
        date raises little (or no) money and consequently has little chance of election. This
        presents a puzzle in the presence of apparently low barriers to entry. Using a variant
        of Baron (1989) we provide a theory encompassing both contested and uncontested
        markets. The essential addition is the presence of Ô¨Åxed costs of campaigning. We
        show that these may be quite small and yet constitute decisive barriers to entry.


      Federal Election Commission data reveal two striking facts about the importance of

money in politics. First, in both House and Senate races the candidate who raises the

most money wins about 90 percent of the time. Second, while most races have multiple

candidates, as many as 80 percent of races are essentially uncontested in the sense

that one of the candidates raises little (or no) money and thus has no realistic chance of

winning (Raskin and Bonifaz, 1994). Uncontested markets look like an important puzzle

because political markets apparently have low barriers to entry. We oÔ¨Äer a formal model

of political market structure which explains why uncontested markets are so prevalent.1
  1
      The notion of uncontested markets is distinct from the well-known notion of uncontestable markets.



                                                    1
    We analyze the phenomenon of uncontested races by incorporating Ô¨Åxed costs of

campaigning into a variant of Baron‚Äôs (1989) model of campaign contributions. Baron‚Äôs

model is typically thought to be ill suited as a general model of political market structure

since the model‚Äôs symmetry makes it most easily interpreted as a story of open seat

races where there is no incumbent. This is unfortunate since open seat races are a small

minority of all races: from 1960 through 1988 incumbents have sought reelection in

approximately 90 percent of House races and 80 percent of Senate races (Magleby and

Nelson, 1990).2

    We show that if the candidate cannot raise enough contributions to cover the Ô¨Åxed

cost of campaigning, entry is deterred. The actual threshold is higher than simply

the Ô¨Åxed cost since contributions involve future costs to the successful candidate that

must be balanced against the beneÔ¨Åt of the money accepted in raising the candidate‚Äôs

probability of election. The deterrence is self-reinforcing since lobbies will be reluctant

to contribute to a candidate who raises a small amount of funds. Candidates who

cannot obtain funds cannot sway enough voters to get elected, and only candidates who

are likely to be elected can obtain funds. As we will show, this ‚ÄòCatch-22‚Äô of electoral

politics can operate even if the Ô¨Åxed cost threshold is quite low. As a result, we Ô¨Ånd

that the introduction of a small Ô¨Åxed cost of campaigning substantially enriches the

basic Baron model, allowing us to explain open-seat, incumbent/challenger, and single

candidate (i.e., nearly unopposed) races.

    We provide a thorough analysis of Nash equilibria in the political contributions

game, characterizing both ‚Äòinterior‚Äô Nash equilibria wherein multiple candidates actively
Fixed costs are a common element, but the contestable market idea emphasizes dynamics: the Ô¨Åxed cost
is sunk in later periods and forward-looking investors will not commit the Ô¨Åxed cost if the incumbent
Ô¨Årm will react with a price war.
    2
      According to Milyo, Primo, and Groseclose (2000) open seat races have become somewhat more
common in recent years.

campaign and also ‚Äòcorner‚Äô equilibria wherein only one actively campaigns. In doing so

we provide a more satisfactory treatment of the existence of interior Nash equilibrium

than in Baron (1989) and Baron and Mo (1993). The Catch-22 feature can produce

an uncontested market even with symmetric candidates and zero Ô¨Åxed costs due to a

self-fulÔ¨Ålling prophecy‚Äîthe candidate cannot raise any funds because no one expects

her to win; consequently, she has no money to spend, which in turn ensures that she

cannot win.3 We provide suÔ¨Écient conditions for the existence of interior equilibria and

derive the model‚Äôs comparative statics. The comparative statics imply that, the higher

are Ô¨Åxed costs and the greater is the asymmetry between the candidates, the more likely

is a corner solution.

    Does our model plausibly explain the prevalence of uncontested races? The quali-

tative results of comparative static analysis cannot reply, so we turn to simulations to

provide an answer to this question. We Ô¨Ånd that corner solutions are the only equilibria

for much of the parameter range. For reasonable parameter values 30‚Äì60% of races

only support a single active candidate. Thus, the simulations demonstrate that Ô¨Åxed

costs can create an uncontested race between two otherwise identical candidates. In

addition, we Ô¨Ånd that given other types of asymmetries between the candidates (say,

initial popularity or campaign eÔ¨Éciency), single-candidate races emerge with very small

Ô¨Åxed costs.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The Ô¨Årst section of the paper

brieÔ¨Çy reviews some of the empirical literature on campaign spending in Federal elections

which motivates our approach: money matters a lot, many challengers raise little money,

and money is spent for some political service such as access. Section 2 sketches the model
  3
    While such self-fulÔ¨Ålling belief equilibria are present in the basic Baron model, they are neither
emphasized nor analyzed in Baron (1989).

of political competition that is reÔ¨Çected in these data. Section 3 contains our analysis of

‚Äòinterior‚Äô Nash equilibria in the model in which both candidates actively campaign. We

Ô¨Årst characterize the conditions for the existence of interior Nash equilibria and establish

conditions that guarantee when the interior equilibrium is unique. We then go on to

discuss some comparative static results (e.g., how contributions change with respect

to changes in the Ô¨Åxed costs of campaigning). Section 4 discusses ‚Äòcorner‚Äô solution

Nash equilibria in which only one candidate actively campaigns. In section 5 provide

simulations and verify the important role of Ô¨Åxed costs in explaining the prevalence of

single-candidate races.


1. Money and Elections

A substantial body of empirical research has been devoted to understanding the role

played by campaign contributions in elections. These studies have identiÔ¨Åed a number

of robust, stylized facts, several of which are most relevant for our model. First, the

candidate who spends the most money wins the overwhelming majority of races. For

instance, in 1992 86 percent of Senate candidates who outspent their opponent won the

general election. In the same year, the bigger spender won 89 percent of House races

(Raskin and Bonifaz, 1994).4

    Moreover, this Ô¨Ånding can not be simply attributed to an incumbency advantage.

It is true that incumbents usually outspend challengers and also that incumbents win

about 90 percent of the time (Magleby and Nelson, 1990). It must be noted, however,

that even in open seat races the bigger spender wins almost 80 percent of House races

(Raskin and Bonifaz, 1994). Thus, while incumbency seems to provide an additional
   4
     While not reporting exact numbers, the discussion in Jacobsen (1978, 1980) and Abramowitz (1991)
indicates that a similar relationship between money spent and outcomes existed during the 1970s and
1980s.


                                                 4
electoral beneÔ¨Åt, it appears that chief among the many advantages of incumbency is the

greater ability to raise funds.5

       Second, many races are characterized by an extraordinary low level of competi-

tion and lopsided races are becoming increasingly prevalent over time (Jacobsen, 1987;

Abramowitz, 1991). These races are essentially uncontested in the sense that the cam-

paign contributions to the incumbent dwarf those to the challenger. And, as a result the

challenger garners very few votes.6 According to Raskin and Bonifaz (1994) ‚Äúin 1992,

four out of Ô¨Åve House incumbents faced either no challenger at all or a challenger with

so little money‚Äîless than 50 percent the amount available to the incumbent‚Äîas to be

deemed a non-serious competitor (p. 4).‚Äù Similarly, Westlye (1991) concludes that more

than half of U.S. Senate races are foregone conclusions. Finally, Levitt (1998) shows

that it is not uncommon for an incumbents to raise 100‚Äì200 times as much the money as

the challenger. Levitt notes that it is precisely the races with extraordinary diÔ¨Äerences

campaign budgets where the incumbent wins by more than 40 percentage points.

       Third, access is a major‚Äìif not the primary‚Äîreason why lobbying groups make

campaign contributions. Consider, for example, that more than two-thirds of multi-

candidate PACs who make campaign contributions (those who contribute to more than

one candidate) also have active lobbying oÔ¨Éces in Washington (Sabato, 1984). Fur-

thermore, Wright (1990) Ô¨Ånds the House of Representatives‚Äô voting decisions are best

explained by lobbying contacts they received from each side of the issue. Once lobbying

is controlled for, however, Wright Ô¨Ånds little evidence that PAC contributions have a

direct impact on voting. In other words, campaign contributions aÔ¨Äect voting decisions

     Other advantages of holding oÔ¨Éce include greater name recognition, franking privileges, and larger
staÔ¨Äs to provide constituent service.
   6
     In 1986 and 1988 the incumbent won by more than 20 percentage points in more than 85% of House
races (Abramowitz, 1991).

indirectly through lobbying. Snyder (1990, 1993) also Ô¨Ånds support for the view that

contributions buy access. In his model contributions buy an asset which takes the form

of a contingent claim. Applying eÔ¨Éciency conditions on candidate and lobby behavior,

Snyder is able to derive relationships among key variables such as total contributions,

the value of such contributions, and election outcomes. Using data from U.S. House and

Senate Snyder uses these equilibrium conditions to estimate implications of the model

and Ô¨Ånds support for the notion of contributions as investments.7


2. The Model

Following Baron (1989) we consider a model with two politicians who simultaneously

advertise and campaign (a set of activities we collectively call ‚ÄòeÔ¨Äort‚Äô) in order to sway

rationally ignorant voters. For convenience we will refer to one candidate as the ‚Äòincum-

bent‚Äô and the other as the ‚Äòchallenger.‚Äô The labels merely point to potential asymmetry

in favor of the incumbent, neither implying nor ruling out that one of the candidates

already holds oÔ¨Éce.

      The objective probability of candidate i being elected is assumed to be equal to

                                     ¬µeŒ≤i
                         p=                       ,   Œ≤ < 1, 0 < ¬µ < 1                        (1)
                              ¬µeŒ≤i + (1 ‚àí ¬µ)eŒ≤c

where e denotes candidate eÔ¨Äort. The indices i and c refer to the incumbent and chal-

lenger, respectively. The parameter Œ≤ < 1 implies that there is diminishing marginal

eÔ¨Äectiveness to eÔ¨Äort. The parameter ¬µ captures the potential asymmetry of relative

eÔ¨Äort levels: for equal eÔ¨Äorts, ei /ec = 1, p = ¬µ. EÔ¨Äort is comprised of an exogenous
  7
   Other studies that Ô¨Ånd support for the access interpretation of PAC contributions include Grier
and Munger (1991a,b), Hall and Wayman (1990), McCarty and Rothenberg (1996), Milyo (1997a,b),
Romer and Snyder (1994), and Snyder (1991, 1992).



                                                  6
component e ‚â• 0 representing ideological attachment or sunk eÔ¨Äort and an endoge-

nous component E which must be Ô¨Ånanced by the candidate. Overall campaign eÔ¨Äort,

therefore, can be written ej = ej + Ej ; j = i.c.

       Candidate j, j = i, c Ô¨Ånances her campaign by accepting Hj contributions from

a large set of potential contributors. The contributions have value to the politician

because they allow her to buy advertising (or more broadly, exert ‚ÄòeÔ¨Äort‚Äô) that increases

her probability of election.8 The cost of campaigning is


                                   Cj = Kj + bj Ej ,     j = i, c,


where Ej is the endogenous portion of candidate eÔ¨Äort, Kj is the Ô¨Åxed cost of campaign-

ing, and bj is the marginal cost. Ej > 0 requires Cj > Kj . The Ô¨Åxed cost represents a

threshold ability to spend which must be met to hire a campaign manager (who must

be convinced that the campaign has some reasonable chance of success), rent an oÔ¨Éce

and so forth. Solving for Ej , Ej = (Cj ‚àí Kj )/bj .

       Each candidate obtains money to Ô¨Ånance her campaign from donors. Our view is

that money is exchanged for access, called inÔ¨Çuence here to emphasize its strategic

potential. To capture this interpretation, we assume that each active donor purchases

one unit of access, rationalized as ‚Äòbuying‚Äô an option on the elected oÔ¨Écial‚Äôs future time,

whereby she implicitly promises to listen, possibly read a position paper, give a reasoned

response to the donor, etc.9 Lobbies value access as an opportunity to get the politician

to process costly (to the politician) information, expecting that the information may

alter the politician‚Äôs behavior favorably. The information must be created at some
   8
    In the U.S. system, campaign contributions cannot be converted to personal income.
   9
    The amounts typically donated are consistent with this notion of purchasing some hours of time of
the politician and her staÔ¨Ä. Empirically, the median value of contributions is around $1500, far below
the FEC limit of $10,000 for a House race and $25,000 for a Senate race.


                                                  7
additional cost (e.g., preparing the report, taking polls), and the signal value of the

lobby‚Äôs information is based on its veriÔ¨Åable production cost.10 The interpretation

oÔ¨Äered here need not include the idea of ‚Äòbuying‚Äô the politician‚Äôs vote, or even buying

a lottery ticket to the politician‚Äôs vote. The main idea is more palatable: political

information processing is costly, and a price system arises in politics to allocate resources

to this task.

    Critically, we assume that access must be purchased prior to its use. This seems to Ô¨Åt

casual empiricism.11 There are also solid theoretical grounds for the assumed structure.

Incumbent politicians who are thought to allow access at the donors‚Äô convenience will

be unable to raise funds, save as in payment for service. This may yield lower revenue

since a much smaller group of clients will pay. Moreover, with a small group of clients

the payment may be negotiated on less favorable terms, since the situation tends toward

bilateral monopoly. Finally, the payment for service type of behavior may lead to an

advantage to the politician‚Äôs rival if it is publicized.12

    The value of access to the donor is private information, and heterogeneity creates an

extensive margin, leading to downward sloping, concave demand, v(Hj ). Since politi-

cians do not know the value of access to individuals, they cannot price discriminate.
   10
      Austen-Smith (1995) has critiqued the access story because a lobby will only be believed if it has
coincident interest to the politician, in which case the lobby need not pay for access. He bases a rationale
for the access model in a rational choice signaling game in which the politician is uncertain about the
lobby‚Äôs interest. This is unnecessarily complicated in our view since the cost of creating the signal is
like a performance bond, wherein lies can be uncovered by the politician‚Äôs eÔ¨Äort but result in loss of the
bond to the lobby. We also think that reputation is important in providing credibility on both sides of
the information exchange between lobbies and politicians.
   11
      The post-1994 election oÔ¨Äer by the Congressional Republicans to allow those who did not con-
tribute previously to make contributions to an elections debt repayment fund seems exceptional. It is
nevertheless diÔ¨Écult to believe that access was granted to latecomers on the same basis as the early
birds.
   12
      The oÔ¨Äer to late-comers of the previous footnote may maintain the credibility of normally denying
access due to the surprise of the shift in control of Congress to the Republicans.




                                                     8
Thus all contributions to a single politician are at the same rate.13

    If elected, each candidate faces some chance of having to grant access to those to

whom it was sold. For simplicity, we assume there is a probability œÄ of having to grant

access to the entire group (each contributor subsequently receives a realization of a

random iid process determining exercise of the option to access). The ex ante value (to

the donor) of the exchange depends on the probability of the candidate being elected,

which is taken as exogenous by the donor, but must be rational in equilibrium. Hence,

the ex ante price for access is pœÄv(Hi ) for the incumbent and [1 ‚àí p]œÄv(Hc ) for the

challenger. Substituting we can express endogenous eÔ¨Äort as


                            Ei (Hi ) = [pœÄv(Hi )Hi ‚àí Ki ]/bi ,                                        (2)

                            Ec (Hc ) = [(1 ‚àí p)œÄv(Hc )Hc ‚àí Kc ]/bc .                                  (3)


Given this setup, we show in the appendix that the probability that the incumbent is

elected can be expressed as a reduced form correspondence, i.e., p = P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).

In the appendix we also establish a condition that guarantees the uniqueness of the

probability p for a given (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ). The same condition also guarantees PHi > 0 ,

PHc < 0, PKi < 0, PKc > 0. Loosely speaking, this condition requires the Ô¨Åxed costs of

campaigning be relatively small relative to exogenous eÔ¨Äort. Intuitively, the condition

means that if exogenous campaign eÔ¨Äort is large enough, a candidate will campaign

even without raising campaign funds. By contrast, in Baron‚Äôs model there are always

multiple solutions for p given (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).

    Politicians do not sell unbounded amounts of access because it is costly for a politi-

cian to listen to a petitioner‚Äôs case: staÔ¨Ä time and the politician‚Äôs own time must be
  13
     Uniform contributions rates are counterfactual and the observed price dispersion implies that politi-
cians do know the value of access in some cases. Uniformity is a harmless simpliÔ¨Åcation nonetheless.


                                                    9
diverted from other business. If access is granted, ‚Ñ¶(Hi ) is the cost to the incumbent

and Œì(Hc ) is the cost to the challenger. The cost functions are increasing and convex

in the number of units of access sold due to each politician‚Äôs limited capacity to handle

access. If we let W denote the value of being elected, we can write the expected utility

of the (risk neutral) candidate as


                           œà i = [W ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶(Hi )]P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ),

                           œà c = [W ‚àí œÄŒì(Hc )[1 ‚àí P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc )].


3. Nash equilibria of contested races

Each candidate maximizes her expected utility with respect to the number of units of

access she sells. The Ô¨Årst order conditions for an interior solution to each candidate‚Äôs

maximization problem are


                     i
                    œàH i
                            = [W ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶(Hi )]PHi ‚àí P (¬∑)œÄ‚Ñ¶ (Hi ) = 0,                    (4)

where we use subscripts to denote derivatives.

An interior Nash equilibrium of the contributions game exists if (4) and (5) are satisÔ¨Åed

when evaluated at the pair (HiN > 0, HcN > 0).


3.1. Symmetric candidates

While an interior Nash equilibrium need not exist, we can show that
 14
      SuÔ¨Écient conditions are provided in the Appendix.


                                                  10
Proposition 1 A symmetric interior Nash equilibrium always exists when the candi-

dates are symmetric and there are no Ô¨Åxed costs of campaigning and no exogenous

campaign eÔ¨Äort.


   For contested races, we are also interested in how one candidate responds to a change

in contributions by the rival candidate. Does an increase in the rival‚Äôs contributions lead

the competing candidate to accept more or less contributions? We can show that


Proposition 2 When the candidates are symmetric and there are no Ô¨Åxed costs of cam-

paigning and no exogenous campaign eÔ¨Äort, the candidates‚Äô contributions are strategic

complements near the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

                    i
   In other words, œàH               c
                           > 0 and œàH      > 0, which means that higher contributions
                      i Hc            c Hi

by the rival raise the marginal proÔ¨Åtability of own contributions, entailing a rise in own

contributions to restore the Ô¨Årst order condition. The best response functions are thus

upward sloping in Hc ‚ÄìHi space.


3.2. Comparative statics

Fixed costs

Candidates are likely have diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Åxed costs of campaigning. This will aÔ¨Äect the

number of contributions that each accepts. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a rise in Kj , j = i, c changes

the interior equilibrium (Hi , Hc ) according to

                                 dKj

      In other words, starting from the symmetric equilibrium an increase in Ô¨Åxed costs

leads to more contributions by both candidates.

      Changes in the Ô¨Åxed cost of campaigning also has a direct eÔ¨Äect on candidate utility.

In particular,


Proposition 4 Near the symmetric Nash equilibrium, an increase in (own) Ô¨Åxed cost

lowers a candidate‚Äôs utility and raises the utility of the rival candidate.


Cost of access

Suppose that the incumbent is more eÔ¨Écient at providing access, perhaps reÔ¨Çecting the

advantage of experience or innate capacity, e.g., Œì (H) > ‚Ñ¶ (H). This asymmetry acts

to increase Hi relative to Hc by shifting up the incumbent‚Äôs best response function.

Intuitively, the incumbent can anticipate less marginal eÔ¨Äort in providing access, hence

is able to accept more contributions, other things held equal. Strategic complementarity

implies that the challenger must then also supply more access in equilibrium.
 15
      The conditions which guarantee strategic complementarity also imply stability.




                                                   12
Recognition

The incumbent plausibly has a built-in advantage in that ¬µ > 1/2 due to voters‚Äô famil-

iarity or campaign experience. Raising ¬µ translates to a parametric rise in P (¬∑). This

has an ambiguous eÔ¨Äect on the reaction functions and hence contribution levels. In the

region where P (¬∑) is greater than or equal to 1/2, the eÔ¨Äect is to lower the incumbent‚Äôs

contribution level while it may raise or lower the challenger‚Äôs contribution level. In the

region where P (¬∑) is less than 1/2, the eÔ¨Äect is to raise the challenger‚Äôs contribution

level while the eÔ¨Äect on the incumbent is ambiguous.


Value of access

A rise in the value of access can be parameterized as a multiplicative shift upward in

v(H). Such a shift has no eÔ¨Äect on the elasticity given H, and is readily seen to increase

the marginal beneÔ¨Åt of contributions in both Ô¨Årst order conditions. Thus the Nash

equilibrium number (and dollar amount) of contributions will rise for both challenger

and incumbent.


4. Corner Solution Nash Equilibria

Interior Nash equilibrium will not exist when candidates are suÔ¨Éciently asymmetric. In

these cases, the dominant candidate is the only active campaigner and Nash equilibrium

is found at one corner (i.e., either Hc = 0 or Hi = 0). A candidate will refrain from

active campaigning if she earns less utility in the interior Nash equilibrium than the

reservation utility she receives by not actively campaigning.

   The corner solution is more likely the more asymmetric are the candidates. For

instance, the larger are the challenger‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed costs relative to the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed


                                           13
costs, the less likely it is that an interior Nash equilibrium will exist. That is,

                                            
            dœà i                         dHc              dP

            dKc                          dKc              dKc H N
                                                              i

            dœà c                          dHi                dP
                    = ‚àí[W ‚àí œÄŒì] PKc + PHi       = ‚àí[W ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶]          < 0.
            dKc                           dKc                dKc HcN

      Even if an interior Nash equilibrium exists, there may be corner solution equilibria,

in which either the challenger or the incumbent does not actively campaign. These

arise, oversimplifying, when the electorate thinks one or the other politician has little

chance. Because the value of access depends on the probability of election, a politician

may be able to sell access, but will realize very little money from these sales and hence

will be unable to aÔ¨Äord to campaign. As a result, the electorate‚Äôs original assessment

that the candidate has a slim chance is self-fulÔ¨Ålling. As we discuss below, this view

is oversimpliÔ¨Åed because a politician who does raise campaign funds may still have a

chance of winning due to the presence of exogenous eÔ¨Äort.

      More formally, if predetermined (or party) support is suÔ¨Éciently small so that ej ‚àí

Kj < 0, j = i, c, there always exists a pair of self-fulÔ¨Ålling prophecy corner solutions. In

this case, in order to begin to improve her chances of election a candidate must make a

discrete leap to a level of contributions suÔ¨Écient to oÔ¨Äset this Ô¨Åxed cost. Each potential

donor may not believe a suÔ¨Écient number of others will support the candidate, so a

coordination failure among the donors and the politician will prevent entry. Thus, a

Nash equilibrium will exist at either corner. However, a corner solution will not be a

‚Äòglobal‚Äô Nash equilibrium if an interior solution also exists. In this case, the interior

solution dominates for the excluded candidate and the corner solution dominates for

the other candidate.16
 16
      When both interior and corner solutions exist, we prefer to think of the corner solution as a ‚Äòlocal‚Äô


                                                     14
    We note that the self-fulÔ¨Ålling prophecy corner solution may not exist. Fixed costs

and exogenous eÔ¨Äort are the two key ingredients in determining whether these corner

equilibria exist. If predetermined (or party) support is large relative to Ô¨Åxed costs,

ej ‚àí Kj > 0, j = i, c, the politician will be viable so that even a small number of

sales of access are worthwhile to both the candidate and the lobbies. In this case,

the initial beliefs of the electorate do not determine the outcome and we will have an

interior equilibrium. For instance, a wealthy candidate may be able to ‚Äúself-Ô¨Ånance‚Äù

her campaign (i.e., has a very large e) and therefore have a very good chance despite

selling no access.

    The preceding discussion has analytically characterized the equilibria in a gener-

alized Baron model of campaign access. We have shown that interior equilibria exist

when the candidates are not too diÔ¨Äerent and that such equilibria may disappear when

we allow the candidates to diÔ¨Äer. Therefore, this generalization is potentially a much

more satisfying characterization of campaign competition since many races are essen-

tially uncontested. While our discussion emphasized the importance of Ô¨Åxed costs in

determining whether or not a race is contested, intuitively it is clear that any asym-

metries will make corner solutions more likely. Qualitative analysis cannot, however,

quantify the likelihood of observing corner solutions.


5. Simulation Results

We now use simulation techniques to show how asymmetries can create uncontested

campaigns and to quantify how diÔ¨Äerent the candidates must be before interior solutions

disappear (i.e., before races become uncontested). Our answer is, not much. We also
Nash equilibrium since moving from the corner implies non-myopic behavior on the part of the lobbies
as well as the politicians.



                                                15
investigate how Ô¨Åxed costs interact with small asymmetries to make interior solutions

disappear. Relatively small Ô¨Åxed costs make for corner solutions. Overall, the results

indicate that the Baron model with Ô¨Åxed costs is quite plausibly an explanation of a

the large proportion of corner solutions.

   In order to simulate the model, we write the value of access as


                          v(Hj ) = v0 Hj Œ± , j = i, c; ‚àí1 < Œ± < 0.


   We also suppose that the cost of providing access can be written as


                                ‚Ñ¶(Hi ) = Hi Œ¥i , Œ¥i > 1,

                                Œì(Hc ) = Hc Œ¥c , Œ¥c > 1.


Substituting, we can solve for campaign eÔ¨Äort as

                                   pœÄv0 Hi Œ±+1 ‚àí Ki
                     ei = max 0,                      + e¬Øi
                                           bi
                                   (1 ‚àí p)œÄv0 Hc Œ±+1 ‚àí Kc
                     ec   = max 0,                          + e¬Øc .
                                              bc

As discussed above, the key determinant for whether both candidates actively sell access

is the relative size of exogenous eÔ¨Äort and Ô¨Åxed costs. It is convenient, therefore, for us

to normalize exogenous eÔ¨Äort to zero and measure Ô¨Åxed costs relative to ei = ec = 0.

The size of Ô¨Åxed costs is to be understood in our simulations relative to the value of

oÔ¨Éce W , the value of access parameters v0 and Œ±, and the cost of access parameter, Œ¥.

For this purpose it is very useful to focus on the minimum value of contributions H min

needed to obtain positive eÔ¨Äort, and on the utility enjoyed at that minimum level of



                                            16
contributions. For the incumbent, for a given probability of election p, we have

                                                           1/(1+Œ±)
                                                      Ki
                                     Himin   =                         .
                                                     pœÄv0

The expected utility of the incumbent at H min is

                                                         Œ¥i /(1+Œ±) 
                                                   Ki
                                    p W‚àí                                   .
                                                  pœÄv0

Assuming a reservation utility of zero, if expected utility is less than or equal to zero at

H min , entry is impossible. Solving for the value of Ki which just makes expected utility

equal to zero, we have Kimax = pœÄv0 W (1+Œ±)/Œ¥i .

      In simulating the model we chose parameter values in part so that the Ô¨Åxed costs

are small in the sense that Ki /Kimax is small.17 If Ô¨Åxed costs are close to Kimax and

Kc > Ki , then it is very diÔ¨Écult for the challenger to be considered viable, even if

the candidates are symmetric in all other respects. Hence, the challenger will have

a very diÔ¨Écult time raising money. We believe this is not a particularly compelling

scenario since the explanation for uncontested races would simply be large Ô¨Åxed costs.

In contrast, when the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed costs are small, the mere presence of Ô¨Åxed costs

does not obviously give rise to uncontested races.

      In the simulations presented below, we assume that candidates are symmetric in

most respects. For instance, we assume they are similar in their ability to provide

access (i.e., Œ¥i = Œ¥c = 2) and in their marginal cost of campaign eÔ¨Äort (i.e., bi = bc = 1).

We also assume Œ≤ = 0.5, œÄ = 0.3, and the value of being elected is W = 10, 000. Finally,

we assume that the value of access without any congestion from other buyers is v0 = 70.

      In our simulations we characterize whether the campaign is contested as the other
 17
      Similar methods characterize what it means for Kc to be small.


                                                     17
key parameters in the model vary. We consider two alternative values for the elasticity

of the value of access, Œ± = {‚àí0.7, ‚àí0.9} and two sizes of the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed costs,

Ki = {1, 3}. Given this parameterization the smallest value of Kimax implied is 21p100.2 ,

which implies that the largest value of Ki /Kimax used in our simulations is equal to 0.09p.

This is a deliberately extreme small value for the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed costs, one which

gives a deliberately large share of the parameter space in which contested races can

emerge in equilibrium.18

       In Figures 1 and 2 we depict our simulation results. On the x-axis we measure the

candidates relative ex ante prospects. As will become clear, it is convenient to normalize

the metric as œâ = (1 ‚àí ¬µ)/¬µ. Without loss of generality we assume that ¬µ ‚â• 1/2.19

When the two candidates have the same ex ante probability of winning (i.e., ¬µ = 1/2),

œâ = 1. As the incumbent is increasingly favored by the electorate, (i.e., ¬µ increases), œâ

falls. In the limit, when the incumbent is guaranteed a victory (¬µ = 1), œâ = 0. Thus,

the œâ should be interpreted as a measure of the challenger‚Äôs initial prospects.

       On the y-axis we measure the relative Ô¨Åxed costs, Œ∫ = Ki /Kc . It is reasonable to

assume that the challenger has at least as large Ô¨Åxed costs as the incumbent, Kc ‚â• Ki .

As the challenger is burdened with larger and larger Ô¨Åxed costs Œ∫ falls. Thus, in the

Ô¨Ågures at the point (œâ = 1, Œ∫ = 1) the candidates are completely symmetric. As we

move to the southwest the candidates become increasingly dissimilar or asymmetric.

       In each of the Ô¨Ågures we report whether in our simulations the race is contested.

For each set of parameter values we plot a line that divides the box into two subspaces.

The region above the plotted line contains parameter values which support a contested
  18
     If the equilibrium probability for contested races is around 1/2, the ratio Ki /Kimax < 1/5. In other
words, the largest Ô¨Åxed costs considered in our simulations is less than one-Ô¨Åfth of the value which
would preclude entry.
  19
     It seems sensible that at the time the campaign begins the incumbent would be as least as likely to
win as the challenger.


                                                   18
equilibrium. The region below contains parameter values for which only corner solutions

exist.

    We begin by looking at Figure 1 where we set Ki = 1. In the Ô¨Ågure we contrast the

solutions for two diÔ¨Äerent values of Œ±, the elasticity of the value of access, which is best

interpreted as a congestion externality. In other words, the value of access to a given

lobby decreases as in the number of lobbies seeking access.

    The Ô¨Ågure highlights several key insights. First, the more similar are the candidates,

the more likely will races be contested. That is, for parameter values in northeast region

(i.e., high œâ and high Œ∫), races are contested. For parameter values in southwest region

(i.e., low œâ and low Œ∫), races are uncontested. This is consistent with the empirical

Ô¨Ånding the uncontested races tend to occur in the same House district year after year

where a popular incumbent runs year after year; conversely, landslide victories rarely

occur in open seat races, where the candidates are far more likely to be viewed as ex

ante similar by the electorate (Gierzynski, 2000).

    Second, for a given value of relative Ô¨Åxed costs, races are more likely to be uncon-

tested the larger is the incumbent‚Äôs ex ante advantage (i.e., the higher is ¬µ). When

relative Ô¨Åxed costs are suÔ¨Éciently diÔ¨Äerent, even races where the candidates have iden-

tical ex ante prospects (¬µ = 1/2 or œâ = 1) are uncontested. Conversely, for a given value

of ¬µ, races are more likely to uncontested the larger are challenger‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed costs. And,

when the incumbent is suÔ¨Éciently favored (¬µ is large), even races where the candidates

have identical Ô¨Åxed costs are uncontested

    Third, as we vary the parameter characterizing the elasticity of the value of access,

the likelihood of contested races changes. In the Ô¨Ågure we depict two values for the

elasticity, one where the congestion externality is relatively low (Œ± = ‚àí0.7) and one

where the congestion externality is relatively high (Œ± = ‚àí0.9). We Ô¨Ånd that the higher


                                            19
the congestion eÔ¨Äect, the more diÔ¨Écult it will be for the challenger to raise funds.

The reason: a high congestion externality reduces the value to contributing. This

exacerbates the incumbent‚Äôs advantages of relatively low Ô¨Åxed costs and high initial

favorability. As a result, the challenger Ô¨Ånds herself unable to raise funds. In our

example, the fraction of parameter space involving uncontested races jumps from 28%

to 54% when the congestion externality increases. Of course, the exact percentage of

uncontested races depends on the precise parameter values, but the lesson is clear: the

role of Ô¨Åxed costs is magniÔ¨Åed when the candidates diÔ¨Äer in other dimensions. And,

this means our variant of the Baron model can plausibly explain the high frequency of

uncontested House and Senate races.

      Figure 2 highlights that the level of Ô¨Åxed costs, not just their relative magnitudes,

inÔ¨Çuence the type of outcomes observed. In this Ô¨Ågure we hold the congestion externality

constant (Œ± = ‚àí0.7) but we now let the size of the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed cost be either low

(Ki = 1) or higher (Ki = 3).20 On the y-axis we continue to depict the candidates‚Äô

relative Ô¨Åxed costs, Œ∫, and assume that the challenger has at least as large Ô¨Åxed costs

as the incumbent.

      Once again, the model generates predictions that are consistent with empirical Ô¨Ånd-

ings. First, just as we saw in Figure 1, the more similar are the candidates, the more

likely will the races be contested. In other words, parameter values in the northeast

region give rise to contested races while those in the southwest give rise to uncontested

races. Second, diÔ¨Äerences between the candidates become increasingly important the

higher are Ô¨Åxed costs. In particular, for a given Œ∫, the lower are the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed

costs the larger ¬µ must be before a race is uncontested. In simple terms, the lower are

Ô¨Åxed costs, the more likely will races be contested. In our simulation, the fraction of

      We once again emphasize that Ki = 3 is still small relative to W and v0 .


                                                   20
parameter space involving uncontested races goes from 28% to 55% when Ô¨Åxed costs

increase. We emphasize that even the higher value of Ô¨Åxed costs is ‚Äòsmall‚Äô relative to

the value of oÔ¨Éce and the revenue of the Ô¨Årst units of access sold. Or, put another

way, the expected utility at the minimum level of H is large so it is not unreasonable

to expect challengers to contest the race. Nonetheless, the simulations reveal that even

small Ô¨Åxed costs can generate uncontested races.

   Taking Figure 1 and 2 together, the simulations conÔ¨Årm that a generalization of the

Baron model of electoral competition can generate competition patterns consistent with

the empirical observation that a large number of campaign races are uncontested.


6. Concluding Comments

In this paper we oÔ¨Äer a generalization of Baron‚Äôs (1989) model of electoral competition.

By introducing Ô¨Åxed costs and exogenous campaign eÔ¨Äort, we show that a Baron-type

formulation can generate predictions consistent with observed patterns of electoral com-

petition: namely, only one candidate reports signiÔ¨Åcant PAC contributions in many

House and Senate races.

   The Ô¨Åxed cost of campaigning allows a role for strategic play in two dimensions.

First, the expenditure of initial funds (or what we refer to as exogenous eÔ¨Äort) raises

the perceived probability of reelection and hence the price at which access may be sold

subsequently to PACs. It thus confers an advantage in the subsequent contributions

competition with a rival. Second, there is the war chest eÔ¨Äect: strategic accumula-

tion of campaign contributions to deter entry of serious challengers. Third, party-level

contributions can potentially serve to stimulate PAC contributions. That is, party con-

tributions can make a weak candidate viable, and by doing so ‚Äúprime the pump‚Äù so that



                                          21
non-party PACs Ô¨Ånd it worthwhile to contribute. In a companion paper (Anderson and

Prusa, 2001) we analyze these issues in greater detail.

The Reduced Form Probability Function

    The model implies that the probability depends on eÔ¨Äort, while eÔ¨Äort depends on

the probability. Further analysis requires a reduced form solution for the probability in

terms of (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).

    Using the expressions for (1), (2), and (3), total candidate eÔ¨Äort is given by:
                 Ô£±
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£≤ei + [pœÄv(Hi )Hi ‚àí Ki ]/bi        if pœÄv(Hi )Hi ‚àí Ki ‚â• 0,
        ei =
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£≥ei                        otherwise.
                 Ô£±
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£≤ec + [(1 ‚àí p)œÄv(Hc )Hc ‚àí Kc ]/bc if (1 ‚àí p)œÄv(Hc )Hc ‚àí Kc ‚â• 0,
        ec =
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£¥
                 Ô£≥ec                                           otherwise.


    For an interior solution, we can obtain the reduced form by dividing the numerator

and denominator of (1) by ¬µeŒ≤i and substituting eÔ¨Äort levels. The rational expectations

equilibrium condition is

                                                                    1
               p = g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) =                                         Œ≤   .   (A.1)

             1‚àí¬µ    bi
where œâ =     ¬µ     bc    . The reduced form probability function is


                     P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) = {p : p = g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc )} .


Existence and Uniqueness of the Equilibrium Probability

    Existence of the Ô¨Åxed point solution of the equation deÔ¨Åning P (¬∑) can be guaranteed


                                                  25
but uniqueness obtains only with restrictions. As for existence, so long as at least one

candidate campaigns actively we show that 1 > g(1, ¬∑) > g(0, ¬∑) > 0. Since g(p, ¬∑) is

continuous on the unit interval, it must cross the 45 degree line satisfying p = g(p, ¬∑)

somewhere in the unit interval, hence a Ô¨Åxed point exists.

   There is a technical complication in the positive eÔ¨Äort requirement. To simplify

notation deÔ¨Åne p = Ki /[v(Hi )Hi ], p = 1 ‚àí Kc /[v(Hc )Hc ].

   For Hi and Hc both small (i.e., pœÄv(Hi )Hi ‚àí Ki ‚â§ 0 and (1 ‚àí p)œÄv(Hc )Hc ‚àí Kc ‚â§ 0),

neither campaign is active and


                 g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) = 1/[1 + œâ (bc ec /bi ei )Œ≤ ]    for all p.     (A.2)


   For Hc small we have

   It is straightforward to show that 1 > g(1) > g(p) > g(p) > g(0) > 0 and g(p) is

continuous on the unit interval, as claimed.

   The Ô¨Åxed point solution p need not be unique. Uniqueness follows if gp < 1 for

For p < p, Ac disappears and for p > p, Ai disappears. Examining the expression

for gp , uniqueness cannot generally be guaranteed, since Ac + Ai can exceed one by

enough to oÔ¨Äset the inÔ¨Çuence of the Ô¨Årst three terms. For large v(Hc )Hc and v(Hi )Hi ,

at equilibrium p = g, gp and converges to Œ≤. As v(Hc )Hc and v(Hi )Hi fall, their eÔ¨Äect

                 ‚àÇHi        Hi [bi ei + pv(Hi )Hi ‚àí Ki ]

where the elasticities are deÔ¨Åned as


                             Œµi ‚â° ‚àív(Hi )/[v  (Hi )Hi ] > 1

                             Œµc ‚â° ‚àív(Hc )/[v  (Hc )Hc ] > 1


   Ac + Ai falls with contributions as bi ei ‚àí Ki > 0 and bc ec ‚àí Kc > 0. Ac + Ai rises

with contributions as bi ei ‚àí Ki < 0 and bc ec ‚àí Kc < 0.



                                             27
     Therefore a suÔ¨Écient condition for uniqueness is Œ≤ < 1, bi ei ‚àíKi > 0 and bc ec ‚àíKc >

0.

Comparative Statics of the Probability Function

     We now consider the comparative statics of the equilibrium probability P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).

We will show that the incumbent‚Äôs probability is increasing in her own contributions

and decreasing in the rival‚Äôs contributions, assuming the uniqueness condition discussed

above is satisÔ¨Åed.

The denominator is positive while the numerator is positive for the portion of the inverse

demand curve for which revenue is increasing in sales.

     As for the Ô¨Åxed costs, we anticipate that the incumbent‚Äôs probability is decreasing

in her own Ô¨Åxed costs and increasing in rival‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed costs. The Ô¨Åxed costs aÔ¨Äect P (¬∑)

   The second derivatives of the reduced form probability function are needed to eval-

uate the comparative statics of the Nash equilibrium in the contributions game. From

the analysis of the Nash game interior solution we know that PHi Ki > 0 is a suÔ¨Écient

condition for a rise in Ki to shift the incumbent‚Äôs oÔ¨Äer of Hi upward for any value of Hc ,

i.e., dHi /dKi > 0 while maintaining the marginal proÔ¨Åt condition for the incumbent.

    The conditions given suÔ¨Éce to sign all terms but gpp . The Ô¨Årst term of the square

bracketed expression in gpp is negative for g > 1/2. The second term is ambiguous.

Hereafter we will assume that gpp < 0.

    Taking all the second derivative expressions and using the Ô¨Årst derivative signs we

have shown



                  PHi Ki > 0, for g > 1/2, gp < 1, gpp < 0, ei ‚àí Ki < 0.

The condition g ‚â• 1/2 basically requires that the incumbent have an advantage. The

                                                30
other conditions are merely technical.

   It can similarly be shown that


                 PHc Ki < 0, for g > 1/2, gp < 1, gpp < 0, ec ‚àí Kc > 0.


   These technical conditions are over-suÔ¨Écient for the economically intuitive signs on

the second derivatives of the reduced form probability function. The conditions imply

that the marginal eÔ¨Äect of own eÔ¨Äort on election probability is increasing in own Ô¨Åxed

cost and in rival‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed cost (recalling that 1‚àíP is the challenger‚Äôs election probability).

The intuition comes from (A.1).

   A rise in own Ô¨Åxed cost lowers own eÔ¨Äort, all else equal, and for Œ≤ < 1, the marginal

eÔ¨Äect of own eÔ¨Äort on election probability is decreasing in own eÔ¨Äort, pei ei < 0. Thus a

rise in own Ô¨Åxed cost raises the marginal eÔ¨Äect of own eÔ¨Äort on election probability. The

rise in rival‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed cost lowers the rival‚Äôs eÔ¨Äort, all else equal. With p ‚â• 1/2, pei ec > 0,

implying that the marginal beneÔ¨Åt of own eÔ¨Äort is lowered by a rise in rival‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed cost.

Existence of interior Nash equilibrium‚ÄîSymmetric candidates

   With symmetric candidates and zero Ô¨Åxed costs an interior Nash equilibrium always

exists. Existence is proved by showing that the Ô¨Årst order conditions are satisÔ¨Åed at

Hi = Hc ,


                  i
                 œàH i
                        = 0 = [W ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶(Hi )]PHi ‚àí P (¬∑)œÄ‚Ñ¶ (Hi )
                  c
                 œàH c
                        = 0 = ‚àí[W ‚àí œÄŒì(Hc )]PHc ‚àí [1 ‚àí P (¬∑)]œÄŒì (Hc ).


With symmetric candidates, the access cost function and the campaign cost function are

common, so ‚Ñ¶(H) = Œì(H). At the symmetric equilibrium, p = P (¬∑) = g(¬∑) = 1/2 and



                                             31
PHi = ‚àíPHc based the properties of P (¬∑) developed earlier in the Appendix. Therefore

the equations are indeed satisÔ¨Åed at Hi = Hc . There is no guarantee, however, that the

symmetric equilibrium is unique even with common access and campaign cost functions.

Strategic Complementarity

   Strategic complementarity obtains if


                      i
                     œàH i Hc
                                 = [W ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶]PHi Hc ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶ PHc > 0,
                      c
                     œàH c Hi
                                 = ‚àí[W ‚àí œÄŒì]PHi Hc + œÄŒì PHi > 0.


Using the Ô¨Årst order conditions we can rewrite these as

                                         PHi Hc
                        i
                       œàH i Hc
                                  = P œÄ‚Ñ¶       ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶ PHc ,
                                          PHi
                                                PH H
                        c
                       œàH c Hi
                                  = ‚àí[1 ‚àí P ]œÄŒì i c + œÄŒì PHi .
                                                 PHc

Drawing on the derivations earlier in the Appendix we know that at the symmetric

equilibrium we know that PHi Hc = 0 if g = 1/2 and bj ej ‚àí Kj = 0, j = i, c. Strategic

complementarity follows directly in this case.

   However, these conditions are clearly over-suÔ¨Écient. Recall that all second deriva-

tives of g have terms in 1 ‚àí 2g, so near the symmetric equilibrium PHi Hc is close to

zero. Therefore, near a symmetric equilibrium the second term will dominate and the

contributions will be strategic complements.

Fixed cost asymmetry

                                            32
derivatives are


                       i
                      œàH i Kj
                                 = [W ‚àí œÄ‚Ñ¶(Hi )]PHi Kj ‚àí PKj œÄ‚Ñ¶
                       c
                      œàH c Kj
                                 = ‚àí[W ‚àí œÄŒì(Hc )]PHc Kj + PKj œÄŒì .


   Earlier in the Appendix we have provided the conditions when


                  PKi < 0,      PKc > 0,   PHi Ki > 0,   PHi Kj < 0, k = j.


                     k
   These imply that œàH k Kj
                                              k
                            > 0, j = k while œàH k Kj
                                                     ‚â∂ 0, j = k. Since D > 0, own eÔ¨Äects

dominate cross eÔ¨Äects in the matrix expression and therefore ordinarily dHj /dKj > 0,

j = i, c. This can be guaranteed in the neighborhood of symmetric equilibrium.

   In contrast, dHj /dKk ‚â∑ 0, k = j. In general, dHj /dKk > 0 when the absolute value
    c
of œàH                                   i
           is less than (greater than) œàH      for j = i, (j = c). This can be guaranteed in
      c Kj                                i Kj

                                              c
the neighborhood of a symmetric equilibrium: œàH c Kj
                                                     = ‚àíœàH
                                                         i
                                                           i Ki
                                                                + S; S > 0.
                                        c
   Even so, dHj /dKk > 0 requires that œàH      be small. This indeed is the economically
                                          c Kj

intuitive case‚Äîa rise in the incumbent‚Äôs Ô¨Åxed cost shifts the incumbent‚Äôs best response

function upward, does not shift the challenger‚Äôs best response function by much, and

thus induces both candidates to work harder. There is, however, a subtlety created by

the dependence of p on eÔ¨Äort while eÔ¨Äort depends on p. The reduced form structure

of P implies that the challenger‚Äôs best response function is also shifted by the rise in

incumbent Ô¨Åxed cost and this can turn out to lower the challenger‚Äôs equilibrium Hc .

obtain even if dHc /dKi < 0 and dHi /dKc < 0.
