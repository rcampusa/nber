        It   has often been asserted that imposition of environmental regulations

in the 1970's may be a partial explanation for the productivity growth

Siodowfls experienced by most industrialized countries during that decade.

The contention is that expenses incurred to satisfy these regulations, such as

investment in pollution abatement capital, is unproductive in terms of

measured output. Thus conventional productivity measures will be biased

downward when such regulations are imposed. In this paper we construct a

model which explicitly recognizes the difference between pollution abatement

capital and "productive" capital and then use this framework to devleop an

adjustment to nonparametric measures of productivity growth, purging them of

the bias resulting from regulation. We measure the bias for the manufacturing

sectors of three countries, the U.S., Canada and Germany, and thereby assess

the impact of increased pollution abatement capital regulation on productivity

growth. Our principal finding is that the bias, which depends on relative

rates of growth of output and pollution abatement capital investment, is

modest.

 I. Introduction




      The imposition of environmental regulations has often been suggested as a

 partial 'explanation for the productivity growth slowdown experienced by most

 industrialized countries in   the   early 1970's. The contention is that

 investments are foregone because resources that otherwise would be productive

must be used to satify the regulations, and the goal of the regulations

pollution abatement -— has no marketable and therefore quantifiable effect in

terms of productivity. This hypothesis has been explored by researchers such as

Denison [19791, who attempted to determine the effects of environmental

regulation by first estimating the incremental costs of production due to

environmental regulations, and then using these estimates to impute the

percentage reduction in output per unit of input attributable to regulation.

Similarly, Norsworthy et al [1979] assessed the impact of environmental

regulat.ions by removing the pollution abatement: capital component of total

capital input to purge the capital measure of "unproductive" capital. Gollop

and Roberts [1983] instead included regulation in a long run total cost function

and used econometric estimates of the production technology to determine the

biases resulting from regulations. Some researchers including Crandall [1980]

and Christiansen and Haveman [1981] emphasize the impact of more indirect and

difficult to quantify impacts of regulations, including discouraging otherwise

productive investments and technological innovations.

     it has also been asserted that environmental regulation may instead

facilitate economic growth. This hypothesis has been suggested by Meyers and

Nakamura [1980] who use a putty--clay model to show that it is possible for

increasingly stringent environmental regulation to cause more capital turnover,

and therefore modernization, so t:hat the net effect may be increased

productivity growth.
                                           2
     Finally, some researchers have recently focused on the impacts on

international, competitiveness of environmental regulations and resulting ]ow

productivity growth in the U .S.An       important   example of this is Kalt [1985] who

asserts that the U.S. is at an extreme disadvantage in international markets

because of the depressing impacts of environmental regulations, especially since

regulations in the U.S. are SO    cost--ineffective.
     It is clear that there is a wide range of methods and focuses in studies

about the impact of environmental regulations on productivity, arid no clear

consensus of the magnitude —-    or   even direction —--   of   the impacts, how to

quantify these impacts, or what the international effects of the regulations may

be. In addition, the impact of these regulations has not, generally, been

motivated within an explicit mode] of the behavior of firms when faced with

regulations on a resource which, without regulation, is a free good to the firm.

Most existing models which consider the impacts of regulation on productivity

growth calculations, either adjust output or input in an ad-hoc manner, or

simply consider regulation to be an additional input into the production process

and use an econometric model. Other studies are not, strictly speaking, based

on a theoretical model but instead assess as many costs of regulation as are

quantifiable given available data. Virtually no studies then place these

estimates in an international context that allows comparison of the relative

impacts of regulation on productivity growth across countries.

     In this paper we develop a model of the decisions of a firm facing a

standard for pollution emissions, which explicitly recognizes the effects of

environmental standards and resulting pollution abatement capital investments,

This model permits consideration of the explicit and implicit costs of

purchasing pollution abatement capital to satisfy these regulations, and the

values to the firm of compliance with the regulation. The framework

incorporates the notion that the pollution abatement capital is not productive
                                          3
    in the usual sense; it is unproductive in terms of measured output and therefore

    should not be treated like a productive input for productivity calculations.

        The implications for measurement of productivity growth from the

    theoretical model incorporating pollution abatement capital investment are

    straightforward to implement nonparametrically, and are therefore useful for

    applied researchers. The resulting impact on measured productivity growth as

compared to the measurements generated by traditional methods is, however,

    theoretically ambiguous. The costs incurred from pollution abatement capital

purchases are separated from production capital costs, so any upward bias in

capital growth from sudden increases in pollution abatement capital investment

is purged. The benefits accruing to expenditures on pollution abatement capital

are implicitly also taken into account; they are represented by a shadow value

characterizing the value of the standard at the margin.1 This value, which is

equivalent to the cost of pollution abatement capital on the margin, is

incorporated as an adjustment to the weight on output change in the productivity

measurements. This may counteract the capital change impact. Thus, as

recognized by Meyers and Nakamura, the impact of environmental regulations is an

empirical issue which depends on which effect dominates.

        Perhaps the most important contribution of the current study is not the

framework —- even though the theoretical justification of the adjustment process

for productivity measurement is very important --    but the comparison between the
manufacturing sectors of three important industrial countries, the U.S. , Canada,

and Germany. This comparison allows consideration of the relative impacts of

environmental regulations among the three countries, and therefore of the impact




1

Theoretically this value could be interpreted as an implicit measure of some
of the indirect costs of regulations including regulation—induced inefficiency
from discouraging technological innovation or other more productive investment
which would have a higher shadow value. Empirically these effects cannot be
distinguished, however, because the data available cannot usefully distinguish
between the ex—st returns to the two types of capital.
                                         4

on   international competitiveness   of these regulations. The alternative ways

countries have dealt with environmental concerns, and    the   resulting effect on

relative production growth, can therefore be assessed in this framework.

       Note finally that the methods here, as for any productivity measurement

studies which explicitly are based on a model of the production process, do not

recognize pollution abatement as a beneficial "output". It is clear that if

environmental impacts were marketable, "returns" to abatement would compensate

     to a greater or lesser extent—-- for the decrease in marketed output.

Production—oriented studies cannot assess the social benefits from abatement,

but the theoretical framework for this study, through the shadow valuation of

the capital investment required for abatement, does provide an implication about

how to assess the implied value society has placed on environmental protection

by imposing standards. This information could be used, if benefit data were

available, to determine whether the standards imposed on the industry were at

the appropriate level to facilitate social optimization.

       The paper proceeds in Section II by developing the theoretical model used

as a basis for the approach, and the resulting implications for productivity

measurement. Section III then presents and discusses standard and pollution

abatement capital-adjusted productivity indexes, and average yearly percentage

productivity growth rates, for the manufacturing industries of the J.S. in

1960-80, Canada in 1967-80 and Germany in 1972-81. The final section includes

concluding remarks and suggestions for further research.



I I. ModLcation


      The model of firm behavior including environmental standards is in the

spirit of Conrad [1985] and Dasgupta [1982]. The firms production decision is

assumed to be based on the maximization of profits by the choice of output (x),
                                               5

variable inputs (v) and investment in both productive capital (I, with stock

level K) and pollution abatement capital (IPA and KPA). This problem can be

written as:


1) max                                  -            -
             JIPA E ert{ptxt                             PI(ItIPAt)

subject to

                  ÷
a) Kt+j =     K       1       6Kt


b) KPA1 =       KPAt
                          ÷         - 6KPA

c) TE =

d)       -
             f(KPA).TE        0,



The maximization process represented by (1) is standard, where Pt IS the price

of output at time t so ptxt is equal to revenue, G(.) is the variable cost

function representing the optimized choice of variable inputs for any given xt,

Kt vector and input prices qj and P1 is the common asset price of investment.

goods so PI(It÷IPAt) is the expenditure on investment in both types of capital.

Note that the variable cost function is assumed to depend on K but not KPA since

KPA is not productive. (Ia) and (ib) also are typical definitions.            (Ic) and

(id), however, require some explanation.

     (In) represents the flow of pollution from the production process without

regulation. TE stands for total emissions, in this sense the unabated total

rate of discharge of pollutants,             is an emission to output parameter which

represents the constant proportional relationship between pollutant discharge

and production when no standards and therefore no pollution abatement capital

exist. The reduction of emissions requires additional costs associated only

with pollution abatement. This reduction therefore is a function of the level
                                       6


of pollution abatement capital, XPA, and is represented by f(KPA). The

resulting   level of emissions, denoted nonabated omissions (NE)    is
characterized by (id), where NE is the standard set for allowable emissions.

f(KPA) is a positive but decreasing function since increasing the pollution

abatement capital stock causes the amount of emissions to decline; f'(KPA)<O.

In addition, the second derivative of this function should be positive so that

the contribution of incremental units of KPA diminishes as the stock of KPA

increases; and f(°°)=O so that if KPA-O, NE=O.

     Note that this model does not require knowledge of the stock of pollutants

because regulation is assumed to be on emissions. This can be adapted to apply

to regulations about the existing stock instead of flow of emissions as

developed by Dasgupta [19821. Note also that this approach does not require a

damage function because valuation of the damage is implicitly incorporated in

the specification of the standard, although a damage function can be

incorporated in a straightforward manner2. The balance of the (private and

social) benefits received from production and the costs imposed by the pollution

are therefore captured by the profit function and the constraint and

corresponding shadow value, respectively.

     The constrained maximization facing the firm from (1) can therefore be

written as:


2) maxXIIPA E ert{ptxt         -
                                                 PI(It+IPAt)} -   .(f(KpA).   -
subject   to (la) and (ib).




p_______________________
Again see Dasgupta [1982] for an outline of an approach including a damage
function as compared to a standard. If the damage function is a threshold
type of function where the marginal damage is very large in the neighborhood
of a given level of emissions (in the Dasgupta framework, the stock) these two
approache, are equivalent.

         We   assume both K and KPA, the state variables, as well as output, xt, are

    chosen by the firm in each time period to optimize (1). The first order

conditions for the control variable xt and the state variables Kt and KPAt which

    capture the investment paths 1 and IPAt can therefore be written as:

3a)       p —   G   —   t.f(KPA)       =   0              SO                 t.f(KPA)E =    G
                                                ,
                                                                    Pt

                        GK                                                       _GK


c)        —PI(r÷6) —    r.f'(KPA)x          =       0,     so                =    —t.f'(KPA).Ex

where T=T.(l+r)              the current (undiscounted) shadow value of non-abated

emissions, and q is the rental price of capital goods (the expost price) which

is assumed the same for both KPA and K because P1, r, and 6 are assumed the

same.3 Note that even though this approach is based on long run analysis, if

qK is calculated as the ex—post price the analysis is consistent with a story

based on slow adjustment; the capital stocks are evaluated at their shadow

values rather than their ex—ante prices which may not reflect the true marginal

product.

         These first order conditions provide interesting inferences.                             (3a), for

example, captures the typical assertion in the pollution literature that

additional revenue with a change in output must cover both the change in

production costs and the extra required costs of abatement on the margin;

"extra" profit must be made to pay for pollution abatement capital expenses

associated with production.                -t       is   positive because it represents a cost to the

firm —— an emission charge reflecting the undesirable effects of pollution. The

This assumption is not necessary for the analysis, and in some cases it may
not be justified.  If it is not used, however, the return to the two types of
capital cannot be identified individually and non—parametric methods of
analysis cannot be used. In this case econometric analysis to separately
identify the shadow prices of K and KPA would be necessary. See Berndt and
Fuss [19851 for a discussion of the importance of evaluating the contribution
of fixed inputs by their shadow values.
                                                 8

firm will therefore reduce production from that which it would choose without

regulation; it will try to maximize, not simply profit from production, but

profit net of emission charges. (3b) says that q =               0K   is the value of having

more capital in terms of using less inputs to produce a given output —--             the

shadow value of capital discussed by Lau [1978].               (3c) is the corresponding

shadow value determination equation for KPA, including the recognition of (1)

the   social    valuation of pollution ——       or   the damage resulting from the pollution

      represented by the standard, and (ii) the nonproductive nature of the

pollution abatement capital stock represented by the lack of a 0KPA term. More

specifically, the shadow value of KPA, —r'f'(KPA)x, is a foregone "tax" that

would implicitly have had to be paid to compensate society for not meeting the

standard.

       I   is   an important parameter in this analysis. It captures the shadow value

—-    in terms    of costs --   of   non-abated emissions. In particular,

           — f(KPA)Ex   > 0     -+   t=0
                         =0 -,       1>0

Thus if the constraint is not binding, i.e., if >f(KPA)x, the valuation of

the constraint at the margin, t,           is   zero. This shadow valuation of the

constraint, -r, has an interesting interpretation. If a standard exists and it

is binding, I       represents the standard because it values the standard at the
margin. It can therefore be interpreted as the implied tax rate or marginal

valuation of the damage function that would cause the required level of

abatement, which satisfies the standard, to be met. Note that t does not

represent a tax schedule or damage function except at the margin; it is an

implicit valuation balancing the private costs of satisfying the standard and

the social benefits from attenuating the damage of the pollutants which prompted

the standard,4

Note that if I can be identified, which is possib1e with an econometric
investigation. it will therefore capture the implied valuation by society of

        (3a,b,c) can be rewritten to facilitate consideration of the homogeneity

 properties of the functions as:

        C                          G                      C


Note that the last equality, (5c), requires the f(KPA) function to be

homogeneous of degree (—1). This assumption is not necessary to impose for the

analysis but is a useful simplifying assumption. It is not possible in general

to determine the degree of homogeneity of f(KPA).

      The expressions in (5) can be employed to motivate the definition of the

total cost function, C, and define homogeneity properties of G and C.

Homogeneity of degree one (constant returns to scale) of C implies that

ln G/ln x +         ln G/ln K =                  1   (see Lau [1978]). From (5), this implies that
p.x/C — T.NE/G —             q.K/G     —    I    for each time period t. Rewriting this equality

results in p.x = C + r.NE +                      q.K,     which, using (5c), is equivalent to p.x =   C   +

q.KPA   ÷   qj<.K
                    —-       the   firm's total costs, C. More specifically, the firm pays

variable plus capital costs for production and q.KPA for the corresponding

required pollution abatement. This regulatory cost is equivalent on the margin

to the valuation of emitted pollutants to society, so the cost function can be

written in terms of either cost. The t.NE cost component, however, is implicit.

Thus the expression based on this component is not very useful for empirical

analysis.




the damage on the margin and can be used to assess the implications of the
standard.

       It is easy         to       show that this implies homogeneity of degree one                                    also for    the

Since p.x/C is equal to one by definition and t.NE=q.KPA, this is clearly equal

to one.

       The specification of the cost function above can be used to derive a cost--

side productivity measure, capturing 1n C/st, similarly to standard accounting

productivity measures but adjusting for the fact that KPA is not a productive

input. To accomplish this, it is first necessary to determine the total

is based on purging the effect of pollution abatement capital from the output.

measure, to capture marginal costs for the actual output, and removing the KPA

component from the total capital stock, since KPA does not contribute to

production and therefore productivity.

     Note that the effect of the pollution abatement adjustment on productivity

is ambiguous in sign; if productivity is incorrectly calculated as (11) instead

of (10) the weight on the din x/dt term (which has a positive sign) is higher
                                             12

(one instead of one minus a positive number), the weight on the din K/dt term

(which has a negative sign) is higher, and the din K/dt term is calculated as

the change in tota.l capital rather than just productive capital compared to the

correct calculation in (10). The difference depends, therefore, on the relative

magnitudes of the din x/dt, din K/dt and din (K÷KPA)/dt terms and cannot be

unambiguously signed.

      To more directly see the effect of the pollution abatement adjustment on

productivity we subtract from (10) the standard expression (11). The resulting

bias h is:


                                                    k    K    K'A KPA

If   productivity is incorrectly calculated as in (11) instead of (10), the bias

term is ignored. If growth of pollution abatement capital exceeds growth of

output the standard expression underestimates productivity change. If KPA and x

grow by the same rate the bias b is zero; the downwards correction of the weight

of output growth by the cost share of abatement capital equals the upwards

correction by not subtracting in the adjusted measure the weighted growth of

pollution abatement capital.

 III. Epirical_Results



 lila. Data

     The U.S. and Canadian manufacturing data for capital, labor and Output

prices and quantities respectively were provided by Berndt and Wood [1984] and

G.Campbel.l Watkins [1985]. The corresponding German data were provided by Unger

[1985].

     The pollution abatement capital data for the U.S. is based on data on

capital stocks and expenditure (constant and current) for pollution abatement

capital equipment presented in Kappler and Rutledge [1982]. This data was used

to determine a beginning capital stock and investment over the period in

pollution abatement capital. The price of capital was calculated from the zero

profit condition as the ex—post price of the total capital stock, including K

and KPA. The Canadian pollution abatement capital data is more sparse. The

data used is from the Statistics Canada publication Water and Air Pollution

Abatement_Expenditures, which provides information on air and water pollution

expenditures only for 1970-75. This data is, however, based on the Class 24 and

27 CCA claims available in the Statistics Canada publication Corporation

Taxation Statistics. The data from this publication was therefore used to

extrapolate the 1970-75 expenditure numbers forward and backward. The price

index for pollution abatement capital was assumed to be equivalent to that for

capital as a whole, since an ex-post price was used and it is not possible to

distinguish between returns to the two individual capital inputs separately.

For the German data, data collection on the costs of environmental protection

regulations began in 1970 with the proclamation of an environmental protection

program by the German government. The data on net investment for pollution
                                          14

abatement equipment for the   years   1971 75 have been developed by the

Umweltbundesamt (Federal   Office for the      Environment)   in   Berlin. Since   1975

these data have been published yearly by the StatistischesBundesamt.               To

determine a capital stock series we made an assumption for the           beginning      capital

stock   in 1970 and cumulated these investment data according to the perpetual
inventory method.




IlIb. Results
        The productivity indexes calculated for the empirical comparison comprise
indexes    computed in a standard way including pollution abatement capital as part

of the capital stock (as in (11)) and "adjusted" indexes (corresponding to (10))

which do not include pollution abatement capital as a productive input. These

indexes were computed for the U.S. for 1960-80, Canada for 1967-80 and Germany

for 1972-81 and are reported in Tables 1,2, and 3 respectively. Only one

"variable" input was considered, labor, so the indexes represent multifactor

productivity growth for value added. The differences between the standard and

adjusted measures were also calculated and are presented as the third columns of

the tables. Summary information in terms of averages over selected time periods

are reported at the bottom of the Tables.

        The first point to note is that in all of these countries, especially the

U.S. and Canada, response to regu1ations is spread out and often delayed as long

as possible because penalties for non—compliance are, in practice, usually not

very large. This makes it very difficult to pinpoint a particular year in which

environmental regulations should begin to make a difference for productivity

measures.     In both North American countries, however, in the beginning of the

1970's purposive environmental regulation at the Federal level really commenced;
                                       15

one would therefore not expect a large impact of environmental regulations on

productivity measurements before this time. In Germany the timing is very

similar; 1971 is the year in which the government became an active participant

in environmental control. The impacts of environmental regulation should

therefore take place approximately during the same time period and are closely

comparable.

     The U.S. indexes are presented in Table 1. These indexes provide

interesting patterns to assess. Productivity growth was quite large on average

throughout the 1960's, and, as would be expected, the impact of changes in

pollution abatement capital expenditures was small. This implies from the

discussion of the bias term "b' in the previous section that changes in output

and pollution abatement capital did not deviate significantly, and/or that the

cost share of KPA was small. Both appear to be true; the states were in charge

of regulation of the environment during this time period and regulation was

sparse. The impact also was in both directions; at times pollution abatement

capital expenditures caused standard productivity measures to indicate stronger

growth and sometimes weaker growth than those including only productive inputs,

as would be expected from the interpretation of "b'. Overall the KPA

adjustment has a smoothing effect since in good years x/x exceeded KPA/KPA so

that the bias b causes an overestimate of the standard measure, and vice—versa.

     On average the effect of including pollution abatement capital in

productivity calculations becomes larger in the early 1970's once the EPA began

to control these regulations. As hypothesized by most researchers, the standard

practive of including pollution abatement capital in the productivity growth

calculations appears to have a depressing effect on the evidence of productivity

growth, although in general the impact is not large. The impact in 1970 of

purging the productivity measure of the KPA-effect, for example, is an increase
                                      16

in measured productivity of .266 percentage points, causing the decrease in

productivity in that year to reduce from 4.865% to 4.599%, approximately a 5%

change in the growth rate.

    The only years in which this impact has the opposite sign     productivity

growth including KPA as a productive input appears better than without KPA

incorporated    are 1972, 1976 and 1977, all years of higher than average

productivity growth. In these years the impact of strongly increasing output

growth, arising after a previous decrease in output, appears to overwhelm the

small (and in some cases negative) changes in KPA and K. This is consistent

with the interpretation of the bias "b', above.

     The strongest impact of KPA adjustment are in those years when productivit

growth is really catastrophic and where strong increases in KPA caused the bias

term "b' to affect the standard productivity growth measure significantly. For

example, 1974 and 1980 are extremely bad years for productivity growth and in

both cases capital (and especially pollution abatement capital, KPA) increased

dramatically while output stagnated or decreased. The adjusted index thus shows

less decline in productivity growth than the standard index for these years.

     Similar trends appear in the productivity growth indexes for Canada

reported in Table 2.   Overall both the productivity growth fluctuations and

impacts of adjustment for KPA are stronger for Canada than for the U.S. The

years of the strongest impacts of pollution abatement capital purchases occur in

1970, 1975 and 1980 which are years of devastating productivity decreases; 1975

is particularly striking. This is consistent with the interpretation of the

bias term b; in these recession years x/x and K/K became increasing smaller

than KPA/KPA.

     In addition, the high productivity growth in 1973 and sharp decline into

1974 and 1975 which in turn resulted in healthy productivity growth in 1976 to
                                      17

1979, is the same pattern, although stronger, that shows up in the U.S. indexes.

For Canada in particu1ar, however, in the post-l976 years the effect of

pollution abatement capital purchases was minimal and, in fact, slight1y

contributed to evidence of large productivity growth because KPA was not

increasing as it had in previous years whereas output growth was recovering.

     One difference between the U.S. and Canadian indexes is that for the U.S.

the difference between the standard and "adjusted" productivity indexes

fluctuates whereas the Canadian numbers indicate a much stronger trend from

fairly large and positive impacts of adjustment for KPA in the early l97Os to

small and then negative impacts of this adjustment in the later years. This

suggests that especially for Canada productivity growth was greater in the

beginning of the 1970's than measured, but that the "recovery" after 1975 has

been overstated. This is particularly evident in 1979; treating KPA as

productive in the "standard" manner results in an almost .4 increase in the

productivity growth measure for that year as compared to the adjusted measure.

     One other tendency which is similar for the U.S. and Canada and which is

consistent with the interpretation of the bias term "h' is that the depressing

effect o including KPA as a productive input in productivity calculations is

strongest in bad years. Productivity declines are muted with the KPA—

adjustment. The reverse clear1y also tends to be true; as noted above the KPA

adjustment smooths out peaks and troughs in the productivity indexes.

     The tendencies discussed in the previous two paragraphs provide evidence

that the acceleration effect    where environmental regulation facilitates

economic growth through modernization of the existing capital stock     may hold

true. It appears from these numbers that strong economic growth is consistent

with a KPA adjustment that is negative so that the net effect is that including

KPA investment further increases productivity growth, This is a crude
                                          18

indicator, however, because the current model does not include any of these

potential determinants of productivity. In addition, another type of impact

which may be appearing in these indexes and is not included in the model is

capacity utilization. The impact of KPA is cyclical, as the interpretation of

the bias term 'b" above indicates, which suggests an important impact of short

run fixities of the capital stock which exacerbate productivity growth

fluctuations. A final effect which this framework may encompass implicitly is

the incentive to buy pollution abatement capital in "good" years because of

special financial assistance for purchases of KPA in Canada. This is also true,

perhaps to a lesser extent, in the U.S. and Germany.

       As mentioned, the Canadian manufacturing numbers suggest a clearly time-

dependent impact of environmental regulation. In particular, although the

impact of the regulations imposed on environmental discharges in the 197Os does

not occur in any one particular year —— the impact is spread out because of

postponement of compliance with the restrictions - the Canadian data suggest

that the largest negative impact on productivity growth as usually measured was

in the beginning of the regulatory effort, especially in 1972. After this time

growth actually looks better with standard methods, like 1976 and 1977 in the

U.S. This trend, and therefore the effect of swift compliance with the

regulations, is more evident in Canada than the U.S.

      The German indexes show this tendency even more strongly. The German

productivity growth indexes in Table 3 cover a shorter time period       from 1972

--   but   indicate a strong effect commencing when regulations were imposed in 1971

and continuing for the first four years. The depressing effect of KPA

investment on standard productivity measurements is quite substantial in the

beginning, approximately .2 to .3 for each year from 1972—75, even though all

these years except 1975 otherwise were years of healthy productivity gains.
                                         19

 After this period investment in KPA appears to have much less of an   efcct
 the   initial investments to satisfy the standards were completed. The KPA—effect

 becomes small and even negative by 1979, a year of good productivity growth,

 second only to 1976. The response to regulations in Germany therefore appears

 faster, perhaps because of better non—compliance penalties and thus swifter

 response.

       Overall, the German productivity growth indexes provide evidence of much

stronger and consistent productivity growth than in the U.S. and Canada,

although the trends are similar. The one catastrophic —-    negative productivity
growth ——    year was in 1975 and the other poor period was 1980-81, when the KPA-
adjustment becomes again more effective. The initial post—OPEC decrease in

productivity growth appears later and was shorter—lived, however, than in the

U.S. and Canada; the decrease is only for one year, 1975, and the following year

showed the best productivity growth in the sample. This is the only

productivity decline that can be compared throughout its cycle, since the data

sample is so short.

       The productivity growth indexes provided for the U.S., Canada, and Germany

do not indicate any documentable evidence that competitiveness for the U.S. has

declined relative to the other countries because of environmental regullat.ioris.

In fact, the evidence suggests that Germany may have suffered more, at least

from 1972 to 1975 from environmental regulations than did the U.S. or Canada.

The impact on the U.S., however, from initial compliance with the regulations,

does not appear to have ended, whereas the impacts on the other countries,

Canada and Germany, has slowed considerably. Thus the U.S. may be in relatively

worse shape from the late 1970's from late compliance with regulations.

       Additional information on overall trends may be obtained from the summary

statistics on average productivity growth rates provided at the ends of Tables
                                      20

1,2, and 3. The averages are presented for different years for the different

countries because the sample periods vary. For the U.S. the partition is for

1960—67, 1967—72 and 1972—80, since the Canadian samp1e starts in 1967 and the

German sample in 1972, so corresponding divisions into the last two components

are possible for Canada and the last partition can be captured in Germany. The

dividing point often mentioned, however, is 1973. Therefore a partition at 1973

is also provided as possible for all countries. Finally, since the German data

also includes 1981, corresponding average measures to 1981 instead of 1980 are

also reported.

     The U.S. averages do not provide evidence of a dramatic productivity

slowdown in manufacturing on average since 1973. Although 1974 and 1975 were

poor years for both the standard and adjusted productivity measures, 1973 and

post-1975 were times of healthy productivity growth. Some associated evidence

is available, however; productivity growth dropped from an average of 2.872% per

year for the standard measure from 1960 to 1967 to 2.661% from 1967 to 1973 and

1.565% from 1973 to 1980. Much of this decline may be attributed to the poor

productivity performance in 1980, since 1976-1978 at least were years of fairly

large productivity growth.

     The adjusted U.S. measures do "smooth" the productivity decline that is

evident from the numbers, the 1960-67, 1967-73 and 1973-80 averages for this

index are 2.865%, 2.743% and 1.788% respectively, indicating the same trend as

before the adjustment but slightly muted. Overall the averages over the time

period, however, indicate only a slight trend downward over time, a slight

increase in measured productivity adjusted for KPA than for the standard

measures, and much more fluctuation around the trend than changes in the trend.

     The Canadian averages provide evidence of a stronger decline over time,

although a substantial amount of this effect can be attributed to the
                                            21

catastrophic productivity dec:1 inc in 1975 arid increase in 1971 and, like the
U.S. numbers, to the 1980 drop. Again, and even to a greater extent, the

averages hide the large fluctuations in the complete indexes which have already

been assessed. The average annual percentage growth rates for 1967-73 and 1973--

80 for tIie standard productivity calculations are 3.239% and .229%,

respectively, indicating a large decline over time. The adjusted averages are

slightly better, although the relative positions are not changed noticeably; the

corresponding annual percentage increases are 3.360% and .278%, respectively.

       Finally, the averages for Germany reflect the consistently high

productivity captured in the indexes. The 1973-80 average annual productivity

growth rate is 2.855%, as compared to 1.788% and .229% for the U.S. and Canada,

respectively. The 1973-81 average is slightly worse due to the poor

productivity performance in 1981, 2.555%. Comparison of the entire German

sample to the corresponding U.S. and Canadian numbers yields average annual

growth rates of 2.828% as compared to 2.174% and .858% respectively, which is

slightly closer and appears quite respectable for the U.S. on average, although

still very low for Canada.

       The adjusted averages provide additional evidence of comparable growth

between the U.S. and Germany and similar impacts of pollution abatement capital

expenditures. The 1972--80 and 1973—80 percentage growth rates for the U.S.

corresponding to the adjusted productivity growth rate index are 2.370% and

l.7889, compared to .918% and .278% for Canada, arid 2.963% and 2.974% for

Germany respectively, all indicating greater average annual productivity growth

with   the   depressing impacts of pollution abatement. capita] purchases removed.

The percentage magnitudes are different, however; the adjustment is strongest

for the U.S. ,    with   an average of an average of .2 percentage points added to the

productivity measure with the KPA adjustment, second for Germany with
                                            22

approximately       .12 percentage points, and   smallest    for Canada which already

exhibited       the poorest product lvi ty growth performance, about a Q59 di ffience.
The    L'.S.   appears relatively unhindered by environmental        regulation   during this
time    period, therefore, compared to    Canada   and Germany, and      the overa]]

productivity performance is very       close to that in Germany.



IV. Concluding Re marks


        In this paper we have considered the often proposed suggestion that
compliance with environmental regulations in the            form   of investment in
"unproductive"      capital, pollution abatement capita]., KPA, has caused part of' the

observed "productivity slowdown" since the early 1970's in industrial countries.

In particular, we have considered the effects of emission or discharge

standards, and resulting investment in KPA to satisfy these standards, on the

measurement of productivity growth for the manufacturing sectors of the U.S.,

Canada and Germany. The overall conclusion is that this investment does appear

to have depressed standard productivity growth measurements for these countries

on average, although the effect was strongest for Germany in the earlier years

of environmental concern and imposition of regulations, and is spread out and

quite strong at the end of the period for the U.S., with Canada somewhere in

between. This suggests that the impact on international competitiveness of

environmental regulations has been to cause Germany's position to worsen in the

early 1970's relative to the U.S. and the reverse in the latter i970's and early

1980's, with, again, Canada being in the middle.

       The approach employed in this study is very useful for justifying a method

of adjusting productivity measures for environmental regulation effects, and

explicitly providing a basis for the ambiguity of the direction of the impact
                                          23

which is recognized in   the   literature. The    framework   developed has much
 interpretative potential.     For example, the contribution of investment to

productivity in the 1970's has been a controversial subject. Some researchers

assert that investment decreases have been a large factor contributing to the

productivity declines of the 1970's and others say that investment really has

not decreased and perhaps has even been too strong given the potential

productivity of investment expenditures during this time period. The model used

in this study shows that investment in productive capital has been less than

that for measured capital and to what extent; this provides a foundation for the

former assertion. In addition, the impact of environmental regulation on

international competitiveness is clear within this structure; the differences in

productivity between standard and adjusted productivity growth rates can be

computed and compared between countries to see which countries have fared the

worst in terms of productivity as a result of environmental concern and

regulation.

     Although the framework developed here is rich and provides theoretical

justification for some assertions made in the literature, other hypotheses about

the structure within which environmental legislation affects productivity growth

may not be modeled and quantified using the type of nonparametric approach

utilized here. For example, there are important indirect effects from control

of pollution abatement technology which some authors have argued causes

environmental regulation —--   particularly    in the U.S.     to be inefficient Di

cost—ineffective because of distortion of technical change and investment

patterns. In reverse, incentives stemming from financial assistance for

purchases of pollution abatement capital as compared to productive capital may

distort investment decisions toward capital which may be classified as pollution

abatement capital. Direct assessment of the associated costs and benefits of
                                         24

environmental    regulation requires determination of a shadow value of pollution

ahatemenL    capita] which differs from that for productive capital. This,
however, cannot be accomplished with the available data and a nonparametric
framework since the exost      returns only to total capital can be determined; the

individual    components cannot be separated.
     Also,    in terms of the specification of   the model and particularly for
international    comparisons, the relevance of standards as the assumed regulatory

instrument for all countries may be questionable. This is related to the point

made in the previous paragraph; it may he that additional distorting types of

regulatory instruments are used which cause the cost of pollution abatement

capital to differ from the purchase cost and the shadow value to differ from the

implied value on the margin. Again, this can only be dealt with if the shadow

values can be distinguished. In the current context, the assumption of

standards as the motivating regulatory force may be justifiable, since at least

Canada and Germany rely substantially on environmental standards, in terms of

flows of discharges or emissions, to motivate environmental control. The U.S.

system too is based on a system of standards imposed by the Environmental

Protection Agency although in practice the regulation is often in terms of

specification of control techniques and does not have enough emphasis on costs.

     An empirical problem with assessment of effects of regulatory controls on

productivity is that the impacts of pollution abatement capital appear to be

cyclical. This may not pose difficulties if, for example, the cyclicity arises

because firms make explicit decisions to postpone investment until "good times",

but it may present problems if the appearance of strong regulatory impacts in

peaks and troughs is simply a cyclical phenomena which should be purged from the

measurement of productivity.
                                      25

     These problems with the approach used in this study suggest that

specification of an econometric model may facilitate consideration of important

effects on production from environmental regulation. In particular, if a short—

run model is specified and estimated which is consistent with our theoretical

structure, shadow values may be identified individually for the individual

capital components and capacity utilization may be adjusted for. This may be an

important avenue to pursue for future research.

     This obviously cannot, however, be accomplished nonparametrically. Since

nonparametric analysis is the most common way of calculating productivity growth

rates, the current specification provides a very practical and therefore useful

way of adjusting productivity measures for the impacts of environmental effects

while still being based on an explicit theoretical optimization model for

purposes of justifying the approach used for adjustment and providing

interpretive power.
