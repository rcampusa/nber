                                    ABSTRACT



     Contributions are made by this paper in three areas, methodological, data
creation, and empirical.  The methodological section finds that, while struc-
tural model building exercises may be useful in suggesting lists of variables
that may play an explanatory role in investment equations, they generally
achieve identification of structural parameters only by imposing arbitrary and
unbelievable simplifying assumptions and exclusion restrictions. The paper
advocates a hybrid methodology combining guidance from traditional structural
models on the choice and form of explanatory variables to be included, with
estimation in a reduced—form format that introduces all explanatory variables
and the lagged dependent variable with the same number of unconstrained lag
coefficients.

     The second contribution is the use of a new set of quarterly data for
major expenditure categories of GNP extending back to 1919. The data file
also contains quarterly data back to 1919 for other variables, including the
capital stock, interest rates, the cost of capital including tax incentive
effects, a proxy for Tobin's "Q', and the real money supply.

     The empirical results support the view that there are two basic impulses
in the business cycle, real and financial.   The real impulse appears in our
statistical evidence as an autonomous innovation to investment in structures.
We interpret these structures innovations as due in turn to changes in the
rate of population growth, episodes of speculation and overbuilding, and
Schumpeterian waves of innovation. The financial impulse works through the
effect on investment of changes in the money supply, as well as the real
interest rate (in the case of postwar investment in durable equipment). There
is a strong role for the money supply as a determinant of investment behavior,
relative to such other factors as the user cost of capital or Tobin's "0...
The role of the money supply is interpreted as primarily reflecting the
banking contraction of 1929—33 and the episodes of credit crunches and
disintermediation in the postwar years.

     Another feature of the empirical work is the attention paid to aggre-
gation.  Coefficient estimates are more stable when four types of investment
expenditures are aggregated along the structures—equipment dimension than
along the household—business dimension.  Historical decompositions highlight
the role of autonomous innovations in structures investment and in the money
supply, and an inspection of residuals suggests that the main autonomous
downward shift in spending in 1929—30 was in fixed investment, not nondurable
consumption.

                             I.   INTRODUCTION


     The behavior of fixed investment is one of the four core topics

(along with consumption, money demand, and the Phillips curve) that have

dominated theoretical and empirical research in macroeconomics during

the postwar era.   An understanding of the sources of persistent swings

in investment spending would seem to be a key ingredient in any satis-

factory explanation of business cycles.    This paper develops a new data

set and uses a new methodology to investigate the behavior of household

and business fixed investment in the United States since 1919.     Its

results have implications for at least four partly overlapping groups of

economists who have strong views about the nature of the fixed invest-

ment process and, indirectly, about the sources of business cycles.

     Keynesians, following the General Theory, regard investment

behavior as containing a substantial autonomous component; investment

responds to the state of business confidence and incorporates the effect

of episodes of speculation and overbuilding.     The instability and un-

predictability of fixed investment behavior forms, of course, the basis

of Keynesian support for an activist and interventionist role for

government fiscal policy.   A crucial and often unstated component of the

Keynesian view is that these autonomous investment movements exhibit

positive serial correlation and last long enough for government action

to be effective.

     In contrast monetarists do not single Out investment for special

attention.   Changes in aggregate private spending, consumption and

investment alike, are attributed to prior fluctuations in the supply of

money.   Since monetarists are usually reluctant to provide detailed

structural interpretations of what happens inside the black box through

which the influence of money is channeled to economic activity, they are

not concerned whether the primary channel runs through consumption,

investment, or both.        But monetarists would expect (if forced uncharac-

teristically to devote special attention to fixed investment behavior)

to find a strong role for the money supply as a primary determinant of

investment behavior.

     In addition to the general approaches to macroeconomic analysis

advocated by Keynesians and monetarists, two additional groups of

economists have made a special effort to understand investment behavior.

The "neoclassical" school, represented by the work of Jorgenson and his

collaborators, emphasizes changes in the relative price or "user cost"

of capital as a dominant influence, together with changes in output, on

fluctuations in fixed investment.       The user cost of capital is the

primary channel by which both monetary policy (working through interest

rates) and fiscal policy (working through investment tax incentives)

influence the flow of investment spending.        The final group consists of

advocates of Tobin's "Q" approach,       inwhich the influence on investment

of forward—looking expectations regarding output and capital costs is

captured by a single variable, "Q,"       the ratio of the market value of

capital to its reproduction cost.        Since the dominant portion of

fluctuations in "Q"    is   accounted for by changes in stock market prices,

proponents of this approach expect econometric work to single out the
                                       3




stock market as an important (or dominant) factor explaining investment

behavior.

        Because of the long time span of data covered in the empirical

portion of this paper, its results have implications for the sources of

business cycles in general and of the Great Depression in particular.

Keynesians view business cycles as the inevitable reflection of the

instability of investment spending, which in turn justifies government

intervention to reduce the amplitude of cycles.       Keynesian interpreta-

tions of the Great Depression, especially Temin (1976), minimize the

role of monetary factors in the first two years of the 1929—33 contrac-

tion.    Monetarists reverse the roles of the government and private

sector and view the basic source of business cycles as autonomous and

largely unexplained fluctuations in the money supply that lead to

fluctuations in private spending.    A reduction in the amplitude of

business cycles requires a reduction in the instability originating in

government management of the money supply.

        The neoclassical and Q approaches to the explanation of investment

behavior are explicitly partial equilibrium in nature and have not been

developed into broader theories of the business cycle.       The neoclassical

approach is compatible with some aspects of monetarism, since insta-

bility in investment can originate from government control over interest

rates and investment tax incentives.       But the policy implications differ

from those of monetarism; to the extent that the monetarist recommenda-

tion of a constant monetary growth rate rule would increase the vola-

tility of interest rates, then the neoclassicists would predict the

consequence to be greater rather than lesser fluctuations in investment

spending.    The "Q' advocates have not addressed themselves to business
                                      4




cycle implications, but their approach creates a natural link to those

(like Mishkln, (1978)) who emphasize the role of the 1929 stock market

crash in the Great Depression.

     The conflict between the Keynesian and monetarist approaches can be

related to the distinction in business cycle analysis between "impulses"

and "propagation mechanisms."    Keynesians argue for activist monetary

and fiscal policy responses to counter serially correlated investment

impulses, while monetarists view investment as part of the propagation

mechanism that carries the influence of autonomous money—supply impulses

from their origin in the government sector to their effect on private—

sector spending.'   The Keynesian—monetarist debate can be translated

into the modern econometric language of Granger causality and innovation

accounting.   Keynesians would expect to find a large role for "own

innovations" in the empirical explanation of investment spending, with a

relatively small role for feedback from monetary variables.       An extreme

Keynesian would expect investment to be exogenous in the Granger sense

to prior changes in the money supply, and the same expectation would be

held by neoclassicists and Q advocates, none of whom (to our knowledge)

has ever entered the money supply directly as an explanatory variable in

an empirical investment equation.     Monetarists, of course, would expect

to find that the money supply is Granger causally prior to fixed

investment.

     This paper reopens the question of exogeneity in investment beha-

vior by inquiring whether the standard approach to the estimation of

"structural   investment equations leads to an overstatement of the

endogeneity of investment spending.       Its primary objective is to decom-

pose fluctuations in fixed investment into three components,      (a) feed—
                                       5




back from policy variables and from non—investment spending, (b) the

propagation mechanism imparted by the investment process itself, which

displays a high degree of positive serial correlation, and (c) "own

innovations' or "shocks" in fixed investment expenditures that remain

after accounting for (a) and (b).     The main contributions of the paper

can be divided into three categories——methodological, data creation, and

empirical.

     The methodological section finds that, while structural model

building exercises may be useful in suggesting lists of variables that

may play an explanatory role in investment equations, they generally

achieve identification of structural parameters only by imposing

arbitrary and unbelievable simplifying assumptions and exclusion

restrictions.     Consideration of real—world decision making suggests that

economic aggregates play "multiple roles" in investment behavior, which

imply that the observed coefficients on explanatory variables in

equations describing investment behavior represent a convolution of

numerous structural parameters that cannot be separately identified.         As

a result it is possible only to estimate reduced forms.

     The estimation methodology suggested here is the same as that

proposed in a previous paper on inflation (Gordon—King, 1982).      It


starts with guidance from traditional structural models on the choice

and form of explanatory     variables to be included.   Then estimation is

carried out in a format similar to that of the unconstrained "Simsian"

VAR models.     Explanatory variables are typically entered with uncon-

strained lags of the same length, and the list of explanatory variables

typically includes a mixture of those suggested by several structural

models, together with those that may not be suggested by any structural
                                      6




model but might in principle play a role through real wealth effects,

credit constraints, or expectation formation (e.g., the real money

supply).     The approach differs from the usual VAR model—building exer-

cise by focussing mainly on equations for the variable of primary

interest (inflation in Gordon—King, and investment expenditures in this

paper), rather than by giving "equal time" to all of the variables in

the model.     It is less "atheoretical" than most VAR research, because

structural models retain a usefulness in suggesting lists of candidate

variables to be included in reduced—form equations and the form in which

those variables should be entered (in this paper, for instance, stock

market prices enter in the form of Tobin's "Q"      variable),   even if the

underlying structural parameters cannot be identified.

     The second contribution is the use of a new set of quarterly data

for major expenditure categories of GNP extending back to 1919.         The

data file also contains quarterly data back to 1919 for other variables

that have been suggested as explanatory "candidates" in investment equa-

tions.     These include the capital stock, interest rates, the cost of

capital including tax incentive effects, a proxy for Tobin's "Q",        and

the real money supply.

     Equipped with its hybrid methodology and its extended data set, the

paper then proceeds to empirical estimation.      The empirical section

differs from    the usual research on investment that typically attempts to

measure response parameters within the context of a single structural

theory, e.g., neoclassical or "Q".     Instead,   our skepticism that struc-

tural parameters can be estimated leads us to estimate reduced—form

equations.     These include explanatory variables suggested by several

theories and can be used to decompose the variance of investment within
                                       7




particular historical periods among the contribution of lagged values of

explanatory variables (output, interest rates, money, Q),    the contri-

bution of lagged investment, and "own innovations" to investment.     The

analysis of shocks to investment provides a link betwen this paper and

the debate between Temin (1976), Thomas Mayer (1980), and others on the

role of an autonomous shock to consumption in 1930, and to papers in

this volume by Hall on shifts in the consumption function and by

Blanchard—Watson on "shocks—in—general."     Our extended data set also

allows us to investigate changes in investment behavior between the

interwar and postwar periods.

     The paper begins in Part    II with a review of the central issues

that lead to our choice of a reduced—form rather than structural ap-

proach.     This is not a full—blown survey of the literature, but rather    a

selective analysis of problems with structural estimation that have

emerged over the past 20 years.     Then Part III contains an introduction

to the data set and a description of the behavior of the major variables

in each of the 14 business cycles since 1919, as well as over longer

subperiods.     Part IV presents the estimated equations for four cate-

gories of investment (producer durable equipment, nonresidential and

residential structures, and consumer durable expenditures), and Part V

presents a study of multivariate causality and exogeneity, innovation

accounting, and a historical decomposition of the sources of investment

spending.     Part VI contains a summary of the main results and

implications.

     II.   PITFALLS IN STRUCTURfiJ.. ESTIMATION OF INVESTMENT EQUATIONS


     Most of the investment literature is concerned solely with business

investment.   This orientation reflects the influence of Keynes' General

Theory, especially its preoccupation with the state of business confi-

dence as a determinant of investment plans.     However business investment

constitutes less than half of total private investment in the U. S.

economy.   Consumer expenditures on durable goods have been larger than

producers' durable equipment expenditures since 1920, and residential

structures expenditures have exceeded those on nonresidential investment

in at least half the years since 1929.

     One might expect household investment behavior to respond to

different variables than business investment.     For instance, if a sub-

stantial fraction of consumers is credit constrained, then episodes of

"credit crunches" are liable to produce a greater response in the

investment outlays of consumers than of businessmen.2     A systematic

exploration of household investment behavior may need to explore factors

that matter in household decision—making, e.g., disposable income may

matter for households but total GNP for businessmen, and the various tax

incentive terms conventionally included in measures of the user cost of

capital may matter for businessmen but not for households,     Here we

begin with a critique of the more familiar literature on business

investment, and subsequently apply our analysis to the determinants of

household investment.

     Chirinko's (1983a) systematic review of assumptions and results

distinguishes four classes of econometric models describing business

investment behavior——Jorgenson's neoclassical approach, Tobin's "Q", the

"General Forward—Looking" approach based on explicit modelling of
                                      9




expectations, and Feldstein's "Return—Over—Cost" and "Effective Tax

Rate" models.   Because they have accounted for the vast majority of

empirical studies completed to date, we concentrate only on the neo-

classical and Q frameworks for investment research.     Extended surveys

are presented by Eisner and Strotz (1963), Jorgenson (1971), Helliwell

(1976), and Chirinko (1983a), whereas here we treat only a few selected

issues that lead to our skepticism that traditional structural

parameters can be identified.


The Neoclassical Paradigm


     As of the mid 1970s, the neoclassical paradigm was so dominant (at

least outside of New Haven) that Helliwell's (1976) survey makes no

mention of any other framework.    Prior to the mid 1960s, investment

equations had been dominated by the accelerator approach and had added

interest rates, profits,    or other variables as determinants of

investment without explicit constraints based on optimizing behavior.

The studies initiated by Jorgenson and collaborators, particularly

Jorgenson (1963, 1967), Hall—Jorgenson (1967, 1971), and Jorgenson—

Stephenson (1967, 1969), are distinguished by their derivation of the

desired capital—output ratio from specific assumptions about behavior

and about the form of the production function.     The centerpiece in the

determination of the desired capital stock is the expected real rental

price of capital services, which is equated to the expected marginal

product of capital.   If factors are paid their marginal products and the

production function is of the Cobb—Douglas form, the desired capital

stock at a given point in time (K) is a linear function of expected

output (X) divided by the expected real price of capital services

                =

                     Ct


where y is the income share of capital in output.          Decision and delivery

lags make actual net investment a distributed lag on past changes in the

desired capital stock:


                     J
(2)             =    E
                    j=0



When the expected variables      (e e        and Ce) are replaced by current

actual values (an unjustified assumption discussed below), and when the

demand for replacement capital is represented by a fixed geometric

depreciation factor (6) times the lagged capital stock (Ki),

the neoclassical investment model becomes:

                            J

           It
                =   a0 +    E .A(PX/C). + 6K1        +
                           3=0

      Equation (3) embodies a number of strong assumptions and restric-

tions, and a large "counterrevolution" literature has developed to

explore the consequences of loosening them.         The "pure" Jorgensonian

neoclassical approach assumes a "putty—putty'         technology without adjust-

ment costs; the capital stock can be adjusted instantly, transformed,

bought, or sold as needed to bring a firm's actual capital stock into

line with its desired capital stock.         As long as expectations are

assumed to be static, the only justification for the lag distribution

included in (3) is the technological gestation lag.         Another inter-

pretation is that investment expenditures involve adjustment costs.
                                     ii

Without adjustment costs or gestation lags, the Jorgenson model is

subject to the criticism that, whenever a gap exists between      and

the rate of investment will be infinitely large and the gap will be

eliminated instantaneously.    However, with either of these assumptions

"tacked on,' the Jorgensonian K is not derived from a complete cost—

minimization problem and is probably not optimal.

     Another peculiarity of the approach is apparent in (1), which

allows the desired capital stock to be a function only of the relative

price of capital rather than the relative price of all inputs.    Yellen

(1980) has shown that (1) can be derived only by assuming that real

wages are inversely related to C/P and respond fully and instantaneously

to any changes in C/P.    As a result all factor price changes must be

assumed to leave the profitability of the firm unaffected, even in the

short run.    Thus the neoclassical approach leaves no room for theories

that predict a profit squeeze, investment slump, and growth slowdown

following a period of excessive real wage growth (see Malinvaud 1982).

     However, even if one were to accept the formulation in (1) with the

single relative price variable, the measurement of capital's user cost

is fraught with ambiguity.    As shown recently in Auerbach's (1983) sur-

vey, taxes and inflation may not change the cost of capital in the same

way for all firms, leaving the feasibility of aggregation an open

question.    Simple formulae for C/P are also elusive when markets are

incomplete, and when managers use financial leverage and dividend policy

to influence market perceptions.

     The empirical 'counterrevolution' begins with Eisner—Nadiri (1968),

an article which takes particular exception to the multiplicative speci-

fication in (3) that forces both the short—run and long—run responses to
X and C/P to be identical.   Eisner—Nadiri find that the elasticities

with respect to output are considerably higher than those with respect

to relative prices, and Bischoff (1971) finds that lags are shorter on

output than on relative prices.   Chirinko—Eisner (1983) find in experi-

ments with the DRI and MPS econometric models that splitting apart the X

and C/P variables can cause the implicit relative price elasticity to

fall by more than half, and together with minor redefinitions of the C/P

variable can cause a reduction in that elasticity by a factor of four.

However, even by loosening restrictions in this way they find that

response coefficients to changes in the investment tax credit in six

models still vary by a factor of four (or a factor of about two for the

four most extensively used models——Chase, DRI, MPS, and Wharton).


Expectations and Identification


     An even more serious problem in (1) —   (3) is the cavalier treatment
of expectations, which are included in (1) but assumed to be static in

the transition from (1) to (3).   In Helliwell's words, "This important

issue has been dealt with principally by the handy assumption that the

future will be like the present" (1976, p. 15).   At best, expectations

of future output are allowed to depend on a distributed lag of past

values of output, but generally lagged values of other variables that

might be relevant for expectations formation (e.g., the money supply)

have been excluded as an identification restriction.    Since investment

is a forward—looking activity, not only must the X and C/P variables be

represented by expectations that in principle should depend on an infor-

mation set containing past values of all relevant macroeconomic aggre-

gates, but also the functional parameters entering the investment model
                                       13




should depend on the same general information set.

       This point can be illustrated in a generalization of a simple model

set forth recently by Andrew Abel and Olivier Blanchard (1983), that

falls into the class of "general forward—looking models."      In place of

(1) we allow the desired capital stock to depend on a sequence of

expected future sales, with a discount factor a; unlike Abel—Blanchard

we also allow the desired capital stock to depend on the sequence of

expected future rental rates (C/P):4



(4)                   a(l—a)a' E{{X÷+.,(C/P).]j]}.

Here   t   is the time an investment order is placed for delivery at t+n,

vith n the length of the delivery or gestation lag.      The parameter a is

the steady—state ratio of capital to output, and         is the information

set relevant at time t to the formation of expectations about all future

variables.     The relevant information set might, for instance, include

past values of output, the interest rate, and the money supply.

       It has been an almost universal practice in the empirical litera-

ture to express the depreciation rate of capital as a fixed exponential

constant.     In contrast Eisner (1972), Feldstein and Foot (1971) and

Feldstein and Rothschild (1974) have argued that the timing of replace-

ment investment is an economic decision and is motivated by economic

considerations.     In particular, fixed proportions in building or machine

construction create an enormous incentive for net investment and

replacement investment to be considered as part of the same economic

decision—making process.5     Accordingly we replace the fixed replacement

rate in the Abel—Blanchard model by an expected rate (e)     that   depends on
                                             14




the    information set:




(5)                  =     [l_E(eIQ)]K÷i + It+n•

where 1t+n represents investment expenditures made at time t+n (strictly

speaking this should be an expectation——see note 6 below).

        Investment orders depend on the gap between desired and actual

capital that is expected to occur at time t+n, and the present expecta-

tion of the fraction of the capital stock that will be replaced at that

time.     Although the fraction of the gap to be closed is decided at time

t,    and is not an expected value, today's decision regarding the fraction

depends on the expected cost of adjustment during the period of the

gestation lag, e.g., expected interest rates on short—term construction

loans, r:6



(6)
            o    =       X[E(r   1k?)1[Kd÷   —    K÷1}   +   E(e()K      +



where       is a disturbance term.

        Finally, actual investment expenditures (L) are a sum of past

orders, with a distributed lag indicating that projects have hetero-

geneous gestation lags:



(7)          I   =        Ew.(Q)O
                         j=O



Here in (7) for completeness we allow the                coefficients to depend on

the information set, thus introducing the possibility that orders may be

cancelled before delivery or that the gestation lag is influenced by the
                                      15




evolution of the economy between time periods t—j and t.7              Thus it would

appear that the Abel—Blanchard assumption that           E u.    1   is unrealis—
                                                        j=O
tically restrictive.

       It is obvious from inspection of (4) — (7) that in principle it              is

not possible to identify structural coefficients on current and lagged

economic aggregates in an aggregate investment equation, because any of

those aggregates could be playing double, triple, or even more roles as

ingredients in the information sets               The reduced form involves

complicated convolutions of the variables entering the information set,

which appears in five places in the reduced form:



(8)
      It




           —                          —    It+n_j_1I     +   E(el .)K÷      .+
       The research by Abel and Blanchard (1983) provides a good example

of the arbitrary assumptions and simplifications needed to achieve

identification in a model like (4) —       (7).     Their problems occur despite

a much simpler framework that differs by (a) excluding the rental price

from any appearance, even in determining the desired capital stock,             (b)

allowing expectations based on an information set only with regard to

the sequence of expected future output,       (c) allowing only past values of

sales to be included in that information set, and (d) assuming fixed

values of all other parameters.   Further, Abel and Blanchard have two

additional types of data not available in this historical study of

aggregate expenditures,   (e) separate data on orders and expenditures,

and (f) sectoral data that allow a distinction to be made between aggre—
                                     16




gate and sectoral sales.    Despite these differences (a) —   (f),   Abel and

Blanchard achieve identification of a structural model only by assuming

arbitrary fixed values of several parameters, and they find no conclu-

sive evidence to prefer the resulting structural model to the

corresponding reduced form.8

     In our application to a set of aggregate data, the more general

model (4) —   (7) does not appear to allow the identification of struc-

tural parameters.    For instance, consider the role of interest rates and

stock prices.    Both would seem to be relevant information for economic

agents forming expectations about future output, not to mention future

interest rates and stock prices (both components of the Jorgensonian

rental price).    Yet how is the estimated coefficient on a lagged inter-

est rate variable to be disentangled to allow identification of separate

roles that this variable plays in forming expectations in different

places in the model in affecting the desired capital stock, in affecting

the desired rate of replacement of old capital, and in affecting the

desired rate of closing the gap between desired and actual capital?


The Q Approach

     The expectations quagmire is inherent in the neoclassical approach,

with its identification of key parameters requiring ad hoc exclusion

restrictions in the set of variables allowed into the information set

influencing expectations.    The "pure" Q approach differs from the usual

investment accelerator by explaining investment activity on the basis of

deviations from portfolio balance, and by assuming from the start that

there is no "time to build," i.e., that there are no gestation lags, so

that I   =
                 Net investment activity takes place when marginal Q, the
                                               17




ratio of the increase in the value of the firm from acquiring an addi-

tional unit of capital to its marginal purchase cost, exceeds unity.

Numerous authors, including Abel (1979) and Hayashi (1982), have derived

Q   investment functions in the following form that adds lags to allow for

delivery or gestation lags:9



(9)
                   =       + s0ts                +    e.

The theoretical derivation involves "marginal Q,'                 which is forward—
looking and hence unobservable.              Actual estimation of (9) involves

replacing marginal Q        with    average Q,       the ratio of the market value of

firms to the replacement cost of their assets.                  (Hayashi (1982) has

shown that actual and marginal Q are equal under specified assumptions

but does not test whether these assumptions are empirically sup—

ported.)     If (9) is estimated for data on net investment, then the

constant term          should be zero, since net investment should be zero in

the steady state when Q        is   unity.    When data on gross investment are

used, then the constant term implicitly measures the depreciation

rate.     At a Q   ratio   of unity, the firm should just replace its old

capital but should not buy any new capital.                 More generally, the

constant term          reflects the mean value of any omitted variables.

        Much of the discussion of possible problems in the Q approach

relates to measurement errors in either the numerator (market value) or

denominator (replacement cost) of the Q                ratio.   For instance, firms may

not pay attention to every quarterly movement in securities prices,

given the possibility of excess volatility in financial markets

(Shiller, 1981).        In addition Hall (1977) and Chirinko (1983b) have
                                        18




emphasized the likelihood of errors due to the indirect measurement of

the value of stocks and bonds, and to the fact that the value of a

firm's shares depends on everything owned by the corporations, not just

their physical capital but also intangible capital, natural resources,

goodwill, monopoly position, and firm—specific human capital.         The

denominator of the Q    ratio   is likely to be measured with error, because

of the absence of a complete inventory of the capital actually in place,

and the need for approximations that may ignore premature retirements

(due, for instance, to changes in energy prices), and mismeasurement of

the replacement price of capital due to inadequate adjustment for

quality change.

     To date empirical results with the Q model have been disappointing.

It does not perform as well in the 1970s as other alternatives (Clark,

1979), and yields a relatively low R2 even when carefully adjusted for

tax effects (Summers,    1981).10   One possible problem is illustrated by

the increases in energy prices after the two oil shocks of the 1980s.

These were followed by a sharp decline in the stock market and in

measured average Q,    but not by a marked decline in investment.     This

might reflect a production relation in which capital and energy are

substitutes, so that a higher relative price of energy induces new

capital investment.

     Similarly, an episode of "wage push" that increases the share of

labor on a semi—permanent basis could well reduce the Q      ratio   for a long

time by depressing the numerator much faster than the denominator can

adjust.   Recall that the denominator is the replacement cost of capital,

measured as today's capital goods price index times a perpetual inven-

tory measure of the real capital stock.      If the inflation rate is larger
                                       19




than the retirement rate, the denominator of the Q        ratio   can grow while

the numerator is falling.      A decline in the stock market can occur when

higher prices of labor or energy eliminate the profit earned by old

plants, but nevertheless firms may keep operating these plants as long

as they contribute more to cash flow than to variable cost (recent

examples include dinosaur steel plants recently closed by U.         S. Steel or

the 707s finally grounded by TWA four years after the second oil shock).

     Even if Q could somehow be measured accurately, with a correct

measure of capital actually in place used to calculate the denominator

of the Q   ratio,   empirical tests of the theory would run aground on a

basic asymmetry in adjustment costs and gestation lags that seems to

have been ignored.      An increase in Q above unity should induce positive

net investment limited only by the size of adjustment costs and delivery

lags, but a decrease in Q below unity induces negative net investment

subject to a quite different set of adjustment costs.         Firms may not

retire capital until its cash flow falls to its variable cost, and there

may be a long transition period that brings with it the danger of bank-

ruptcy before this variable cost point is actually reached.          Firms with

little profit—making potential and with a near—zero value on the stock

market may nonetheless have sufficient residual goodwill or monopoly

power to be able to keep themselves afloat by issuing debt, as has been

so evident in the airline industry.         An implication is that a revival of

industry fortunes (due, for instance, to a decline in energy prices) may

cause stock prices to soar without setting off an investoent boom, as

firms concentrate on paying off debt and restructuring their balance

sheets.

     Such portfolio rearrangements can create considerable looseness
                                      20




between stock market movements and investment decisions.     The same

looseness may be caused in part by a differing evaluation of a company's

future formed by firm management from that formed by the market.        In

graduate school we were first exposed to Paul Samuelson's joke that "the

stock market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions," and we

also have heard much from 0dig1iani—Cohn (1979) and others about irra-

tionality in market valuations.     So it seems no wonder that management

should be as skeptical of the market's verdict in making valuations as

we economists have been.     In a recent survey of 600 companies, Business

Week found that 60 percent of responding executives felt that the "real

value" of their company was undervalued by the stock market."

     Our criticism of the Q    theory has been based on asymmetric adjust—

ment costs and possible irrationality or differences in opinion in

market valuations.     It is related to the critique by Bosworth (1975),

which stresses that firms will pay little attention to Q, because the

stock market fluctuates excessively, while investment projects take time

to plan and construct.     Bosworth's argument is criticized by Fischer and

Merton (1984), who deny that managers would ignore the stock market even

when granting Bosworth the extreme assumptions that (a) there occurs a

completely exogenous and irrational decline in the stock market (with an

accompanying increase in the expected return on the stock market from 15

to 20 percent) while (b) firm managers' assessments are "completely

unaffected by such animal spirits and they know with certainty the true

objective probabilities" (that the expected equilibrium real return is

15 percent) (p. 39).     Even in such a situation, Fischer and Merton

argue, the stock market would influence investment, since rational

managers would use retained earnings to purchase their own or other
                                     21




firms' shares.   Similarly, they would be reluctant to finance new

investments by issuing equity at the depressed stock market prices.

     No doubt some firms are influenced by such considerations.

However, others may forge ahead with new investment projects, for at

least two reasons.   First, animal spirits may influence the stock and

bond markets differently.    The 1973—75 episode of collapsing stock

market was accompanied by negative short—term ex post real interest

rates and by long—term real bond rates that were relatively low, judged

either in terms of the high contemporaneous inflation rate of 1974—75 or

by the average inflation rate of the 1974—81 period viewed retrospec-

tively.   Thus firms may simply have switched from equity to debt issue.

Fischer and Merton would contend that rational managers should have

borrowed short—term to buy back their shares instead of planning new

investment projects, but their view seems to ignore the potentially

large costs of postponing investment projects.

     Managers face a tradeoff between the uncertain capital gains to be

made on purchase and subsequent resale of their own shares or those of

other firms, and the less uncertain losses that would be incurred if

(given long lead times and gestation lags) new capacity were not

constructed now in anticipation of the next period of prosperity and

high capacity utilization.   The planning and implementation of invest-

ment in new plant and equipment may be an ongoing bureaucratic process

involving high costs of delay or postponement.

     Surely the real world is characterized by both responses, with some

firms responding to a stock market slump that they believe to be tern—

porary by choosing the buy—back route, while others engage in friendly

or hostile take—over bids, and still others continuing with previously
                                       22




planned investment projects.      Fischer and Merton may argue correctly

that the stock market must make some difference to investment expendi-

tures, while we put forth the compatible argument that the stock market

may be used as just one piece of information, in addition to the

traditional factors (expected output, rental prices, etc.).      If this is

a correct interpretation, then the Q model, by including only the single

Q   variable,   as in (9), incorporates arbitrary exclusion restrictions,

just as does the neoclassical paradigm.      When we incorporate looser

restrictions into both approaches, they melt together into a generalized

reduced form in which output, interest rates, stock prices, the money

supply, tax rates, and other variables enter a model like (4) — (7) in

multiple roles, influencing desired capital, expectations, desired

adjustment speeds, and replacement rates.


Household Investment

       Household investment in durable goods and residential structures

has received much less attention than business investment in equipment

and structures.'2     This neglect cannot be justified by the share of

household fixed investment in GNP, as this share has been at least as

large as that of business investment throughout the 1919—83 period and

has become relatively larger in the past two decades.      Perhaps it is the

perception that household investment is passive rather than a driving

force in business cycles that has kept it in the background.      Expendi-

tures on consumer durables and residential structures, rather than being

treated on a par with business investment, enter into macroeconomic

model building mainly as a channel of transmission of monetary policy

episodes of disintermediation and credit controls.
                                      23




     There are many parallels between the models used for consumer

expenditure and those used to explain business investment.        Both the

simple Keynesian consumption—income relation and Friedman's permanent

income hypothesis are close analogues to certain variants of the

accelerator hypothesis of business investment behavior.        Lagged or

expected GNP is replaced as an explanatory variable by lagged or expec-

ted disposable income in moving from business to consumer investment,

but the mechanism remains the same.        More recent attempts at modeling

the consumer's decision, such as Bernanke (1982), treat optimal durable

goods investment within the framework of intertemporal utility maximiza-

tion under uncertainty.    The resulting model parallels closely the

"business investment in the presence of adjustment costs" literature

that originated with Lucas (1967).    All models like Bernanke's either

implicitly or explicitly require consumers to form expectations of

future values of relevant variables, leading to the same complications

(delivery lags, replacement timing) that occur for business investment

above in equation (8).    As is the case in (8), the estimated coeffi-

cients of the relevant time—serf es variables are under—identified

convolutions of many structural parameters.


Relation to Other Critiques

     Christopher Sims (1980a) presented a critique of traditional econo-

metric models and urged the profession to shift from structural estima-

tion to his atheoretical VARs.    In a sense the above critique of

structural investment equations represents a special case of Sims' more

general critique.   Both place particular emphasis on the fact that any

set of lagged variables may in principle influence expectations of a
                                    24




variable, and thus there is little justification for many of the exclu-

sion restrictions that are incorporated in traditional econometric

models.   For instance, there is ample evidence that it is suboptimal to

form expectations of real output using only a univariate autoregression,

as in most empirical implementations of the neoclassical investment

model and in such recent papers as Abel—Blanchard (1983).      In

contrast, our own recent work (Gordon, 1983b) shows that nominal GNP

growth is associated with past changes in interest rates, the monetary

base, and the money multiplier, with different weights in each postwar

decade.   And in another paper (1982) we showed that, for a given nominal

GNP change, real output depends among other things on its own lagged

value, lagged inflation, lagged changes in real energy prices, and

variables to capture the effects of government price—control programs.

     Despite the above critique of traditional investment equations and

its similarity to Sims' general critique, there is no need to go as far

as Sims in endorsing completely atheoretical VAR models.   Consideration

of a reduced—form equation like (8), together with the long list of

candidate variables that might influence expectations, suggests that

degrees of freedom are likely to be exhausted even in a relatively large

data set like that used in this paper.   VAR models estimated to date

usually involve short lists of aggregate variables without inclusion of

individual categories of expenditure, e.g., investment, or special

variables that might be important for a particular category.

     Gordon and King (1982) recommend an econometric approach that

combines the VAR approach with the estimation of reduced—form equations

suggested by traditional theory.   Both the reduced—form and VAR ap—

proaches can be viewed as selecting different methods of allocating zero
                                    25




restrictions in the face of scarce degrees of freedom.     Like any trade-

off in economics, the best way to allocate these restrictions should

depend on an assessment of benefits and costs.     The VAR technique,   in

which every variable is included on the right—hand side of every

equation with lag distributions of equal length,    is a useful tool for

checking traditional specifications and determining, for instance,

whether stock prices or the money supply "belong" in an investment

equation.   To repeat a phrase frequently used in oral discussions by

Sims, Shiller, and others, the VAR technique is an efficient way to

conduct "exploratory data analysis."

     But reduced—form econometrics must be guided by prior structural

analysis.   Excessive pursuit of symmetry in the VAR approach can lead an

investigator to omit particular variables that may matter for one equa-

tion but not others, e.g., variables to measure the effect of the

wartime price controls in a study of inflation, or the investment tax

credit in a study of investment behavior.    Gordon and King (and in more

detail King, 1983) have concluded that specifications used in some VAR

applications have been cavalier about detrending and have tended to

yield estimates that mix secular and cyclical effects and can result in

biased coefficients.

     The general Simsian critique, and our particular critique of the

investment literature, seem to point to estimation of highly unrestric-

ted and unconstrained specifications.    They appear to move in the

opposite direction from econometric work set in motion by the Lucas

(1976) critique, which has set out on the task of estimating parameters

"at deep levels of choice," e.g., parameters of utility and production

functions, that remain invariant in the face of changes in policy rules.
                                               26




As yet this line of research, represented for instance by Hansen and

singleton (1982), has not yet provided convincing time—series charac-

terizations of the major macroeconomic variables that might be compared

with traditional explanations.             Further, applications of the Hansen—

Singleton methodology appear to achieve "identification via an

'incredible' disturbance assumption," according to a recent critique by

Peter Garber and Robert King (1983).


The Hybrid Methodology:          Blending Structure with VAR Reduced Forms

      The central role of investment fluctuations in business cycles has

spawned an enormous number of papers that estimate structural investment

equations in which unconvincing simplifications and exclusion restric-

tions have been introduced to achieve identification.                   Often the focus

is on persuading the reader that the author's favorite explanatory

variable is statistically significant, or that some other author's

favorite variable is insignificant.                 Our skepticism regarding the

multiple roles played by aggregate time series variables, and our doubt

that any proxy for Tobin's "Q" can adequately summarize all of the

influences on investment appropriations and expenditures, leads us to

estimate reduced form equations.             Our point of departure is a list of

"candidate" explanatory variables that has been suggested in previous

theoretical research.         Our basic emphasis is on determining which varia-

bles play an important role in the investment process, and how much of

the variance of investment remains to be attributed to "innovations."

      The methodological approach adopted here is similar to that pre-

viously applied to the econometric explanation of inflation behavior.

equation that over the postwar period appears to remain relatively

stable and which, when estimated for the pre—1981 period, seems able to

track reasonably well the sharp disinflation that has occurred since

then.'4    Insights of previous structural models are used to develop the

list of explanatory variables, and to emerge with a specification that

introduces a few more constraints than typically appear in "pure" VAR

models.    The equation can be used to test for the exogeneity of parti-

cular sets of lagged variables in the inflation process, for temporal

stability, and for biases in one set of coefficients that results from

the omission of another variable.     They can be used to identify signi-

ficant shifts in sets of lagged coefficients between one period and

another.    However, what has been lost in the inflation equation litera-

ture, and what cannot be regained, is the ability to use particular

coefficients to identify specific aspects of the behavior of labor

markets as opposed to product markets.'5

       The specification of the investment equation in this paper begins

with the lagged dependent variable.     Just as we are interested in

"inflation inertia," we are interested in "investment inertia."        The

serial correlation properties of the investment process, which result at

least in part from aggregation over heterogeneous projects having

different gestation lags, are part of the basic "propagation mechanism"

by which random shocks in the demand for investment goods are translated

into business cycles displaying persistence in the devfation of output

from   trend.   Most previous econometric work on investment, whether based

on a neoclassical specification like (3) or a "Q"    specification   like

(9), has omitted the lagged dependent variable.     If the "true" invest-

ment process exhibits a high degree of positive serial correlation, then
                                               28




estimated coefficients are likely to be biased when the lagged dependent

variable is omitted.          Although we exhibit evidence of the effects of

this misspeciflcation below, the nature of the bias can be illustrated

in the following simple model.              Imagine that the true model of

investment spending (In) involves both an accelerator effect on the

lagged change in output (LX_i), and dependence on the lagged dependent

variable (I....i):



(10)
          It     =                +
                                       pI   ÷ e,


while the misspecified regression that is actually estimated is:


(11)      It =       bAXi     +       Ut.

By the usual analysis of specification error in the case of a left—out

variable, we can write the expectation of the estimated accelerator

coefficient as:


(12)      E(b)       =    +


where y is the coefficient of the 'auxiliary" regression of lagged

investment on the lagged change in output.              Since investment is part of

output, there is a presumption that y is positive, although a precise

expression for y requires a more complete specification of the time—

series process generating non—investment output.              A full analysis of

this problem would also need to take account of the fact that most

empirical accelerator equations include a set of current and several

lagged X terms.          It is sufficient here to note simply that tests of the

accelerator hypothesis may yield biased coefficients, as in (12), and

that the error term in (11) is quite likely to exhibit serial correla—
                                             29




tion,    since it is related to the "true" error term e as follows:


(13)       u = e     +   p[(l—y)I       +           —



where N is non—investment output.

        The list of. regressors for our investment equations, in addition to

the lagged dependent variable, begins with the two central variables in

the neoclassical approach, the change in output and in the real price of

capital services (C/P).       Tobin's    Q   is   included as well, in combination

with the neoclassical variables rather than alone as in (9).                Because

changes in the money stock may be relevant both for the formation of

expectations and/or as a proxy for the effect of credit rationing, these

are included as well.      The most important variables that are omitted are

the prices of other inputs besides capital, e.g., the real wage and real

energy prices.     This omission is justified by the need to control the

scale of this empirical investigation, which tends to grow with the

square of the explanatory variables considered as candidates.

        The empirical equations share with the VAR approach the use of

unconstrained and relatively short lag distributions, and the inclusion

of the same number of lags for each explanatory variable, including the

lagged dependent variable.          In our initial research, as in much other

recent VAR research, lag distributions were limited to four quarters.

Subsequently we adjusted the lag length to eight quarters for the

postwar period, in light of the evidence that the coefficient on the

price of capital services for the postwar period is sensitive to an

extension of lag length.      Contemporaneous values of variables are

excluded from the estimated regressions.                Subsequently we examine

correlations among contemporaneous orthogonalized innovations in a VAR
                                         30




model containing equations for investment and for each of our final set

of explanatory variables.        At that stage we carry out several "innova-

tion accounting" exercises for two alternative choices of the ordering

of contemporaneous errors in the VAR system.        As shown by Gordon and

King (1982, pp. 212—14), such choices amount to decisions about

admitting current variables into the estimating equations.

      The specification of the investment equations in this paper differs

from most applications of the VAR technique in its correction for

heteroscedasticity and in its attention to the form of variables.        All

real expenditure series are normalized by "natural real GNP" (XN).           The

money supply is expressed in real terms, since it is entered into an

equation for real investment expenditures, and it is also normalized by

xN.   Our empirical tests also examine shifts in coefficients over time.

The precise values of the individual lag coefficients are of no particu-

lar interest.   Instead, we emphasize exclusion tests on the contribution

of all lags of a given right—hand variable, running these tests for both

the interwar and postwar period.        This technique allows us to determine

whether the relative contribution of different sets of variables has

changed over time.     There is no analogy in the paper to the usual search

for significant coefficients, since either positive or negative results

in the exclusion tests are equally interesting.


                     III.    DATA AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS


Development of the Basic Variables


      This paper investigates the historical behavior of four categories

of fixed investment:        producers' durable equipment (PDE), nonresidential

structures (NRS), residential structures (RS), and consumer durable
                                    31




expenditures (CD).   While in the previous literature some of these cate-

gories have been analyzed with different theories in separate papers,

here they all seem amenable to analysis within the same reduced—form

methodology.   Our inclusion of consumer durable expenditures as part of

"investment" creates an overlap in coverage with Hall's paper in this

volume.

     Quarterly data on the four investment categories for 1947—83 come

from the National Income and Product Accounts.    Investment and real GNP

data for 1919—41 are created by the Chow and Lin (1971) method of inter-

polation from a variety of sources, as described in the data appendix.

We have been careful to interpolate each component of real GNP on the

basis of separate data sources, in order to avoid a spurious correlation

between dependent and explanatory variables in this study.     The Chow—Lin

method is an iterative procedure in which a regression is run to explain

a data series available only annually (e.g., real GNP), using as explan-

atory variables the annual average of one or more series available

monthly (e.g., industrial production and real retail sales).     In this

example the coefficients from the regression are used to create monthly

(or in our case quarterly) values for real GNP.

     Some investigators have carried out historical studies with raw

monthly data rather than interpolated data.   Examples include Bernanke

(1983b), Sims (1980b), and the papers in this volume by Bernanke/Powell

and Blinder/HoltzEakin.    This makes sense when comparable monthly data

are available for both the interwar and postwar periods.     However,

investigators of postwar investment behavior have uniformly used

national accounts quarterly data, not monthly data on the industrial

production of producers durables and on square feet of nonresidential
                                    32




construction.   To achieve comparability in a study of investment,

interpolated quarterly data for the interwar period are preferable.

Further, to use the raw monthly data would involve discarding the

information available in the annual averages for components of real

GNP.   It seems clear from the literature that the previous absence of

quarterly investment expenditure data for the interwar period has caused

investigators to limit themselves to the postwar period, and it is to be

hoped that the availability of the new data set will spur further

historical research on investment and other components of real GNP.

       All expenditure series, real GNP, the real capital stock, and the

                                         natural real GNP   (XN)   series,
real money supply are deflated by the

the creation of which is described in Gordon (1984a, Appendix C).       The

basic procedure is to establish a constant "natural rate of unemploy-

ment" for the portion of the labor force not engaged as self—employed

farmers and proprietors——this natural rate is arbitrarily set equal to

the rate estimated for 1954 in a study of inflation dynamics covering

the 1954—80 period.    Then, adjusting for the shrinking share of self—

employed proprietors (who are not counted among the unemployed), the

corresponding total natural unemployment rate series is used to estab-

lish the level of      in selected benchmark years (1901, 1912, 1923,

1929, 1949, and 1954).    Since actual and natural unemployment are not

equal in the benchmark years, an assumed "Okun's Law    coefficient of 2.0

was used in calculating      for those years, and the values for inter-

vening years were interpolated using logarithms.    The deflation by          is

introduced to avoid heteroscedasticitythe level of          rises from $229

billion in 1919 to $1667 billion in 1983.    Use of the XN series is

 superior to detrending in a study of business cycles, since detrending
                                            33




for a period like 1929—41 yields an unrealistically low estimate of

"normal" conditions.

     In addition to data on investment expenditures, thisstudy has

developed five other series as possible explanatory variables.                All are

from original sources, and only the capital stock is interpolated.                The

others are available monthly.

          (1)     Capital stock.     This is available as an annual series from

the Commerce Department capital stock study for both producers durable

equipment and nonresidential structures.              Four concepts are available,

gross and net, in current and constant dollars.              In this study the net

real stock is interpolated quarterly (as described in the data

appendix).      It is used and subsequently rejected as an explanatory

variable, and the net real stock times the current investment price

deflator isused as an estimate of the replacement cost of capital for

construction of the     'Q   proxy" described below.
          (2)    Real Money Supply and Real Monetary Base.           The "High

Powered Money" series is from Friedman—Schwartz (1970), divided by the

interpolated GNP deflator, and linked to the corresponding postwar

series.   The Ml series has been created by Benjamin Friedman back to

1915 on a basis that is consistent with the current (early 1980s)

definition.

          (3)    "Average Q'.      First   a "Q    Proxy" series is calculated as an

index number, with 1972:Q2          1.0, since the numerator and denominator

are in different units.       The numerator is the Standard and Poors 500

stock price index, and the denominator is the replacement—cost net

capital stock index described above.              This quarterly series is used to

interpolate Summers' annual average "conventional Q"             series   (1981, Table
                                          34




3, column 1) for the period 1931—1979.           Data for 1919—30 and 1980—83 are

obtained by linking "Q Proxy" to the interpolated Summers series in 1931

and 1980.

            (4)     Real Interest Rate.   The expected inflation rate used to

calculate the real interest rate is typically computed as the predicted

value from a simple time—series regression including lagged inflation

and a few other lagged variables.         Invariably this leads to a predicted

series in which the main weight is carried by the first lag on infla-

tion, and the result is a highly volatile estimate of the expected

inflation rate and the corresponding expected real interest rate

relevant for investment decisions.         In this study the volatile series

produced by this procedure is ignored, and in its place we use a twelve—

quarter "rectangular" weighted average of past inflation.           Even this

arbitrary approximation is flawed, however, because it gives unreason-

able values in periods for the first few years after both World War I

and World War II.        As one of us has argued previously (1973), rational

agents would have treated wars and immediate postwar periods as special

episodes, in light of a long history of wartime inflation and postwar

deflation.        Since there was no trend in prices over the century before

World War I, an expected inflation rate of zero is imposed for the

interval 1919—24, and the twelve—quarter average is introduced beginning

in 1925:Q1.       After World War II the same procedure is used for 1947—49,

except that the constant value is set equal to 2.6 percent, the value of

the twelve—quarter average in 1950:Q1.          This series on expected infla-

tion is subtracted from the Baa rate,          to reflect the presumed relevance

of a less—than—highest—grade interest rate for the average investment

decision.

             (5)   The Real Price of Capital Services (C/P).     Standard

formulae, shown in the appendix, are used to calculate the real price of

capital services from a variety of data sources.         The before—tax real

borrowing rate is taken to be the real Baa rate, from (4) above.            This

facilitates comparisons of the effects ofthe full C/P variable as con-

trasted with that of the real Baa rate, one of the major components of

C/P.     The depreciation rate included in the estimate of C/P is that

which is yielded by an iterative search for the rate that makes the

quarterly interpolated capital stock series in (1) above consistent with

the published annual capital stock series and our new interpolated

quarterly investment series.         Tax rates are obtained from published

sources, as described in the appendix.


Fixed Investment in Recessions, 1920—1982


        Descriptive statistics on the variables used in this paper are

provided in Tables 1,    2, and 3.      The first of these calculates the

percentage decline in three ratios to           over the 13 recessions in our

sample period, five in the interwar period and eight in the postwar

period.     NBER reference cycles are used throughout, and this creates an

inconsistency between the cycle dating procedure actually used (see the

chronology paper by Moore—Zarnowitz in this volume) and the "growth

cycle     concept that would be more relevant given our deflation of real

variables by xN.

        Column (1) of Table   1   shows the percentage decline in the "output

ratio" X/XN, ranging from 42.8 percent in 1929—33 to only 2.7 percent in

1960—61.    The next three columns exhibit recession declines in the ratio

of three different investment magnitudes to X——all four types of

expenditure,   the two "business" types (PDE+NRS), and the two "household"

types (.TRS+CD),   respectively.     Leaving aside the mammoth numbers for

1929—33, the largest absolute declines in total investment were in the

recessions of 1920—21, 1937—38, and 1973—75, in that order.

     The remaining columns of Table       1   establish the importance of fixed

investment behavior as a contributing factor in business cycles.            Shown

for each cycle is the percent of the total decline in the x/xN         ratio
accounted for by the decline in the ratio of total investment         to   xN.

While these percentages are quite small for the first two postwar

recessions, in other recessions they range from 30 to 78 percent, with

the recessions in which investment played the largest role ranked as

1920—21, 1960—61, and 1980.        Interestingly, the relative contribution of

investment to the Great Contraction of 1929—33 was less than in all five

of the postwar recessions between 1957—58 and 1980.         There seems to be

no systematic difference between the interwar and postwar recessions in

the division of the investment decline between the two business types

and the two household types.       The two business types accounted for a

larger contribution in eight of the 13 recessions, and the two household

types for the remainder.

     The three right—hand columns display an elasticity concept,

measured as the percentage change in the ratios shown in columns (5)

through (7) divided by the average value of each ratio in the peak

quarter of each cycle.     An elasticity of unity would indicate that the

decline in investment was proportional to its peak—quarter share, i.e.,

that the percentage responses of investment and non—investment were

equal.   An elasticity above unity indicates that the contribution of

investment to the decline in real GNP was larger than its peak—quarter
                                      37




share in real GNP, and that the contribution of non—investment must have

been smaller.     For all four types of investment (column 8), the elasti-

cities range from 0.6 to 3.8.     The elasticity for the Great Contraction

is a middle—ranked 1.8, less than in the 1920—21, 1923—24, and 1937—38

interwar recessions, and all five of the recessions between 1957—58 and

1980.     At least one example with a low elasticity can be easily

explained, the 1953—54 recession in which the dominant depressing

influence on real CNP was the post—Korea decline in defense spending.

And the relatively high elasticity of household investment In 1980 may

reflect the Influence of the Carter credit controls.


Means and Standard Deviations

        Table 2 displays means and standard deviations of the variables

used in this paper over thirteen complete trough—to—trough business

cycles between 1919 and 1982, and one incomplete cycle between 1938 and

1941.     Also shown are averages for the entire interwar period and

postwar period.     Each cell shows the mean, with the associated standard

deviation displayed immediately below in parentheses.        The first column

shows that on average the x/xN    ratio    was considerably higher In the

postwar period than the interwar period, and of this 10.3 percentage

point difference, 5.2 points are accounted for by the four investment

types taken together.     Also evident is the much higher standard deviaton

of the X/X' and the total real investment series during the interwar

period over individual cycles.     The regression equations in the subse-

quent tables of results cover several business cycles in each sub—sample

changes in means across cycles.

      In this light it     is interesting to note the high means for both

types of structures investment that reflect the construction boom of the

1920s, which plays a large role in some nonmonetary explanations of the

Great Depression (see Gordon—Wilcox, 1981) and in our analysis below in

Part V.    The ratios to       of nonresidential structures were higher in

the 1921, 1924, and 1927 cycles than in any postwar cycle.        The mean for

the 1924 cycle was highest for residential construction, followed by

1949 and a tie between 1921 and 1954.        The ratios to xN of producers'

durable equipment and consumer durables show quite a different pattern,

with all three of the highest ratios achieved during the 1971—82 period.

      Another difference between the two structures types and the two

equipment types concerns the difference between the interwar and postwar

standard deviations.       The standard deviations of nonresidential and

residential structures fell from 2.4 to 0.5 and 1.6 to 0.8 points,

respectively.   The standard deviations of producers and consumer dura—

bles fell much less, from 1.4 to 0.9 and 1.3 to 1.1., respectively.

While nonresidential structures had by far the highest standard devia-

tion in the interwar years, consumer durables had the highest standard

deviation in the postwar years.

      Additional insight into the behavior of investment spending is

provided by Figures 1 and 2.       The former displays real GNP (X), total

investment (I), and non—investment GNP (N), each expressed as a ratio to

XN.   Here we note the contrast between the volatility of I in the 1920—

21 recession and subsequent recovery, and its relative stability during

1923—29.    Evident throughout the interwar period is the high positive

covariance between I and N;      this covariance appears to occur at annual

and lower frequencies and is not an artifact of our interpolation

procedure.     The postwar period is dominated by the large bulge in N

during the Korean war, although there is a less pronounced hump in I in

1972—74.     Also evident is the downward drift in both X and N relative to

I after 1966.     The robust health of the i/xN   ratio   in the last half of

the l970s suggests the possibility that our average Q        variable   may

perform poorly, in light of its collapse after 1973.

     Figure 2 exhibits each of the four categories of investment, also

expressed as a ratio to xN.    The investment boom of the 1920s and the

unusual share of boom contributed by nonresidential structures are

clearly visible.    The 1930s are characterized by a simultaneous collapse

in all four categories, as well as by a milder slump of consumer durable

spending.    By 1939—40, the two equipment categories had each recovered

to within a percentage point of the 1926—29 average, but residential

structures had only recovered to about half of the 1926—29 level, and

nonresidential structures to less than one—third.         Postwar business

cycles exhibit a continuing shift from structures to equipment, together

with a general tendency for booms in residential structures to lead

booms in PDE, with consumer durables in between.      Cycles in nonresiden-

tial structures do not coincide with those in the other four categories,

with the appearance of a process involving much longer lags.

     Table 2 exhibits the means and standard deviations of the major

explanatory variables——the real money stock expressed as a ratio to

the price of capital services, average Q, and the real Baa rate.          The

behavior of these variables is illustrated in Figure 3, where each is

expressed as an index with l9l9:Q1 =    1.0.   The most stable variable in

both the interwar and postwar periods was real Ml, the variation of
                                         40




which consists of a slight uptrend at the end of the 1930s and a

consistent downtrend during the postwar period.            The standard deviation

of real Ml is smaller than that of total investment within most interwar

cycles and is about the same order of magnitude during postwar cycles.

       The capital service price has a small standard deviation and little

drift.    It exhibits two major humps, in response to high real interest

rates in 1930—34 and 1980—83.        The smaller degree of volatility in the

capital service price than in the real interest rate reflects the

dominant role in the former variable of a fixed depreciation rate.             Both

the service price and the real interest rate exhibit minima in 1936—37,

1952—53, and 1975—77, reflecting 'price increases that are subtracted

from the nominal Baa rate.        The average Q   variable   (expressed as a

percent in Table 2) has a much higher mean in the interwar period than

in the postwar.      The standard deviation of Q averaged over the interwar

period was double that in the postwar, and the average for individual

cycles in the interwar period was more than four times higher than the

average for individual postwar cycles.

       The regression analysis in the next part of the paper compares the

differing relative contributions of lagged investment and lagged GNP in

explaining current investment.        As a preliminary, we present a decompo-

sition of variance of the ratios to            of real GNP (X), real investment

(I), and real non—investment CNP (N).          A familiar formula linking the

variances   of these three variables is:


(14)        var(X)   =   var(I)   + var(N) +   2cov(I,N)

The top half of Table 3 presents a decomposition of variance as in (12)

for the interwar and postwar periods, and for two halves of the postwar.

postwar period is immediately apparent.   There is no decline, however,

in the ratio var(I)/var(X), which is slightly higher in 1947—65 and

1947—83 than in 1919—41.   The most interesting contrast between the

interwar and postwar period is in the covariance term.   The positive

covariance between I and N contributes almost half of the total variance

of real CNP in 1919—41, whereas it contributes a negligible fraction in

1947—65 and is actually negative in the postwar period taken as a whole.

One may conjecture that, while the interwar period was dominated by the

cyclical behavior of private spending, much of the variance of non—

investment in the postwar period was contributed by government spending.

The negative covariance of I and N in the postwar may suggest that

investment was "crowded out" by major increases in government spending.

     The bottom half of the table shows that about two—thirds of the

total variance of investment in the interwar period was contributed by

the covariance term, i.e., a shock common to all investment types rather

than to only one.   In the two halves of the postwar the covariance terms

contribute less than half, and virtually nothing for the postwar period

taken as a whole.   The largest "own—variance" in the full postwar period

is for consumer durables, but the smaller value of this term for the two

separate halves of the postwar indicates the dominance of a trend

effect.   Nonresidential structures shifted from contributing the largest own—

variance in the interwar period to the smallest in the postwar period.

   IV.     REGRESSION EQUATIONS EXPLAINING TOTAL INVESTMENT EXPENDITURES


Will the Real Accelerator Please Stand Up?

     The starting point of our hybrid methodology is to determine the

specification for a reduced form investment equation that seems "reason—

able" on an a priori basis.    Our goal is then to use the estimated

reduced form equations to suggest "data—coherent" ways of moving to more

structural models and interpretations.      In arriving at such interpreta-

tions, we recognize the conventional wisdom that many structural models

may imply the same reduced form.    However, there is a similar problem

with structural models.    Quite dissimilar "structural" models may    result
when the same general economic phenomenon is interpreted by different

authors.

     For example, a starting point in many studies of investment

behavior, and an ending point in some,     is the accelerator hypothesis.

In its simplest form, dating back to Clark (1917), it explains the level

of real investment as a function of the change in real GNP.      But this

apparently straightforward idea does not imply a single "structural"

specification.    The change in real GNP may enter only as a current

value, or as a combination of current and lagged values.      Or the

investigation may start from the "flexible accelerator" hypothesis, in

which investment depends on the current level of output and one lagged

value of the capital stock.    Or one might adopt a more general dynamic

specification, as in Table 4 below, that allows several lagged values of

investment to enter as well as current and lagged changes in output.

Since the coefficient on lagged investment turns out to be roughly

unity, this last alternative amounts to a regression explaining the

change of investment spending, in which case the accelerator hypothesis

would call for the output variable to enter as a second difference.          A

rational expectations approach to the accelerator, as in Abel—Blanchard

(1983), would imply a reduced form in which levels of expected future

output appear, rather than lagged values.      These expectations may be

functions of many variables in addition to lagged output.       An extreme

version of the expectational approach to investment behavior might lead

to the conclusion that investment is a random walk, parallel to Hall's

(1978) interpretation of consumption as a random walk.

     All these models are merely alternative formulations of a single

underlying structure, the accelerator mechanism.      However each model

results in a different specification for the appropriate reduced form

equation.   This proliferation of structural models is also a problem

with the other mechanisms that are claimed to be of importance for

explaining investment, e.g., the Q approach.      To avoid losing sight of

our objectives by examining a multitude of different formulations, we

choose to set up "straw man"   reduced    forms that are relatively unres-

tricted and allow alternative explanatory variables suggested by alter-

native theories to enter on equal terms.


Contribution of the Accelerator and the Cost of Capital

     We begin by examining reduced—form regressions for each of the four

individual categories of total investment:      consumer durables, residen-

tial structures, producers durable equipment, and nonresidential struc-

tures.   We begin at a disaggregated level and subsequently study the

consequences of alternative aggregation schemes.      In Table 4 and later

tables, the full sample period of available quarterly data is divided
                                       44




into 1919—41 and 1947—83.      In preliminary work a break was allowed in

 the middle of the postwar period at 1965, but Chow tests rejected the

hypothesis of a structural change for most equations, and so here the

postwar period is treated as a single entity.      There are insufficient

degrees of freedom available to test for a structural break within the

interwar periodat 1929.       Chow tests indicate a decisive break in

structure at World War     ii.16
       Our reduced form equations omit the lagged capital stock (K...i)

term, which appears in (3), for two reasons.      First, an identity links

the lagged capital stock and lagged investment, precluding an investment

equation containing several lagged values of investment from also

including several lagged values of the capital stock.       Second, while a

single lagged value of the capital stock may appear, preliminary tests

indicated statistical insignificance in every sample period.

       Tables 4 and 5 are arranged in two sections, corresponding to the

two sample periods (interwar and postwar).      Each cell in the table

contains results for each of the four categories of investment spending

in the following format:      the first line of each cell gives the sum of

coefficients with its significance level, and the second line exhibits

the significance level for an F—test on the exclusion of all lags of

that explanatory variable.     A blank on the second line indicates that

the 10 percent level of statistical significance was not attained.

      The first line for each investment type in Tables 4 and 5 presents

the   regression   results for what might be termed a   naive accelerator!—

cost of capital" specification of the investment equation.       The log

level of investment spending (I/XN) is regressed on 8 lagged first

differences of real non—investment GNP, N/XN, and 8 lagged values of

first differences of the appropriate real cost of capital series

(LC1P).    In the regressions involving household investment in Table 5,

real personal disposable income, y1jxN, replaces real GNP, and 8 lags

of the first difference of the real Baa interest rate is used as a proxy

for the price of investment. In line 1 both the        and DW statistic are

very low for all categories over all periods, indicating a poor fit and

serially correlated errors.     The "accelerator" variable passes the

exclusion test only for producers durables in the interwar and for

exhibited by the "cost of capital," which passes the exclusion test only

for postwar residential structures.

     Line 2 in each block is identical to line 1, except that four lags

of the dependent variable are included as additional regressors.           The

results from these regressions further weaken the case for the accelera-

tor and the price of investment.     For all categories and all sample

periods the lagged dependent variables terms enter significantly at the

one percent level.   Both the accelerator and the price of investment

become insignificant for most types and sample periods.       While the

accelerator variable has explanatory power for postwar producers

durables, and consumer durables in both periods, the sums of the coeffi-

cients are insignificantly different from zero in every equation.

Overall this formulation of the two traditionally dominant explanations

of investment behavior fares poorly in both the interwar and the postwar

periods.


Contribution of Q and Real Ml

    As the sum of coefficients on lagged investment in line 2 of each
                                                46




block is close to unity, the equation amounts to an explanation of the

behavior of the first difference of investment.                    To be consistent with

the first difference format, in line 3 the accelerator is expressed as

the first difference of the first difference of real non—investment GNP,

MN/XN, and the remaining explanatory variables are entered as lagged

values of their first differences.               Non—investment GNP and the cost of

capital or interest rate terms enter with 8 lags, while the remaining

explanatory variables enter with 4 lags.                  Our measure for Tobin's

average Q has no significant explanatory power, except for postwar

nonresidential structures, and as often as not enters with the wrong

sign.     The change in C/P       continues to be insignificant in the exclusion
tests, although the sum of coefficients is significantly negative for

the two durables categories in the postwar.

        Previous research by King (1983) and Sims (1983) has emphasized a

distinction between the role of inside and outside money as a determin-

ant of real output.         In the work of King this distinction is implemented

by entering the two multiplicative components of Ml, the money

multiplier and monetary base (Mi/P                m(B/P)), separately in VAR models

for total output.        We can investigate the same issue here and inquire

whether the effect of monetary changes on investment occurs through the

multiplier, the base, or a mixture of the two.                   The first difference

specification for the explanatory variables suggests that we should

split the change in Mi. into the level of the multiplier times the first

difference in the base (mtB/P), and the level of the base times the

first difference in the multiplier (l3/Ptm).                 Both components enter

significantly into the equations for producers and consumers durables,

interwar and postwar.          The change in the money multiplier has moderate
                                      47




explanatory power for both structures categories in the postwar, as well

as for nonresidential structures in the interwar.


Other Specifications.


        The final reduced form specification appears in line 3 or 4 of each

block.     The specification in line 4 differs from that of line 3 only in

the exclusion of variables that are significant but have the wrong

sign.     Both the accelerator and the price of investment are included

along with average Q and the monetary variables.     The accelerator

variable is significant only for postwar producer durables.     We experi-

mented with alternative specifications of the final reduced form in

order to check the robustness of our results.     In these tests the cost

of capital term in the business investment equations was replaced by the

real Baa rate, but this rate was never significant and as often as not

carried the wrong sign.

     A variant of the "expectatiorial accelerator" was also estimated by

a two—stage procedure.     Time series models for non—investment GNP and

personal disposable income were estimated and used to generate k—step

ahead forecasts.     Eight leads of these forecasts, in various trans-

formations, were used as explanatory variables but were always insig-

nificant, often with the wrong sign, for all but postwar producers

durable equipment.    This set of results implies that the significant

monetary variables in Tables 4 and 5 enter directly into the determin-

ation of investment spending, rather than indirectly through an effect

on expectations of future output.


Summary of Disaggregated Results

    Perhaps the most surprising result of these initial reduced form
                                      48




estimates is the small explanatory role accorded conventional variables

and the large role given to unconventional variables like the real money

supply.     The poor showing of the interest rate and cost of capital,

combined with the singular importance of average Q     for   non—residential

structures, lead one to suspect that the financing decision is an

important determinant of investment expenditures.      The broad role played

by the money multiplier may indicate that credit rationing, rather than

interest rate changes, may be the primary constraint in the financing

decision.     This view is consistent with that expressed in Roosa (1950)

as to the dominant channel through which monetary policy affects the

economy.

     The similarities in the behavior of the two structures and the two

durable goods categories suggest that aggregation by asset type rather

than by decision maker is preferable.      This approach to disaggregation

would also be in accord with Tobin's asset approach, insofar as durable

goods are normally shorter lived than structures.      However, this

approach is at odds with the conventional structural approach to

investment.    With its focus on the investment decision, the traditional

approach has always aggregated by the decision—maker (i.e., household

vs. business) rather than by the character of the asset (i.e.,

structures vs. equipment).


Aggregation Schemes


     Table 6 displays our basic equation for two alternative aggregation

schemes, household/business and durables/structures. The household

/business aggregation scheme is not particularly successful.       In the

interwar period both categories appear to be autonomous, with only

lagged "own values" passing the exclusion test (as well as the money

multiplier in the business equation).       Both real monetary variables

become highly significant for the two categories in the postwar.       The

only difference in behavior between household and business investment

appears In the postwar, when business investment exhibits a strong

accelerator effect.     If we were to ignore real balance effects, as does

most of the literature, then aggregation by decision—maker would result

in a pair of highly autonomous investment series in the interwar period.

Stated another way, this aggregation scheme would indicate that the

decision—maker does not respond to relevant economic variables.

     Aggregation by the asset character of investment leads to more

illuminating results.     Durable equipment and structures exhibit marked

differences in behavior in both sample periods.       Structures investment

for 1919—41 is quite autonomous, but durables expenditures exhibit

sensitivity to interest rates (with the wrong sign) and to real monetary

variables.     More important is the finding that real money balances are

highly significant in explaining both investment categories in the

postwar.     Durable goods are sensitive to the accelerator and interest

rates (with the correct sign), whereas structures depend significantly

on the average Q    variable.   This result may indicate the importance of

the different financing methods that are used for equipment and Struc-

tures.     One might think of short—lived assets as financed to a large

extent by internally generated funds, i.e., retained earnings and

disposable income, while investment in structures may depend heavily on

conditions in the bond and security markets.

     Using the alternative aggregation criterion of asset durability

produces the most sensible results in Table 6.      Investment behavior is
                                      50




found to differ between short and long—lived assets in a way that is

statistically significant.     The accelerator and the Baa rate are both

important for investment in durables, while structures (dominated by the

non—residential category) respond to average Q.     These results provide

evidence supporting the importance of financial conditions for invest-

ment decisions.     What is surprising is the way in which the conventional

investment literature, with its emphasis on the business investment

decision, has overemphasized disaggregation by decision—maker and has

glossed over the importance of the asset characteristics of investment

and the role of real monetary variables.


               V.   INVESTMENT IN A VECTOR—AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL


Correlations Among Contemporaneous Innovations

     The equations estimated in Tables 4—6 investigate the feedback from

the various lagged explanatory variables to components of investment,

but they say nothing about the relationships among contemporaneous

innovations in the variables, nor about the feedback from investment to

the explanatory variables.     These issues can be addressed by analyzing a

vector—autoregressive (VAR) system that contains the primary variables

of interest.    We economize on space by restricting attention to a VAR

model containing six variables——real investment in structures (ISTR),

real investment in durable goods (lUG), real non—investment GNP (N), the

real money base (B/P), the Ml money multiplier (m), and the real Baa

interest rate (r).     For the interwar period the interest rate variable

in Table 6 has the incorrect (positive) sign in the equations for both

ISTR and IDG, leading us to choose a five—variable system omitting the

interest rate for 1920—41.
                                         51




        All variables (except m and r) are once again expressed as ratios

to natural real GNP       (xN).   To maintain the symmetry required for the VAR

system, all variables are expressed as first differences, in contrast to

Tables 4—6, where investment is expressed as a ratio, output as a second

difference, and the other variables as first differences.          Extra degrees

of freedom allow the inclusion of eight lags on all variables in the

postwar period, as opposed to four lags in the interwar period.

        Columns in Table 7 correspond to each of the six variables in the

VAR system.     A slash (I) divides the interwar result from the postwar

result in both the top and bottom sections of the table.          The dashes

(———)    indicate    the exclusion of the interest rate in the interwar

model.     The top section shows correlations among contemporaneous

innovations.        There is a uniformly high correlation between the two

components of investment, ISTR and II)G.         Another similarity between the

interwar and postwar is the positive correlation between the money

multiplier (m) and both ISTR and IDG, the negative correlation between

IDG and the monetary base (B/P), and the high negative correlation

between the base and the multiplier.          Perhaps the most important

difference between the interwar and postwar periods is the sharp decline

in the correlation of durable goods investment (IDG) with non—investment

CNP (N).     This is similar to the decomposition of variance in Table 3

above and may indicate that N in the interwar is dominated by a common

impulse to private spending that also influenced lUG, whereas in the

postwar N was more affected by defense expenditures in the Korea and

Vietnam periods which had no impact or even a negative impact on IDG.

        The correlations of the base and the multiplier with non—investment

GNP change signs in the postwar period.          This is suggestive of a change

in the behavior of monetary policy between the two periods.      Another

"structural" shift is suggested by the change of the coefficient of the

interest rate on IDG from positive (shown in Table 6 but not Table 7) to

negative.   This should be interpreted in conjunction with the sharp

decline in the correlation of N and IDG in the postwar period.      These

facts may indicate that durable goods expenditures in the interwar

tended to be more constrained by income or retained earnings, while in

the postwar period the availability and price of credit was relatively

more important.


Multi—variate Exogeneity Tests

     The bottom section of Table 7 displays significance levels for the

contribution of each explanatory variable in each equation.      Explanatory

variables are represented by the six columns, and dependent variables by

the six lines.    Asterisks denote the same significance levels as in

Tables 4—6, and are calculated from F—ratios on the joint exclusion of

all lags of a particular variable.      Often such tables reveal a highly

significant set of diagonal elements, reflecting highly significant

lagged dependent variables in the VAR equations.      This occurs here only

for lOG, BIP, and    m.   The insignificance of the other diagonal elements

may reflect the fact that all variables in the model are expressed as

first differences.

     Investment in structures appears to be relatively exogenous in both

periods, with modest feedback from non—investment GNP in the interwar

and the money multiplier in the postwar.      Durable goods investment

exhibits substantial feedback from several variables in either or both

periods, and in this sense in much less "autonomous" than investment in
                                     53




structures.    The pattern of monetary influences on IDG and N differs.

While IDG reflects significant feedback from the base and the multiplier

in both periods, N reflects feedback from the base in both periods, the

interest rate in the postwar, and the multiplier in neither period.       A

notable feature of the pattern of exogeneity is the independence of the

money multiplier and the interest rate from almost all the other

variables.    In the postwar the interest rate is totally independent of

all the remaining variables, feeding into only IDG and N. The channel of

influence from the interest rate to investment,   if any, appears to be

indirect, running through non—investment GNP, with only a weak direct

effect in the postwar.   The pattern of these exogeneity results may

suggest the existence of two impulse sources in the business cycle, one

financial (interest rates and money multiplier) and the other real

(investment in structures), whose effects interact through the

propagation mechanism represented here by the remaining variables.


Innovation Accounting


     VAR modeling techniques are often criticized for the ambiguity

inherent in the a priori ordering of the variables necessary to carry

out the usual "innovation accounting" exercise.   However the allocation

of the variance of the investment categories between 'own" innovations

and innovations in other explanatory variables is of interest in any

investigation of the role played by investment in business cycles.     As

with our choice of aggregation schemes, we allow our earlier empirical

results to suggest "appropriate" orderings of the variables.   The equa-

tions estimated in Table 6 suggest that investment in structures is

quite autonomous, a result reinforced by the exogeneity tests of Table
                                    54




7.   Our basic model, as it appears in the top half of Table 8, places

structures (ISTR) first in the ordering, followed by investment in

durables (IDG).   Gestation lags in both types of investment make it

plausible that at least one quarter is required before investment

spending can be influenced by changes in non—investment real GNP (N),

the real base (B/P), the multiplier (m), or interest rate (r).    Although

our empirical results cast doubt on other ordering schemes, a priori

notions about the importance of autonomous government spending in the

postwar might suggest an ordering with non—investment real GNP first,

followed by investment in structures, then durables.   Results for this

ordering appear in the bottom half of Table 8.   The interest rate is

placed last in both orderings, as the theory of efficient markets would

suggest an instantaneous response to innovations in other variables.

B/P and m are intermediate variables but are capable of moving quickly,

particularly if the Federal Reserve is operating to stabilize the

interest rate.

      [n the ordering with structures first, the own innovation of

structures accounts for the majority of its variance at the 16 quarter

forecast horizon in both sample periods.   This own contribution is not

altered in the slightest by placing N first in the ordering.     Structures

appear to be virtually autonomous, with a highly significant influence

only from the money multiplier in the postwar.   ISTR accounts for more

than 10 percent of the variance of IDG in both periods, N and r in the

postwar, and m in the interwar.   In an alternative version of the model

in which the variables are expressed in levels (not shown in Table 8),

the role of ISTR is substantially greater, accounting for at least one

third of the variance of almost all the other variables in both

periods.
       Innovations in IDG   account   for more of the variance of N than vice

versa in the interwar period, which might be interpreted as indicating

that the multiplier was a stronger influence than the accelerator during

that   interval.    Investment in durables displays substantial feedback

from both investment in structures and from the money multiplier in both

periods.    The fact that the money multiplier has a larger effect on the

three categories of spending (ISTR, IDG, and N) than the two other

financial variables (B/P and r) may indicate that the collapse of the

banking system in the 1929—33 period and disintermediation in the

postwar period were important channels of influence, proxied by the

money multiplier, of the financial system on real expenditures.            As

mentioned above, the ordering in the bottom of Table 8 that places N

first does not change these results significantly, and this seems to

support our argument for the exogeneity of investment in structures.


Historical Decomposition of Variance in Both Investment Types


       A more revealing display of the implications of the VAR model            is


contained in the historical decomposition of each series in the system

over each of the sample periods.       The ordering used in arriving at these

decompositions was that of our basic VAR model which places the explana-

tory variables in the order shown      in   the top half of Table 8 (ISTR, IDG,

N, B/F, m and r).    To limit the number of diagrams, we present only the

decomposition of the two categories of investment —         interwar    structures

in Figure 4 and durable goods in Figure 5,        followed by postwar

structures in Figure 6 and durable goods in Figure 7.

 investment with a "projection" which summarizes the net effect of the

 constant terms in all of the equations.    The contribution of each of the

other variables in the system then appears below.     These contributions

do not refer just to the lagged values times the estimated coefficients

in the IDG equation alone, but rather to the contributions of the

innovations in each variable to investment behavior, taking account of

all channels of feedback working through the six—equation model (recall

that interest rates are excluded in the interwar period).

     The predominant role of own—innovations in the structures

investment (ISTR) process is evident in Figure 4.     There is a high

plateau in the own—innovations series in 1926—27, a gradual downward

movement in    1928—29, and a sharp downward plunge beginning in l929:Q3,

prior to the fourth—quarter stock market debacle.     Equally interesting

is that the own—innovation series remains negative throughout the 1931—

41 period, supporting the interpretation of "overbuilding" in the 1920s

that required a long period of subsequent adjustment in the 1930s.

     Two other variables display interesting patterns in Figure 4.      The

real monetary base (B/F) makes a major negative contrIbution in 1927—31

and a positive contribution in 1938-41.     The latter episode is easy to

understand in light of the large inflow of gold to the U. S. during this

period.     However, the decline in the contribution in B/P in 1927—31 may

seem puzzling, since nominal B varied little in the Great Contraction of

1929—33, while the price level (P) declined substantially.     The behavior

of the B/P contribution can be explained in terms of the "projection"

for B/P (not shown), which displays a sharp upward trend during the

entire 1920—41 period in response to the doubling of B/P between 1920

and 1941.    The actual value of B/P is below this "projection"
                                        57




continuously from 1920 to 1938 and then above it from 1939 to 1941.

Thus the VAR    historical   decomposition algorithm interprets the slow

increase in the real base in 1927—31 as being an actual decline relative

to trend, and this is reflected in the contribution of base innovations

to structures investment in Figure 4.        The other variable making an

important contribution is the money multiplier, which exhibits a sharp

decline during the period of monetary contraction and bank failures

between 1931 and 1933, as well as after the increase in reserve

requirements in 1936—37.       The role of the multiplier makes our analysis

compatible with the emphasis on the financial crisis in Bernanke (1983b).

     Figure 5 shows the interwar historical decomposition of innovations

to equipment investment.       Compared to Figure 4 for interwar structures,

the own—innovations in IDC are relatively less important and the

innovations in the monetary base and money multiplier are, more

important.     To some extent the innoVations in the base and multiplier

are offsetting, and this reflects in part the upward trend of the base

and downward trend of the multiplier in the interwar period.        However,

we recall from Tables 4—6 that both the base and the multiplier have

consistently positive coefficients in the interwar regression equations

for expenditures on durables.

     Figures 6 and 7 decompose the variance of ISTR and IDC for the

postwar years.     Note that in these figures the scale is compressed

horizontally and expanded vertically, since the ratio of investment to

natural output varied over so much smaller a range in the postwar

period.   Figure 6 for postwar structures shares with the interwar Figure

4 a predominant role for oin      innovations.   However, Figure 7 for

durables is quite different from the other historical decompositions.

Structures innovations play a much more important role in explaining

postwar durables expenditure fluctuations than the own—innovations in

durables.        Further, there is a substantial role for real interest rate

innovations in Figure 7, supporting the highly significant negative

coefficients on the real interest rate variable in Tables 4—6.       The

effect of high real interest rates in 1981—83 in reducing investment

expenditures is particularly noticeable.

       Thus any conclusion in this paper that investment contains a large

autonomous component must refer mainly to structures, whereas durable

equipment investment displays substantial feedback from both structures

investment and from financial variables.       It does not seem surprising

that there should he feedback from structures investment to equipment

investment, since the two activities are complementary.       Construction of

a new factory, office building, or shopping center requires investment

in equipment, lust as residential construction stimulates investment         in

furniture, appliances, and other components of consumer durable

expenditures.


The Temin "Autonomous Shift'      in 1930


       An important part of Temin's (1976) interpretation of the first

stage of the Great Contraction of 1929—33 is an autonomous shift in

consumption in 1930, which he identified by estimating an annual

consumption function.       Our purpose here is not to review the controversy

stirred up by Tenth's result (see Mayer, 1980), but rather to reexamine

his hypothesis using the more definitive microscope provided by our

quarterly data set.       Table 9 exhibits quarter—by—quarter residuals from

our   interwar    VAR models for the sixteen quarters covering 1929—32.
                                      59




Asterisks are used to mark off residuals greater in size than 1.0

standard error of estimate (see notes to Table 9).

     The five variables of the model are the first differences of,

respectively, investment in structures (ISTR), investment in durables

(IDG), non—investment real GNP (N), the real monetary base (B/F), and

the money multiplier.   All variables (except m) are expressed as per—

,centage ratios to natural real CNP, and beneath the residuals the table

shows the level of these ratios in 1929:Q2, ranging from 5.6 percent for

the monetary base to 77.6 percent for non—investment real GNP.       Here we

treat the behavior of non—investment real GNF as representing       consump-

tion," actually nondurable consumption, since in 1929 nondurable

consumption made up 85.2 percent of N, and accounted for 74.6 percent of

the decline in N from 1929 to 1930.

     The emphasis in this paper on autonomous movements in investment,

particularly structures investment, is supported in Table 9.       There were

three large negative innovations in 1929—30 to ISTR, including one in

1929:Q3, one quarter prior to the business downturn and stock market

crash.   There was a large negative innovation in lOG in 1929:04.      The

cumulative residuals of ISTR and IDG in 1929—30 amount, respectively, to

—25.2 and —17.2 percent of their levels in 1929:Q2.    In contrast, the

only large N residual for 1929—30 is positive in 1929:Q3.    The

cumulative N residuals in 1929—30 amount to only —1.6 percent of its

level in 1929:Q2.    Thus we find no evidence that negative residuals for

nondurable consumption played a key role in the initial stages of the

Great Contraction.

     Two other interesting results are evident in Table 9.     First, there

are substantial negative innovations in the real monetary base beginning

as early as 1929:Q1 and cumulating to —20.5 percent of the l929:Q2 level

in   1929—30.   Second, the largest cumulative negative residuals in the

1931—32 period are contributed by the money multiplier, supporting a

role for bank failures and the credit contraction in aggravating the

contraction.     Especially interesting is the large negative multiplier

innovation in 1931:Q3, the quarter that the Fed tightened its policy

following Britain's departure from the Gold Standard.

      Overall, these results are consistent with our interpretation of

two sources of the business cycle, real and financial, with the negative

innovations in real investment playing a dominant role in 1929—30, and

with the nature of the negative financial innovations shifting from a

contribution of the monetary base in 1929—30 to one by the money

multiplier in 1931—32.


                         VI.   SUMMARY ANT) CONCLUSION


Methodology and Data Description

      Most of the tests of     structural" investment equations that have

been carried out in the literature embody what Sims (1980) calls

"incredible     exclusion restrictions.     The literature on the neoclassical

investment paradigm embodies prior assumptions about the form of the

production function.     In its putty—putty version it neglects expecta-

tions entirely, and in its putty—clay version it fails to allow time—

series aggregate variables to play multiple roles in the formation of

expectations in different phases of the investment process.        As a

result, coefficients on variables like lagged output and interest rates

cannot be interpreted in the structural way that has been typical in the

literature.
                                          61




        The Tobin "Q"   theory starts from a plausible point of departure but

then takes itself too seriously, allowing only Q to influence invest-

ment.     There seems to he no reason why the single Q       variable,   whether or

not it is measured with      error,   should embody all influences of other

variables on the investment process.           Our discussion emphasizes in par-

ticular the role of asymmetric adjustment costs, as well as the tradeoff

firms face between costly alternatives when the stock market gives one

set of signals and output or other variables give a conflicting set of

signals.

        We conclude that the difficulties of structural equation—building

are irremediable.       As a substitute we carry out a hybrid methodology, in

which theory is used to suggest sets of variables and their form, but

empirical estimation is carried out by estimating equations in the

symmetric VAR format, with all explanatory variables entering the

investment    equation, and with the dependent variable included with the

same number of lags.      Our hybrid approach thus combines insights from

structural models with the unconstrained approach to testing and data

exploration tha typifies investigations using VAR models.

        Our first empirical task is to establish the importance of fixed

investment in historical business cycles.          Using procedures described in

the Data Appendix, we have created a new set of quarterly data on major

expenditure components of GNP extending hack to l919:Q1.          We include

four types of real investment expenditures in our study——producer's

durable equipment, nonresidential structures, residential structures,

and consumer durable expenditures.        The decLtne in the sum of these four

components ('I") contributes between one—third and one—half of the

decline in real GNF     in recessions, even though the share of I        in GNP   at
                                      62




the typical business cycle peak is about one—quarter.     Total investment

actually was relatively more important in postwar recessions between

1957 and 1980 than it was during the Great Contraction of 1929—33.

     A decomposition of variance allows a description of the relation

between investment (I) and non—investment real GNP (N) in major epi-

sodes.    The interwar years were characterized by a high own—variance of

investment, narticularly in 1919—29, and after 1929 by a high covariance

between I and N.    The own—variance of N was more important in the

postwar period and was dominated by the Korean war episode.      Of the four

components of investment, the own variance of nonresidential structures

was the largest in the interwar period, while the own variance     of


consumer durable expenditures was largest in the postwar period.


Implications for Four Schools of Thought

     Keynesians, monetarists, neoclassicists, and Q advocates all have

an interest in the results of this investigation.     Nenhers of each group

will he disappointed with our results,     if they are seeking support of

"monocausal" or "one—factor' hypotheses of investment behavior.         Yet

ironically the empirical findings offer some solace to each group,

because they provide substantial support for an eclectic view of invest-

ment that blends elements of each approach, while providing evidence

against opponents of each approach who insist on some alternative

monocausal explanation.

     Keynesians view investment behavior as containing a substantial

autonomous component.     Our empirical investment equations summarized in

Table 6, together with the    historical decompositions in Figures 4—7,
support   the view that autonomous innovations in structures investment
                                      63




are an important driving force in the business cycle.     In Table 8 the

effect of innovations in structures investment on durable equipment

expenditures, as well as on non—investment GNP, is greater than the

reverse feedback from equipment and non—investment GNP innovations to

structures investment, in both the interwar and postwar periods.     The

boom in structures investment between 1923—29, the subsequent slump in

the 1930s,    as well as the smaller negative innovations in the early

1960s and boom in 1971—73, all can he viewed mainly as autonomous events

rather than as a passive reaction to other economic variables.

     While monetarists would doubtless be unhappy with a view that

treats major swings in structures investment as autonomous, they

nevertheless have the consolation of learning that the response of both

structures and equipment investment to the real money supply is

significantly greater than to the 'traditional" variables in investment

equations, the accelerator (output change), the user cost of capital,

and "Q".     The effect of money, split here between the real monetary base

and the Ml money multiplier, is suhstantial in both the interwar and

postwar periods.    The regression results in Table 6 find a strong impact

of both the base and multiplier on equipment investment in the interwar

period, and on both structures and equipment investment in the postwar.

The historical, decompositions in Figures 4—7 indicate that base innova-

tions had an important impact on both structures and equipment invest—

ment, as well as on non—investment CNP, in the interwar period, whereas

the multiplier played a role in both the interwar and postwar periods.

     It seems ironic that this study of investment behavior provides

more support for the general views of the economy represented by

Keynesians and monetarists than it does for the views of specialists in
                                        64




the investment process, the neoclassicists and Q advocates.          In Tables 4

and 5 the user cost of capital for businesses, and the real interest

rate For households, are insignificant or have the wrong sign in every

equation for the interwar years.       The equations for consumer and

producers durable spending exhibit a significant and correctly signed

(negative) sum of coefficients for the postwar period, but in every

postwar equation the user cost or interest rate variable fails an

"exclusion test" on the joint significance of all lagged values in the

explanation of investment spending.          The verdict on the Q approach is

even more negative.       In the aggregated regression equations of Table 6,

the Q    variable   passes the exclusion test only in one equation, for

postwar structures investment.       This appears in Table 4 to be

attributable to the nonresidential component of structures investment.

Such results pose a new task for Q      theorists,    that is, to determine what

factors would make investment in structures more responsive to 0 than

investment in producers' equipment.

        Our empirical work casts doubt on the importance of the accelerator

hypothesis of investment behavior that has been supported by some past

work, e.g., Clark (1979).       The simple device of including four lags on

the dependent variable in equations explaining total I eliminates the

significant explanatory contribution of lagged values of real GNP,

except in the equipment equations for the postwar period.          However we

find that it is possible to obtain significant sums of coefficients for

an accelerator effect in a postwar durable equipment equation only when

real GNP is entered as a second rather than first difference.          These

findings support our basic interpretation that there is a sharp

difference between the behavior of structures and equipment investment,
                                           65




with the former behaving mainly in an autonomous fashion, whereas the

latter reflects feedback both from investment in structures and from

financial and monetary variables.


Deeper Issues and Unsettled Questions for Future Research

       In a recent paper Blanchard (1981, p. 154)) reached the conclusion

that    .   .   .   the multiplier is dead and the accelerator alive.'   This

paper reaches the opposite conclusion, particularly for the structures

component of investment.          The accelerator muchanism, interpreted as the

feedback from autonomous movements in non—investment GNP to investment

in structures, seems to be considerably weaker than the multiplier

mechanism, interpreted in the elementary textbook fashion as the effect

on total GNP of autonomous movements of investment, particularly the

structures component.         While there is a substantial effect of monetary

and financial variables on investment, nevertheless there are major and

persistent movements in investment that occur in both the interwar and

postwar periods that cannot he explained by prior changes in output,

money, stock prices, or interest rates.

       The fact that we label major movements in structures investment as

'autonomous" does not mean that we leave them unexplained.          Rather, this

basic interpretation of the paper treats structures investment as

exogenous with respect to the explanatory variables included in our

statistical analysis.         This does not rule out other explanations, and in

fact we can offer three complementary explanations of the behavior of

structures investment in the interwar period.         First, the residential

structures boom of the 1920s and subsequent slump of the 1930s can be

explained in part by demographic factors that lie outside the scope of
                                      66




this   paper.   While the rapid population growth of 1900—1920, together

with the postponement of construction during World War I and the 1920—21

recession, may provide a partial explanation of the intensity of the

1920s residential construction boom, the restrictive immigration law of

1924 and subsequent deceleration in population growth may help to

account for the decline in residential construction after 1926.

       Hickman (1973) has documented both the effect of the decline in

population growth on the desired housing stock and also the extent of

overbuilding in the mid—1920s.     Hickman's work treats the rate of

population growth as endogenous, with the rate of household formation

responding to the growth rate of income, and he is able to decompose the

observed decline in the rate of population growth between the early

1920s and mid—1930s into two components, that due to the effect of

declining income, and a remaining exogenous decline due primarily to the

decline in immigration.     In order to isolate the effect of the exogenous

component of the decline in household formation, Hickman calculated two

dynamic simulations of his model, one in which standardized households

are assumed to increase steadily at the 1924—25 rate of growth, and

another in which income and other economic variables are identical hut

in which standardized households follow their actual declining path

after 1925.     The impact of the actual demographic slump gradually

becomes more important as the 1930s progress, accounting for a decline

in housing starts between the two simulations of 28.3 percent for 1933

and 39.1 percent for 1940.     His result is consistent with our Figure 4

above, in which the own—innovation in structures investment is negative

throughout the 1930s.

       A second factor, more relevant for investment in structures than in
                                      67




equipment, is the element of speculation.     The Florida land boom of the

1920s, the stock market "bubble" of 1928—29, and earlier investment

excesses like the "South Seas bubble" of the early eighteen century, all

have some similarity to the construction boom of the 1920s.                For six

years (1923—28) real residential construction achieved a level more than

double the average of the entire decade before World War I, and in four

successive years (1924—27) the ratio of real residential construction

investment to GNP reached by far its highest level of the twentieth

century.    Hickman estimates that even with a continuation of population

growth at the 1924—25 rate, rather than a post—1925 decline, housing

starts would have fallen by 35 percent between 1925 and 1930 (as a ratio

to natural real GNP,    it actually fell by   percent).

     Nor is the phenomenon of overbuilding confined to the interwar

period.    Figure 6 shows that the postwar own innovation to structures

investment peaked in 1972—73.     Several years later contemporary accounts

recognized the phenomenon of overbuilding:

           'In Chicago, new apartment construction has just about

           ceased.   In Atlanta, where there is at least a three—year

           supply of unsold condominiums overhanging the market, mortgage

           companies are auctioning off high—rise units to the public at

           two—thirds their original asking price   .   .   .   .    The current

           problems stem from overbuilding in the early 1970s'             "The Great

           High—rise Bust," Newsweek (August 30, 1976),         p.    5.


     The third factor that may be an important explanation behind the

apparently "autonomous" structures investment boom of the 1920s and

slump of the 1930s is the "Schumpeterian" bunching of innovations.                 This

hypothesis is developed by R. A. Gordon (1951), who argues that the
                                              68




buoyancy of both residential and nonresidential construction in the

1920s reflected in large part the influence of the automobile in

expanding the boundaries of urban areas:

            "Between 1923 and 1929 the growing use of automobiles and

            trucks had a more important impact on total investment and

            employment than did the expansion of motor vehicle output.

            Motor vehicle registrations in 1929 were about 75 percent

            greater than in 1923 and nearly three times the number in

            1920.   .   .   .   large scale investment was necessary for roads and
            bridges, oil wells, pipe lines, garages and service stations,

            and tire and automobile supply stores, as well as for oil

            refining and tire manufacture.         In addition, the automobile

            accelerated the trends toward urbanization and 'suburhaniza—

            tion', stimulating thereby residential and commercial

            building."

Other    industries were also involved in the bunching of investment
opportunities in the 1920s. Among these were            electric power——well over

half    of the installation of electric generating capacity during 1902—40
occurred    during the decade of the 1920s.         Other important new industries

were radio, telephone, and chemicals.

        The results in this paper support the view that there are two basic

impulses in the business cycle, real and financial.             The real impulse

appears in our statistical evidence as an autonomous innovation to

investment in structures.            This concluding section has suggested three

factors that may        underlie the     cycle in structures investment.   We choose

to emphasize this element of investment behavior here because it has

received relatively little attention in recent research, however
                                      69




familiar it may seem to experts on the earlier literature on business

cycles.   The financial impulse works through the effect on investment of

changes in the monetary base and money multiplier, as well as the real

interest rate for postwar investment in durable equipment.      In these

results the money multiplier may be acting as a proxy for such phenomena

as the banking contraction of 1929—33 and the episodes of credit

crunches and disintermediation in the postwar years.

     Many avenues for future research are opened up by these results.

Past studies of structures investment need to be reviewed for problens

of identification and simultaneity that may have led to a misleading

emphasis on the investment accelerator, rather than autonomous

movements, as the driving force behind structures investment.      Our

inability to find a strong influence of the stock market (working

through our Q   variable)   on investment, except for postwar nonresidential

structures, needs to he reconciled with the recent findings of Fischer

and Nerton (1984), who find a stronger connection between economic

activity and prior movements in the stock market.      Finally we hope that

our new quarterly interwar data on components of expenditures will

stimulate further research into the interrelations of real and financial

variables during the Great Depression.

1.   Recall the famous debate of the mid—1960s set off by the attempt by

Milton Friedman and David Mejselrnan (1963) to characterize "autonomous

5.   Students of U.   S.   twentieth century architecture know that there was

virtually no central—city office building construction between 1930 and

reasons.

7.   As an example, airlines that ordered the Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft

in 1978 reacted to the previously unexpected period of poor profits that

occurred during 1980—82 both by cancelling part or all of their orders,

and by "stretching out" the delivery period.       American Airlines

initially ordered both the 757 and 767, and cancelled its entire order

half of its 767 order by up to five years, and has threatened to cancel

that half.

Hayashi, only current Q                 enters and gestation lags are a special case.
10.     The poor post—sample performance of the Q approach is illustrated

by Clark (1979) on p. 93.                    Since his article was written, a national

accounts revision has substantially raised the level of actual invest-

ment for the later 1970s, thus implying an even poorer performance of

the Q    approach.

derives a model of investment with gestation lags that shares with (4)

and (6) the feature that current investment orders depend on

expectations of both future output and capital costs.         Taylor is not

concerned with the identification issues under discussion here, but he

does choose to simplify his model as do Abel—Blanchard, by making

expectations of future output depend only on past output, and in

addition makes future capital cost depend only on future and past

output.     By omitting the multiple roles for past financial variables in

determining expectations of all future variables.         Taylor thus

introduces prior simplifying restrictions that have no empirical

justification.

meaningful analysis of investment behavior during that period.          Further,

interval.
                                 DATA APPENDIX



1.   General Description:


      This paper investigates the behavior of investment in the U.S.

economy over both the interwar (1919—41) and the postwar (1947—1983)

periods.   Annual nominal and real expenditures and deflator series are

available as far back as 1929 using Survey of Current Business

supplements, hereafter SCB.     Prior to 1929, however, one must resort to

a number of sources to collect annual data which can be matched up to

the 1929 Commerce figures.     Swanson and Williamson (1971), hereafter

S&W, contains nominal series for all the major national account cate-

gories for the period 1919 to 1928, which have been adjusted from

Kuznets' figures to conform to the SCB definitions.     These annual

nominal series are used here for all the national accounts categories

except for investment in structures and foreign trade.     The desired

division of investment into residential and non—residential structures

uses figures from Grebler, Blank and Winnick, hereafter CBW, and adjusts

nominal GNP accordingly.     Net exports are broken down into the two

nominal components, exports and imports, using indices available in the

Statistical History of the U.S., which are then linked to the 1929 SCB

values.

     This provides us with a complete set of annual nominal national

income accounts.    The next task is to find implicit deflators for these

nominal series.    Our starting point is the set of 5GB implicit deflators

for all the national income categories for the period 1929 to 1941.

Annual figures for the GNP deflator, 1919—1928, are obtained by linking

Kuznets' GNP deflator to the SCB 1929 implicit GNP deflator.     As both
                                     A-2




current and constant dollar indices are available for exports and

imports, it is possible to construct implicit deflators for both series

from 1919 to 1928 which can be matched to the SCB 1929 deflators.        For

the remaining categories, such as consumption and investment, deflators

are not available for the period 1919 to 1928.     To obtain figures for

this period, our interpolation program is run over the available annual

price series, 1929 to 1941,   to produce quarterly figures.   The final

regression is used to "back—forecast" the quarterly values over the

period 1919 to 1928.   These quarterly values are then averaged to yield

annual price series for the period 1919—1928.     With the complete set of

price deflators it is possible to convert the nominal national accounts

into real series covering the full 1919—41 period.     The real annual

national account series are interpolated to arrive at a complete set of

real quarterly accounts and a corresponding set of deflators.

     An interpolation procedure following that of Chow—Lin (1971) is

used in converting the annual series to quarterly observations.     A more

complicated procedure, such as that suggested by Litterman (1981), is

deemed to be too costly compared to the possible gain in accuracy.        The

procedure itself is fairly simple.     As our annual series are annual

averages of quarterly variables, the procedure we use is that termed

"distribution" by Chow and Lin.    In what follows upper case letters

represent annual series, and lower case letters represent the associated

quarterly series.   To each annual series to be interpolated (Yft) is

associated a number of quarterly series (x1) that a priori information

suggests move within the year the way quarterly observations on the

annual dependent variable would.     These quarterly explanatory variables

are annualized (x.) and a regression against the annual dependent
                                              A—3




variable is run;


(Al)         1.
              it
                    =    X.
                          it   +   U
                                       t

It   is assumed in each interpolation that the quarterly errors follow an

AR(l) process, which induces a complicated covariance structure on the

annual error, U.          The first autocorrelation of U,        is related to
                                                            A'
the quarterly autocorrelation coefficient, PQ by the non—linear

formula:


                         7
                        p+   6
                           2p+   5
                               3p+   4.3
                                   4p+ Jp+ 2p 2 +p

                                   2PQ+ 4PQ+ 6PQ+ 4


Estimating A as the first autocorrelation of the residuals from the

regression in (Al), we can obtain an estimate of            by solving (A2), and

this is used in an iterative GLS procedure to obtain estimates

of     and PQ•     The final estimates from this procedure are then used to

generate quarterly observations for the dependent variable as:


(A3)
             it     =   X.     +   Qt—l•
The assumption of AR(l) errors in the quarterly equation overcomes the

artificial choppiness induced if u is assumed to be white noise.           This

procedure is used to derive the quarterly series for the implicit

deflators and real series of the national accounts as well as Summers' Q

and some components of the cost of capital.

11) Capital Stock, Equipment and Structures

    1925—1983 (annual)   Nominal and real series for the two types of

    capital stock, equipment and structures, was taken from various

   issues of SGB.   Nominal and real series for the capital stok of

   consumer durables was taken fron ?1usgrave (1979).     In order to

   utilize the information available from our associated quarterly
                                  A-7




investment series in constructing each quarterly capital stock

series, we followed the iterative procedure:

       a.   the annual series provide a beginning and ending value

       for the capital stock

       b.   assuming a fixed exponential rate of depreciation, the

       quarterly series must satisfy

                Kt   =    + (1—)K1
The procedure   uses the starting value of the capital stock and the

associated quarterly I series, iterating on ô until the value of

the quarterly capital stock at the end of the period is "close" to

the specified ending value.     Below we present the estimated annual

depreciation rate for each type of capital stock in each of the sub—

periods.

3.   Rental Price of Capital Services

     The rental price of capital services, for equipment and for

     structures, was constructed using for equipment:



                 —   E5E r)(1       —   RITCE_ DUM•ZEITAX*RITCE_ ZETAX)
           CE    -                             (1 — TAX)



     and for structures:

                 —              (1 — TAX)



     A   composite cost of capital series was constructed by weighting each

     of CE and Cs by their share in the sum of the capital stock of

     equipment and structures.                 Individual components of the cost of

     capital services are:

                         Long amendment to the Revenue Act of 1962, and set equal

                         to zero in all other periods.

                     =   Implicit   deflator for investment in producers' durable

                         equipment, from Section 2.
