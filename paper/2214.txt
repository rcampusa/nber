          Anticipated Protectionist Policies, Real Exchange Rates

                          and the Current Account




                                 ABSTRACT




     In this paper a general equilibrium intertemporal model, with

optimizing consumers and producers, is developed to analyze how the antici-

pation of future import    tariffs affects real exchange rates and the

current account. The model is completely real, and considers a small open

economy that produces and consumes three goods each period. It is shown

that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs, interesting paths for

the equilibrium real exchange rate can be generated. In particular "equi-

librium overshooting" can be observed. Precise conditions under which an

anticipated future import tariff will worsen the current account in period 1

are derived. Several ways in which the model can be extnded are also

discussed in detail. The results obtained from this model have important

implications for the analysis of real exchange rate misalignment and

overvaluation.

      The growing U.S. external imbalance of the last few years has generated

 protectionist sentiments in a number of quarters. As a result, talks of new

 trade legislation that would impose higher import tariffs have become quite

 common. More recently, there has also been a growing concern regarding the

behavior of the real value of the dollar. In particular a number of

observers have argued that protectionist policies are required to

halt its decline) Moreover, this protectionist mood has also

affected a number of other countries, both industrialized and less

developed.

     Although international trade theorists have developed models that

explain the contemporaneous effects of import tariffs on the trade and

current accounts, there has been little work on how the anticipation of

future import tariff will affect today's current account.2 However, this is

an important issue, since usually the enactment of restrictive commercial

policies is preceded by long discussions and parliamentary debates. In

other cases the public's anticipation of future tariffs are not material-

ized. Nevertheless, the sole fact that some restrictive legislation was

expected may affect today's current account, as well as the path of

equilibrium real exchange rates.

     The purpose of this paper is to develop an optimizing general

equilibrium model of a real economy to investigate the way in which

anticipated future import tariffs affect the path of equilibrium real

exchange rates and the current account balance. The model is general

enough, however, to analyze the effects of other disturbances such as

permanent tariffs and terms of trade shocks. The model presented here

considers the case of a small open economy where optimizing firms and

consumers produce and consume three goods --   importables,   exportables, and
                                          2




nontradables. Foreign borrowing is allowed, and the only constraint faced

by the nationals of this country is that the discounted value of the sum of

the current account balances equals zero. There is no uncertainty, and

agents have perfect foresight. The model is completely real and is solved

using duality theory.

     The paper is organized as follows. In Section I an intertemporal

general equilibrium model of a (small) real economy with optimizing

consumers and producers is developed. Here the concept of equilibrium RER

in an intertemporal setting is discussed, and the modeling strategy is set

forward. Section II deals with the effects of the anticipation of a future

import tariff on equilibrium real exchange rates (RERs) and the current

account, under the assumption that initially there are no tariffs. In

Section III the impact of an anticipated hike in a previously existing

tariff is analyzed. Section IV deals with extensions, while Section V

contains the concluding remarks.


I.   The Model

      In this section a three goods-two periods model is developed in order

to analyze how the anticipation of the imposition of import tariffs affects

the equilibrium path of real exchange rate and the current account in the

current period.

     Consider the case of a small country that produces and consumes three

goods - -   importables     (M) exportables (X) and nontradables (N). There

are two periods - -   the   present (period 1) and the future (period 2) - -   and
foreign borrowing and lending is allowed at the exogenously given world

interest rate r*. The country faces an intertemporal budget constraint

that states that the discounted sum of the current account balances is zero.

 There are a large number of producers and (identical) consumers, so that

 perfect competition prevails. Consumers maximize utility subject to their

 intertemporal budget constraint, whereas firms maximize profits in each

 period, subject to existing technology and availability of factors of

 production. In order to simplify the exposition it is assumed that there is

 no investment (see, however, Section IV).

      Assuming that the utility function is time separable, with each

 subutility function homothetic, the representative consumer problem can be
 stated as follows:


                max W(TJ1(C,C,C), U2(C,C,c4)},

subject to:


                C ÷ p1C ÷ q1C + 6*(C+p2C+q2C)          Wealth                 (1)

where W is the utility function; 1U and U2        are periods 1 and 2 sub-

utility functions assumed to be homothetic;              are consumption of
N, M and X in period i       1,2; p' is the (domestic) price of

importables relative to exportables in period i       1,2; qi is the price of

nontradables relative to exportables in period i; and 6* is the world

discount factor equal to (l+r*)*

     Wealth is the discounted sum of consumer's income in both periods.

Income, in turn, is given in each period by three components: (1) income

from labor services rendered to firms; (2) income from the renting of

capital stock that consumers own to domestic firms;    (3) and income ob-

tained from government transfers. These, in turn, correspond to the

proceeds from import tariffs which the government hands back to the public.

In this model, then, as in most of the international trade literature, the

government plays no active role besides imposing import tariffs, and
                                                          4




handling their proceeds back to households in a nondistortionary way.3

          Given the nature of preferences, the consumer optimization process

takes place in two stages. First, the consumer decides how to allocate

his(her) wealth across periods. Second, he(she) decides how to distribute

each period (optimal) expenditure across the three goods.

              It is assumed that firms use conventional technology to produce N, X

and M. There are three factors of production - -                             capital,   labor and natural

resources. Consequently, factor price equalization does not hold in either

period. Producers' maximization problem can be stated in each period i, in

the following way (where V is the vector of factors of production w is a

vector of their rewards, and Q is output of good j in period i.)

                        max Profits              (p1Qj + q'Q + Q) -          wVi                      (2)


subject to plausible technology.

              In this small open economy the price of exportables is given from

abroad and the price of importables is in each period equal to the interna-

tional price of this type of goods (p*1) plus the (specific) import tariff
     1
(r       ):
                        p1 — p*1         1                    *2         2

              The simultaneous solutions of the consumers and producers optimization

problems, plus the requirement that the nontradable market clears every

period, and the full employment conditions will determine the equilibrium

path of nontradable prices, equilibrium real exchange rates in both periods,

quantities produced and consumed of X, M and N, the current account, and

factors rewards. A very convenient way of characterizing this country's

full equilibrium is by using duality theory.4 Equations (4) through (9)

succinctly summarize the internal and external equilibrium conditions for

revenue function in period 2); subscripts refer to partial derivatives with

l's revenue function relative to q                (the price of nontradables in period

The price of exportable is taken as the nuineraire:

(9) describes the current account in period 1 as the difference between

income and total expenditure in that period.

       Given our assumption of time separable utility function, expenditure in

periods 1 and 2 are gross substitutes. As a result all intertemporal cross

demand effects are positive (i.e., E                                E        E    E      > 0).

supply side it is assumed that the three sectors compete for factors in each

period; all cross price effects are thus negative (R11             < 0).

1.1. The ConceDt of "Equilibrium" Real Exchange Rate

     In models with importables and exportables the definition of "the" real

exchange rate becomes "tricky", since the by-now traditional concept of

relative price of tradables to nontradables loses some meaning. The reason,

of course, is that if there are shocks that affect the price of X relative

to M, it is not possible to talk about the Hicksian composite "tradables"

anymore. In a way, in this type of model there are two RERs: the relative

price of importables to nontradables (p/q), and the relative price of

exportables to nontradables (l/q). For this reason, and in order to

simplify the exposition, in this paper we will focus on the (inverse) of

real exchange rate for exports q. Of course, once it is known how q

responds to changes in fundamentals, it is possible to compute, using simple

algebraic manipulations, the effect of shocks on any of the traditional

indexes of RER.

     In the intertemporal model presented above there is not one equilibrium

value of the real exchange rate, but rather a path of equilibrium RERs.

Within this intertempora]. framework the equilibrium (exportable) RER in a

particular period is defined as the inverse of q that, for given values of

other variables such as world prices, technology and tariffs, equilibrates

simultaneously the external and internal (i.e., nontradables) sectors.5 In

terms of the model, the vector of equilibrium RERs is composed of those
                                             8




(l/q')'s that simultaneously satisfy equations (4) through (8), for given

values of the other fundamental variables.

     From the inspection of equations (4)-(9) it is apparent that exogenous

shocks in, say, the international terms of trade, will affect the vector of

equilibrium RERs through two interrelated channels. The first one is related

to intratemporal effects of terms of trade shocks on resource allocation and

consumption decisions. For example, as a result of a temporary worsening of

the terms of trade, there will be a tendency to produce more and consume less

of M in that period. This, plus the income effect resulting from the

worsening of the terms of trade will generate an incipient disequilibrium in

the nontradables market which will have to be resolved by a change in the

equilibrium q. In fact, if we assume that there is an absence of foreign

borrowing these intratemporal effects will be the only relevant ones.

However, with capital mobility, as in the current model, there is a second

intertemporal channel through which changes in exogenous variables will

affect the vector of equilibrium RERs. For example, in the case of a tempo-

rary worsening of the terms of trade, the consumption discount factor

        will be affected, altering the intertemporal allocation of

consumption.6

     Equations (4)-(9) can be manipulated to find out how the vector of

equilibrium RERs and the current account respond to exogenous shocks such as

changes in tariffs, disturbances to the international terms of trade,

international transfers, and changes in world interest rates. In order to

simplify the exposition it is assumed that initially there are no import

case with positive initial tariffs is discussed.

intuition behind the positive slope of H1H1 is the following: An increase

in the price of N in period 2 will make consumption in that period

relatively more expensive. As a result there will be a substitution away

from period 2 and towards period 1 expenditure. This will put pressure on

the market for N in period 1, and an incipient excess demand for N in

that period will develop. The reestablishment of nontradable equilibrium in

period 1 will require an increase the relative price of N.

      The intuition behind this positive slope is analogous to that of the
 11                  .       .   1
H H    schedule: an increase in q    will make current consumption

relatively more expensive, shifting expenditure into the future. As a

result there will be a pressure on q2, which will have to increase to

reestablish equilibrium. Stability requires that the     H2H2 schedule be

steeper than the   H1H1 curve (see Appendix).

      The intersection of H1H1 and H2H2 at A characterize the (initial)

relative prices of the nontradable goods market in periods 1 and 2     (l2)
compatible with the simultaneous attainment of intertemporal external equi-

librium and internal equilibrium in both periods. In order to make the expo-

sition clearer we have assumed that these equilibrium prices         and

are equal; the 45° line passes through the initial equilibrium point       A.9


II. Anticipated Future Import Tariffs: The Zero Initial Tariffs Case

      In this section we analyze how the anticipation of the future

imposition of an import tariff will affect the equilibrium RERs, and period

l's current account. We assume that the initial condition is characterized

by no import tariffs in either period     (r1 =    0).   In Section III we

look at the more general case of positive initial tariffs.


11.1. Equilibrium Real Exchange Rates

      Consider the case where, in period 1, economic agents (correctly)

expect that the government will impose an import tariff r2 in period 2.

This will shift both the H1H1 and H2H2 schedules, generating a new

vector of equilibrium relative prices. Let's first consider the case of

H1H1. An anticipated import tariff in 2 means that the expected price of

imports in that period will increase, making future consumption relatively

more expensive. Consequently, via the intertemporal substitution effect,

consumers will substitute expenditure away from period 2 and into period 1.

This will result in an increase in the demand for all goods in period 1,

including nontradables, and in a higher q1. Consequently the H1H1 curve

will shift upward. From equation (5) it is possible to find the magnitude

of this vertical shift:

                    1HH     (E

As this expression shows, this movement in the     H1H1 curve is a reflection

of the intertemporal degree of substitutability in consumption: it will be

greater or smaller depending on whether E 1 2 is large or small. In the
                                                                     11

schedule will be horizontal, and will not shift as a result of expected

future tariffs.

     The imposition of an (anticipated) import tariff in period 2 will also

affect the H2H2 schedule. In this case, however, in addition to the

intertemporal effect already discussed, there will also be an intratemporal

effect related to the change in relative prices in period 2. Since the

expected teriff will make future consumption more expensive, the inter-

temporal effect will generate forces towards a reduction in q2, and a

leftward movement of H2H2. The intratemporal effect, on the other hand,

can either reinforce or tend to offset those forces. The higher domestic

price of imports in period 2 will reduce the quantity demanded of M in

that period. Depending on whether importables and nontradables are gross

substitutes or complements in consumption, in that period, the quantity

demanded of N will increase or decline. If M and N are complements,

(E 2 2   < 0)   the higher tariff will reduce the demand for N in period 2,

and the H2H2 schedule may shift to the left.                     If, however, N and M are
gross substitutes, the imposition of the period 2 tariff will increase the

demand for N. In this case the H2H2 curve will shift to the right.

Formally, the horizontal shift of H H
                                                  22    can be obtained from equation (6):

It is clear from (13) that the indeterminacy stems from the fact that E
                                                                                            2 2

      Figure 2 illustrates two possible new equilibria. Point A

characterizes the initial equilibrium. Point                      corresponds to the case

when N and M are gross substitutes and the intratemporal effect is

strong enough: the new (after tariff anticipation) equilibrium schedules

are            and 22 In this case the anticipation of an import tariff

results in a higher relative price of nontradables in periods 1 and 2. That

is, the equilibrium RER appreciates in both periods, as a result of the

expected tariff. Notice, however, that there is nothing in the model that

tells us which of the two curves shifts by more (see below for the exact

ility of some interesting equilibrium paths for the RERs. For example, it

is possible to observe an "equilibrium overshooting", where (relative to the

no-tariff case)             increases by more than 2 This would be the case if

the H1H1 shifts to the left by more than what H2H2 shifts to the right.

This will be the case if the new equilibrium point is above the 45° line,

and is illustrated in Figure 3.

     Point C in Figure 2 is the new equilibrium under the assumption that

nontradables and importables are complements in consumption in period 2, and

that this effect dominates. In this case, as discussed, the   H2H2 schedule

will shift to the left to a position such as l2I42. A possible outcome is

the one described in Figure 2 where as a result of an anticipated tariff the

equilibrium path of the real exchange rate will be characterized by wide

swings: it will increase in period 1, and it will decline in period 2 below

its initial (pre-tariff) level. Although this path is clearly characterized

by equilibrium movements in each period, observers may think that the RER

has moved in the "wrong direction" in period 1. Notice that this type of

behavior of the RER can even happen if M and N are substitutes. The

H2H2 will shift to the left if the intertemporal effect dominates.

     Figure 4 provides a diagrammatical illustration of four possible paths

for the real exchange rate in periods 1 and 2 as a result of the

anticipation of an import tariff. In these diagrams       is the equilibrium

RER in both periods under the assumption of no tariffs, and is used as a

benchmark for comparison.         and 2 are the equilibrium relative prices

in periods 1 and 2 in the anticipated tariff case. Panel (a) in Figure 3

illustrates what we have called "equilibrium overshooting" of the relative

price, where in the tariff case q1 and q2 are higher than in the non-

tariff case, but the adjustment implies an equilibrium reduction of q in

period 2. By analogy, case (b) can be called "equilibrium undershooting".

Here both 's are also higher than in the non-tariff case. Now, however,

the adjustment path requires an equilibrium increase of q in period 2,
                                           14



over and above the higher q in period 1.          Panel (c) depicts the case where

the equilibrium RERs move in opposite directions in each period. In period

1 there is a real appreciation, relative to the non-tariff case, while in

period 2, the period when the tariff is actually imposed, there is a real

depreciation. As noted, a sufficient condition for this to be the case is

that E
             2 2 < 0. Finally, panel (d) is the most "traditional" case, where
             pq
as a consequence of the anticipated tariff the RER appreciates by the same

amount in both periods.

        From equations (4), (5), (6) and (8) it is possible to formally find

the equilibrium changes in q1 and q2 as a result of the anticipated

import tariff:

     Equations (14) and (15) formally confirm the preceding diagrammatic

analysis, showing that in this three good-two period model, an anticipated

import tariff can, in principle, generate interesting dynamic paths of the

equilibrium real exchange rate under a pure real equilibrium analysis.

balance in period 1, as a result of the anticipation of a tariff in 2, can

           The presence of an E.. terni in every one of the RHS terms of

 equation (16) clearly highlights the fact that the anticipated imposition of

 a future tariff will affect the current account via intertemporal channels.

The first term in the RHS of equation (16) is negative and captures the

direct effect of the anticipation of a tariff in period 2 on the current

account in period 1. The intuition for this negative effect is straightfor-

ward. The anticipated higher period two tariff makes period 2 consumption

relatively more expensive, and as a result of this the public substitutes

consumption away from period 2 into period 1, generating a worsening of the

current account balance in period 1. The magnitude of this effect will

depend both on the intertemporal substitution effect E                     and on the
                                                                     1 2

initial share of imports on period 2 expenditure It22.

           The second and third terms on the RHS of equation (16) are indirect

effects, that operate via changes in periods 1 and 2 equilibrium real

exchange rates. Since, as was established above, the signs of (dq'/dr2)

and (dq2/dr2) cannot be determined a priori, the signs of these two terms

in (16) are generally undetermined, as will be the sign of equation (16) as

a whole. However, the interpretation of these two indirect terms is quite

straightforward within the intertemporal framework of the current model. If

the anticipated tariff results in an equilibrium real appreciation in period

1,        (dql/drZ) >   0,      there will be an offsetting force towards a current

account improvement. The reasoning is again simple. If the anticipated

tariff results in a higher equilibrium price of nontradables in period 1

(i.e., in a real appreciation in 1), there will be substitution away from

period 1 expenditure, generating an improvement in the current account in
                                       16




that period. The third term on the RHS relates the change in period 2's RER

to period l's current account. If as a consequence of the anticipated

tariff q2 increases (see equation (15) above for the conditions under

which this will take place), there will be a tendency to substitute

expenditure away from period 2 into period 1, generating forces that will

tend to worsen period l's current account. On the contrary, if as a result

of the anticipated tariff there is a real depreciation in period 2,

(dq2/dr2) <   0,   expenditure will go down in period 1 with the consequence

improvement of the current account.

     The total effect of the anticipation of an import tariff on period l's

current account will depend on the strength of the intertemporal price

effects, initial expenditure on income and nontradables, and on the effects

of the tariff on the RER vector. This result contrasts with the traditional

static view where the conditions for tariffs improving the current account

are related to imports and exports elasticities within each period. An

important result of this analysis is that, under very plausible conditions,

it is possible that the sole anticipation of the enactment of future

protectionist policies will worsen today's current account. Moreover, it is

possible to simultaneously observe a worsening of the current account and a

real depreciation; a combination that would puzzle a number of observers,

including the media.


III. The Case of Positive Initial Tariffs

     If initially there are positive tariffs, the anticipation of a future

hike in tariffs will generate a first order negative income effect in period

2.12 Households will try to smooth consumption through time, and the effect

on consumption of this negative income effect will be spread across periods.
                                                             17




This income effect will result in a drop in demand for nontradables in

periods 1 and 2 and will generate downward pressure on the relative price of

N in both periods. This is because the reduction of real income associated

with the period 2 tariff hike will provoke an incipient excess supply of

nontradables in both periods. The reestablishment of equilibrium will

require a reduction in home goods prices. The presence of this income

effect will enhance the possibility of observing "interesting" dynamics in

the behavior of the equilibrium RERs, such as overshooting or opposite

movements:


                     1                        2
                                                                                                         (17)
               di-                      di-



     In this case the income effect also plays a role in the reaction of the

current account to the anticipation of a hike in period 2's tariffs:

where the three first terms on the REIS are the same as in equation (16) for

the zero tariff case. The fourth term is related to the income effect.

Since (dW/dr2) < 0           -   - that       is the future tariff reduces utility -               - we can
see that in this case it is also possible that the anticipation of a future

hike in existing import tariffs can result in a worsening of the current

account in period 1.

IV. Temporary Tariffs. Permanent Tariffs and Other Extensions

    The model developed above can be easily used to analyze the effects of

temporary and permanent tariffs on the path of equilibrium RERs and on the

current account. In particular, the diagrammatic analysis of Section II can

handle both of these cases. In the case of temporary tariffs (i.e., a

period 1 tariff only), it is easy to show that, once again, "equilibrium

overshooting" can result where the initial equilibrium relative price of N

(q1) increases - -       in   relation to the nontariff benchmark case - -   by   more

than the equilibrium price of N in period 2.               In the case of the imposi-

tion of a temporary tariff in period 1 only, the            H2H2 schedule will always

shift to the right, while the H1H1 curve can shift either to the left or

to the right. Figure 5 illustrates two alternative equilibria that can

result as a consequence of temporary import tariff.

     With respect to the current account, a temporary tariff can either

improve or worsen that period's current account balance. The intuition

behind this is analogous to the case of the anticipated tariff, discussed

above. More specifically:

     The model developed in this paper can be extended in several

interesting directions. For example, the case of a large country can be

easily handled by specifying a second country with a similar structure, and

by adding the worldwide budget constraints. Also the case of shocks to the

international terms of trade (pl* and p2*) can be incorporated into the

discussion. In this case, however, it is not possible to ignore the income

effects. Even if the initial tariffs are zero, a worsening of the terms of

trade will have a first order (negative) income effect. Investment can also

be introduced into the analysis. Moreover, its incorporation will not alter

in a significant way the main results presented above. Once investment is

added, the interteniporal budget constraint has to be altered, and an

equation describing the process governing investment decisions has to be

added to our system. Denoting investment by I, and assuming that there is

time to build, the intertemporal budget constraint becomes:

               Rl(l,ql,pl;Kl,Vl) + 8*R2(l,p2 ,q2;K1+I,V1)

                                 + r1(E1- R11) + 6*r2(E     2   R22)
                                                                       -    I   =


                                                                                    (20)


Further assuming that investment decisions are governed by the condition

that in equilibrium Tobin's "q" equals 1, and that investment goods

correspond to the numeraire good, the investment equation is:

                       1                                                            (21)
                6*4
The manipulation of (20) and (21) and the two conditions for equilibrium in

 the nontraded goods market in period 1 and 2 will now yield the correspond-

 ing expressions for changes in the RERs and the capital account.          Once

 investment is added into the analysis the capital stock in period 2 becomes
                                        20



 an endogenous variable. More specifically, it is possible to relate

 additions to the capital stock (dK) to anticipated changes in tariffs and

 to real exchange rate changes:

V. Concluding Remarks

     The analysis presented in this paper has shown that a fairly simple

real intertemporal model of a fully optimizing economy, with no rigidity or

adjustment costs, can generate a number of interesting paths for the equi-

librium real exchange rate, as a response to exogenous real disturbances.

This suggests that real equilibrium models may be able to explain a

nontrivial fraction (but not necessarily all) of observed RER movements.

For example, since terms of trade shocks are very common and quite

substantial in magnitude, it is possible that in a number of countries the

observed wide swings in RER are, at least in part, equilibrium movements

generated by the economy's reaction to terms of trade or other structural

(real) disturbances. This possibility is particularly important in light of

the recent interest by politicians and policymakers in real exchange rate

"disequilibrium".

     In fact, in the last two years or so policy analyses have increasingly

focused on issues related to real exchange rate disequilibrium, and some

proposals aimed at actively intervening in the exchange market in ord
                                    21




reduce real exchange rate "misalignment" have been discussed. These

proposals, however, would only make sense if recent RER movements in fact

represent a disequilibrium phenomenon, where the actual RER exhibits sus-

tamed departures from its equilibrium value. If, on the other hand, this

is not the case, and observed RER changes respond to "fundamentals,"

intervention could have counterproductive effects. It would seem, then,

that in order to fully understand RER behavior, and to propose policy

actions, it is first necessary to have a fully articulated theory on how the

equilibrium value of this relative price responds to different (real)

disturbances. Most of the recent exchange rates research, however, has

focused on nominal exchange rate determination, tending to ignore real

aspects of real exchange rate behavior. The model presented in this paper

provides a coherent fully optimizing model that can help analyze the way the

equilibrium RER reacts to these changes in "fundamentals". A next step

would then be to add to this model a monetary sector as well as short term

rigidities in a way such that issues related to disequilibrium and misalign-

ment could be properly analyzed.

     Another important result reported in this paper is the (likely)

possibility that an anticipated tariff will worsen today's current account.

This implies that if protectionism is thought of as a way to tackle current

account imbalances, the sole discussion of possible import tariffs in the

future will make things even worse today.
