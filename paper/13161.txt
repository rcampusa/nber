                                             ABSTRACT

We contrast the spatial mismatch hypothesis with what we term the racial mismatch hypothesis – that
the problem is not a lack of jobs, per se, where blacks live, but a lack of jobs where blacks live into
which blacks are hired. We first report new evidence on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, using data
from Census Long-Form respondents. We construct direct measures of the presence of jobs in detailed
geographic areas, and find that these job density measures are related to employment of black male
residents in ways that would be predicted by the spatial mismatch hypothesis – in particular that spatial
mismatch is primarily an issue for low-skilled black male workers. We then look at mismatch along
not only spatial lines but racial lines as well, by estimating the effects of job density measures that
are disaggregated by race. We find that it is primarily black job density that influences black male
employment, whereas white job density has little if any influence on their employment. The evidence
implies that space alone plays a relatively minor role in low black male employment rates.

I. Introduction

         Black employment rates are lower than those of comparable whites. The spatial mismatch

hypothesis argues that this is in part attributable to there being “fewer jobs per worker in or near black

areas than white areas” (Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1998, p. 851) because of exogenous residential

segregation by race attributable at least in part to discrimination in housing markets.1 In this paper, we

consider the possibility that the problem may not be so much a lack of jobs in areas where blacks reside,

but a lack of jobs that employ blacks even in the areas where they do reside, whether because of labor

market discrimination, race-specific labor networks, or neighborhood effects. In either case, finding a job

may be “like a haystack needle” for blacks. But whereas the spatial mismatch hypothesis attributes lower

employment of blacks solely to the spatial distribution of jobs relative to where blacks live, the “racial

mismatch” hypothesis suggests that it has more to do with the distribution of jobs that employ blacks. The

implications of the alternative hypotheses are significant, because only the spatial mismatch hypothesis

implies that black employment would be increased by improving access of blacks to areas with more jobs

(at the appropriate skill level), without regard to the racial composition of employment in those jobs.

         Looking at detailed Census data on both residential and employer location, we first estimate the

relationship between an individual’s employment and the density of jobs in their geographic area of

residence, providing new evidence on spatial mismatch. The more substantive contribution, however, is to

explore whether the evidence is really generated by spatial mismatch, or instead reflects what we refer to

as racial mismatch. Whereas the pure spatial mismatch hypothesis implies that it is only the location of

jobs, irrespective of whether they are held by blacks or whites, which affects employment prospects, if

1
  Discrimination is not the only possible source of this segregation. For example, Brueckner and Rosenthal (2005)
present a model and evidence suggesting that the concentration of poor (often minority) residents in central cities
arises because preferences for newer housing stock lead richer people, who are more likely to be white, to locate in
the suburbs.


                                                          1
discrimination, labor market networks, or neighborhood effects in which race matters play important

roles, then the distribution of jobs held by members of one’s own race may be the more relevant

determinant of employment status. Given that urban areas with large concentrations of black residents

may also be areas into which whites tend to commute to work, it is possible that the employment

problems of low-skilled inner-city blacks may not reflect simply an absence of jobs where they live, even

at appropriate skill levels, but rather that the jobs that do exist tend to be held by whites. This motivates

our inquiry into whether employment of blacks is affected by the spatial distribution of jobs – conditional

on skill – irrespective of whether those jobs are held by blacks, or whether the racial composition of those

jobs is also important in explaining black employment. Note that in the latter case the spatial distribution

of jobs is still important, but it is the spatial distribution of jobs held by blacks that is central. The key

difference is that we cannot have racial mismatch unless race plays an independent role in employment.

While “racial mismatch” is a convenient short-hand for this alternative hypothesis, and we use it from

here, the hypothesis is one about the interaction of space and race, which might best be thought of as

“spatial-racial mismatch.”

         Spatial mismatch is premised on residential segregation by race coupled with fewer jobs in areas

where blacks live. As a result, the net wage (defined as the wage minus commuting costs) for a worker

who lives in a black area but for whom jobs are far away may be below the worker’s reservation wage, so

that fewer residents of black areas will choose to work. This will be truer of lower-skilled blacks, for

whom commuting costs represent a larger share of earnings.2 The spatial mismatch hypothesis posits that

via these channels residential segregation leads to overall lower employment rates among blacks. This

may be reinforced by an excess supply of workers to firms near heavily black residential areas, causing

the wages of workers living in those areas to fall and further reducing incentives for employment. The

spatial mismatch literature suggests that this disequilibrium persists because of the continuing movement

2
 It may also be accentuated by worse public transportation options from inner-city areas to suburban work sites,
which again will more severely impact lower-skilled individuals who rely on public transportation. At the same time,
Glaeser et al. (2006) suggest that the poor have tended to concentrate in central cities because of the availability of
public transportation for getting to work and other needs (a time-intensive, but lower cost mode of transport than
automobiles).

                                                          2
of jobs out of central city areas, discrimination in housing that prevents mobility of blacks to where jobs

are located, customer discrimination against blacks (which might also reduce black employment prospects

in white areas), and poor information about jobs in other areas (Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1998). In contrast,

if racial mismatch is more important, then there are weaker incentives for black central city residents to

move to the suburbs in response to the spatial distribution of jobs.

         One obvious potential source of racial mismatch is employment discrimination against blacks, in

which case the availability of jobs for blacks in an area, rather than overall availability, will play a

stronger role in determining black employment. This implication of discrimination is no different from

what would be implied by an important role for informal labor market networks that are stratified by race,

or by models of racially stratified “neighborhood” or “peer effects,” where labor market behavior and

outcomes of an individual are partially determined by the behavior of people with whom an individual

interacts in a non-work setting, based on residential location as well as race.3

         Our empirical analysis asks whether the spatial distribution of jobs appears to disadvantage less-

skilled blacks or instead whether employment outcomes are related to the racial composition of jobs

where blacks live, which we term “racial mismatch.” Distinguishing between discrimination, network

effects, and neighborhood effects as the sources of racial mismatch is beyond the scope of this paper,

although we try to shed a little bit of light on the alternative possibilities and find both some evidence

consistent with discrimination and some potentially more consistent with networks. Our evidence comes

from the confidential full file of Long-Form respondents to the 2000 Decennial Census, which we use to

construct detailed location-, skill-, and race-specific measures of the extent of jobs available to local

residents. The evidence we present therefore is based on a very large nationally representative sample of

individuals who live in geographically diverse areas with respect to job availability by race and by skill,

even within metropolitan areas.

         Finally, as discussed in more detail later, the spatial mismatch literature faces the potential

3
 The research literature provides some support for all three of these influences. For example, see Turner et al. (1991)
and Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) on discrimination, Granovetter (1974) and Bayer et al. (2005) on networks,
and Case and Katz (1991) and Evans et al. (1992) on peer effects.

problem of bias from endogenous residential location generating a correlation between job density and

unobserved characteristics of potential workers. We do not have a definitive solution to this problem.

Although some city- or MSA-level analyses have proposed instrumental variables (e.g., Cutler et al.,

1997), valid instruments are generally unavailable at the local labor market level at which we do our

analysis. In addition, we would need separate instruments for measures of job density by race, and it is

even less likely that such instruments exist or that they could predict independent variation in the race-

specific density measures.4 We address the endogeneity issue in two ways. First, we draw on a wide set of

regression results from a uniquely rich data source to probe various possible sources of bias related to

endogeneity as well as other factors. Second, we argue that we can quite confidently assess the

importance of spatial mismatch versus racial mismatch even in the presence of endogenous location

decisions. In particular, the biases stemming from unobservable characteristics of workers are likely to

bias the coefficients on race-specific job density measures similarly. Thus, there is much less concern that

this source of bias generates differences in the estimated effects of job density defined for blacks and for

others, which is the core test for racial mismatch.

II. Background on Spatial Mismatch

         In this section we explain how our research fits into the larger literature on spatial mismatch. The

classic early study of spatial mismatch was by Kain (1968), who drew three conclusions from data on

Chicago and Detroit: (i) blacks were less likely to be employed in areas with lower shares of black

residents (perhaps due to customer discrimination); (ii) black employment would be considerably higher

if there were less racial segregation in housing; and (iii) jobs had moved from central city areas to

suburban areas between 1950 and 1960, combining with segregation of blacks in central city areas to

depress further black employment prospects.

         In subsequent work, researchers often instead looked at employment (or earnings) differences

4
  A related literature that tests for agglomeration economies, where employment density or economic activity more
generally raises productivity and wages, faces similar challenges of inferring causality because wages may be higher
in dense locations due to non-random selection of high-ability workers into those locations (see, e.g., Combes et al.,
forthcoming; Glaeser and Mare, 1999; Rosenthal and Strange, 2008).


                                                          4
associated with urban (central city) residence versus suburban residence (e.g., Harrison, 1972; Vrooman

and Greenfield, 1980; Price and Mills, 1985). Holzer (1991) argued that such an approach potentially

improves on Kain’s because job access for blacks versus whites is likely to differ much more sharply

along central city-suburban lines than among more disaggregated areas within cities; for example, blacks

may have access to jobs in a central city near but not in a highly black residential area. One problem with

the central city-suburban “test” is that lower employment of central city blacks may also reflect

unmeasured differences between blacks residing in central city areas and blacks (or whites) residing

elsewhere, which can arise from endogenous location decisions in which those with jobs and therefore

higher income tend to choose to live in suburban areas, creating a bias toward a finding of spatial

mismatch (Ellwood, 1986; Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1998).5 A second problem is that job opportunities

vary within central city and suburban areas.

         Consequently, other work on spatial mismatch has tried to incorporate more direct information on

job access related to either travel time or the extent of nearby jobs within a metropolitan area (e.g.,

Ellwood, 1986; Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1990). This latter approach is closer to what we do in our tests of

pure spatial mismatch, although we incorporate a good deal more information on the availability of jobs.6

These studies tend to show that blacks face lower access (such as longer commute times to jobs because

there are fewer jobs per person in the areas where blacks live), but that the differences may not be large

and could conceivably be overcome relatively easily (Ellwood, 1986). However, potential biases from

endogenous location also arise in estimating the link between job access and employment among blacks.

In particular, if blacks with jobs have higher incomes choose to live in areas with less job access, this

5
  Wilson’s (1987) work focuses on the interactions between spatial mismatch and the characteristics of the inner-city
residents that remain, arguing that the movement of jobs out of central city areas contributed to the growth of the
black underclass. Zax and Kain (1988) provide evidence that is less prone to criticisms regarding unobserved
characteristics of inner-city blacks underlying apparent evidence of spatial mismatch. In particular, they examine
how black and white employees responded to their employer relocating from central city Detroit to the suburbs,
finding that blacks were less likely to move to the suburbs and keep their jobs, and more likely to quit.
6
 Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist (1998) characterize studies using direct measures of job access as falling into one of two
categories: either using a single metropolitan area with measures of job accessibility at the neighborhood level; or
using many metropolitan areas, typically restricted to central cities, with a single measure of job accessibility for
each metropolitan area. The first lacks generalizability, while the second ignores considerable variation in job
accessibility across neighborhoods within central cities.

                                                           5
generates a bias toward zero in the estimated relationship between job access and employment (Ihlanfeldt,

1992). Moreover, even compelling evidence of longer commute times for blacks does not point to spatial

mismatch per se, as simple employment discrimination against blacks can imply fewer job offers and

hence on average longer commute times even if blacks and whites live in the same place.

         Another line of research uses across-city variation in the spatial distribution of jobs to test for

spatial mismatch. This work is closer to ours in that it uses data from a large set of metropolitan areas

(rather than a few). But it differs because of the level of aggregation; that is, we simultaneously use data

from metropolitan areas across the country, but do the analysis at a disaggregated level within cities. In

particular, Weinberg (2000, 2004) studies whether the concentration of black residents in central cities is

associated with lower black employment, and how residential concentration affects black-white

differences in employment differentials. Using across-city variation does not necessarily lessen the

potential problem of endogenous residential location, since individuals may also sort across cities (and

between cities and suburbs). But some researchers have been more willing to posit the existence of valid

instruments for city-level analyses – and instruments can be more readily constructed at the city level.7

         In contrast to this latest work, we are interested in how the distribution of jobs across local labor

markets affects employment, and hence we conduct a more disaggregated analysis, using measures of job

access at a considerably more detailed level, constructed from confidential Census information on place

of work. Because of the large sample and other features of our data, we are also able to construct job

access measures by skill, which may provide a better characterization of spatial mismatch facing

particular groups of individuals. Finally, we focus not on black-white employment differentials, but

instead – following most of the spatial mismatch literature – on the determinants of black employment.

         The more substantive departure from the previous literature, however, is that we introduce the

7
  For example, Weinberg uses as instruments the industrial composition of a city’s employment, information on the
housing stock, and historical black residential concentration. Cutler and Glaeser (1997) instrument for city-level
racial segregation in housing with variables capturing the local structure of government and topographical features of
the city. In all these papers, accounting for endogeneity with instrumental variables estimation has little effect on the
results. Ross (1998) also analyzes spatial mismatch at the MSA level, although he focuses on changes in jobs and
residential location.



                                                           6
idea of racial mismatch and test for evidence consistent with its existence. We do this by constructing

measures of job density by race (and skill) and estimating whether black employment is more sensitive to

the spatial distribution of jobs held by blacks than to job density measured without regard to race.8 As

noted in the introduction, this particular test regarding the effects of job density on black employment is

likely less prone to biases from endogenous residential location that may arise in research on spatial

mismatch.

III. Data

        We use the 2000 Sample Edited Detail File (SEDF), which contains all individual responses to

the 2000 Decennial Census one-in-six Long Form, and detailed information on residential location and

place of work.9 The SEDF includes the individual-level controls provided in the Census, allowing us to

capture differences in skills and other characteristics across individuals that may affect employment. But

the key feature that these data provide from the perspective of studying spatial mismatch is the ability to

construct measures of job density for highly disaggregated geographic areas within MSA’s using a very

large sample. The job density measure on which we rely in most of our analyses is the number of jobs in

the area relative to the population residing there, in the aggregate and for subsets of the population. In all

cases, the density measures assigned to each Census respondent are calculated excluding that individual,

to avoid a mechanical relationship between job density and an individual’s employment. Job density

parallels the concept of “job accessibility” that figures prominently in research on spatial mismatch,

although it has been more common to measure this accessibility indirectly via commuting time.

        The definition of these job density measures requires the specification of the relevant local labor

market. The idea is to consider a geographic unit in which the availability of jobs has an important

influence on residents of that geographic unit. A city (or MSA/PMSA) is likely much too large. On the

other hand, single zip codes are likely too small. We instead focus our attention on “zip code areas,”

8
  The only study we have found that looks at job density by demographic group is by Ellis et al. (forthcoming), who
examine how the residential distribution of immigrant groups and the spatial distribution of employment in the
industries in which immigrant groups work interact to determine, within a metropolitan area, variation in the
industries in which different immigrant groups are concentrated.


                                                         7
defined by the zip code and all geographically contiguous zip codes. Over a third (34 percent) of the

employed individuals in our sample work in the “zip code area” in which they reside, compared with only

14 percent working in the zip code in which they live, and 92 percent in the same MSA/PMSA. These

figures suggest that zip code areas capture a relatively compact geographic area in which many residents

look for and find employment.10 We also, however, explore variations in how to define local labor

markets. In much of the research on spatial mismatch, job access has been measured via functions of

observed commuting patterns for employed workers, often based on parameters of a gravity equation that

are used to weight jobs at varying distances from a residential area.11 Our baseline job density measures

that define the local labor market as the zip code area can be thought of as a particular version of a gravity

model where the distance parameter for all zip codes in a zip code area is one, and all other zip codes

have a weight of zero. We also explore the robustness of our results to alternative definitions of job

density, using a more extreme version where the local labor market is defined as the resident’s zip code

(rather than zip code area), as well as definitions that are more like traditional gravity models where we

define the local labor market to be the entire MSA and use a decay function to downweight jobs within

the MSA that are farther from the resident’s own zip code.

           Table 1 describes the construction of the sample of black males used in this paper. As shown in

the top two rows, the full SEDF includes 42.6 million (non-institutionalized) observations, with nearly 2.2

million observations on black males. The following five rows indicate how many of these observations

(on black men) would be excluded based on a number of criteria for exclusion from the sample; each

9
    The results are qualitatively very similar using the 1990 SEDF.
10
   Technically, the 2000 Decennial Census reports Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA’s) rather than the more
traditional postal zip codes, although there is a one-to-one mapping of the two definitions in most cases; we therefore
simply refer to ZCTA’s as zip codes. Some ZCTA’s are actually disjoint sets of census blocks. In those (relatively
rare) cases, we treat the disjoint sets as two separate zip codes. For each zip code, we use ArcView to map the zip
codes contiguous to each zip code to form our “zip code areas.” A single zip code therefore is likely to be part of
multiple zip code areas in our data.
11
  For example, Raphael (1998) estimates an equation for young workers in the San Francisco area that yields a
parameter measuring the impact of private vehicle commute time on employment patterns. This parameter is used to
construct a job access measure for a given residential neighborhood by aggregating a weighted estimate of
employment (or employment changes in this particular case) of nearby neighborhoods, weighting by the distance
parameter from the gravity equation.


                                                            8
criterion is considered separately, rather than specifying an arbitrary order for imposing them and the

number of observations dropped at each step. The three most significant exclusion criteria are living

outside a metropolitan area, being outside the age range, and (related to age) being in school. Imposing all

of these criteria jointly yields 700,303 observations on black men. Subsequent rows address some

particular problems that arise because we need to identify both where people live and where they work.

First, a small number of observations (about 2,800) report a zip code for either place of work or place of

residence that is on the water, rather than on land. (For example, an oil rig would be a work location on

the water.) These zip codes have very few residents or workers (and often only one or the other) and

therefore have meaningless measures of job density, so we exclude them. There are a few observations

with unmatched information on place of work, which arises when one’s place of work is in a zip code that

does not get included in the file we use to create contiguous zip codes. Far more prevalent are cases where

the place of work has been allocated rather than reported by the respondent, which occurs about one-fifth

of the time. Because we want to be sure to accurately measure place of work, and because our

examination of the allocated cases suggested that allocated places of work are essentially chosen to be

random places within metropolitan areas, we drop these cases. However, because the incidence of missing

place of work information is non-random with respect to observable characteristics, we reweight to obtain

a representative sample.12 These weights are used in all descriptive statistics and regressions.

        The final set of sample restrictions ensures that the job density measures are defined for the

remaining observations. In particular, because the denominators of the density measures are the numbers

of individuals with given characteristics living in the zip code area, these denominators occasionally can

be zero. We drop from all of the regressions we estimate all data in zip code areas with undefined density

measures, so that the various estimates can be compared across a consistent sample.13 The final number of

12
  For the sample of employed workers, we estimated a linear probability model for unmatched or allocated place of
work information as a function of all of the demographic controls used in the regressions described below. We then
reweighted the employed observations based on the estimates from this model, weighting by the reciprocal of the
predicted probability of having valid place of work data.
13
  The alternative would be to drop a different set of zip code areas depending on the density measures used in each
regression. The differences in resulting sample sizes are minor.

SEDF observations on black men is 533,198.

        Figure 1 provides a sense of what a zip code area is, relative to zip codes and to census blocks.

We present three separate maps that contain information from the zip codes that begin with the number

600, which is essentially the city of Chicago. Chicago is of course just one particular example, but it is

illustrative of many of the types of issues that arise in the study of spatial mismatch because it is a big city

that has both high residential and high employment density in various parts of the city, and it is a racially-

mixed city that is racially segregated. We constructed the first two maps in Figure 1 with GIS software

using publicly-available data from the city of Chicago that are derived from the 2000 Decennial Census.

The zip code boundaries are clearly delineated. In addition, in the first map each individual census block

is color coded with the number of white residents living on the block and in the second map each census

block is color coded with the number of black residents. In both cases, darker shades denote more

residents. The third map in Figure 1 uses underlying data from County Business Patterns in 2000 and

color codes the number of workers employed in each zip code.

        These maps do not directly display zip code areas – each defined as a zip code and all zip codes

contiguous to it; zip code areas are too difficult to display as they often overlap. Nonetheless, it is clear

from the first two maps in Figure 1 that zip code areas contain numerous census blocks, but do not cover

large areas of land. The maps also reveal substantive information about spatial mismatch and the potential

for racial mismatch. First, residential segregation is apparent, as areas of the city with high white

residential density in general have low black residential density, and vice versa. Second, employment

density in Chicago varies strongly across zip codes. A lot of workers are employed in downtown Chicago

(and not so many Chicago residents live there). But there are many other areas of the city containing non-

trivial employment as well. Moreover, although there appears to be a somewhat greater concentration of

jobs near where whites live, there are also many jobs near where blacks live, suggesting that a simple

disconnect between where blacks live and where jobs are located may not be the entire story.

IV. Empirical Approach

Spatial Mismatch


                                                      10
         The analysis of spatial mismatch uses the sample of black men in the SEDF living in MSA’s. The

first specification we estimate simply includes add an aggregate job density measure (JD) as well as a

standard vector of controls, as in

(1)      E = α + Xβ + δJD + ε .14

         The spatial mismatch model implies that job density should be an important determinant of

employment, predicting that δ is positive. The variables in X include: age (linear and quadratic terms),

marital status (a dummy variable for currently married), education (five dummy variables for high school

degree, some college, Associate’s degree, Bachelor’s degree, and advanced degree), MSA fixed effects,

and residence in a central city, non-central city, or suburb. Given the sample size, equation (1) is

estimated as a linear probability model.

         Because the spatial mismatch model also predicts that the location of jobs is more relevant for

less-skilled individuals, we augment the model to allow the effects of job density to vary with an

individual’s education, as in

(2)      E = α + Xβ + Σk δkJD⋅EDk + ε .

where EDk is a dummy variable for whether the individual has education level k.15

         While equation (2) allows for different effects of overall job density depending on individuals’

skill levels, it may inaccurately capture the effects of job density on individuals in different skill groups

because it uses an aggregate job density measure, rather than a measure of the density of jobs at skill

levels closer to those of the worker. We therefore construct education-specific job density measures – in

particular, for those with at most a high school degree, and for the narrower group of high school

dropouts. When we construct these job density measures for lower education levels, the restriction applies

14
  In most cases, because the data are clustered on zip code areas and the job density variables are defined at this
level, we report standard errors that are robust to non-independence of observations within zip code areas, as well as
heteroscedasticity. Estimated standard errors that are clustered at the MSA level are only slightly larger, and change
none of the conclusions.
15
  We experimented with varying levels of detail, but settled on using categories for less than high school, high
school graduate, and any (some) college. Most of the important relationships appeared for the lowest levels of
education, so there was nothing gained by further disaggregating those with different amounts of post-secondary
education.

to both the numerator and the denominator; for example, the high school dropout job density measure is

jobs held by high school dropouts divided by residents who are high school dropouts. Thus, equation (2)

becomes

(3)     E = αj + Xβj + Σk δkjJDj⋅EDk + εj , j=1,…, J,

where the job density measure now has a j subscript to indicate that it is defined for a particular education

level, and the parameters have a j superscript (and the residual a j subscript) to indicate that we estimate

the model separately for job densities defined for different education levels j. Under the spatial mismatch

hypothesis, we expect to find the strongest evidence that job density affects employment of less-educated

individuals using job density defined for low education groups. (We also estimate equation (1) for job

densities defined for different education levels.)

        The estimates of the models in equations (1) through (3) provide increasingly detailed tests of

whether the data are consistent with the spatial mismatch hypothesis. The overall results, and how they

change with the specification, provide more compelling tests of the potential existence of spatial

mismatch than has much of the previous literature.

Racial Mismatch

        The specifications to this point do not distinguish job density by whether the jobs are held by

blacks or by others. The racial mismatch hypothesis, however, implies that employment is more sensitive

to job density for one’s own race – in contrast to the simple spatial mismatch hypothesis. To study this

question, we first go back to the simplest specification (equation (1)), but we distinguish job density by

race, as in

(1’)    E = α + Xβ + δWJDW +δBJDB + ε .

        JDW is white jobs per black resident, and JDB is black jobs per black resident. We actually use

three alternative versions of these density measures: jobs held by non-blacks and jobs held by blacks, per

black resident; jobs held by non-black men and jobs held by black men, per black male resident; and jobs

held by white men and jobs held by black men, per black male resident. But as a short-hand the equation




                                                      12
simply refers to black and white job density.16 Because we define both densities relative to black

residents, estimates of the two coefficients δW and δB allow a comparison of the effect on black

employment probabilities of an additional black job per black resident to the effect of an additional white

job per black resident. If job density of one’s own race is more important, then we should find that δB >

δW (with the first expected to be positive), indicating that black job density does more to boost black

employment. This would be evidence against pure spatial mismatch (which would instead predict no

difference between δB and δW), and instead point to racial mismatch in the sense that black employment

problems may reflect not so much the availability of jobs – at the right skill level in the specifications that

distinguish by skill, described below – but rather jobs that are present but unavailable or less available to

blacks.17

         We also estimate equation (1’) for job densities defined for different education levels, and we

estimate versions of equations (2) and (3) allowing for separate effects of job density by race. These

specifications become

(2’)     E = α + Xβ + Σk δkWJDW⋅EDk + Σk δkBJDB⋅EDk + ε

and

(3’)     E = αj + Xβj + Σk δkj,WJDj,W⋅EDk + Σk δkj,BJDj,B⋅EDk + εj , j=1,…, J,

where JDj,B, for example, is jobs held by blacks with education level j per black resident with education

level j. Again, comparisons of the estimated δ’s tell us whether the relationship between job density and

employment – now based on skill – is race specific.

         We have already noted that a stronger association of black job density (perhaps by skill level)

16
  The tables always clarify which group we are studying, but in the text we often simply refer to whites or to non-
blacks.
17
  A concrete example of what we are testing for is provided by the following example. Suppose that a new firm with
10 jobs is created in an area, and suppose that 9 of these jobs are filled by non-residents. We are told the racial mix
of the 9 non-resident hires, and asked whether we can predict whether this new firm increases the probability that a
random black in the area is employed. If racial mismatch matters, then this probability increases more if the 9 other
hires are black than if the 9 other hires are white (i.e., the new firm increases black job density, rather than
increasing white job density). The same argument holds if the 9 hires we are told about are not restricted to non-
resident hires, as long as we leave the individual out of the calculation. In fact, we show later that our results are
robust to excluding from the numerator all jobs held by residents, and instead defining job density as non-resident
jobs per black resident.

                                                          13
than of white job density with black employment can arise from a number of sources, including

discrimination, neighborhood, or peer effects. We know from the existing literature (most notably,

perhaps, Manski’s 1993 and 2000 papers on the reflection problem) that it is very difficult to sort out

these alternative explanations. Note, however, that our regressions are not plagued by the classic

reflection problem that would arise if we were regressing individual employment on the mean local

employment rate of black residents, because the numerator of the job density measures includes both

residents and non-residents. We do not claim that we can distinguish between discrimination,

neighborhood, and peer effects as potential explanations of the evidence of racial mismatch that we find.

Rather, our contribution is to explore whether the relationship between an individual’s employment status

and job density in one’s local labor market is driven by race-specific factors, which is inconsistent with

the pure spatial mismatch hypothesis.

V. Results

Descriptive Statistics

        Panel A of Table 2 shows that 58% of black men, but only 30% of non-black men and 27% of

white men live in central city areas, reflecting the rather profound residential segregation that is at the

core of the spatial mismatch hypothesis. The panel also reveals the sharp educational differences between

blacks and non-blacks or whites, with a much higher incidence of education less than high school (more

than double the rate for whites), and a considerably higher incidence of post-secondary education for non-

blacks (57%) and whites (62%) than for blacks (42%). Panel B reports on overall job density at the zip

code area level, providing comparisons for blacks and whites.18 As reported in column (1), which covers

all black and white men, job density is higher for black men, whether defined using men and women, only

males, or only black and white males. The higher overall job density for blacks presumably reflects net

commuting patterns into central city areas. Columns (2) and (3) report these statistics for lower education

groups, and reveal no notable differences.

        The figures in Panel B contradict the basic tenet of the spatial mismatch hypothesis – quoted in




                                                      14
the Introduction – that “there are fewer jobs per worker in or near black areas than white areas.” However,

this changes once we define job density by skill level, as shown in Panels C and D, which report job

density figures broken down by education level – first based on those with at most a high school degree,

and then high school dropouts. Job density for the lowest education category (less than high school) is

lower for blacks (0.50 versus 0.66, in the first two rows of Panel D), and the same is true for job density

based on a high school degree or less (0.64 for blacks versus 0.73 for whites in the corresponding rows);

the same holds for densities defined using only males or only black and white males. In contrast, job

density for those with some college (not shown in the table) is higher for blacks. The higher density at the

highest education level, and lower density at lower education levels, highlight spatial mismatch in terms

of skills, in that blacks, who are less educated, live in areas where high-skill job density is high relative to

areas where whites live, while low-skill job density is relatively low.

           Table 3 reports job density figures by race, again overall and for two narrower education groups.

These job density measures are used to capture “racial mismatch” rather than simply “spatial mismatch.”

As we would expect given the small share of the black population, on average blacks are exposed to a

much higher white or non-black job density than black job density. For example, in the first row of Panel

A, the mean of overall non-black jobs per black resident is 6.11, versus a mean of black jobs per black

resident of 0.61. The comparisons are similar for the lower education groups. The high value of non-black

or white job density for black workers indicates that whites often hold many jobs in areas where blacks

live; moreover, this is disproportionate to their share in the population of residents where blacks live.19

           The much higher non-black job density does not necessarily imply, however, that there are many

jobs available to blacks in the areas in which they live, because many of the jobs may require skill levels

higher than those of local blacks. We would certainly expect this to some extent given the lower

educational levels of blacks reported in Table 2. It is of interest, then, to compare the race-specific job

18
     The figures for non-blacks are very similar to those for whites.
19
  For example, we computed for blacks the mean of white male residents per black male resident, and the mean of
white male jobs per black male job, based on zip code area of residence. The ratio of white male jobs to black male
jobs exceeded the ratio of white male residents to black male residents by 25% (7.61 versus 6.11). At the lowest


                                                             15
density measures disaggregated by education level, which we do in Panels B and C of Table 3. The

differences between non-black and black job density faced by blacks fall, indicating that the jobs held by

non-blacks in areas where blacks tend to live employ more-educated workers. For example, in Panel C,

for dropouts only, the average non-black job density is 4.30 (versus 6.11 across all education groups),

while the average black job density is 0.46 (versus 0.61 across all education groups). Nonetheless, white

job density is still considerably higher than black job density for these education-specific job density

measures, so that less-educated blacks do live in areas where there are many jobs held by less-educated

whites. This suggests that the problem may not be a lack of jobs at appropriate skill levels where blacks

live, but a lack of jobs that are available to blacks.

Spatial Mismatch Regressions

           Having discussed the descriptive statistics, we next turn to the regression results. We first report

estimates of equations (1), (2), and (3), which include overall or education-specific job density measures,

but without distinguishing the density measures by race. The top panel of Table 4 reports estimates of

equation (1), using a single job density measure with no interactions with the individual’s education level.

There are, though, two dimensions of variation across the nine columns of the table. First, we define

density in three different ways: total jobs per resident; jobs held by males per male resident; and jobs held

by black or white males (only) per black or white male resident. There is no obvious reason to prefer one

of these density measures, but we want to explore the robustness of the results to the different measures.

Second, we define this density based on all individuals as well as those with lower schooling levels. The

spatial mismatch model predicts that job density defined for lower education levels should be a more

important determinant of employment for low-skilled residents.

           The estimates in the top row of Table 4 indicate a statistically significant positive effect of job

density on employment when the density is defined for either of the two lower education groups.20 For the

overall density measure the effect is actually negative but it is much smaller and is insignificant in one of


schooling level, the comparable numbers are 27% (4.40 versus 3.45).
20
     Most of our key results are strongly statistically significant, so in the ensuing discussion we often avoid


                                                             16
the three cases, despite the large sample. Thus, the evidence points to a stronger effect of job density

when it is calculated for jobs held by those with lower levels of education as a fraction of residents with

the same levels of education. Moreover, the point estimates are always larger when job density is defined

using those with the least education.21 To interpret the magnitudes, in column (6), for example, the

estimate implies that a 0.1 (or 10 percentage point) increase in job density for high school dropouts,

which is less than the difference between the 25th percentile and the median or the median and the 75th

percentile, raises the probability of employment by 0.0042, or about 0.6 percent given the mean

employment rate for black men, reported in Table 2, of 0.67.

           The specifications reported in the remaining rows of Table 4 distinguish the effects of job density

on employment based on an individual’s own educational level. The spatial mismatch hypothesis predicts

that job density should matter more for less-educated workers, and that this should be particularly true

when job density is measured for individuals with less education. The estimates largely confirm these

expectations. In all cases where job density is defined for the less-educated groups, we find a positive

effect of job density on employment (e.g., the 0.099 estimate in column (3)), and this effect is always

larger for the less-educated groups than those with some college. Moreover, in columns (2), (5), and (8),

which define density based on those with at most a high school degree, the strongest effect of job density

is for those with a high school degree (e.g., the estimate of 0.030 in column (5)), while in columns (3),

(6), and (9), which define density based on high school dropouts, the strongest effect of job density is for

that group. And finally, the strongest effects are found for high school dropouts when we define job

density based on high school dropouts (e.g., the estimate of 0.076 in column (9)).22

           Although these results are strongly consistent with spatial mismatch, it is possible that because of


continually referring to the statistical significance of the results unless the conclusions differ.
21
     Qualitatively similar results are reported in data for Sweden (Aslund et al., 2006).
22
  It might appear curious that we find effects of education-specific density measures for individuals with other
education levels – for example, the 0.070 estimate in column (9) for the effect of job density defined for high school
dropouts on those with a high school degree. However, we do not include the density measures for workers with a
high school degree in this regression, and the densities of jobs at different education levels are positively correlated.
In addition, of course, there are not rigid lines between jobs at specific skill levels and the skill levels of workers; for
example, a greater prevalence of jobs filled by those with less than a high school degree may nonetheless boost


                                                             17
endogenous sorting employment rates are higher in areas in which residents are more employable based

on a set of unobserved person-specific characteristics, so that the relationship between job density and

employment need not reflect spatial mismatch. While we obviously cannot control for all characteristics

of workers, given that we are able to control for some key ones we are more inclined to interpret the

variation in job densities as reflecting some kind of spatial influences. In addition, the evidence of

stronger effects of the spatial distribution of jobs for those with less skill is an implication of the spatial

mismatch model that does not derive nearly as naturally from the hypothesis of unobserved

characteristics, given that there is no obvious reason that job density should serve as a stronger proxy for

these unobservables for those with fewer skills relative to those with more skills.23

Racial Mismatch Regressions

         We now turn to our main evidence exploring whether there is a racial dimension to the effects of

job density. To begin, columns (1), (4), and (7) of the top panel of Table 5 report estimates of equation

(1’), where we simply use a measure of overall job density measure (not distinguished by education),

although broken down by race.24 The estimates in these three columns indicate very clearly that only job

density for blacks is substantively related to the employment of blacks. In each case, the estimated

coefficient on the black job density measure is larger than that of the non-black job density measure by a

factor of about 10.

         Next, just as we did in considering the pure spatial mismatch hypothesis, we measure job density

based on lower educational levels – first for at most a high school degree (columns (2), (5), and (8)), and


employment prospects of those with a high school degree even in these jobs.
23
  The relationship between job density and employment could also arise from agglomeration economies that lead to
higher worker productivity and hence higher wages where employment density is higher. However, Fu and Ross
(2007) present evidence suggesting that this higher productivity is offset by commuting costs (which they argue
reflects a locational equilibrium), leaving the net wage unaffected by employment density; in this case the job
density results would not reflect a labor supply response to a higher wage stemming from agglomeration. And again,
the agglomeration story does not explain the stronger effects of job density at lower skill levels.
24
   Note that, relative to the job density measures in Table 4, these density measures utilize a different denominator
defined only by black residents. We do this to isolate the role of job availability for black residents, rather than for
all residents. As a result, the scale of the density measures in Table 5 is much larger than in Table 4 (see the
summary statistics in Tables 2 and 3), which can affect the scale of the estimated regression coefficients in Table 5
relative to Table 4, irrespective of whether the effects of black job density and non-black job density differ.


                                                           18
then for high school dropouts (columns (3), (6), and (9)). We find that the estimated effects of non-black

or white job density change by only a small amount, at most 0.0005. In contrast, the estimated effects of

black job density are higher, rising by about 0.005 for the broader low-education group, and about 0.008

(roughly doubling) using the lowest-education group.

         The sharp differences in the estimated coefficients of the black versus the white or non-black job

density measures indicate that black job density is a much more important determinant of black

employment than is non-black job density. Moreover, the differences between the estimates in the first

and second rows of Table 5 are strongly statistically significant. Based on these differences (and

corresponding evidence below), we conclude that the racial mismatch hypothesis is a better

characterization of how the spatial distribution of jobs affects black employment. In particular, from a

policy perspective, we want to know which specification provides us with a better idea of how policy

might be used to raise black employment. Our estimates make clear – and we show this with a simple

simulation later – that the spatial mismatch model is clearly misleading, as it suggests that changing the

spatial distribution of black residents could do a lot to increase black employment. In contrast, the racial

mismatch model clarifies that simply shifting black residents to areas with high job density (even at the

appropriate skill level) is unlikely to do much to increase black employment.25

         The lower panel of Table 5 reports results for the specifications including interactions of the race-

and education-specific job density measures with dummy variables for individuals’ education levels. The

most important finding is that, regardless of the education level for which density is measured, the effect

of black job density on black employment is much stronger than the effect of the corresponding non-black

or white job density. In column (3), for example, the estimated effect of non-black job density defined for

high school dropouts on employment of black high school dropouts is 0.0008, whereas the estimated

25
  Note that some of the more standard statistical approaches do not apply when comparing the results in Tables 4
and 5. First, we cannot nest the models, because the denominators in the spatial and racial specifications are
different; restricting the coefficients of black and white density in Table 5 to be the same in the racial mismatch
specifications does not yield the spatial specification in Table 4. Moreover, the same policy argument above implies
that the loss function that is minimized by maximizing R2 is not the right one. The goal is not simply to forecast
variation in black employment, but rather to identify the types of policies more likely to be useful in increasing black
employment.


                                                          19
effect on this same group of black job density defined for high school dropouts is 0.041. In general, the

difference is much larger for less-educated workers, and in particular for the specifications defining job

density for less-educated individuals the difference is sometimes a factor of 30, 40, or even more.

        We also find that the effect of black job density for less-educated blacks is stronger when this job

density is defined based on less-educated workers and residents. For example, in the second row of the

lower panel, the estimated effect of black job density on high school dropouts rises from 0.005 in column

(1) to 0.041 in column (3). This always holds for the interactions with the dummy variables for the two

lower education levels, although the same is not true for those with some college. Moreover, the

estimated effect of black job density is particularly strong for less-educated blacks, when using the

density measures defined for lower education levels. The causal interpretation of the 0.041 estimate in

column (3) is that if black job density for high school dropouts increases by 0.1, the black high school

dropout employment rate increases by 0.0041. Given an employment rate of 0.46 for black high school

dropouts, this represents an increase of almost 1 percent. At the same time, the implied elasticity is well

below 1, indicating that the benefit of higher job density does not accrue solely to residents. In contrast,

we do not find the same sort of results with respect to the effects of non-black or white job density on

black employment. Higher non-black or white job density has little relationship to black employment

probabilities, and generally fails to exhibit the differences in effects associated with education that are

predicted by the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Together, this evidence is consistent with the notion that the

spatial distribution of job density matters for the employment of less-educated blacks, but it is only the

spatial distribution of jobs held by blacks that matters – which we have termed racial mismatch.

        In Table 6 we examine the robustness of our results to other definitions of the local labor market,

and therefore other measures of job density. In this and the ensuing robustness and other analyses we

present, we report results for the specification in Table 5, column (6) (using men with less than a high

school education to define job density).26 After repeating the baseline estimates in column (1), column (2)

reports estimates using as our job density measure a distance-based gravity-like model of job access,




                                                      20
where we still use zip codes as the basic geographic construct but where we allow all jobs and residents

across zip codes of an MSA to have an impact on measured job density. In particular, for each individual

we first measure the distance between the centroids of his residential zip code and all other zip codes in

the MSA. We then construct the numerator of the job density measure as the weighted sum across all zip

codes in the MSA of the number of jobs in that zip code held by workers (with less than a high school

education, and by race), using as weights 1/(1+distance)2. The denominator of the job density measure is

the weighted sum of residents with the same characteristics in each zip code in the MSA, using the same

weights. For any observation in our data, this weighting function obviously weights more strongly jobs

and residents who live in the same zip code as the individual, with the weights decaying nonlinearly as we

consider jobs and residents farther away from the zip code in which the individual resides.

           The estimates in column (2) of Table 6 are all higher than in column (1). For example, the effect

of black job density on residents with less than a high school education in column (2) is 0.123, three times

larger than in the baseline specification. This is not surprising, given that the gravity-based job density

measures incorporate jobs in the entire MSA, rather than just in the zip code area. But the important

qualitative results still hold. In particular, black job density matters much more than non-black job density

for employment, and matters most for less-skilled residents.

           In column (3) we use a weighting function of 1/(1+distance), which decays at a slower rate with

distance. The estimates on black density, in particular, are even higher, but again the results show strong

differences in the impact of job density by race, and much stronger impacts of black job density on less

educated blacks relative to those with some college education. In column (4) we take the opposite

approach to weighting, using an extreme job density measure which defines job density to consist of jobs

per resident only for the exact zip code in which the individual resides. For the most part, the results are

very similar to those in the baseline results reported in column (1). All in all, the results in Table 6 find

robust evidence in support of racial mismatch.

           We next consider a number of additional analyses that assess potential sources of bias in our

26
     Results were similar for other specifications based on measures of job density for those with low education.

                                                            21
estimates or help to interpret the estimates. First, if blacks and whites live in different types of zip codes,

and this causes the mismeasurement of the local labor market to differ by race, then any comparisons of

the effects of job density across races might be misleading. Perhaps of most concern is the fact that zip

codes are larger in suburban areas. For example, if in suburban areas the local labor market is more likely

to be just the zip code of residence, rather than contiguous zip codes as well, then white job density in the

suburbs is overstated relative to white job density in central cities when we use contiguous zip codes

everywhere. Thus, depending on whether the identification of the black and white job density effects

comes more from observations concentrated in the city versus the suburbs, the relative magnitudes of

these estimated effects may be biased. This problem should be addressed by the gravity-type estimates

reported in Table 6. As another approach, however, we re-estimated our racial mismatch regressions

excluding suburban residents. The evidence for the same comparison specification is reported in column

(2) of Table 7, and is qualitatively similar to that from the baseline specification, with at most a slight

diminution of the estimated differences between the effects of black and non-black job density.

        Second, we consider a specification that may help to separate the influence of unobservables such

as neighborhood or network effects that are common to residents of a local labor market from the

influence of job availability per se, and hence go some way toward assessing the importance of the

possible mechanisms that could drive our results. In particular, the black job density measure JDB in

equation (2’) can be rewritten as (JDBR +JDBNR) where JDBR is the number of jobs held by black residents

of the zip code area per black resident, and JDBNR is the number of jobs per black resident held by black

non-residents. We estimate a specification in which we incorporate both of these job density measures

(again, by race and skill) separately into the employment equation and examine to what extent an

individual’s employment is differentially associated with the resident and non-resident job density

measures.27 To the extent that the zip code area defines an area in which residents are more likely to be

similar in unobservable ways than others who work there – for example by experiencing common

neighborhood effects – we expect the resident job density measure (JDBR) to pick up the effects of these




                                                       22
factors on employment and hence to be the source of the findings reported thus far. In contrast, we expect

any effects of the non-resident density measure (JDBNR) to capture the impact of job availability, which

may reflect labor market discrimination.

           Columns (3a) and (3b) of Table 7 report the estimates from regressions including both resident

and non-resident job density measures.28 In general, the disaggregated job density results from this

regression show that the estimates based on the aggregate race-specific job density measure that we used

in the preceding results are very similar to those identified for non-resident jobs in the zip code area,

while the estimates for resident job density are much larger. In the top panel, the estimated effects of both

non-black resident and non-black non-resident jobs are small (0.001 and 0.0001) and are of a scale that is

similar to that of the baseline specification in column (1) (0.0003). In contrast, the estimate of the black

resident job density coefficient is very large (0.154), whereas the estimate of the non-resident job density

measure is 0.014, close to the estimate of 0.018 for the aggregated density measure. The similarity of the

latter two estimates implies that the aggregate estimates mainly reflect the effects of non-resident job

density. When we estimate separate effects by interacting the resident and non-resident job densities with

an individual’s education, as reported in the bottom panel of the table, the impacts on those with some

college are again very small for both density measures. For those with lower levels of education, the

estimated impact of the black resident density measures again are very large, whereas the estimated

impact of the non-resident black job densities, while somewhat smaller than in the baseline results, is still

of the same order of magnitude and is always stronger than the non-black density measure.

           The fact that the estimated effect in column (3a) of low-skilled resident black job density on

employment of low-skilled blacks is so large suggests that it probably reflects unobservables shared by

local residents, including neighborhood or network effects. But the fact that, even conditional on resident

job density, the job density of low-skilled black male non-residents is strongly related to the employment

27
     In each case, the denominator remains the same as in the baseline.
28
  Conditional on the other covariates included in the model, the correlation between resident and non-resident black
job density is only 0.05. The corresponding correlation for non-blacks is 0.61. (The unconditional correlations are
virtually the same.)


                                                           23
of low-skilled resident black males (column (3b)) suggests to us that there likely is a direct and

substantive role for the local availability of jobs for lower-skilled blacks to affect the employment of low-

skilled black male residents, possibly stemming from labor market discrimination.29

           A third issue we consider is that there may be measurement error in the job density measures

resulting simply from sampling error – most likely because of zip code areas with very few black men,

given their small share of the population. Unlike the textbook measurement error case, the implications

for bias in the estimated coefficients are unclear, because we always have more than one density measure

included in the equation, and we often also have interactions between these density variables and

education. To assess the potential influence of measurement error on the estimates, we re-estimated our

models dropping from the sample zip code areas for which density measures were based on fewer than 10

black men. We report the results in column (4) of Table 7. In the top panel, using job density measures

without the education interactions, the estimated effect of non-black job density rises, and that of black

job density falls relative to the baseline specification, although the black job density still remains much

larger. For the estimates in the bottom panel that include the education interactions, the estimated effects

of job density based on high school dropouts are actually larger for high school dropouts and for those

with at most a high school degree, but not for those with some college. For the two low-education groups,

for which the spatial distribution of jobs should be more important, the differences between the estimated

effects of black and non-black job density increase. Thus, we regard the evidence for the two low-

education groups as largely unchanged.30

           A different measurement issue is whether the flow of new jobs better captures job availability

than the stock of jobs as embodied in job density measures like the ones we use. Raphael (1998), in work

that addresses pure spatial mismatch, instead uses job creation rates to measure job availability, based on

29
  It is also possible, in principle, that even conditional on education and the other controls in our model, there is
some sense in which black jobs are more suited to black workers, and similarly for white jobs and white workers.
This is clearly always an alternative explanation to discrimination in hiring. However, we view this alternative
explanation as less plausible because the qualitative results are insensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of the
demographic controls we do observe, making it less likely that unobservable job characteristics drive the results.
30
     We also verified that the estimates and conclusions were robust to omitting the weighting to correct for the non-


                                                            24
employment change between the 1980 and 1990 Censuses. However, even if job changes matter more

than job levels for characterizing the spatial distribution of employment opportunities, unless the

relationship between job flows and stocks differs for jobs held by blacks and jobs held by whites, the fact

that we use a stock measure of job availability rather than a flow measure cannot explain the difference in

the impact of job density by race in our estimates. This argument echoes one we make a few times in this

section; although one can think of reasons why the estimated coefficients on job density measures in our

regressions corresponding to pure spatial mismatch may be biased estimates of the effects of the local

availability of jobs, it is far less clear why there is any bias in the estimated differences between the

coefficients of the white and black job density measures.

         Fourth, as noted earlier, the importance of spatial influences on employment outcomes is

predicated on constraints on residential mobility. Most of the empirical work in the spatial mismatch

literature has taken residential location as exogenous, as do we. In tests of pure spatial mismatch, this is a

potentially serious concern, as those with stronger tastes for work or higher market productivity may

choose to locate in areas with more jobs, hence generating a positive association between job density and

employment probabilities.31 However, this factor alone does not explain why there is a much larger

coefficient estimate on black job density than on white job density, as the blacks with stronger tastes for

work should relocate to areas with higher job density irrespective of the racial composition of those jobs.

Rather, our findings could be generated by endogenous residential mobility only if blacks with stronger

tastes for work (or higher productivity) tend to move to areas where there are relatively more jobs

employing blacks. But the results would still imply that these blacks are not, to the same extent, moving


representativeness of the sample with valid place of work.
31
   Aslund et al. (2006) study this question for refugees in Sweden by exploiting a policy that dispersed refugees to
different regions of the country in a way that was arguably random conditional on the observables available to them.
They find positive effects of job density regardless, except for highly-educated groups, but they find considerably
stronger estimates of job density when they study this refugee sample (for employment outcomes in 1999 regressed
on job density measures where they were assigned in 1990-91), compared with a cross-section of the population or
even simply the 1999 cross-section for refugees, who may have moved subsequent to original assignment in 1990-
91. If endogenous sorting is important, this result is surprising, because the endogenous sorting would be expected to
lead to upward bias in the estimated relationship between job density and employment.




                                                         25
to areas where there are relatively more jobs employing non-blacks.32 In that sense, even if blacks with

stronger tastes for work were moving to areas with higher black employment rates, the results would still

demonstrate the importance of the race-specific spatial distribution of jobs, rather than the spatial

distribution of jobs per se.

         Nonetheless, we can also shed some light on whether our results are driven by mobility. In

columns (5) and (6) of Table 7, we break the sample into those who did not change residence in the last 5

years, and those who moved in that period. We find similar results for both subsamples. We cannot

necessarily interpret the results for those who did not move in the last 5 years as representing effects for

individuals who are completely immobile. But this subsample is clearly less mobile, and given that low-

skilled workers are likely to be in relatively high-turnover jobs, it seems reasonable to view residential

location for this sample as predetermined with respect to employment. In general, therefore, our evidence

on the effects of race-specific job density is very robust, and does not appear to suffer from biases that

might generate spurious evidence of racial mismatch.33

         In the final regression estimates we present, we switch to studying how white and non-white job

density affect the employment of white men. These estimates are reported in Table 8, and reveal

qualitatively similar results to what we found for blacks, with white male job density strongly positively

associated with higher employment of whites, and more so for less-educated white workers and for

density measures based on less-educated workers. Indeed the estimated coefficients on the non-white job

density variables are negative, although very small and in some cases insignificant.34 Thus, for whites we

get the same kind of evidence of racial mismatch as we do for blacks, suggesting that the racial

distribution of jobs, and not only the spatial distribution, matters for both whites and blacks. One might,

32
  The same argument would apply if the racial mismatch results are driven by the reverse story, where employers
that employ blacks are attracted to areas where blacks are more likely to be employed. In this case, too, absent the
racial dimension underlying employers’ location decisions, the evidence of racial mismatch would not arise.
33
  We also did many of these robustness checks for the pure spatial mismatch tests in Table 4, and found, similarly,
that the results in that table were very robust.
34
  It is possible that the negative coefficient estimates can be explained by low unobservables related to employment
for whites living in areas of high black job density (conditional on white job density).



                                                          26
however, be more inclined to view the results for whites as driven by networks than by employer

discrimination, although co-worker discrimination on the part of both blacks and whites could also

generate these results.

Quantifying the Importance of Spatial Mismatch

        We first presented evidence from a new approach to testing for spatial mismatch, based on job

density, and found evidence consistent with the predictions of the model, suggesting that black

employment probabilities are lower where job density in their residential area is lower, and that this

relationship is stronger at lower educational levels. We then showed, however, that it is the race-specific

job densities that matter; job density for blacks is much more strongly related to black employment

probabilities than is white job density. What does this evidence imply? At the risk of employing a double

negative, it does not imply that space does not matter. Blacks living in areas of higher black job density

do have higher employment probabilities. But the impact of space has a strong racial dimension, as higher

job density for non-blacks has very weak effects on black employment probabilities.

        Thus, the evidence does not reject spatial mismatch per se, but it rejects what we have termed

“pure spatial mismatch” – that is, that the spatial distribution of jobs, per se, is an important determinant

of black employment, and in particular that a significant determinant of the lower employment of blacks

living in central city areas is the simple lack of nearby jobs. One way to try to make this conclusion more

concrete is to ask what the estimates imply for the importance of pure spatial mismatch for black

employment. In order to gauge the impact of space, per se, on black employment, we use the coefficients

that we estimate in our employment model, but calculate the employment probability that would be

implied if a black man lived where the representative non-black or white lived. We do this calculation for

black and white males, restricting attention to high school dropouts, for whom spatial mismatch (whether

race-specific or not) is most important. Table 9 lays out the steps of this calculation.35

35
  This simulation ignores any general equilibrium effects of many people moving, and is therefore best thought of as
calculating the change in predicted employment if a small number of black males moved to areas in which they faced
the job densities of the representative white male in their MSA. If we do this calculation for the broader low-skill
group with at most a high school education or for black and non-black males, we reach a very similar conclusion to
that described below.

                                                        27
         In Panel A, we report the mean employment rates by race for male high school dropouts. For this

group, the mean employment rate for blacks is 0.459, compared with 0.690 for whites, a gap of 0.231.

Next we report estimates from the simplest model with race-specific job densities. The model is

equivalent to that in the last column of the top panel of Table 5, but using the sample of black male high

school dropouts only. As reported in Panel B, the estimates reflect the same finding as before; the

estimated effect of black job density is more than 10 times that of white job density. Panel C reports the

means of the job density measures for blacks. There are considerably more white male jobs per black

resident than black male jobs per black resident, averaged across blacks. In Panel D, we instead compute

the means of the same job density measures that blacks would face if they lived where the representative

white in their MSA lived.36 Comparing Panels C and D, it is clear that whites on average live in areas

where there are more jobs per black resident, whether held by whites or by blacks, although the difference

is far greater for jobs held by whites.

         Finally, we predict employment probabilities using the estimated employment model from which

the coefficients in Panel B come, but substituting the job density measures in Panel D for those in Panel C

(the latter are the means for blacks, which along with the means of the other variables and their

coefficients yield the mean employment rate for blacks). Because both job density estimates in Panel D

are higher, this obviously results in a higher predicted employment rate for blacks. However, because the

effect on black employment of white job density – which is what would increase most sharply if blacks

lived where whites lived – is so small (0.002), the simulated change in residential location has very little

effect on the predicted probability of employment for blacks. Overall, the new predicted black probability

is only higher than the actual mean by 0.025, which is a small share (10.8 percent) of the race difference

in employment rates for these groups.37 We interpret these results as indicating that space, per se, has

36
  We calculate this by computing the average job densities (on a per black resident basis) for white male high school
dropouts. We then take the mean across whites in the MSA, assign these to each black based on their MSA of
residence, and then average across blacks.
37
   The 0.025 result comes from the combination of two effects that occur when we reallocate blacks to where whites
live: the increase in white job density of 5.883 (7.868 – 1.985) multiplied by 0.002 yields an effect of 0.0118 (or 1.18
percentage points); and the increase in black job density of 0.454 (0.886 − 0.432) yields an effect of 0.0127. If


                                                          28
relatively little to do with lower black employment among those with less education, although the effect is

not zero.

VI. Conclusions

         According to the spatial mismatch hypothesis, the location of jobs coupled with residential

segregation and mobility barriers and costs combine to reduce black employment rates, especially among

those with lower skills. We contrast the spatial mismatch hypothesis with what we term the racial

mismatch hypothesis – or spatial-racial mismatch, to emphasize that space also plays a role, but that race

is central. The racial mismatch hypothesis suggests that the problem is not a lack of jobs, per se, where

blacks live, but a lack of jobs into which blacks are hired, whether because of discrimination, labor

market networks, or neighborhood effects in which race matters. Under the racial mismatch hypothesis, it

is the local availability of jobs for (or held by) members of one’s own race that matters for employment.

         We begin by reporting evidence on the spatial mismatch hypothesis. We take advantage of access

to all Census Long-Form respondents to study the relationship between employment and location-specific

measures of the distribution of jobs, conditional on skill. When we construct direct measures of the

presence of jobs in detailed geographic areas, we find that these job density measures are related to black

employment in ways that would be predicted by spatial mismatch. In particular, black employment is

higher in areas with more jobs per resident. Moreover, this is true primarily for low-skilled jobs and

residents, as the density of jobs for those with less than a high school degree has a stronger effect on black

employment, and the strongest effect for the least-skilled blacks.

         We then move beyond considering pure spatial mismatch to look at racial mismatch, estimating

the effects of job density measures that are disaggregated by race. The findings are quite striking. It is


instead of reallocating blacks, we simply had a way to make the effect of white job density on black employment as
large as the effect of black job density, then black employment would be much higher (by 1.985 multiplied by 0.028
instead of 0.002, or 5.6 percentage points). And of course if we could do both – eliminating the spatial difference by
race, as well as the differential effects of white versus black job density – the effect would be even larger, 0.028
·(5.883+0.454) or 17.7 percentage points. However, note that it is not clear that, in the absence of the factors that
generate different effects of black and white job density on black employment, the coefficient on white job density
would be the one that would prevail. Instead, some number between 0.002 and 0.028 might be more likely. This
issue has parallels to the question, in studies of wage discrimination, of what the wage structure would look like if
there were no discrimination (Neumark, 1988). Here, though, it is likely even more complicated because


                                                          29
primarily black job density that influences black employment, whereas white (or non-black) job density

has little if any influence on the employment of blacks. Moreover, we find similar patterns with respect to

differences in effects associated with schooling; black job density at lower education levels has a stronger

effect on employment of blacks, and in particular for those blacks with less education.

        This evidence does not repudiate the importance of the spatial distribution of jobs. What it

suggests, however, is that race plays a key role, and that the availability of jobs locally is not enough to

markedly impact black employment rates. Pure spatial mismatch is not an important component of lower

black employment rates. Instead the spatial distribution of jobs available to blacks – or racial mismatch –

appears to be much more important.

        This evidence has potentially significant implications for policies designed to counter what has

been interpreted as pure spatial mismatch. Specifically, concerns over spatial mismatch have helped

motivate policy interventions such as “Moving to Opportunity” (Katz et al., 2001), “Wheels to Work” and

other programs to increase access of low-income workers to cars (Goldberg, 2001), and enterprise zones

(Peters and Fisher, 2002). Interestingly, many evaluations of these programs suggest that they are

relatively ineffective at increasing black employment. This is entirely consistent with the results we find

here, where simply living near jobs, even at one’s skill level, does little to boost black employment unless

those jobs are available (or tend to be held by) blacks. Indeed, a simple simulation shows that moving

blacks so that they faced the race-specific job densities of the representative white in their MSA (with the

same skill level) would do relatively little to increase black employment, because the main effect of such

a move would be to expose them to higher white (or non-black) job density, which our estimates indicate

does little to increase black employment.

        Our results demonstrate that formal descriptions and empirical tests of the process by which the

spatial distribution of jobs matters for black employment must take seriously the modeling of the

mechanism(s) by which race matters. We previously mentioned some obvious mechanisms for which

there is already some empirical support – discrimination, labor market networks, and neighborhood


discrimination may not be the only source of racial mismatch.

                                                        30
effects – but there may be others as well. It remains an important task for future research to try to

disentangle the separate impacts of these mechanisms in explaining why more jobs held by whites or non-

blacks in a local area has little effect on black employment rates. A better understanding of these factors

can facilitate the choices among and the design of policies to increase black employment, especially

among the less skilled.

There are 533,198 observations on black men, and 4,030,425 on white men, using the sample
construction rules in Table 1. Standard deviations (SD) of continuous variables are reported in
parentheses in Panels B through D. All estimates are weighted to account for differences in the
probability of having valid place of work data. “LTHS” refers to those without a high school
diploma, “HSD” represents high school graduates, and “SCOL” refers to those with at least some
college education, including college graduates.

There are 533,198 observations on blacks. Regression estimates are from linear probability models, with standard errors in parentheses. All specifications
include controls for age (linear and quadratic terms), marital status (a dummy variable for currently married), highest education (six categories including
less than high school, high school degree, some college, Associate’s degree, Bachelor’s degree, and advanced degree), residence in the central city, non-
central city, and suburban residence, and MSA fixed effects. All estimates are weighted to account for differences in the probability of having valid place
of work data. All standard errors are robust to non-independence of observations within zip code areas heteroscedasticity. See also notes to Table 2.

The density measures in this table are always defined in terms of male non-black jobs or
male black jobs per black male resident, for those with less than a high school degree. In
column (2), observations having either a non-black male job density or black male job
density in the top percentile are excluded. In column (4), only those observations living in
zip codes which have black male residents having less than a high school degree are
included in the sample. In columns (2) and (3), standard errors are clustered at the MSA
level. See note to Tables 2 and 4 for other details.

 densities of average white male in MSA (substituting job densities from
 Panel D into employment model)
Specification is the same as in top panel of Table 5, including only high school dropouts in the
sample. The sample size is 129,348. The estimates in Panel D come from computing the average
job densities (on a per black resident basis) for white male high school dropouts, taking the mean
across whites in the MSA, assigning these to each black based on their MSA of residence, and
then averaging across blacks.
