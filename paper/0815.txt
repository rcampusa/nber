                    COMPLIANCE WITH THE OVERTIME PAY
               PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT


                               Abstract


     Our paper presents a methodology that can be used to estimate the

extent of noncompliance with the overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor

Standards Act (FLSA). The methodology is applied to data from the May

1978 Current Population Survey and the 1977 Michigan Quality of Employment

Survey. These data suggest that the fraction of covered workers working

overtime who fail to receive a premium of at least time and a half, as

called for by the legislation, is in the range of 25 percent. They also

suggest that the extent of noncompliance is greater in those industries in

which size class exemptions to the legislation exist (retail trade and

selected service industries). Finally, probit analyses of the determinants

of noncompliance suggest that decisions about whether to comply with the

overtime provisions of the FLSA are at least partially based on the associated

benefits and costs.

I.   Introduction

     Proposals have been periodically introduced into Congress to raise the

overtime pay premium required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) from

time and a half to double time in the hope that by making overtime hours

more expensive, employers would be induced to reduce their usage of overtime

and to increase their employment levels. That is, increasing the overtime

premium is thought by some to be a way to stimulate employment growth and to
                       1
reduce unemployment.

     If the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA are not fully complied

with, the potential employment gain associated with any increase in the

overtime premium will be reduced. Furthermore, since an increase in the

overtime premium would increase the amount employers save by not complying

with the legislation, such an increase might lead to a decrease in the

compliance rate. This would further moderate the actual dec).ine in over—

time hours and the potential positive employment effects resulting from an

increase in the overtime premium.

     A number of data sources provide some information on compliance with

overtime legislation. An early U.S. Department of Labor compliance survey

indicated that 30 percent of the establishments in which overtime was worked

were in violation of the overtime provisions of the FLSA and 5.9 percent of

the employees working overtime were not paid in accordance with the overtime

provisions (U.S. Department of Labor (1965)). More recently, Labor Depart-

ment investigations in FY 1977 of complaints of violations under the FLSA

found a greater dollar volume of violations of the overtime pay provisions

than they did of the minimum wage provisions.2 Finally, data from the annual

May supplements to the Current Population Surveys indicate that over the 1973

to 1978 period, less than 43 percent of full—time wage and salary workers who
                                                                         3
worked 41 or more hours a week at one job reported receiving premium pay.
                                                                       2




     Of course, many of the individuals who work long workweeks may work

in noncovered employment where payment of an overtime premium is not

required; only 58 percent of all wage and salary workers were covered by

the overtime provisions of the FLSA in l978. Since one may reasonably

conjecture that noncovered workers are more likely to work overtime, as

their marginal costs of overtime hours are lower than those of otherwise

identical covered workers, the data from the CPS cited above should be con-

sidered only suggestive and probably overstate the extent of noncompliance.

Our objective in the next section is to more carefully analyze the May 1978

CPS and also the 1977 Michigan Quality of Employment Survey data to obtain

estimates of the extent of noncompliance with the overtime pay provisions,

focusing on workers who can be identified with certainty as being covered

by and subject to the overtime provisions of the FLSA.

    Knowledge of the correlates of noncompliance may well be as important

to policymakers as knowledge of the rate of noncompliance. While informa-

tion on the latter may lead them to push for an increase in the resources

devoted to enforcing compliance and/or for increases in the penalties for

noncompliance, knowledge of the former is useful in deciding how the limited

resources that the government has to assure compliance should be allocated.

With this in mind, in Section III we describe our attempts to build and

estimate a model of the determinants of noncompliance with the overtime pay

provisions of the FLSA and discuss the conclusions that can be drawn from

these efforts.5

    Our analyses in Sections II and III deal only with individuals who we

can identify as being subject to the overtime pay provisions with certainty.
                                                                        3



However, for individuals employed in retail, trade and selected service indus-

tries, coverage under the FLSA is partially based upon whether the employer's

annual sales exceed a critical value and, at least in the CPS data, such infor—

ination is unavailable. One might speculate that noncompliance will be higher

among employees subject to the overtime provisions in these industries than

it will be elsewhere as both employees' knowledge of their rights to receive

overtime premiums of time and a half and employers' knowledge of their obli-

gations to pay such premiums may be lower in these industries, especially in

establishments whose sales just exceed the critical value. To test this con—

jecture one must develop a method to estimate the extent of noncompliance in

industries in which such size class exemptions exist, when data on the size

of establishment in which each individual is employed is unavailable;

this is done in Section IV.6 Finally, we briefly summarize the conclusions

that can be drawn from our efforts.



II. New Estimates of Noncompliance

     The May 1978 Current Population Survey contained data on 11,738 indi-

viduals who reported that they worked 41 or more hours during the survey

week for a single employer. It would be incorrect, however, to focus on

this entire sample when discussing compliance with the overtime pay provi-

sions since there are numerous individuals who are not subject to the pro-

visions. These include, but are not restricted to, supervisory employees,

outside salespersons, employees in seasonal industries (including agriculture),

state and local government employees, employees in small retail trade and

service sector establishments, and some household workers.

     Fortunately, it is possible to sort each individual who worked overtime

into one of three groups; those who we believe are "definitely" subject to the
                                                                     4



overtime pay provisions, those who we believe are subject to the provisions

with a known probability, and those who are either not subject to the pro-

visions or for whom coverage probabilities can not be determined. The

assignment is based upon an algorithm which makes use of knowledge of the

various exemptions to the overtime provisions of the FLSA, whether each

individual was paid by the hour, and of the detailed three—digit census

industry and occupation categories in which each individual is employed.

In the case of individuals employed in retail trade and selected service

industries, where coverage under the overtime provisions was based upon

whether the establishment's sales exceeded $250,000 per year in 1978, each

individual was assigned a probability of coverage equal to the fraction of

employees in the three—digit industry who worked in establishments with

sales of greater than $250,000 in l977. The latter information came from

published volumes of the 1977 Census of Retail Trade and the 1977 Census of

Selected Service Industries, as well as from unpublished tabulations that

were specially prepared for us by the Census.

     Details of the algorithm used to assign individuals to the three groups

are contained in an appendix that is available from us. The procedure

resulted in our classifying 3,231 individuals as being definitely subject to

the overtime pay provisions and 535 individuals as being subject to the

provisions with known probability. It is these two groups, which represent

32 percent of the individuals who reported working overtime, that we focus

our attention on in the paper. This section and the next consider the

"certain coverage" group, while Section IV considers the "known probability

of coverage" or "partial coverage" group.
                                                                         5



     Individuals in the CPS sample reported whether they received any premium

pay for overtime hours in excess of 40 per week, not what their overtime pay

premium was. While it is possible to construct an estimate of the overtime

pay premium for a subset of individuals in the sample, this estimate is sub-

ject to considerable error. Because of this, we define noncompliance in

the CPS data as failure to receive       premium pay for hours of work greater

than 40 hours per week. Since receipt of a premium of less than time and a

half represents noncompliance also, such a definition clearly understates the

extent of noncompliance.0

     In Table 1 we focus on the individuals who we believe are definitely

subject to the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA and, weighing each obser-

vation by its sample weight, compute an estimate of noncompliance;

this is found in column (1). Defining noncompliance as failure to receive

any premium pay for overtime, we find (row 1) that 9.6 percent of the indi-

viduals in the sample fell in this category. This number is higher than the

estimates of noncompliance obtained in the 1965 BLS compliance survey.

     A second source of data on noncompliance is the 1977 Michigan Quality of

Employment Suryçy (f). The       is   a sample of over 1500 employed adults and

the premium received for overtime work was explicitly reported for those in the

sample who worked overtime. Unfortunately, most adults in the survey failed

to work overtime and, after applying our algorithm to isolate those individuals

who were subject to the legislation with certainty (including the restriction

that they were paid on an hourly basis), we wound up with a sample of only 69

individuals. Of these individuals, however, almost 16 percent failed to receive

a premium of time and a half (column 3).

    Although this estimate is quite precise, one should not place too much

faith in its specific value because the sample may not be representative due
                                                                        6




to its small size. Nevertheless, it does suggest that the actual noncom-

pliance rate in the "complete coverage" sector is probably fairly close to

the lower bound estimate of 9.6 that we obtained with the CPS data. We

should reemphasize that the former figure refers to the fraction of those

individuals working overtime, who failed to receive any premium; it does

not include those individuals who received overtime pay premiums of less

than time and a half. To the extent that there are any individuals in

this latter group, the actual noncompliance rate will be above 9.6 percent.9



III. The Determinants of Noncompliance

     What are the factors that influence the probability that an individual

who is working overtime and subject to the overtime pay provisions of the

FLSA will be observed not being paid a premium of at least time and a half,

as the FLSA calls for? An economic model of noncompliance should start from

the proposition that an efficient solution requires that noncompliance will

be observed only when the sum of the net benefits (benefits minus costs) to

an employer and his employees from noncompliance exceeds zero)° That is,

the gains and losses from noncompliance faced by both parties in the employ—

inent relationship must be evaluated.

     From the perspective of the employer, the benefits from noncompliance

are the savings that accrue from his failing to pay workers working overtime

a premium of at least time—and—a—half. The cost to the employer of noncom-

pliance include the costs of any increased employee turnover that may result

from failure to pay legally required premium payments. These costs are

likely to be higher for skilled workers than they are for unskilled workers

and for workers that the employer expects (wants) to have long job tenure

with the firm, than they are for workers with short expected job tenure.
                                                                        7




     The costs of noncompliance also include any costs that would result

if an employer is caught violating the overtime pay provisions, these costs

are determined both by the probability of being caught if a violation occurs

and the expected penalty once a violation is identified. The resources

available to the Employment Standards Administration to enforce the provisions

of the FLSA are minimal and only rarely does the agency institute investigations

on its own.11 More typically, investigations result from alleged viola-

tions being reported by employees who feel that they have not been paid

in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This suggests that the

costs of noncompliance that an employer perceives he faces will increase

as his perception that an employee will report a violation increases.12 It

also increases with his perception that such a report will be investigated.

     Finally, the costs an employer perceives are associated with noncom-

pliance depend upon the expected penalty once a violation is judged to occur.

Since the penalty for first—time violators who do not falsify their records

involves only back payment of the premium pay that is owed to workers

(without interest) and the typical settlement involves repayment of substan-

tially less than 100 percent of the funds that are owed, the incentives for

firms to comply with the legislation are not very high.13    It should not

be surprising then, that we obtained a lower bound estimate of noncompliance

of roughly 10 percent in the "completely covered sector". Indeed, the fact

that the noncompliance rate is not substantially higher suggests that while

calculations of the benefits and costs from noncompliance influence employers'

decisions, they are not the sole determinants. Other factors, such as the

desire not to violate government legislation, clearly are important.
                                                                      8




     From the perspective of employees, the costs of noncompliance include

the loss of premium pay they would suffer if the employer failed to pay them

an overtime premium of at least time—and—a—half, as called for by the legis-

lation. The benefits include the possibility that a lower "price" for over-

time hours would induce an employer to expand his usage of overtime hours.

If an employer's demand for overtime hours is elastic with respect to the

overtime wage rate, an employee's total labor earnings would be higher if

the employer fails to comply with the legislation. In this case noncom-

pliance would yield net benefits to the employee if the increased earnings

are sufficient to compensate him for his reduction in leisure hours. Of

course, employees also have preferences with respect to the avoidance of

violations of government legislation that must be taken into account in

the analysis.

     To make the discussion a bit more formal, suppose that the net economic

benefits that an employer perceives from noncompliance (BE) and the net

economic benefits that employees perceive from noncompliance (Bw) can both

be expressed as linear functions of a vector of explanatory variables (Z).

Let c represent the net effect of the sum of employer and employee pre-

ferences or tastes for complying with government legislation. Then we can

write

                                                                        —
             is an unobservable continuous variable that represents the sum

of the net economic and noneconomic benefits that individual i, who is
observed working overtime, and     his or her employer would receive from not

complying with the legislation. The          and      represent vectors of

regression coefficients that indicate the marginal effects of the explana—

tory variables on the net benefits that the employer and the employee,

respectively, receive from noncompliance. Since some variables will affect

either the employer's net benefits or the employee's net benefits, but not

both, some of the coefficients in the vectors aE       and      will be zero.

Put another way, the variables that affect BE and Bw may well differ.
                  *
    Although Si is unobservable, we can arbitrarily scale its cut—off

value so that when the sum of the net benefits from noncompliance is greater

than zero (S > 0), we observe an individual who is working overtime not

receiving a premium that is in compliance with the legislation (S. =     1).
Conversely, if the    index   is less than or equal to zero (S < 0), the

individual will be observed receiving a premium in compliance with the

legislation (S. =     0).   If we further assume that the c. can be treated

as a normally distributed random variable that is uncorrelated with the Z,

equation (1) represents a probit model of the determinants of noncompliance

with the overtime premium that can be estimated by standard methods.

    Our data on noncompliance is for individuals and it is natural to ask

what variables might enter into Z and influence the probability that a

worker working overtime, who is subject to the overtime provisions of the

FLSA, does not receive premium pay in compliance with the legislation. A

group of variables that are likely candidates are available in either the

CPS or        samples or can be constructed from other sources and we discuss

each in turn.
                                                                       10



     The noncompliance rate is expected to first decline, and then to increase

with age. Teenagers have high expected turnover rates; this makes it unlikely

that employers will heavily invest in their training and thus that any increase

in their turnover rates induced by noncompliance would be costly to the

firm. As new entrants, teenagers are also less likely to be aware of the

overtime provisions of the FLSA and this, along with their high turnover

rates and short tenures makes it unlikely that they would report any viola-

tion and ask for a compliance investigation. As such, the noncompliance rate

will likely be high for teens.

     Now, as individuals age and develop "permanentt' attachment to firms,

they accumulate both considerable "firm—specific" knowledge and knowledge of

the FLSA's provisions. Noncompliance with the overtime provisions for these

individuals will be costly for the firm; it would be costly to replace them

if they quit and the probability that a FLSA violation will be reported by

them is high. However, after some point in time workers become "locked in",

their earnings with their current employer exceeds their earnings potential

elsewhere due to the firm—specific knowledge they have accumulated. This

reduces the probability that they will quit in response to noncompliance,

which reduces the costs of noncompliance that employers face. These argu-

ments suggest that the noncompliance rate should first decline and then

increase with age.

     Turning next to the role of an employee's sex, there are two conflicting

forces at work. On the one hand, females have historically had higher turn-

over rates and lower expected tenure than males, and thus received less firm—

specific training. This implies that any noncompliance—induced quits by

them would be less costly to firms than quits by males; as a result noncom-

pliance rates for females might be expected to be higher than those for males.
                                                                        11



On the other hand, in a world of growing litigation, employers may be con-

cerned that failure to pay females the legally required premiums would lead

to the possibility of sex discrimination suits; women may be more likely to

report noncompliance for this reason (see footnote 12) and this should reduce

the noncompliance rate for females. The net effect of these two forces is

indeterminate.

     Discrimination against nonwhites or hispanics may manifest itself in

higher noncompliance probabilities for individuals from these groups. The

fact that some hispanics are not fluent in English and thus may not be fully

aware of the legislation reenforces this effect, as does the possibility that

some may be undocumented workers who would be unlikely to complain to

authorities about violations of the FLSA.    Of course, fear of litigation,

or government compliance activities that are targetted at nonwhites, might

reduce the noncompliance rates for that group.

     Highly skilled individuals are likely both to be costly for firms to

replace if they quit and also to be fully aware of their legal rights. As

such, higher education levels should be associated with lower noncompliance

rates, other things equal. Individuals earning high wage rates, other things

equal, are likely to also have the same characteristics. However, here the

firm also has an incentive not to comply, other things equal, since as an

individual's wage rate increases the benefits (premium savings) from noncom-

pliance also increase. On balance, one might expect that the former effect

dominates and that compliance will increase as employees' wage rates
         14
increase.

     Noncompliance is also expected to be lower in unionized environments

than in nonunion environments. One important role that unions play is to
                                                                        12




monitor employeest working conditions to assure that both collectively bar-

gained and legally required conditions of employment are satisfied. Not

only do unions call violations of legally required conditions to the atten-

tion of employers, they also are less reluctant than individual employees——

since they fear retribution less——to call these violations to the attention

of enforcement agencies.

     The CPS and QES data both contain information on the industry in which

each individual is employed. Other things equal, one should expect that

noncompliance rates will be lower in highly concentrated industries for two

reasons. First firms in concentrated industries, that face relatively

inelastic product demand curves, can increase their product prices when

faced with having to pay an overtime premium, without fear of losing all of

their sales; this reduces the benefits to noncompliance. In contrast, a

firm in a highly competitive industry has little control over product price

and, faced with the legal requirement to pay an overtime premium, may

achieve greater benefits from noncompliance.

     Second, from the Hicks—Marshall laws of derived demand, we know that

because the price elasticities of demand faced by firms in competitive

industries are higher than those faced by other firms, ceteris paribus,

the wage elasticities of labor demand faced by firms in competitive indus-

tries will be higher than those faced by firms in other industries. Non-

compliance would thus likely lead to a greater expansion in the usage of

overtime hours in these industries than elsewhere. Because of this, the

net benefits to employees from noncompliance would be higher in competitive

industries; this should further increase the probability of observing non-

compliance in competitive industries.
                                                                            13



        Finally, we also expect that noncompliance would be lower in areas

in which greater resources are devoted by the    government to assuring com-
pliance with the FLSA, since the probability of violations being caught.

should be higher in such areas)5 The Employment Standards Administration

(ESA) provided us with data on the total number of FLSA compliance actions

undertaken and the total FLSA compliance budget for each of the 90 local

ESA area offices in 1978. From these data we were able to aggregate up to

state totals and merge into each CPS individual's record, data on these two

measures of compliance activity, each deflated by the number of private and

federal nonsupervisory workers in the state, to approximate compliance

activity per worker subject to the legislation.16

        How well are these hypotheses borne out by the data? Table 2 presents

estimates of probit models of the determinants of noncompliance for the

samples of workers who are subject to the overtime pay provisions of the

FLSA with certainty in both the 1978 May CPS and 1977 QES. Noncompliance

is defined in the former survey to be failure to receive any premium for

overtime hours worked in excess of 40 per week, while in the latter survey

it is defined to be failure to receive a premium of at least time and a

half.      One should remember that the sample size in the latter case is

extremely small (69) and thus it is unlikely that one will observe statistic-

ally significant relationships in that data. Nevertheless, since empirical

regularities are less subject to challenge when they are replicated in dif-

ferent data bases, we present both sets of estimates.

        The dependent variable in each case is the probit transformation of a

dichotomous variable that takes on the value of one if the individual failed
                                                                        14




to receive a premium in compliance with the legislation (as defined above)

and zero otherwise.'7 The explanatory variables in the case of the CPS

data include those described above, as well as several other control

variables. In both data sets, a set of (0,1) variables are included to

capture the effect of the major (1—digit) industry group in which the

individual is employed. Only a subset of the other explanatory variables

were available in the QES. In particular, since state of residence was

not reported in this survey, resources devoted to compliance activities

in the state could not be included in the analyses.

     Quite strikingly, a number of our hypotheses are borne out. Further-

more, none of the coefficients that are statistically significant are

opposite in sign to what we would expect. For example, both data bases

indicate quite clearly that noncompliance rates are significantly lower in

firms in which unions are present than they are in nonunion firms. Similarly,

the probability of noncompliance is significantly lower in heavily concen-

trated industries, such as manufacturing and public utilities, than it is in

less concentrated industries such as mining, construction, wholesale trade,

and finance, insurance and real estate. Finally, in accord with our expecta-

tions, the probability of noncompliance is significantly negatively related

to an individual's earnings level in the CPS data.

     Other results are supportive of our model, although less clear cut. An

increase in the level of government resources devoted to compliance activities

in a state does appear to reduce the probability of noncompliance, however,

this variable is statistically insignificant. The probability of noncompliance

is significantly higher for nonwhites than whites in the QES data, suggesting

that discrimination is present and that this effect dominantes over any

effect of government enforcement activity. Noncompliance is also seen to

increase with age. Results not reported here suggest this relationship
                                                                         15




occurs primarily for older workers; other things equal, the probability of

noncompliance appears to be some 4 to 6 percent higher for workers older

than age 55 than for all other workers. As we hypothesized earlier, to the

extent that mobility of older workers is limited, older workers may be less

likely to institute complaints about nonreceipt of premium pay. Contrary

to our prior expectations, however, alternative specifications provided no

evidence that noncompliance rates were also higher for teenagers.18

     Taken together, these results provide support for the view that

sonic employers and their employees, at least implicitly, do make con-

scious decisions about whether to comply with the overtime provisions of the

FLSA; decisions that involve a weighting of the benefits and the costs that

both parties incur by such an action. While this might suggest to some that

an increase in the overtime premium, which increased the benefits employers

receive from not complying with the legislation would lead to an increased

noncompliance rate, we should remind the reader that such an increase also

increases employees' economic incentives to report noncompliance. The

increased threat of such actions on their part may induce employers to

reduce noncompliance. Thus, one can not predict in advance what the effect

of an increase in the overtime premium on noncompliance would be from our

results.




IV. Noncompliance in the "Partial Coverage" Sector

     The analyses in the previous two sections were conducted on a subsample

of individuals who we believe with certainty, were subject to the overtime

pay provisions of the FLSA. We turn now to the subsample of individuals
                                                                                16




whom can only be assigned a known probability of being subject to the pro-

visions. In this case, estimates of noncompliance can not be obtained by

looking at the proportion of individuals working overtime in the group who

fail to receive a premium of time and a half (or any premium if our conserva—

tive definition of noncompliance is being used). Rather, a more indirect

method must be used.

       Let C. denote the proportion of workers subject to the overtime pro-

visions of the FLSA in industry i. We assume that this is equal to the

proportion of individuals in each of the retail trade and service industries

who are employed in establishments with annual sales of at least $250,000 in

1977. Let        equal the probability that a worker subject to the overtime

provisions who works overtime in industry i does not receive a premium in

compliance with the legislation andP. the comparable probability for workers

not subject to the legislation. P is in fact the noncompliance rate, the

variable which we seek to estimate. It is straightforward to see the proba-

bility that an individual working overtime in industry i is not getting paid

a premium in compliance with the legislation                    is given by'9



       (2)     PiA =   P    C.

                                                   = P.
                                                      in   + (P. — P. )C.
                                                               iC   in i


This   is nothing more than a weighted average of the "noncompliance rates"

of the workers who are subject to and not subject to the legislation, with

the weights being the proportion of workers subject to and not subject to

the legislation. Of course, for workers not subject to the legislation,

the term noncompliance does not denote any violation of law; it simply

reflects failure to receive the premium called for by the law in the covered

sector.
                                                                                                  17



        Now suppose, for a moment, that P. and P. were constant across mdi—
                                                             iC      in
viduals and industries. That is, the probability that a worker working

overtime who was subject to (not subject to) the overtime pay provisions of

the FLSA failed to receive a premium in accordance with the legislation, did

not vary with either characteristics of the individual or the industry. In

this case, equation (3) can be written



          (3)          p.iA   = P       +(P —   P )C.
                                    n     C     n 1


where P and P are the                    constant noncompliance rates of workers subject
to,   and not subject to, the legislation respectively.

          In this situation, it should be clear that if one estimates, for the

sample of individuals working overtime, the simple linear probability

function model



          (4)          d..a
                        ii  0 +aC.

where d.. takes on the value of one if individual j                           in   industry i is not
            13

paid a premium in accordance with the legislation, and the value of zero
if   he    is paid a premium, that one can estimate the noncompliance rate for
                                                        20
workers subject to the legislation.                           Specifically,

where            and      are the estimated values of a0 and a1.

      Of course, it is not likely that P1 and P1 are constant across mdi—

viduals and/or industries. The simplest modification is to assume that the
                                                                                              18




probability of "noncompliance" varies in both sectors with the vector of

variables Z that we discussed in the previous section. Suppose that the

probabilities that individual j, who is employed in industry i, does

not receive a premium in compliance with the overtime provisions are given,

in the two sectors, by



      (6)     P..

      Substitution of (6) and (7) into (2) then yields, after manipulation

that the probability that an individual with characteristics Z. in industry i

who is working overtime fails to receive a premium in compliance with the

legislation I'A is given by

      Hence, if one estimates the linear probability function model

the average noncompliance rate for workers subject to the overtime pay pro-
visions of the FLSA in these industries can be obtained from

where Z   is   the mean value of Z for individuals in the sample who are subject

to the legislation.

     Table 3 presents our estimates of the proportion of employees subject

to the overtime provisions of the FLSA (C.) in May 1978 for 36 Census three—
                                               23
digit retail trade and service industries.          The proportion varied con-

siderably across industries, ranging from 1.00 for department stores to only

.04 for barber shops. There were 535 individuals in the May 1978 CPS sample

who worked at least 41 hours during the survey week, reported that they were

paid by the hour, were not exempt from the overtime provisions for other

reasons, and were employed in one of these industries. These individuals

form our "partial coverage sample".

     Estimates of equations (4) and ( 9   )   are   found in Table 4 and the implied

estimates of noncompliance with the overtime pay provisions one obtains from

these results, using equations (5) and (10), are found in Table 5.       In each

case, noncompliance is defined as failure to receive           overtime pay premium;

the estimates therefore likely understate the true noncompliance rate.

     The estimates in Table 5 strongly suggest that noncompliance is higher

for workers subject to the overtime provisions in the "partially covered"

sector than it is for workers in the "complete coverage" sector, as we earlier

hypothesized. For example, if we use the simplest model which assumes that

the probability of noncompliance does not vary with individual or industry

characteristics, we estimate that 20.2 percent of individuals working over-

time who are subject to the overtime pay provisions in the partially covered

sector failed to receive any premium pay for overtime. When we generalize

the model to allow noncompliance to vary with characteristics of the individual,

the noncompliance rate, evaluated at the mean values of the characteristics,
                                                                     20




rises to 24.5 percent. These estimates are substantially higher than the 9.6

percent estimate for noncompliance that we observed in the complete coverage

CPS sample.

     We can also compute estimates of the proportion of individuals in the

sample who are not subject to the overtime pay provisions and who did not

receive any overtime pay premium for overtime hours. These estimated

"noncompliance rates" have no normative significance, as these workers are

not legally required to receive a premium. Nonetheless, it is interesting

to note that they are considerably larger than the noncompliance rates for

workers in these industries who are subject to the legislation. Indeed, our

estimates of "noncompliance" for these non—subject workers is 64.2 percent

when the probability of receiving a premium is assumed not to vary with indi-

viduals' characteristics and 48.5 percent when it is assumed to vary.

     One might be tempted to conclude from these estimates, that a reasonable

estimate of the effect of the FLSA on the probability that workers in these

industries who are subject to the overtime provisions are paid a premium is

the difference between the proportions receiving premium pay in both sectors.

Our estimates would imply then that the FLSA has increased the probability

that a worker receives premium pay for overtime by between 24 (48.5—24.5)

and 44 (64.2—20.2) percentage points.

      Such a conclusion would be incorrect, however, for at least two reasons.

First, the presence of a covered sector may well affect the probability

that establishments in the noncovered sector pay an overtime premium.24

Thus, estimates of the difference between "noncompliance" rates in the covered

and noncovered sectors tells us little about the effect of the legislation on

 the probability that workers subject to the legislation are paid a premium.
                                                                      21




Second, independent of the   above problem, there is no reason to presume that
the probability that noncovered (small) establishments pay a premium is an

accurate estimate of the probability that covered (larger) establishments

would pay an overtime premium, in the absence of the legislation. Our esti-

mates simply can not be used to infer anything about the quantitative effect

of the FLSA on the proportion of workers receiving premium pay for overtime

in this sector.

     Finally, one can recover estimates of the marginal effects of the

various explanatory variables on the noncompliance rate for workers subject

to the overtime pay provisions in this sample from



     (11)           =
                        (e1 + e3)


These estimates are presented in Table 6 for a number of the explanatory

variables; their expected signs are summarized in the first column. Although

most of these effects prove not to be statistically significantly different

from zero, perhaps because of the smaller sample sizes in the "partially

covered" sample, it is gratifying to observe that the pattern of effects is

quite similar to that which we observed in the "complete coverage" CPS sample.

In particular the noncompliance rate in this sector is higher for males than

females and for nonwhites than whites, is lower for union members than non-

union members, and declines with an individual's earnings and education level

and with the level of resources that the government devotes to compliance

activity. Each of these relationships was also observed in the "complete

coverage sample".
                                                                         22




V.   Concluding Remarks

     The evidence presented in this paper strongly suggests that noncompliance

with the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA is a nontrivial problem.         Our

analyses of the May 1978 CPS data indicated that at least 9.6 percent of

individuals who worked more than 41 hours in the survey week and who we

believe were subject to the FLSA's overtime provisions with certainty failed

to receive       premium pay for overtime hours. Moreover, from our analyses

of the "partial coverage" CPS sample, we inferred that over 20 percent of

the people   working overtime Who were   subject to the overtime pay provisions

in those industries in which size class exemptions existed, failed to

receive any premium. Finally, our analyses of the 1977 Michigan QES data

indicated that almost 16 percent of the individuals who worked overtime

and who we believe with certainty were covered by the overtime provisions

failed to receive a premium of time and a half. Together these analyses

strongly suggest that 10 percent would be a highly conservative estimate

of the noncompliance rate with the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA.

Such a noncompliance rate would substantially moderate the positive employ—

inent effects generated by any future increase in the overtime premium.

     Our analyses also provide some support for the view that

decisions about whether to comply with the overtime pay provisions of the

FLSA are at least partially based on the benefits and costs that

are associated with noncompliance. To the extent that increasing the over—

time premium would increase the benefits employers perceive from noncompliance,

this might lead to an increase in noncompliance. If this occurs, the employ—

inent effects of an increase in the   premium would be further moderated. Of
                                                                     23




course, an increase in the overtime premium would also increase employees'

economic incentives to report noncompliance to enforcement authorities. The

increased threat of such actions on their part might induce employers to

reduce noncompliance. Thus, our results unfortunately do not permit us to

predict what the effect of an increase in the overtime premium on noncompliance

would be.

generalize the work of Orley Ashenfelter and Robert S. Smith (1979).

     6. Ashenfelter and Smith confined their attention to the sector in

which coverage could be determined with certainty.

     7. The establishment sales size test rose to $275,000 on July 1, 1978

and has increased still further since then. However, since the CPS data is

for May 1978, the $250,000 figure is the correct one to use.

     8. Two problems should be noted with this definition. First, it ignores

the possibility that the existence of the overtime pay premium may have caused

some employers, who otherwise would have worked their workforces overtime,

to avoid the use of overtime. Such employers would be complying with the

legislation, but individuals employed in these firms would not be included

in our sample. Although we return to this point in the next section, when

we attempt to estimate whether government resources devoted to increasing

compliance reduce the probability that an individual will work overtime, it

should be understood that noncompliance is defined in this section to be

conditional on individuals working overtime.
                                                                     26




    Second, there may be some measurement error in the reporting of hours

of work. Some individuals who reported that they worked more than 40 hours

per week and failed to receive an overtime premium may actually have worked

40 hours or less; inclusion of these individuals in our sample would cause

us to overstate the noncompliance rate. In contrast, some individuals who

reported that they worked 40 hours or less and failed to receive a premium

may actually have worked more than 40 hours; exclusion of these individuals

from our sample would cause us to understate the extent of noncompliance.

While one would hope that these two sources of bias just offset each other,

we have no strong reason to believe that this will (or will not) be the case.

     9. One additional set of results warrant being briefly reported here.

Analyses reported in the next section suggest that the noncompliance rate

was higher in the federal sector than in the private sector. Some people

may find it inconceivable that federal government agencies would fail to

comply uniformly with federal legislation. While we do not necessarily

agree with this view, it is instructive to note that when the analyses are

redone excluding federal workers (column 2), the results change only mar-

ginally. For evidence of federal government agencies' noncompliance in

another area, see George Borjas (1978).

     10.   We are grateful to a referee for stressing the importance of this

point to us. For example, it might be the case that the benefits from non-

compliance exceed the costs as far as the firm is concerned, but the costs

to workers of not receiving premium pay far exceeds the net benefits to the

firm. In this, noncompliance might not arise (even though it is in the

firm's best interest not to comply) because employees could potentially

offer to pay the firm to comply with the legislation (perhaps by taking a
                                                                       27




straight—time wage cut or agreeing to smaller wage increases) a sum equal

to the firm's net benefits from noncompliance. Such an arrangement would

eliminate the firm's gain from noncompliance and would leave the workers

better off than they would have been if the firm had failed to comply with

the legislation. Of course, workers can first attempt to reduce the firm's

net benefit from noncompliance in other ways (see footnote 12) before

resorting to such implicit monetary payments.

     11. See Ashenfelter and Smith (1979) for background data on these

points.

     12. Employees, of course, must make their on calculations of the

benefits and costs to them of reporting noncompliance. While the obvious

benefits include the possibility of receiving premium pay for future over-

time and back pay to compensate them for their failure to receive overtime

premium pay in the past, the costs include the possibility that the

employer will use less overtime in the future and/or that he might attempt

to retaliate against the "informers" (if he can identify them) by denying

them wage increases or promotion opportunities or by laying them off or

firing them for cause.

     13. For example, in fiscal year 1977, Labor Department investigations

discovered $88 million of overtime pay premium violations but only $33

million of this total was repaid to workers. See U.S. Department of Labor

(1978), p. 21.

     14.   Put   another way, in structured internal labor markets in which

high wage employees have implicit or explicit long—term contracts, noncom-

pliance, if known, might lead to a reduced supply of new applicants. This

would bid UI) the straight time wage the firm would have to offer, offsetting

any benefits from noncompliance.
                                                                           28




      15.   The previous   hypothesized effects, save for race, assume that

government resources devoted to compliance activity are randomly distributed.

However, if the government was trying to maximize the effectiveness of its

compliance activities, it would assign them in such a way as to maximize

the   expected   number of violations it would uncover (see Ashenfelter and

Smith (1979) for an elaboration of this point). So for example, it would

investigate primarily low—wage nonunion firms in competitive industries,

where violations are likely to occur, rather than high wage union firms in

concentrated industries in which violations are     less   likely to occur.

      Clearly, such a rational assignment of government resources would

other postulated "determinants't; Ashenfelter and Smith did find some

evidence that compliance resources were being assigned nonrandomly. Hence,

the empirical estimates we obtain should be understood to represent the

product of the interactions between employer and employee actions and

government assignment of enforcement resources.      Of course, given the low

level of government enforcement activity, we would be surprised to see it

substantially alter the pattern of noncompliance (as opposed to the level).

       16. The state level was the finest geographic breakdown that could be

identified in the CPS data. Since some local offices served more than

one state, it was often necessary to aggregate data across several states.

As a result, the number of individual states, or state aggregates, for

which these totals could be computed is actually 32.         We should also note

                                                            devoted to minimum
that it was impossible to separate out the resources

wage and overtime pay violation activities.
                                                                     29



     17. Our model is of the determinants of noncompliance. Clearly then,

in the case of the CPS data, the dependent variable is measured with error.

Whenever it takes on the value of one (no premium), the legislation is not

complied with. However, when it takes on the value of zero this may repre-

sent receipt of a premium of time and a half of more (compliance) or receipt

of a premium of less than time and a half (noncompliance). Such measurement

error may bias the estimates in Table 2, however it is unclear in which

direction the bias will go.

     18. In all of the above, compliance is defined conditional on the

individual's working overtime. However, the existence of the overtime

premium and efforts to enforce compliance with the premium, may reduce the

probability that individuals actually work overtime. If this occurs, the

estimates in Table 2 may be subject to sample selection bias; we may con-

found the effect of an explanatory variable on the probability of noncom-

pliance with its effect on the probability of working overtime (see James

Heckman (1979)).

     Using data on individuals in the CPS who both did and did not work over-

time, we attempted to correct for this problem by estimating a model in

which the probability of working overtime and the probability of not receiv-

ing a premium were simultaneously determined. Unfortunately, such an

approach yielded very few significant coefficients, probably because it is

a difficult model to accurately specify.

     19. Data limitations force us to. assume in this calculation that the

proportion of employees working overtime in an industry who are subject to

the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA equals the reported proportion of

employees in an industry who are subject to the provisions (C1). This
                                                                       30



assumption may be inappropriate because the usage of overtime hours may

vary systematically with establishment size (and hence coverage), although

it appears impossible to specify the direction of this relationship. On

the one hand, the usage of overtime may be higher in small establishments

that are not subject to the legislation, because their marginal costs of

overtime hours are lower. On the other hand, the size class exemptions to

the FLSA were instituted because small establishments were successfully

able to argue they did not regularly schedule overtime hours and that their

usage of overtime occurred only in emergencies; if this argument is true

the proportionate usage overtime would increase with establishment size.

The implications of all this is that we may have measured the proportion

of employees in an industry working overtime who are subject to the over—

time provisions with some error, however, it is impossible to determine

if we systematically have overstated or understated this proportion.

     20. While there are well—known statistical problems associated with

the linear probability model, estimates obtained from it will be unbiased.

We use it here both for expository purposes and because the more appro-

priate probit or logit models would not permit us to make the necessary

linear aggregation across workers subject to and not subject to the

legislation.

     21. For expository convenience, in what follows we treat Z and its

coefficient vector as single numbers rather than vectors. However, in our

empirical work, they are treated as vectors.

     22. Actually one knows only the mean value of Z for all individuals

in the sample and these are used in the calculations.
                                                                       31



     23. These numbers should more precisely be interpreted as the    pro-
portion of employees who are not exempt for other reasons (e.g., who are

not supervisory or outside sales persons) who are subject to the overtime

provisions.

     24. One might argue that as the proportion of individuals covered by

the legislation increases, the noncompliance rate in this sector will fall,

since both employees and employers will be more likely to be aware of their

being subject to the legislation. In addition, if labor markets are at

all competitive, one might hypothesize that an increase in the proportion

of workers subject to the legislation would increase the probability that

employers not subject to the legislation would have to pay overtime pre-

miums to attract workers. While it would be desirable to test these

hypotheses, if one allows both P and P to vary with C, the resulting

estimating equation would be under—identified and one would not be able to

obtain an estimate of either P or P .   We   did estimate some equations in
                             C     n
which only    was allowed to vary with C. While these equations yielded

estimates of P that were higher than those in Table 5, one can show that

if the probability that premium pay for overtime is received in the

noncovered sector increases with C, then such estimates of PC will be biased

upwards.
