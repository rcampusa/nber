    TESTING STRATEGIC BARGAINING MODELS USING STOCK MARKET DATA


                               ABSTRACT




     This paper presents three empirical teats of a class of asymmetric

information bargaining models using stock market data.    The basic idea

behind these models is that protracted bargaining can be used to infer

Information that is privately known by another party to the negotiations.        A

fundamental   Implication of these models is that there should be evidence

that negotiations result In learning taking place.     In the context of union

contract negotiations,   if bargaining is primarily motivated by the union's

uncertainty over the firm's future profitability,    then there should be

evidence that contract negotiations reduce this uncertainty.    This

prediction is tested by comparing the variance of the firm's stock price

prior to and following a contract negotiation.     The data indicate that

bargaining results in a significant reduction in this variance.     Other

predictions   of these bargaining models are that the firm's stock price

should deôline during a strike and increase on the settlement date.     The

data generally support these predictions with the exception of a decline in

the firm's equity value following the settlement    of a contract which did not

Involve a strike.

     Recent studies of   micro   data on union contract negotiations have

better informed than the union leaders about the firm's

profitability.     The more uncertain the union   I   about the firm's


profitability,    the more likely the union will engage In prolonged bargaining

i.e. call a strike.

      A new empirical literature is developing which attempts to test
                                                         Several studies have
predictions based on this view of strike activity.
                                                                      for

uncertainty.     Tracy (1986, 1987) assumed that there Is a positive

correlation between the union and Investor uncertainty over the firm's

profitability.     Measures of the latter were constructed from stock market

data and used as a proxy for the former.      Variances of the firm's excess


returns were shown to have a positive and significant effect on both the

 likelihood and the duration of a strike.     Using industry aggregate strike

data, McConnell (1987) finds    that strikes are positively related to the

variance in actual producer prices, but not significantly related to the

variance in forecasted producer prices.        Herrington (1988) uses micro strike

data and finds that strikes are positively related to the variance in the

firm's sales.

     A second prediction of many of the one—sided asymmetric information

models of strikes is that a negatively sloped wage "concession function"

exists.    That is the union's wage demands should decline as a strike

progresses.3 This prediction has been tested by Grama (1984) and McConnell

(1987) using U.S. data, and Card (1988) using Canadian data.       Gram.   finds   a

positive sloped concession function while McConnell finds a negative but

relatively flat concession function.4 Using the first difference in wages

between contracts,   Card finds no systematic relation between wages and

strikes.

     The mixed findings of the studies to date suggest that it would be

worthwhile to develop and test further implications of this class of

bargaining models.     In the next section of the paper three additional      tests

will be derived.     The intuition   behind these tests is a follows.    If

investors understand the mechanics     of the bargaining process, then by

observing the course of the negotiations they may be able to infer along

with the union information related to the firm's profitability.         Assuming



31t should be noted that this prediction is sensitive to which party
 involved in the negotiations is uninformed.   If the union has complete
 information and the firm is uninformed about the opportunity cost of labor,
 then an upward sloping wage concession function exists.   When both parties
 are uninformed, then speculation suggests that there may not be a predicted
 sign for the slope of the concession function.
4Based on the entire sample, McConnell's estimates indicate that real wages
 fall by 3% over the first 100 days of a strike.   The steepest concession
 function was for nonmanufacturingindustries where the estimated decline is
 7%.

that capital markets are efficient,     this new information   should be quickly

capitalized into the firm's stock price.5

     A fundamental i,p1icatlon of this class of bargaining models is that

there should be evidence that negotiations     result in learning taking place.

In particular,   if negotiations are primarily   motivated   by the union's

uncertainty over the firm's future profitability,     then there should be

evidence that contract negotiations are followed by a reduction in this

uncertainty.     Following Tracy (1986, 1987) this hypothesis can be tested by

comparing the variance in the firm's stock returns prior to and following a

contract negotiation.     The test is whether there   is systematic   evidence    that

the post—negotiationvariance is smaller than the pre—negotiation        variance.

     Strategic   bargaining models also give predictions concerning the

pattern of the firm's stock returns both during a strike and following           its

settlement.    Previous empirical   studies of the stock •arket response to

strikes have attempted    to measure the resource cost of a strike to the firm

using the reduction    in the fir.'s equity value during the strike.6      The

reasoning Is that if strikes involve resource costs to firms, then the news

of a strike should result in a reduction of the equity value of the firm.

This argument is inconsistent    with the view that management trades off these

strike costs during negotiations for future reductions       in their wage bill.

Rational   bargaining by management suggests that conditional on the firm's

state of demand, the expected value of the fIrm should increase throughout

the strike until the settlement     date.

     Assume now that both the union and investors are uncertain about the

firm's state of demand.    The stock price reflects the firm's unconditional

profitability rather than its conditional profitability.             Incentive


co.patibility       constraints   incorporated   into these bargaining Models require

that the higher a firm's state of demand, the sooner the firm settles with

the union.     Bargaining involves a sorting process.        While the conditional

value of the firm increases during a strike, the unconditional             value

decreases    due to the adverse information about the        firms   state of demand

which is learned as the strike continues.            If strikes act as a learning

Mechanism, then the firm's stock price should decline throughout a strike.

These models also predict that when a settlement is reached the firm's stock

price should be revised upwards.          Prior to settlement   the •arket price

reflects the average state of demand for that stage of the bargaining.                 The


settlement indicates that the firm's demand state is in the upper tail of

that distribution.

      To summarize, strategic bargaining models generate three implications

concerning the stock market response to contract negotiations.              First, the

post—negotiationvariance in the firm's stock price should be less than the

pre—negotiationvariance; second, the firm's stock price should decline

during the course of a strike; and third, the firm's            stock   price should

increase on the settlement of a new contract.            Each of these three

predictions    will be tested in this paper.




II.   A SIMPLE SEQUENTIAL BARGAINING MODEL

      The three predictions discussed in the introduction can be formally

derived from a variety of bargaining models.            In this section a simple

sequential bargaining •odel is presented which illustrates these

i.plications.       A   number of abstractions are made to keep the model

tractable.      I   ignore the repeated nature of bargaining and focus on a single
                                          —5—

contract negotiation.      I   assume that the union is risk neutral and that

there is no wage/employment trade—off.          The bargaining process     itself is

divided into discrete rounds.       At the beginning of a round the union makes a

new contract demand consisting of a wage rate which the firm can either

accept or reject.     No bargaining takes place between rounds, and production

does not start until a contract has been agreed to by the fir..7

     The firm enters into the bargaining process with complete information.

The union is uncertain    as to the   firms     profitability   over the next contract

period.     The discounted value of the   firms revenues net of      noniabor costs

is denoted by P and is a random variable to the union.            The firm knows the

realization of P. while the union believes that P is uniformly distributed

over the interval (P. P).      The discounted value of the alternative wage

available    to the union members Is denoted by R.       During negotiations the

union members receive the flow value from these alternative          job

opportunities    while the firm receives zero economic rents.        The total rents

to be divided between the union and the firm is given by P —          R which   I


assume is always positive.      The size of the rents is known by the firm but

not the union.     The costs of strikes to the union and the firm are

parameterized by discount factors 6u.

    The length of the bargaining process is limited to a maximum of N

rounds.     The solution concept used In this presentation closely follows

those found in Sobel & Takahashi (1983) and Cramton (1984).           The advantage



7Recent work by Gui and Sonnenscheln (1985) demonstrates the important role
 that commitment not to bargain  between rounds plays in these models.
 They show that as the length of time between rounds becomes arbitrarily
 small, the probability of delay goes to zero. In this paper I assume that
 the time between rounds of negotiation are fixed for technological reasons.
 For example, there may exist scheduling deadlines for production to be able
 to resume in the following period. See Hart (1986) and Tracy (1987) for
 more detailed discussion.
                                                                  —6-

of    a fixed number                of   bargaining rounds is that the solution to the model can

be derived recursively.                           Assume that the bargaining has reached the Nth

round.       The union now believes that P is uniformly distributed                               over the

interval        (P,                      Since this is the last round of bargaining the union

knows that it is optimal for the firm to accept any wage demand that leaves

the firm with a nonnegative level of rents.                                  It follows that the expected

payoff to the union from making a final wage demand of MN is

This structure can be verified by induction.                                  Assume that the structure in

     The basic implications concerning investor behavior during a strike

follow from the next proposition.



Proposition

     At each round in the bargaining the following inequality holds



       't-        +   P)    -           >         >
                                                         V;1       6F



Demonstration:

     Recall from          (6)   that


         -            =         -
                                    W)           6F



Since the cutoff points decline toward P during the negotiation,



                  +         >
        't—
              +             <



These two inequalities imply that



              t-                    —
                                        W    ]
                                                 >
                                                         [       (P+
                                                                        —
                                                                            ]   6       (12)




Sequentially applying this argument establishes the following general

inequality.
                                                      —1O-



                         -

                                                                                                          (13)




Since the firm's indirect payoff function is a weighted average of terms in

(12), we have that



                +
                    -
                        —
                             *   >
                                         *



This   demonstrates the first part of the inequality.                        To show the second part

of the inequality, rewrite (11) as follows.



        *
                                                      -          *                        *
                                                  ÷          -        ÷
            =
                                                      P)         w                        Vgti 5
                -1 !                                                       pt—i-     !


From (13) and our first result, it follows that                             >            6F



       Assume that investors have the same information as the union.                               This


implies that investors           can calculate each term in the inequality given in

the proposition. At the start of the tth round of bargaining investors

would evaluate the expected discounted value of the firm's share of the

rents at    V.      If a settlement occurs during the tth round, then the union's

beliefs about the firm's state of demand is narrowed down from (P,                                         to

                and the settlement wage is known to be                     W.        This new information

causes investors to revise upward their previous evaluation of the firm's

value to 1/2            +            —       >
                                                 V.       If no settlement         occurs, then the

firm's state of demand is revealed to be below                        P.    This new information

causes the current value of the expected discounted value of the firm's

share of the rents to be revised downward to                         V÷1 6       <
                                                                                     V.       This pattern
                                       —11—

of upward revisions of the firm's equity value upon settlement and downward

revisions with continued negotiations applies to each round of the

negotiations.

       To further illustrate this model consider the following example.

Assume that at the outset of negotiations     the union believes that the firm's

                                                                            Let the
profitability is uniformly distributed over the interval (50, 100).

asset value of a job outside the bargaining unit equal 48 and the firm and

union discount parameters equal 0.9.    Restrict bargaining to last no more

than a total of ten rounds. The expected unconditional      value of the firm at

the outset of negotiations equals 14.56.      The union's optimal first round


wage demand is 64.00 which the firm accepts If its value of P exceeds 89.32.

If a settlement occurs in the first round, then the expected unconditional

value of the firm increases by 16.10.     If the union's wage demand is

rejected,   then the firm value declines by 4.36.     If bargaining continues

until the ninth round, the union wage demand will have decreased      from 64.00

to 52.70, the expected unconditional    firm value will have decreased from

14.56 to 1.90, and the variance of the union's beliefs about the firm's

                                                           These patterns
profitability will have decreased from 9.50 to 0.32.

Illustrate each of the three predictions      outlined In the introduction.




III.    DATA DESCRIPTIOII

       The primary source of data used in this study Is a micro data set of

major contract negotiations (i.e. contracts covering at least 1000 workers)

which was constructed as a joint project with John Abowd, David Card, and

Sheena McConnell.    Information on contract negotiations was gathered from

three sources.    The Bureau of Labor Statistics    (BLS) publishes an annual

bulletin titled Wage Calendar which lists "planned" expiration dates for
                                        —12--


major contracts in both manufacturing     and nonmanufacturing    industries.8    For

each contract expiration the BLS lists a contract identification         number

which is unique to that bargaining pair, the name of the firm (or employer

association),    the name of the union, the number of workers covered by the

contract,   the geographic   location of the bargaining    unit, the two-digit    SIC

industry classificationfor the product line involved, and the year and

month of the planned expiration date.      Unpublished BLS information was used

to add the expiration day andfour—digit SIC code for as many contracts as

possible.     Information on contract settlement and effective     dates was

obtained from a tape provided by the Current Wage Development        (CWD) Section

of the BLS.     The settlement date is meant to refer to the date when the new

contract was ratified.9

     The sample contains contract negotiations from January 1970 through

December 1981.    The total sample size is 7712 negotiations.        Of this total,

271 ohservations correspond to scheduled reopenings        rather than

renegotiations    of contracts.   The reopenings were dropped from the sample.

The next selection    criteria was that a complete set of bargaining dates

existed for the negotiation.      This reduced the sample to 2,246 negotiations

consisting of 1,954 oonstrikes and 292 strikes.

     Strike information was collected from the     81.5   and the Bureau of

National Affairs (BNA).      Both the BLS and the BNA gather strike data from

public sources.     The BLS public source strike data is contained in a weekly



8By planned we mean the expiration date which is anticipated as of the
 signing of the contract. As I will show later, the actual expiration date
 often differs from this planned date.
9The CWD data also is restricted to major contracts. However, for many
 negotiations in our sample no settlement or effective dates are available.
 This is due to an unfortunate policy by the CWD of deleting all historical
 information about a bargaining pair If its current coverage falls below
 1,000 workers.
                                          —13-

bulletin titled Industrial Relation Facts (IRF).        In an attempt to obtain

•ore accurate and detailed information about a strike, the BLS also carried

out a separate survey of firms and unions reported to be involved in a

strike.   Summary statistics on strike activity coapiled from this survey

were published annually by the BLS in a bulletin titled Work Stoppages.

This survey was discontinued at the end of 1981 in response to budget

cutbacks at the BLS.      The original   survey data was released for research

with the names of the firm and union removed fro. the records.       By •atching

the reported variables with the same variables       in the public sources we were

able to recover most of the firm and union names.        Details of this matching

process are given in Tracy (1986).

     If a strike took place during a negotiation,       then a third selection

criteria was that a match could be found in the BLS survey data.       This

reduced the number of strikes from 292 to 212 leaving a total of 2.166

negotiations.      Requiring a complete bargaining chronology resulted in a loss

of nearly 70% of the total number of observations.       While this is a

considerable loss of data,     I   will demonstrate below the importance of having

this dating information available.        The final selection criteria was that

security price information for the fin, was available during the ti.e period

surrounding     the negotiation.    Security price data was taken from the CRSP

daily return file and was available for 1,253 out of the 2,166 remaining

negotlatlonm.

     Having a complete set of bargaining dates allows us to examine in

detail the sequence of events surrounding each negotiation.       Consider first

those negotiations that do not involve a mtrike.       While it is the case that

•ost nonstrikes have settle.ent and effective      dates close to the planned

expiration date, there are many exceptions.       Define an "early settle.ent" to
                                       —14—

be a negotiation where the settlement date is at least five days prior to

the planned expiration date and the effective date Is the day following the

expiration date.     A total of 54 early settlements (2.8% of nonstrikes)

occurred in the sample.     Define an 'early expiration' to be a negotiation

where both the settlement and effective date are at least five days prior to

the planned expiration date.     That Is early expirations   correspond to cases

where the contract ends prior to its planned expiration date.      A   total of


276 early expirations    (14.1% of nonstrlkes) occurred in the sample.

     Figure one shows the distribution of early settlements and expirations

by their respective durations.     For an early settlement the duration is

defined to be the number of calendar days between the settlement date of the

new contract and the planned expiration date of the previous contract.          The

duration for an early expiration is the number of calendar days between the

effective date of the new contract and the planned expiration date of the

previous contract.     While the early settlements typically have durations of

one month or less, cases do exist of durations of six months to one year.

Early expirations occur most frequently with durations of two to three

months and a year or more.

     The reader may have noted that the sum of the contracts which settle at

the planned expiration date,     the early settlements, and the early


expirations do not add up to the total number of nonstrikes in the sample.

The 626 remaining negotiations (32.0% of nonstrlkes) consist of what        I   call

settlement "delays."     Define a delay as a negotiation where the settlement

date is at least five calendar days after the planned expiration date, the

effective date is the day following the planned expiration date, and no

strike is observed for the negotiation.'0 Delays consist of cases where


10Delays light be followed by a strike.       If the length of the delay prior to
                                          —15'-


negotiations continue beyond the expiration of the current contract without

a work stoppage and the new contract is back dated.               While there has been

little discussion in the strike literature           about delayed settlements,    the

incidence   of delays in this sample is roughly five tI.es greater than the

incidence   of strikes.      Figure two shows the distribution of delays and

strikes by their respective       durations.      One important    point to note is that

delays are not necessarily brief in length as evidenced by the prevalence of

delays exceeding three months In duration.

     How should we treat delays In the analysis?            Recent bargaining models

do not seem to offer an explanation for delays.            These models rationalize

prolonged bargaining as a mechanism for eliciting privately held

information.    However,     in the models discussed earlier, this mechanism is

effective only if there are costs associated with prolonging the

negotiations.    Unlike strikes where workers withhold their labor services,

it Is unclear what exactly the costs are associated with a delay.              In the

empirical   analysis   I   distinguish between nonstrikes, delays, and strikes

rather than categorizing delays with either nonstrikes or strikes.

     Figures one and two illustrate       for nonstrikes the distribution of

settlement dates around the current contract's planned expiration date.

Without   the settlement and effective dates         it would be impossible   to know

where a particular negotiation fits into this overall distribution.               This

can be particularly problematic for investigating           certain questions.     For

example suppose that we are interested in examining the pattern of a firm's


  the strike was quite long, then we were unlikely to have matched the
  strike information with that negotiation. We are In the process of
  rematching the strikes using the settlement and effective dates. This
  will allow us to determine whether a delay involved a strike, what the
  length of delay was prior to a strike beginning, and how long the strike
  lasted following the delay.  Analyzing this data will require a richer
  class of bargaining models than the one described earlier in the paper.
                                       -16--


security returns Just prior to the expiration of a contract for which no

strike takes place.     If the only information available was the planned

expiration date, then we would end up Including in the analysis security

returns for negotiations which have already been concluded,        and the new

contract is either in effect or soon to become effective.         As a consequence,

the analysis would not accurately reflect the pattern of security returns

for negotiations which are ongoing and nearing the contract's        expiration.

     Issues of timing are also important       for negotiations   involving a

strike.   The BLS survey data offers two important advantages over the BLS

and BNA public source strike data.     First, reporting errors may exist in the

public source data which have been corrected in the survey data.         Second, if

a strike involved several    unions, firms, or plants within a firm, the BLS

                                                             Distinct beginning
surveyed each separate entity involved in the strike.
and ending dates as well as number of workers Involved were recorded for

each entity.    Of the 126 strikes during the sample period for which BLS

survey Information was available,    approximately    one—third   had multiple


beginning and/or ending dates listed.     For these strikes there is no single

definition of the strike duration.

     For contract negotiations with multiple strike dates, the duration of

the strike can vary significantly depending on the method used to calculate

the duration.   Define DURI as the strike duration measured from the first

reported beginning date to the last repoIted ending date.          By construction.

DUR1 will give the maximum strike duration estimate.         Define DUR2 as the

issue' bargaining.          The median values for DURI and DUR2           are   23 days and 21

days respectively,        while the maximum values are 631 days and 358 days

respectively.       In this study        I   limit the analysis to strikes with common


beginning and ending dates.



IV.   EJIPIRICAL RESULTS

      The first implication            of the model which I test is that bargaining

results    in a reduction       in the variance of the firms security price.              The

                                                            variances were

      The pre— and post—settlement                 variances were each estimated using

forecasted residuals          from separate market models.            A simple one factor model

was estimated by OLS using a year of daily stock returns data.

The coefficients of these •arket models tended to be unstable through

As a result, using a single market model based on the Interval marked REG A

to estimate both variances would on average result in estimates of VAR B

which were biased upward due to model .isspecification.                       For this reason,
                                         —18—

VAR B was estimated from residuals forecasted from a separate market model

estimated over the interval marked REG      B.   Both variances   were computed

using three months of daily forecasted residuals.

     As discussed in the previous section there is a distribution of

settlement dates around the planned expiration date for a nonstrike.             This

requires careful definition on a case by case basis of the E and S points in

the time line above.     For a delay, E was set to the planned expiration date

and S was set to the CWD reported settlement date.          For early expirations, E

was set to the CWD reported effective      date, and S was set to the reported

settlement date.       For early settlements     both E and S are set equal to the

reported settlement date.     Finally,   for strikes S was set to the maximum of

the strike ending date and the CWD reported settlement date.

     One problem that arises in this data is that several negotiations may

be ongoing for the same firm at a given point in time.          When this occurs the

estimated variances can be biased by the fact that other negotiations

involving the firm are also in progress.         To deal with this problem   I



checked each negotiation    for a given firm against all other negotiations

involving the same fire.     If the interval used to calculate VAR A or VAR B


overlapped the interval (E-3M, S+lW) for any other negotiation for the firm,

then these variances were excluded from the analysis.          These overlap checks

were carried out using all contracts      in the original    data for which CRSP

data were available.     For the purpose of overlap checks, nonstrikes with

missing expirations days were assumed to have expired in the middle of the

month.   Similarly,   strikes with no BLS survey match had S set equal to the

planned expiration date.     Of the 1.253 observations      in the sample, 647 were



For most early   expirations the effective date is either the same as or
  precedes the settlement date.

     There are two remaining points to discuss before turning

of the statistical analysis.       The first is the specific choice of the

                                                    variance.   The interval

that the contract was due to expire.        I   selected the interval (E—6M, E-3M)

                                              which helps it proxy for the

     Following French, Schwert, & Stambaugh (1987)             I   first esti.ate a time—

series model       for the market variance.     Daily market returns were used to

calculate monthly estimates          of the market variance from 1962 to 1985.       The

natural log instead of the level of the monthly variances were used In order

to reduce the skewness in the distribution.            First differences were then

taken to remove the nonstationarityin the data.               Examining the sample

autocorrelationsled to selecting a third—order moving average

representation of the first differences of ln ot.

The original data as well as the smoothed series of market variances               are


given in figure three.

     Tests of the variance reduction          hypothesis were carried out using both

the unadjusted and the adjusted firm pre and post variances.                The adjusted

firm variances are normalized by the time weighted average of the predicted

monthly market variances for the months Included In the interval used to

calculate   the firm variance.         If bargaining   leads to lower variances,   then

we would expect on average a positive difference between the pre- and post—

negotiation    variances.

     Wilcoxon signed—rank tests of the differences in the unadjusted and the

adjusted variances are given in table 2.            The test statistic Is calculated
                                         —21—


by taking the differences between the pre and post variances, ranking the

absolute values of these differences, and summing the ranks assigned to the

positive differences.       Large values for this statistic indicate a reduction

in the firm's variance.      Table 2 reports standardized values of the test

statistic which have an asymptotic standard normal distribution.           This test

assumes symmetry of the distribution of these differences        but is robust to


the degree of "fatness'      in the tails of the distribution.    The unadjusted

data suggests that variances decline significantly        for nonstrikes   but not


for strikes or delays.       Adjusting for conditional heteroscedasticity

indicates   a significant    variance reduction for nonstrikes and strikes but

not for delays.

     These findings support the variance reduction hypothesis.          As a further

check I recalculated this test using two variance estimates taken three

months apart during the middle of the current contract.          This constitutes

the control sample listed in table 2.       Since no systematic bargaining events

occur at this point In time in the contract,       I   would expect to find no


significant difference in the variances.        Neither   the adjusted nor

                                                             for the
unadjusted data indicate a significant reduction in variance

controls.     This provides some evidence concerning the reliability of the

statistical    method.

     The bargaining model suggested two other empirical regularities which

should show up in the data:       the excess returns on average should be

                                                                     a
negative during a strike and should on average be positive following

settlement.     Table 3 gives mean and median daily excess returns for the

                                                                    The mean excess

returns indicate that the equity value of the fir. declines by nearly

on the announcement of a strike.       While this effect is large relative to the
                                         —22—

standard error, the •edian excess return on this date is much smaller in

absolute magnitude.12

        The cumulative effect of a strike or a delay on the firm's equity value

is given in table 4.     The excess returns are cumulated from the first to tbe

penultisate day    of the strike   ox the delay.    The mean and •edian cumulative

excess returns (CER) for the strike sample are -1.4% and —1.8%

respectively.13     Disaggregating the data by the duration of the strike

reveals that the mean CERs are negative for all but one of the duration

categories while the median CER's are negative for all duration categories.

The largest mean CER is for strikes of 2—3 •onths in duration and indicates

an equity loss of slightly over 3%.       In contrast to the announcesent effect

of a strike, the median CER5 are all larger in absolute value than the mear

CERs.     The largest median CER is for strikes of 3—4 months in duration and

indicates an equity loss of nearly 6%.          No similar equity losses are

associated with delays.     This result combined with the earlier result on

variance changes, indicate that there are an important distinctions betweer.

strikes and delays which should be accounted         for in future bargaining

models.

        The market reaction to the settlement of a strike is given in table     5.


There is a mixed pattern of positive and negative excess returns in the dayc

preceding the settlement.     Both the mean and median excess returns are

positive on the settlement date and indiéate an equity gain of around 0.2%.


12The standard errors for the mean excess returns are calculated under the
  assumption that the excess returns are Independent across negotiations as
  well as across observations within a negotiation. The variance of the
  excess return is assumed to equal the residual variance estimated from the
  market model. As such, these standard errors are only approximate and are
  included for comparison purpose.
13A larger sample of strikes is used in this analysis than in the variance
  analysis.  A key difference Is that strikes which have missing expirstioc
  days are kept in this sample.
                                       -23-

The one anomaly in this table is the large negative median excess return -

associated with the    third trading day following the settlement.     The


corresponding mean excess return for that day is negative but small in

magnitude.

      The bargaining models outlined earlier also predict a positive excess

return on the settlement date of nonstrikes.       The •arket reaction to

contract settlements for which no strike or delay occurred is given in

table 6.     For the entire sample of nonstrikes   the data indicate   that the

firms   equity value declines for the three trading days beginning with the

settlement date.     The mean and median excess returns indicate a decline in

equity value of the firm in the range of O.2%—O.3%.       Focusing only on

settlements    close to the planned expiration of the previous contract reveals

the same pattern of negative excess returns.       This finding is at odds both

with the predictions of the models and with previous e.plrical results In

the literature.14




V.   CONCLUSION

      Strategic bargaining •odels suggest that strikes may be used as a

mechanism for Inferring information which is privately held by the other

party to the negotiations.     Several papers have tested for the empirical

relationship between ex ante levels of uncertainty and the incidence and

duration of strikes.     The evidence to date has been mixed.    In this paper I


presented an alternative test of these models of strikes.       If uncertainty     is

a pri.ary motivation for prolonged bargaining, then bargaining should

resolve so.e of this uncertainty.     This suggests that a fundasental       test of

                                         —24-

this class of bargaining models is that there should be evidence that

contract negotiations reduce uncertainty.       This test is i.ple.ented by

examining variances of a firm's excess returns before and after bargaining.

The data indicate that bargaining does result in a significant reduction In

this variance.       Strategic bargaining models also suggest that the firm's

excess returns should be negative during a strike and positive on the

settlement   date.     In general the data support these predictions with the

exception    being the finding of negative excess returns following the

settlement   of nonstrikes.     Finally, a significant   portion of prolonged

negotiations   occur without a strike taking place.       Unlike strikes,   there is

no significant   reduction in variance of the firm's excess returns or decline

in the firs's equity value associated with a delay.        An i.portant future

research topic involves expanding current bargaining models to incoporate

the decision to delay vs. strike.
