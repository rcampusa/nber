     We construct a computational dynamic stochastic overlapping generations general equilibrium

model with uncertain lifetimes and explore the impact of policy stickiness (specifically, a major reform

will preclude future reforms for a generation) on optimal long-run fiscal policy. Under such

circumstances, entitlement reforms exhaust a valuable option to move in the future. We explore the

conditions under which the gain to waiting is large enough to induce optimizing policymakers to delay

reforming a suboptimal system. We also allow for the uncertainty to have ARCH characteristics and

explore the impact of time-varying uncertainty on the optimality of delayed policy action.

1. Introduction

       A growing share of government expenditures, in the United States and in other developed

countries, is devoted to transfer programs benefiting the elderly. These programs involve

substantial and very long-term commitments to members of the current labor force. Combined

with aging populations, this spending pattern has led to serious questions about the viability of

current fiscal policy, both in the United States and in other developed countries (e.g., Auerbach

et al 1999). But how and when to deal with these apparent fiscal imbalances is very difficult to

ascertain, even if one’s social objectives are clearly specified. With considerable uncertainty

about future mortality, productivity and other factors affecting fiscal balance, the plausible range

of outcomes under current policy is enormous (e.g., Lee and Tuljapurkar 2001). The political

difficulty of changing such well-established programs imparts a further brake to the policy

reform process. Policy-makers shy away from touching the “third rail” of politics, as the U.S.

social security system has been called in graphic commemoration of its popularity.

       This paper investigates the nature of optimal fiscal policy, in an environment endowed

with many of the important characteristics of the current fiscal climate. Using an infinite

horizon, overlapping-generations model, we estimate the optimal levels of taxes, transfers and

debt when there is population uncertainty and restrictions on the government’s ability to change

policy. We also consider how optimal policy is influenced by household attitudes toward risk,

and how the prospect of resolving uncertainty may affect actions today. This last point, in

particular, is of interest, because it addresses the point one frequently hears in the policy debate,

that with such enormous uncertainty about future circumstances, it is better to wait until more

information is available. Clearly, the desirability of waiting depends on whether the future

brings a resolution of uncertainty or simply new shocks to replace the old.
       This paper builds on our previous work on the subject (Auerbach and Hassett 2001). In

that paper, we provided a theoretical analysis of optimal fiscal policy in an overlapping-

generations model with several sources of uncertainty, and then provided simulations of the

model, with and without restrictions on government policy, to estimate the effects of imposing

these constraints. The current paper extends our previous analysis in a number of important

ways. Most fundamentally, using an alternative simulation technique, we are now able to derive

optimal government policies in an infinite horizon setting, rather than in the short-horizon case to

which the previous paper’s simulations were limited. This change, in turn, means that we are

now able to examine the stochastic steady states under different policy rules, to trace out not only

the impact effects of government policies, but also the long-run effects. In addition, we consider

variations in preferences and in the environment of uncertainty. We estimate the sensitivity of

optimal policy to the degree of household risk aversion, and replace the assumption of stationary

shocks to life expectancy with an ARCH model in which the current environment can either be

more or less uncertain than the environment expected for the future.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section sets up the basic

model, and reviews the results of the previous literature. Section 3 describes the simulation

techniques we use to solve for the government’s value function and optimal policy in different

environments, based on the use of neural networks. Section 4 presents our basic results for

optimal policy and considers the impact of political constraints, while Section 5 considers the

impact of varying household risk aversion, and Section 6 the stochastic process for life

expectancy. Section 7 offers some concluding comments and suggestions for future research.




                                                                                                  2
2. Government Policy in an Overlapping Generations Model

A. The Basic Setup

         Throughout the paper, we analyze policy design using a two-period overlapping-

generations model with no bequests, heterogeneity within each generation, or capital market

imperfections. There is no growth in population per generation or productivity, and one source

of uncertainty in the economy, individual life span.1 Individuals supply a unit of fixed labor

when young (normalized to 1 unit per generation) and are retired when old, and make one

decision based on preferences, how much to save for retirement consumption and how much to

spend on consumption when young. A generation’s life span is unknown when it makes its

saving decision, but is revealed before it consumes in old age, so that there are no accidental

bequests. The government can increase welfare because the market does not offer an asset that

insures the current young against the possibility that they will have an unexpectedly long

lifespan. The old, however, know their actual lifespan, so they do not have to purchase an

annuity to insure against long lifetimes. Since precautionary saving by the young is a function of

uncertainty concerning lifetime, our framework is related to that of Yaari (1965) and Sheshinski

and Weiss (1981).

         We assume that production is Cobb-Douglas, obeying the expression:


(1)               Yt = K tα




1
  Productivity shocks are also important in determining optimal fiscal policy, and their inclusion would be a useful
extension of the current approach. We have not included them here because of the considerable complexity they
would add to the simulation problem. The complication arises because, with productivity shocks, private assets are
risky and it is necessary to determine portfolio equilibrium and the premium on risky assets relative to safe assets.
With only life-span uncertainty, all assets are perfect substitutes, so it is unnecessary to solve for the risk-premium
or portfolio decisions.



                                                                                                                          3
From (1), the competitive wage rate and interest rate at t are:


                  wt = (1 − α )K tα
                                                                                   α −1
(2a)                                                       (2b)          rt = αK t


We initially also assume that preferences are Cobb-Douglas,


                                              C 
(3)               U t = ln C1t + Et β t +1 ln 2t +1 
                                               β t +1 


where Ut is the expected utility of the generation born in period t, C1t (C2t) is the consumption of

the younger (older) generation in period t, and βt is the length of second-period life for the older

generation in period t. The form of second period utility is based on the notion that the period is

really divided into β sub-periods, each with equal weight and consumption.

         Government policy at date t is specified by the level of safe government debt at that date,

Bt, and taxes on the young and old generations, T1t and T2t. Together, these three variables

determine the transition equation for government debt:


(4)               Bt +1 = (1 + rt )Bt − T1t − T2 t


There are various possible interpretations of the terms T1t and T2t. One may think of them as

representing the tax and benefit components, respectively, of a public pension scheme.

However, for convenience, we assume that the second-period tax, T2t, is imposed as a

proportional tax on second-period capital income. Although this appears to impose a distortion,

the government’s optimal policy will turn out to be one that eschews distortionary taxation.2

2
  That is, in the model in which policy is unconstrained, the government is able to achieve the same allocation as it
would by directly choosing the levels of consumption for the old and the young. See Auerbach and Hassett (2001)
for further discussion.


                                                                                                                        4
          Utility maximization by the young generation at date t yields the expression for first-

period consumption:


                          wt − T1t
(5)              C1t =
                         1 + E t β t +1


The expression for second-period consumption is:


(6)              C 2t = K t (1 + rt ) + Bt (1 + rt ) − T2 t = K t (1 + rt ) + Bt +1 + T1t ,


where the last substitution follows from (4). With use made of (1), (2), (4), (5) and (6), the

capital transition equation is:


                                               1                        1        
(7)               K t +1 = K tα (1 − α )1 −              − T1t  1 −            − Bt +1
                                          1 + E t β t +1           1 + Et β t +1 


          Finally, we assume that life span evolves according to the first-order autoregressive

process,


(8)               β t +1 = 1 + ρ ( β t − 1) + ε t ,


where, initially, the random term ε is assumed to be i.i.d. over time. In the simulations presented

below, we assume that ε has a uniform distribution.

          The preceding equations provide a complete solution for the economy’s evolution at each

date t.




                                                                                                    5
B. Optimal Policy without Constraints

           We are now in a position to maximize social welfare through the choice of {T1t, T2t, Bt+1}

at date t, subject to expectations at date t. We assume an additively separable social welfare

function with weight ωt assigned to generation t. Our objective, therefore, is to maximize3


(9)                  Wt = ωt −1 β t ln C 2 t + ωt ln C1t + E tWt +1


subject to three state variables, the values debt, Bt, capital, Kt, and life expectancy, βt, at date t.

                                                                                           ωt −1
We further assume that the government’s pure rate of time preference,                            − 1 , is constant over
                                                                                           ωt

time, and denote this pure discount rate as r*. Thus, we may rewrite (9) as:


                                             1               1
(9’)                 Vt = β t ln C 2 t +          ln C1t +        E tVt +1
                                           1+ r *          1+ r *


where Vt =Wt /ωt-1 is the government’s objective at date t, normalized by the discount factor it

applies to that date’s old generation.

           In our earlier paper, we discussed the characteristics of the optimal solution to this

problem and derived some results based on a linearization of the model around its stochastic

steady state. While we will not try to summarize all these results, a couple of them are worth

noting.

           First, the government’s optimal policy calls for the marginal utility of first-period

consumption to follow a random walk, with drift of (1+r*)/(1+rt+1) ≈ r*- rt+1,




3
    There is an additional term in the objective function, - ωt-1 ln βt, but this doesn’t vary with government policy.



                                                                                                                          6
                    1   1+ r *  1
(10)            Et          =         
                    C1t +1   1 + rt +1  C1t


Note that expected growth of consumption itself depends on the level of uncertainty, because of

the convexity of the function U1(C1) = 1/C1. A mean-preserving spread in next period’s

consumption will increase expected marginal utility, because the decrease in marginal utility

associated with positive deviations of consumption from its mean will be more than offset by the

increase in marginal utility associated with negative consumption deviations. The uncertainty of

future consumption increases its value and makes it optimal for the household to increase mean

expected consumption and hence the consumption growth rate. As first noted by Leland (1968),

this increase in precautionary saving in response to uncertainty is implied by the convexity of the

marginal utility of consumption or, equivalently, a positive third derivative of the utility function.

Any utility function with the desirable property of constant or decreasing absolute risk

aversion—including the constant relative risk aversion class considered below, of which

logarithmic utility is a special case—satisfies this property. Indeed, the greater the fluctuations

in consumption, the greater this precautionary saving should be.

       Second, a positive shock to life span should reduce current capital accumulation. With

more consumption needed in the near term, less capital should be accumulated. This result may

seem counterintuitive, if one thinks of longer life span as making individuals better off and more

able to make transfers to other generations. But the key here is the impact on the marginal value

of consumption; with longer life span, a generation must spread its resources over a longer

period. Also, the more durable this positive shock, the smaller the reduction in capital

accumulation – and the greater the decline in consumption – that should occur. This is because

future generations are expected to be less able to provide resources for current ones.



                                                                                                      7
C. Limits on Policy Changes

        Thus far, we have considered government policy when there is sufficient instrument

flexibility for the government to control consumption directly. In a more realistic setting, this is

unlikely to be the case.

        One complication that may arise is that it may not be possible to change government’s

instruments in every period. This may reflect political difficulties, or implicitly the large fixed

costs associated with major policy changes. To be concrete, let us suppose that the tax rates T1

and T2 cannot be changed in successive periods. Given that each period in an overlapping

generations model corresponds to roughly 30 years, this restriction corresponds to the notion that

major changes in, say, the Social Security or Medicare system may be possible only once every

few decades. In the U.S. currently, for example, it has been almost 20 years since the Greenspan

commission’s recommendations lead to an overhaul of the Social Security system, despite the

fact that the long run balance of the system has been a clear issue for at least a decade.

        With this restriction on frequent changes, the government’s problem now can be viewed

as depending on an indicator variable dt, which equals 0 if T1t-1 = T1t-2 and T2t-1 = T2t-2 and 1

otherwise. Letting Vt 0 ( Vt1 ) be the government’s normalized objective function in period t if dt =

0 (1), we may express these functions as:


                                            1               1
                                                                 E t (Vt1+1 ) , Vt1 
                                                                                   
(11a)          Vt 0 = max  β t ln C 2t +        ln C1t +
                                         1+ r *          1+ r *                    

                                        1               1
(11b)          Vt1 = β t ln C 2 t +          ln C1t +        E t (Vt 0+1 )
                                      1+ r *          1+ r *




                                                                                                       8
where Cit is the value of Cit chosen by the household of age i when {T1t, T2t} equals {T1t-1, T2t-1}.

The government’s optimization problem at date t thus consists of maximizing Vt 0 if it did not

change taxes in the previous period, subject to five state variables, the original set {Bt, Kt, βt}

plus lagged taxes, {T1t-1, T2t-1}.

        Despite the apparent simplicity of this objective, the presence of two value functions and

five state variables makes even numerical solution challenging. Using the approach of backward

induction, starting from an assumed terminal period, we were able in our previous paper to arrive

at solutions only for a four-period horizon, because of the growing dimensionality of the

optimization problem.


3. Simulation Methodology

        In this paper, we take a different approach to solving for the government’s optimal

policy. Consider first the case in which the government is unconstrained in its choice of T1t and

T2t, regardless of its policy decisions the previous period. By the stationarity of the inifinite-

horizon problem, the value function will depend only on the state variables at date t, and not the

date itself. That is, we can express Bellman’s equation corresponding to the optimization

problem as:


                                                            1              1                                    
(12)            V ( K t , Bt , β t ) = max  β t ln C 2t +       ln C1t +        E tV ( K t +1 , Bt +1 , β t +1 )
                                       T1t ,T2 t          1+ r*          1+ r *                                 


where we use expressions (2) and (4)-(8) to express the variables on the right-hand side of (12)

in terms of the state variables at date t and the instruments T1t and T2t.




                                                                                                                     9
        To avoid the “curse of dimensionality,” we attempt to solve (12) directly for the

stationary value function, rather than by converging to this function through backward induction.
                                                                  ~
That is, we start with an initial guess of the function V(·), say V (⋅) , defined over a grid of values

for the vector of state variables, and calculate a new guess of the function, say V (⋅) , using

equation (12),


                                                              1               1       ~                            
(13)             V ( K t , Bt , β t ) = max  β t ln C 2 t +        ln C1t +        E tV ( K t +1 , Bt +1 , β t +1 ) ,
                                        T1t ,T2 t           1+ r *          1+ r *                                 


                                                                           ~
and iterate on this expression until the function converges, i.e., V (⋅) ≡ V (⋅) . When this occurs,

we have solved for the value function V(·). Because we iterate over the same value function over

and over, this problem has the same dimensionality as that of the two-period finite horizon case,

making this aspect of the problem much simpler than under the backward-induction approach.

But the trade-off is that we must start with a guess of the value function, and must use a method

of approximation that is flexible enough to represent a potentially very complicated function of

unknown shape.

        The problem of approximating an unknown function is even more challenging for the

case in which government is constrained not to move every period, for then the value function V0

is an upper envelope of two functions, based on this period’s V1 and next period’s V0. Bellman’s

equations corresponding to (11a) and (11b) are:

As in the simpler, unconstrained case, we may iterate on the value function in (15) by replacing
                                                                                         ~
each of the value functions on the right-hand side of the equation with an initial guess V 0 (⋅) and

solving for a new function V 0 (⋅) on the left-hand side. Once convergence is reached, we can

immediately solve for the function V1(·) by plugging the solved equation for V0(·) into the right-

hand side of (14b).

        Following the suggestion in Judd (1998), we use neural networks to approximate the

value function for each iteration of the process just described. A neural network approximates

functions using a succession of linear and nonlinear transformations of the vector of state

variables, the parameters of these transformations being updated with each iteration in order to

approximate the newly obtained estimate of the value function, V (⋅) or V 0 (⋅) . The Appendix

provides further details of the simulation methodology.4

  We experimented with alternative solution algorithms including the use of Chebyshev polynomials, but found that
the neural network approach was more successful in approximating the value function for the more complicated
problem with government policy constraints.

4. Basic Results

           Table 1 presents the simulation results for optimal policy under both assumptions about

government policy constraints, and for a variety of initial values of life expectancy, β, and the

persistence of shocks, as represented by the autoregressive term, ρ. For all simulations in this

table, the random term ε is assumed to be drawn from a distribution that is uniform over the

interval [-0.1, 0.1], and the government’s pure rate of time preference, r*, equals 2.5 The initial

stock of capital is set equal to its steady state value in the absence of shocks, and the initial stock

of debt is set to zero.6

           Let us consider first the results for the unconstrained model. In this case, it can be shown

(see Auerbach and Hassett 2001) that the government’s decision simplifies to a two-step

problem: it allocates consumption to each generation in a given period to equal C2/C1 = (1+r*)β

(which equals 3β for our assumption that r* = 27), and then chooses the capital stock to spread

resources over time, consistent with its Euler equation relating the marginal utilities of

successive young generations.

           The unconstrained results are also consistent with the prediction regarding the impact of

ρ on the response of consumption to a shock to current life span, β. Recall that as the shock to β

is expected to be more permanent (ρ is large), we can less afford an increase in the current

consumption of the elderly. Thus, consumption of the elderly should increase less, and saving



5
  Remember that each period in this life-cycle model represents a generation of perhaps 30 years, so a discount
factor of 2 corresponds to a compounded annual discount factor of around 3.7 percent.
6
 The simulations in this table are based on the same parameterizations as those in Table 1 of Auerbach and Hassett
(2001). Although the patterns of the results are reasonably similar when ρ=0.1, they are less so when ρ=0.9,
suggesting that the approximation error involved in using a finite horizon is more significant when shocks are
persistent.
7
    That this relationship does not hold exactly in each simulation reflects rounding and slight interpolation error.



                                                                                                                        12
should be higher, when ρ is high. Indeed, this is quite evident when we compare the changes in

C2 as β increases for ρ = .1 and ρ = .9.

       Another result worth noting is that, as the level of uncertainty increases, so does optimal

saving. For a starting value of β =1, there is no expected trend in life span. The larger ρ is,

however, the more persistence is expected for positive or negative life-span shocks, and hence

these shocks have more important effects. The increased risk at β = 1 associated with an

increase in ρ from 0.1 to 0.9 raises the optimal level of Kt+1. Indeed, for ρ = 0.9, the optimal

capital stock is higher in all cases than in the deterministic steady-state value. Thus, with

sufficient uncertainty, it is optimal to accumulate additional capital, even if current needs are

unusually high (i.e., β > 1).

       The simulations for the constrained model show the optimal policy choices, if the

government is able to act and if it is optimal to do so. Whether moving is optimal, in turn, will

depend on the lagged values of T1 and T2.

       As one would expect, anticipating a lack of flexibility leads the government to sacrifice

current consumption to provide for the future. In all cases, both C1 and C2 are lower than in the

corresponding unconstrained specification. In percentage terms, the reduction in C1 is larger

than that in C2. Intuitively, this reflects the fact that the young may be expected to “recover” part

of the government’s extra precautionary saving when they are old. Also, the higher is current

life span, β, the greater is amount of added precautionary saving. The intuition for this is that,

when the current value of β is high, future generations are, in general, expected to be worse off –

they are also expected to have a high β, and hence less consumption per unit time for a given

level of resources. With their higher associated marginal utility of consumption, the welfare cost

of having the “wrong” fiscal policy in place when the government cannot move will be greater.


                                                                                                     13
This leads the government to exact a greater sacrifice from current generations, particularly the

young.

         In Figures 1 and 2, we present estimates of the range of inaction in the policy-constrained

version of the model, for the cases of β = 1 and ρ = 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. In each figure, the

star represents the optimal value of the pair {T1, T2}, corresponding to the values in bold in Table

1. These values of the lagged tax rates would yield the highest value of the current value

function. As the lagged tax rates move away from this point, it is more and more costly for the

government to maintain its option to move next period. When the boundary of the inaction range

is passed, it becomes optimal for the government to change policy in the current period,

extinguishing the option to move in the next period.

         There are a number of interesting patterns in these two figures. First, the area of the

inaction range is substantially bigger for ρ = .9 than for ρ = .1. This difference suggests that

there is much greater value in waiting to adjust policy if next period’s information is more

“permanent.” Another interesting pattern in these results is that the optimal values of T1 and T2

each lie much closer to the upper boundary of their respective inaction ranges than to the lower

boundary. This is especially true for ρ = 0.1. We may infer from this that suboptimal current

tax rates are more costly if they are too high than if they are too low.

         The intuition for this finding is as follows, and depicted in Figure 3. Mistakes in either

direction have a roughly symmetric impact on the welfare of future generations; because these

deviations in resources from the optimal policy are spread over a large number of generations,

the deviation for any one generation is very small and hence valued at an approximately constant

marginal utility for movements in either direction. This is depicted by the dashed horizontal line

in Figure 3, characterizing the valuation by future generations of movements away from the



                                                                                                      14
optimal distribution of resources at point a*. For current generations, however, the resource

fluctuations from optimal policy are large, so that the marginal utility applicable to added

resources will be lower than the marginal utility applicable to resources taken away, as depicted

by the downward sloping line in Figure 3. There is a net social cost of moving in either direction

from point a*, but, for equal movements in either direction (to point al or point ah) the cost of

being too generous to current generations—the area H in the figure—is smaller than the cost of

being too harsh—point L in the figure—as long as the marginal valuation curve of current

generations in convex. This convexity condition on marginal utility, i.e., that the utility

function’s third derivative is positive, is precisely the same condition discussed above that causes

uncertainty to increase precautionary saving. Hence, a factor that tends to increase saving in the

unconstrained case and, presumably, in the constrained case as well, also works in the opposite

direction in the constrained case, causing the government to be more likely to cut taxes than to

raise them when current policy is not optimal.

       Thus, when taking action, the government is likely to engage in more precautionary

saving in the constrained model, but the timing of its actions tend to favor less saving. Taking

into account both periods of action and periods of inaction, taxes could be higher or lower in the

constrained world than in the unconstrained world. We address this question below, but consider

first the impact of the results presented thus far of the government’s discount rate.

       Table 2, and Figures 4 and 5, provide simulations and inaction ranges comparable to

those in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2, but for a government discount rate of r* = 1 instead of r* =

2. Although the patterns are generally similar to those already discussed, there are some

interesting and intuitive differences. Note, for example, what happens to capital accumulation in

the constrained case for ρ = 0.9, as β rises. Previously, we found that capital accumulation




                                                                                                    15
should fall, because the current elderly need more resources. The high value of ρ mitigates this,

because the elderly in the near future will also need more resources. Here, though, the

government actually chooses to accumulate more when β is high. The reason is that β could go

even higher, and a government constrained not to move in the future, with a low discount rate,

perceives the need to provide for this eventuality.

       Another effect of the lower discount rate is the expansion of the government’s inaction

range. This is most evident when the range is large to begin with, for the case of ρ = 0.9 (Figure

4 versus Figure 1). Imbued with a greater concern for future generations, the government values

the option to move in the future more highly.

       We now return to the question raised earlier, whether the imposition of policy constraints

reduces saving and capital accumulation in the long run. As discussed, there are offsetting

factors, as government engages in more precautionary saving when it changes policy, but is more

likely to change policy when saving is too high, rather than too low. Figures 6 and 7 provide

comparisons of steady-state capital stock distributions for constrained and unconstrained policy

action, for the case of persistent life-span shocks (ρ = 0.9). Figure 6 is for the case of a high

government discount rate (r* =2), corresponding to Figure 1 and the left side of Table 1. Figure

7 is for the case of a low discount rate (r* = 1), corresponding to Figure 4 and the left side of

Table 2. In each of the new figures, the distribution of the capital stock is tighter when there are

no policy constraints, as one would expect. When r* = 1, the capital stock distribution has a

higher mean as well, reflecting the precautionary saving motive. But, when r* = 2, the

asymmetry of the inaction range dominates, and the capital stock is actually lower, on average,

with constraints on government action.




                                                                                                    16
5. The Impact of Risk Aversion

        Thus far, we have considered variations in initial conditions, government constraints and

the environment of uncertainty, but not in household preferences and, by extension, the risk

aversion implicit in government policy making. Clearly, risk aversion is an important element of

the problem, so it is useful to see how variations in risk aversion affect optimal government

policy. In place of the Cobb-Douglas preferences assumed thus far, we now consider the general

constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences,

with coefficient of risk aversion γ. When γ = 1, preferences are Cobb-Douglas.

        For general CES preferences, the first-order condition for first-period consumption

becomes, in place of (5),


                        wt − T1t
(5′)            C1t =

(17)            x t = E t β tγ+1 (1 + rtn+1 )



and rtn+1 is the after-tax rate of return in period t+1. When γ =1, xt+1 reduces to Etβt+1 and (5′)

reduces to (5). Otherwise, the distribution of rtn+1 must be known to calculate C1t. As this

complication would make the simulation exercise considerably more complicated, we

approximate rtn+1 with r* in (17). The approximation error involved in doing so is likely to be



                                                                                                      17
small, given the fairly tight distribution for the capital stock in the simulations we are

considering, with r*=2 and ρ=0.9 and government unconstrained (see Figure 5).

         Table 3 presents simulations for three different values of the degree of risk aversion, γ,

1.1, 3.0 and 5.08, and two values for the interval of the uniform distribution. The interval used

above, [-0.1, 0.1], has length 0.2. To consider the effects of risk and risk aversion, we utilize two

extreme values for the interval length, 0.1 and 1.1, corresponding to the uniform distributions

[-.05, 0.05] and [-0.55, 0.55].

         As the table shows, the impact of risk on behavior is very small for a moderate degree of

risk aversion. When γ = 1.1, there is a slight decline in the optimal level of C2 caused by

increased risk, and a decline in the optimal level of C1 so small that it is not perceptible to the

third decimal place. Thus, although the point emphasized above about the pure impact of risk on

precautionary saving is true, it is not particularly significant here, compared to the impact, say, of

the government’s inability to change policy. The importance of risk becomes more important as

the degree of risk aversion grows. For the empirically large (but not implausible) risk aversion

coefficient of 5, first- and second-period consumption levels are noticeably lower for the higher-

risk simulation. This is consistent with the fact that, as risk-aversion grows, so (for the CRRA

utility function) does the strength of the precautionary saving motive, as measured by the degree

of “prudence” (Kimball 1990).9




8
 We use γ =1.1 instead of 1.0 to simplify the programming, which would require additional statements to handle
exact Cobb-Douglas preferences.
9
 Kimball defines “prudence” as minus the ratio of the third utility derivative to the second utility derivative and
shows that the precautionary saving motive increases with this measure, which equals (1+γ)/C for risk-aversion
coefficient γ. Thus, for a given value of consumption, prudence increases with risk aversion.



                                                                                                                      18
6. Why Wait? Changes in the Degree of Uncertainty

       Up until this point, we have analyzed the impact on optimal policy of the level of

uncertainty, but the distribution of lifetime uncertainty has been fixed for each simulation. This

assumption ignores a second possible source of gain to policy delay: the possibility that the

government can learn more about the underlying parameters over time. As many have

documented, programs like Social Security and Medicare appear unsustainable and in need of

substantial change. A commonly heard argument, though, is that for programs like these that are

subject to enormous uncertainty, it is impossible and hence unwise to take any significant action

immediately, when so little is known. While this argument may ring true, there is little in the

analysis thus far to support it. Indeed, there are two factors working in precisely the opposite

direction. First, as just discussed, risk aversion should lead to precautionary saving, and more

risk should lead to more saving. Second, to the extent that government may face limits on its

ability to act, any action it takes should involve even more stringent policy measures. It is true,

as we have seen, that constraints on policy also leave room for ranges of inaction when

circumstances are not far enough away from optimal, and that the inaction range expands with

uncertainty. But is there more to the story than this?

       One possibility involves the distinction between risk and uncertainty that goes back to

Knight (1921) and has been considered anew in the recent literature (see, e.g., Schmeidler

(1989)) The argument may be that the parameters of the distributions of the stochastic terms are

unknown, but that the government is in the process of learning them. Without departing from the

standard paradigm for analyzing optimal behavior under uncertainty, though, one may make

sense of the argument for waiting if a resolution of the existing uncertainty may be expected.

That is, it makes little sense to wait for today’s uncertainty to be resolved, if more is on the way



                                                                                                   19
tomorrow. But if today’s uncertainty is greater than that anticipated for the future, waiting might

make sense.

           To some extent, an ARCH process that allows the parameters of the mortality distribution

to evolve over time in a predictable way parametrically characterizes such a situation, but in an

admittedly incomplete manner since it abstracts from the learning process and occurs within a

well defined probability space. To make this intuition concrete, we adapt the model considered

thus far, to allow changes in the degree of life-span uncertainty over time. We continue to

assume that life span is stochastic, and described by the first-order autoregressive process in (8).

But now, instead of assuming that the random terms εt are i.i.d., we assume that they are

determined by an ARCH(1) process, in which the variance of the distribution itself varies over

time around some long-run value.

           Let νt be a random draw from the uniform [-0.5, 0.5] distribution at date t, and let m be

the term that multiplies this to determine the actual error term εt and the range of the

corresponding uniform distribution. For example, for the range equal to 1.1 used in Table 3, m ≡

1.1. Now, suppose that m is time varying, with εt = mt-1νt.10 We specify that m evolves

according to:


(18)                 m t2 = (1 − α )m 2 + αm t2−1ν t2 / σ ν2


where σ ν2 is the (constant) variance of the innovation ν. In this expression, the unconditional

expectation of mt2 is m 2 , and the expectation conditional on mt2−1 is (1 − α )m 2 + αm t2−1 . Thus,

mt2 follows a first-order AR process. For α = 0, the process reduces to the one previously


10
     We choose the timing of m in this way because it is known as of the end of period t-1, while νt is not.



                                                                                                               20
considered, with m ≡ m . The larger α is, the more persistence there is in the impact of shocks to

                                          .5
the variance itself. Given that σ ν2 = ∫ ν 2 dν =    1
                                                     3   (.53 + .53 ) =   1
                                                                           12   , equation (18) becomes:
                                          −.5




(19)            m t2 = (1 − α )m 2 + 12αm t2−1ν t2


Using the ARCH specification, we can contrast two situations in which current conditions are the

same. In the first, the variance is mt-1, and expected to stay at this value. In another, the current

variance is mt-1, but m follows an ARCH(1) process and is expected to fall in the future, because

mt-1 > m . In this case, mt-1 is an additional state variable of the government’s optimization

problem.

       Table 4 provides simulations that allow us to measure the impact of this distinction. The

first three columns repeat the last three from Table 3, with r* = 2, β =1, ρ = 0.9, and m≡ 1.1.

The next three columns present simulations for the same current values of these parameters, but

with m determined by an ARCH(1) process with α = 0.2. In all simulations, the capital stock is

increased by policy from its initial level, so the situation corresponds to one in which “fiscal

discipline” is needed. The results indicate that the intuition provided above holds, but only for a

sufficiently risk-averse population.

       When γ = 5, the prospect of reduced future variance lowers the perceived need for

precautionary saving. Consumption by both young and old is higher than under the constant-

variance assumption, and capital accumulation is substantially lower. This effect, however, is

substantially weaker for the moderate degree of risk aversion, γ = 3. For γ = 1.1, the effect is

actually reversed. Although the model is sufficiently complicated that no simple intuition seems

to apply, we conjecture that this reversal has something to do with a second aspect of the ARCH




                                                                                                           21
process. While m is expected to fall in the long run, it also varies with actual shocks in the short

run. In particular, if there is an unexpected increase in life span – which is bad news for fiscal

policy – this will also induce an increase in m. Thus, negative fiscal shocks will be associated

with increased uncertainty, and this positive relationship may lead to more precautionary saving,

offsetting the effect of the long-run decline in m that is anticipated. In summary, unless the

resolution of uncertainty is itself certain, its possibility does not necessarily dictate delay in

remedial fiscal actions.


7. Conclusions

         Using numerical simulations, we have considered the nature of optimal long-run fiscal

policy in a variety of environments. Although it may be helpful to think of these results as

relating specifically to optimal Social Security policy, the model is more general and abstracts

from the specific institutions of Social Security.11

         Our results indicate that limits on the ability of government to readily adjust policy exert

a significant impact on the nature of optimal policy. These limits lead to more precautionary

saving when policy changes, but also to an asymmetry in policy responsiveness that favors

current generations. Thus, in the long run, policy constraints can contribute either to more

saving or less, and make the distribution of the long-run capital stock much wider. We also find

that the resolution of uncertainty may lead to circumstances where it is optimal to “wait and see,”

but that powerful precautionary motives work in the opposite direction.

  For a good recent analysis of optimal Social Security policy with respect to risk-sharing in a model that
incorporates many of Social Security’s institutional characteristics, see Bohn (2001). Bohn’s analysis relates most
closely to that of our unconstrained model, which we explored more fully in Auerbach and Hassett (2001).



                                                                                                                  22
Appendix: Neural Networks

           Figure 8 provides a schematic representation of the neural network we use here, for the

simple unconstrained problem in which there are three state variables, the capital stock, K, the

level of debt, B, and life span, β.

           The neural network approximates a function using a sequence of linear and nonlinear

transformations of the state variables. In the first stage of each round, a pre-specified number,

say m, of linear combinations of the state variables are constructed, using the weights w11···w3m.12

Each linear combination corresponds to a “node” of the first “hidden” layer of the neural

network, and is passed through a nonlinear transformation, denoted f in Figure 8. If there is just

one hidden layer, then the resulting scalars, x1…xm, are aggregated using linear weights ui to

form an approximation of the value function evaluated at the particular inputs, V(β, K, B). If

there is a second hidden layer, as depicted in Figure 8, then there is an additional step before this

final aggregation, in which the initial process is repeated; if there are n nodes in the second

hidden layer, we form n linear combinations of the outputs of the first hidden layer, x1…xm, and

pass these linear combinations through another nonlinear transformation, denoted g in Figure 8.

The function depicted in the figure is:


                                          n
                                                  m           3        
(A1)                 Vˆ ( β , K , B ) = ∑ u i g  ∑ v ji   f ∑ wk z kj  
                                        i =1      j =1        k =1     


where {z1, z2 ,z3} = {β, K, B}. The unknown parameters of this function, the vectors u, v, and w,

                                                                          (          ) 2
are chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals, Vˆ ( β , K , B ) − V ( β , K , B ) , over the points

in the state variable grid.

12
     The linear transformations also include a constant.



                                                                                                       23
       The flexibility of the neural network increases with the number of hidden layers and the

number of nodes in each layer, but so does computational time. Also with too many nodes

and/or layers than are necessary for a close approximation, we lose degrees of freedom and may

hamper our ability to forecast the function for points not on the grid. Thus, we experiment with

different specifications, adding layers or nodes until sufficient flexibility is achieved, and

experimenting with different nonlinear transformations as well. For the unconstrained model

and Cobb-Douglas preferences, we used one hidden layer and six nodes. For the unconstrained

model with CES preferences, and for the ARCH model, we used one hidden layer and 10 nodes.

For the most complex simulations, those based on the constrained model, we added a second

hidden layer, with 16 nodes in the first layer and seven nodes in the second layer. For each

specification, we used the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function

(A2)                      −1
                1 + e −2a



for the first hidden layer. For the second hidden layer in the constrained simulations, we used

the log sigmoid transfer function
