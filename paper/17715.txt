This analysis uses March Current Population Survey data from 1999-2010 and a differences-in-differences
approach to examine how California’s first in the nation paid family leave (PFL) program affected
leave-taking by mothers following childbirth, as well as subsequent labor market outcomes. We obtain
robust evidence that the California program more than doubled the overall use of maternity leave,
increasing it from around three to six or seven weeks for the typical new mother – with particularly
large growth for less advantaged groups. We also provide suggestive evidence that PFL increased
the usual weekly work hours of employed mothers of one-to-three year-old children by 6 to 9% and
that their wage incomes may have risen by a similar amount.

         The United States is the only advanced industrialized country without a national law

providing new mothers (and often fathers) with entitlements to paid family leave (PFL).

However, three states have implemented paid leave programs, the first of these being California,

where PFL took effect in 2004. We study how California’s program has affected leave-taking by

mothers following childbirth, and the extent to which these effects differ across population

subgroups. We are particularly interested in learning whether PFL has reduced previous

disparities in leave-taking, whereby advantaged mothers have been much more likely to use

leave than their less advantaged counterparts. We also provide an initial investigation of the

medium-term impacts on mothers’ labor market outcomes: employment, work hours, and wage

income.

         The analysis uses March Current Population Survey data from 1999-2010 and a

differences-in-differences (DD) approach to compare pre- versus post-program implementation

experiences of mothers with infants or young children – the treatment groups – to control groups

alternatively consisting of women with older children, childless women, men with non-infant

children, or new mothers in other states.1 We obtain robust evidence that the California program

increased leave-taking, more than doubling overall maternity leave use – increasing it from

around 3 to 6 or 7 weeks – with particularly large growth for less advantaged mothers (those who

are less educated, unmarried, or nonwhite) who had relatively low levels of baseline use. This

contrasts starkly with the results for other state family leave laws (most of which extend rights to

unpaid leave beyond those in the FMLA), where the estimated effects are much larger for

college-educated and married women than for less advantaged counterparts (Han, Ruhm and

Waldfogel, 2009). The exploration of effects on medium-term labor market outcomes provides

1
 We considered men with infant children as a treatment group, since such fathers are covered under PFL, but did
not find consistent evidence of effects on leave-taking. This may have occurred because low rates of paternity leave
use imply that we did not have the power to detect statistically significant effects.

more equivocal results, but with evidence that paid family leave led to 6 to 9% increases in usual

weekly work hours for employed mothers, and that their wage incomes may have risen by a

similar amount.

Background

        All industrialized nations, other than the United States, grant parents the right to take time

off work with pay following the birth or adoption of a child (Earle, Mokomane, and Heymann,

2011).2 In European countries, a period of at least 14 to 20 weeks of maternity leave is provided,

with 70 to 100% of wages replaced.3 Subsequent to this, some form of paid parental leave

(available to both mothers and fathers although a portion is sometimes reserved for one parent) is

typically supplied. The duration of the job-protection and leave payment differs substantially

across nations, but the total duration of paid leave exceeds nine months in the majority of them.

Our neighbor to the North, Canada, currently provides at least one year of paid leave, with

around 55% of wages replaced, up to a ceiling (Doucet, Lero, and Tremblay, 2011).4

        Until enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993, the United States

did not even provide rights to unpaid leave. Under the FMLA, firms employing at least 50

persons within 75 miles of the work site are required to offer eligible workers 12 weeks of job-

protected but unpaid time off work to care for newborn or newly adopted children (as well as for

other reasons such as serious medical problems).5 However, the firm size and work history

requirements (the individual must have worked for the firm 1250 hours during the previous 12

months) imply that only around half of employees are eligible for FMLA leave.



2
  Australia, long the other exception, began providing 18 weeks of paid leave in 2011. (For details, see:
http://www.familyassist.gov.au/payments/family-assistance-payments/paid-parental-leave-scheme/.)
3
  Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is drawn from a more extensive discussion in Ruhm (2011).
4
  The leave period is 70 weeks in Quebec.
5
  Firms are required to continue health insurance during the leave period. See U.S. Department of Labor (2010) for
further information on provisions of the FMLA.


                                                      Page 2
           A number of states extend the FMLA by providing rights to unpaid leave to additional

employees or for longer periods of time. In addition, pregnant women and new mothers in the

five states (California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island) offering temporary

disability insurance (TDI) can take some time off work with pay – usually for around six weeks

at one-half to two-thirds earnings – for pregnancy related short-term “disabilities”, although at

least some of this leave usually occurs before the birth.

           We examine consequences of California’s first in the nation explicit paid family leave

program, which took effect in July 2004. California PFL offers six weeks of partially paid leave

to bond with a newborn or a recently placed foster or adoptive child, or for other reasons (such as

to care for seriously ill relatives).6 Almost all private sector workers are eligible (unlike the

FMLA, with its employer-size and work history requirements) and wage replacement is 55% up

to a ceiling based on the state’s average weekly wage. PFL has many elements in common with

the California TDI program: job protection is not provided during the leave, unless the individual

is eligible for and simultaneously uses FMLA leave; financing is through payroll taxes levied on

employees (without employer payments); and the two programs are closely coordinated, so that

PFL can start immediately after TDI leave ends. One difference is that PFL applies equally to

mothers and fathers.

           Studying the effects of the California paid leave program is interesting in its own right

and because the results may be informative for understanding the potential effects of similar

programs enacted in other states or nationally. These possibilities are salient. In 2009, New

Jersey implemented a paid parental leave program that is similar, in many ways, to that in

    The discussion in this paragraph and the next is based on information provided in Fass (2009).

California.7 Washington State also passed a more limited paid leave program, originally

scheduled to begin in 2009, but delayed until at least 2012 due to budgetary pressures.8 The

immediate prospects for a national PFL program are less favorable but substantial advocacy and

limited legislative efforts have been undertaken.9

        Prior research provides some guidance as to how unpaid leave rights in the U.S. affect

women’s leave usage and subsequent employment. Mothers giving birth post-FMLA in states

that did not previously have maternity leave statutes are more likely to use maternity leave and

take more time off work than those giving birth pre-FMLA (Waldfogel, 1999; Han et al., 2009).

State unpaid leave statutes are also associated with increased leave-taking although the effects

are small and the estimates are less consistent (Klerman and Leibowitz, 1997; Han and

Waldfogel, 2003; Washbrook, Ruhm, Waldfogel, and Han, 2011). The effects of unpaid leave

policies are largest for relatively advantaged women, who are more likely to be eligible for leave

under such policies and able to afford unpaid time off work.10

        The effects of paid leave, however, could be quite different. In particular, disadvantaged

mothers might be more able to use paid than unpaid time off work, potentially reducing

disparities in leave-taking. Evidence from other countries’ paid leave expansions supports this

possibility. Studies of Europe and Canada consistently show that take-up of paid leave is very

high, often close to universal (see e.g. Rønsen and Sundström, 2002; Baker and Milligan, 2008;

Burgess et al., 2008; Dustmann and Schonberg, 2008; Carneiro, Loken, and Salvanes, 2010; Liu

7
  As in California, the duration of leave is 6 weeks, financing occurs through an employee-only payroll tax and the
program builds upon the state’s existing TDI program. Wage replacement rates are higher in New Jersey than
California (66% versus 55%) but the maximum benefit is lower ($546 in 2009 versus $959 in California).
8
  Washington was scheduled to offer a flat benefit of $250 for five weeks, with job-protection provided to persons
meeting the same work history requirements as in the FMLA.
9
  For example, in 2007, Senators Dodd and Stevens proposed a Family Leave Insurance Act that would have
provided 8 weeks of paid benefits for time off work for the same reasons as in the FMLA, financed by employee and
employer premiums (see http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/encyclopedia_entry.php?id=16912&area=All for further details).
10
   For example, Han et al. (2009) find that the positive effects on leave-taking are confined to college-educated or
married mothers, with no significant effects for those who are unmarried or have less education.


                                                      Page 4
and Skans, 2010; Rasmussen, 2010). Second, when paid leave has been introduced to replace a

former system of at least partially unpaid leave, effects on leave-taking have been largest among

disadvantaged women least likely to have used unpaid leave (see, for example, evidence from

Norway in Carneiro et al., 2010). The effects of maternity leave rights on employment are

theoretically ambiguous, since longer leave periods might cause women to stay on leave longer,

or might boost job-holding because mothers no longer need to quit jobs to obtain time off work

(Klerman and Leibowitz, 1997); however, empirical studies suggest that the latter effect

dominates, particularly when the period of leave provided is not excessively long (see e.g.

Gregg, Domenech, and Waldfogel, 2007). With regard to longer-run labor market effects,

comparative studies find that extended paid leave entitlements are associated with modestly

higher female employment rates, although with some concern that excessively long leave periods

(periods well in excess of a year) could have detrimental effects (see e.g. Ruhm, 1998; Jaumotte,

2004; Pettit and Hook, 2005).

       On the other hand, the impact of the California program might differ from those studied

above, because wage replacement rates are considerably lower than in most European countries

(but not Canada). Moreover, Appelbaum and Milkman (2011) provide evidence that public

awareness of the program remains limited, even six years after implementation, and with fear of

negative employment consequences for using it being cited by many individuals who know

about the program but do not apply for benefits. Even if the program does increase leave-taking,

it is not obvious for which groups the effects will be strongest.

Data

       We use 1999-2010 data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual

Demographic Supplement, accessed via the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)



                                               Page 5
database. The CPS data are useful because they provide information on leave-taking and labor

market outcomes for a large and nationally-representative sample. Questions about the use of

maternity and paternity leave are asked directly of individuals reporting being with a job but

absent from work during the reference week (the week immediately before the survey).

Limitations include the lack of precise information on child birth dates and on women’s

employment status during pregnancy. To our knowledge, no other large and representative data

sets combine this information with that on leave use.

       When analyzing effects on leave-taking, we limit the sample to persons employed

(reporting any usual work hours) in the prior year. The treatment group consists of women

residing in California with an infant (less than 1 year old at the survey date) in the household

who reported working any usual hours in the previous year (N=1,422). While this definition

captures most women eligible for PFL, we would ideally like to restrict the analysis to those

working throughout most of their pregnancy (which our data will not permit). Most resulting

classification errors are likely to be minor. For example, a woman with an 11-month-old child

surveyed in March 2007 most likely became pregnant during the last quarter of 2005. If she

worked at the end of 2005, but not during 2006, we would exclude her from the treatment group,

even though she had some pregnancy employment. That said, it is unlikely that she would have

been eligible for PFL, given that she stopped working several months before childbirth.

Potentially more problematic, we will misclassify into the treatment group women who did not

work during pregnancy but began to do so after childbirth but during the reference year. For

example, we would erroneously place into the treatment group a mother whose child was 11-




                                               Page 6
months old in March 2007, who gave birth in April 2006, and only worked during that year in

the period after childbirth.11

         If the measurement error described above is random, it would be likely to attenuate the

estimated effects. Potentially more serious, however, is that bias may be introduced if there is

selection into the treatment group as a result of PFL. For example, if it increases post-birth

employment, then the potential misclassification of women who only worked after childbirth into

the treatment group could be more problematic. To address this issue, we also estimated

regressions that included all women with youngest children aged <1 year in California in the

treatment group, regardless of last year’s reported employment. These regressions represent

intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses rather than the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) analyses that we

emphasize below. However, the ITT results are very similar to the presented TOT estimates,

when scaled by the pre-treatment fraction of treatment women working during the last year,

suggesting that this source of selection bias is unlikely to be serious.12

         Our primary control group consists of women residing in California with a youngest child

aged 5-17 years at the time of the survey, and who reported working any usual hours in the

previous year (N=13,555). The key assumption is that mothers with older children (sometimes

referred to as control group 1 below) would have similar employment trends, in the absence of

the treatment, to women with infants. Ideally, we might have used mothers with toddlers (i.e. 1-

to 3-year-olds) as controls, assuming that their work behavior would be even more similar to the

treatment group. However, this might be problematic if such mothers are pregnant or planning to

become pregnant in the near future, so that their labor market behavior might be affected by the


11
   Such misclassifications are likely to be relatively rare, since relatively few mothers not working during pregnancy
are employed shortly after childbirth. For example, Han, Ruhm, Waldfogel, and Washbrook (2008) present evidence
that only around a quarter of mothers giving birth in 2001, and not employed at birth, were working 4 months later.

   These results are available upon request.

presence of paid family leave. As an alternative, we estimated models with varying minimum

child threshold ages (between two and eight years old) for inclusion of mothers into the control

group. The results are not sensitive to this choice as briefly discussed below.

        The assumption of a common trend between our treatment and primary control groups

might be violated (e.g. if macroeconomic conditions differentially affect the two groups).

Although we cannot completely eliminate the potential bias this might introduce, we address this

possibility by testing the robustness of the results to the choice of several alternative comparison

groups. These include: women residing in California with no children (N=22,091); men residing

in California with no children <1 year old (N=53,584); women with infants residing in one of the

next three largest states – Florida, New York, and Texas (N=2,058).13 These are sometimes

referred to as control groups 2, 3 and 4 below. Although each of these comparisons is

informative, we focus on specifications using control group 1 because labor market behavior of

mothers with older children is likely to be more similar to that of mothers of infants than those of

women with no children or men. Control group 4 is potentially useful but could introduce biases

due to the effects of omitted time-varying state-specific confounding factors.

        Our main analysis is of the use of maternity leave. By construction, almost all individuals

in control groups 1, 2, and 3 have a zero value for this outcome, as they do not have newly-born

children.14 We also present results using a broader measure of leave-taking that adds in “other

types of leave”, which includes work absences due to vacation/personal days, child care

problems, other family/personal obligations, or other reasons. This is of potential interest

because mothers may use accrued vacation and sick leave (or related sources) as a way to take

time off work to care for infants (Han et al., 2009). In addition, we provide results for these other

13
  In all cases, we further require the control groups to have some usual work hours during the previous year.
14
  A very small fraction of these control groups may be pregnant at the time of the survey (which we do not observe)
and so report being absent from work for maternity leave taken before the future child is born.


                                                      Page 8
types of leave alone as an informal placebo test, since California’s PFL policy should have no or

much weaker effects on these sources of work absences than on the use of maternity leave.

       We also study medium-term labor market outcomes of mothers, defined as those for

women with one- to three-year-old children. Specifically, we analyze: whether the mother

worked any hours during the last week, log hours worked last week, whether she worked any

usual hours during the last year, log usual hours last year, and the log wage income last year. The

outcomes related to employment last week indicate the mothers’ most current labor market

status; employment and wage income during the previous year measure labor market behavior

over a longer period of time.

        This analysis of medium-term outcomes introduces additional complexity because our

data cover only the survey reference week and previous year (i.e. the week and year before the

March CPS survey), whereas the births took place prior to that. One issue is that mothers may

have had additional children in the intervening period. For this reason, we do not classify

mothers based on age of the youngest child, because doing so would implicitly condition on no

subsequent births and introduce potential sample selection bias. Instead, we include information

on the ages of other children in the household, obtained using the family interrelationship

structure of the March CPS, as additional regressors, and assign California mothers of children

aged 1, 2, and 3 years old to separate treatment groups, as detailed below. Second, we do not

know the month of birth and so are not sure whether some children are born before or after the

implementation of PFL. Therefore, when examining mothers with 1-year-old children, we

classify survey years 2006-2010 as the post-treatment period and delete survey year 2005 from

the analysis (since we do not know whether 1-year-olds in 2005 were born before or after PFL

implementation). Similarly, for mothers of 2-year-olds, 2007-2010 constitutes the post-treatment



                                               Page 9
period and 2006 data are dropped (2-year-olds in 2005 were born prior to PFL), while for

mothers of 3-year-olds, 2008-2010 is the post-treatment period and the 2007 data are excluded.

       Table 1 presents summary statistics for our preferred leave-taking analysis sample,

consisting of the treatment group and control group 1 (mothers employed in the previous year

with youngest children aged 5 and over). All statistics are weighted by CPS person weights.

About 1% of women report using maternity leave in the reference week. This low rate of use is

expected since the control group almost never takes maternity leave and, even in the treatment

group, its use is generally limited to the period immediately after childbirth. Nearly 3% of

women are absent from work in the reference week for other reasons.

       The remainder of the table shows results when splitting the sample into treatment and

control groups, and separately by the pre- and post-PFL implementation periods (i.e. 1999-2004

versus 2005 and later). Notably, there is a substantial increase in maternity leave use for the

treatment group post-2004 relative to earlier – from 5.4 to nearly 11.7% -- whereas there is

essentially no reported use of maternity leave by the control group in either period. There is also

not much change in other types of leave-taking for either the treatment or control groups (rising

from 2.8 to 3.2% for the former and 1.3 to 1.6% for the latter), although higher absolute levels of

use for the treatment group suggest that these provide substitutes for formal parental leave in

some cases. This overall pattern of results indicates an absence of distinguishable trends in

general leave-taking during the period of analysis, while the substantial rise in maternity leave-

taking for the treatment group after 2004 may reflect the implementation of PFL in California.

       When considering medium-term labor market outcomes, nearly half of mothers with 1-,

2-, and 3-year-old children report working in the reference week, and nearly 60% during the last

year (see Appendix Table A.1 for details). There are no substantial changes in employment on



                                               Page 10
the extensive margin, between the pre- and post-PFL periods for any of the treatment groups, but

we do see suggestive evidence of an increase in work hours in the last week and year.

Empirical Methods

         We employ a standard difference-in-difference (DD) design comparing changes in leave-

taking for eligible California mothers of infants, surveyed pre- and post-2004, relative to

corresponding differences for comparison groups unlikely to be affected by PFL.15 Our primary

econometric specification takes the form:

         (1)

for individual i surveyed in year t.        is the outcome of interest (e.g. use of maternity leave).

          is a dummy variable set to one for mothers with children less than 1 year old at the

survey date who were employed in the previous year.                     is an indicator equal to 1 if the

individual was surveyed in 2005 or later, and 0 otherwise.               is a vector of individual

characteristics including indicators for: age (<20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+ years old),

race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, other), education (less than high school

graduate, high school graduate, some college, college graduate), marital status (married,

separated, divorced, widowed, never married), and US birth. We also control for age of the

youngest child when using control groups 1 and 3, and for state fixed effects and the state-year

unemployment rates when using control group 4.16 In (1),                is a vector of year fixed effects and

     is an individual-specific error term. The regressions incorporate CPS person weights and

robust standard errors are reported.17 The key coefficient            , measures the DD estimate of the

effect of PFL on the treatment group.


15
   Since we do not observe the child’s month of birth, we treat mothers with children aged <1 year surveyed in 2005
or later as being exposed to PFL, and treat survey years 1999-2004 as the pre-treatment period.
16
          is omitted from this model because it is collinear with the year fixed effects.
17
   Unweighted regressions yield very similar results.


                                                     Page 11
        We present the results obtained from linear probability (LP) models, since marginal

effects on interaction terms in logit and probit models are more difficult to compute and interpret

(Ai and Norton, 2003). However, prior to doing so, we estimated LP and probit models for

equations corresponding to equation (1), except without the interaction term. The estimated

marginal effects were very similar, suggesting that the LP estimates provide useful information.

        We estimate a variant of equation (1) when examining how California’s paid family leave

program affects the medium-term labor market outcomes of mothers. As discussed, California

mothers with children aged 1, 2, and 3 years old are assigned to separate treatment groups, and

California mothers whose youngest children are 7-17 years old are placed in the control group.

These difference-in-difference regressions include additional controls for the exact ages of

younger children in the household.18 As discussed, survey years 2006-2010 are the post-

treatment period and 2005 data are dropped, when studying mothers of 1-year-olds; 2007-2010

(2008-2010) represents the post-treatment period and 2006 (2007) data are excluded when

examining mothers of 2-year-olds (3-year-olds).

Results

A. California’s PFL Program Increases Leave-Taking

        Table 2 presents the main set of results on leave-taking, using the four alternative control

groups. In each case, we find a statistically significant six to seven percentage point increase in

the likelihood of maternity leave-taking for the treatment group following PFL implementation

(column 1). The estimated effect is virtually identical for the broader definition of leave, which

adds in other forms of time off work (column 2). Conversely, the estimated impacts for leave-

taking other than maternity leave are miniscule and statistically insignificant (column 3),


18
  For instance, when women with 3-year-olds constitute the treatment group, we include indicators for children <1,
1 and 2 years old (three variables).


                                                     Page 12
providing evidence that the results are not due to spurious changes in leave-taking among the

treatment group.

        Magnitudes of the estimated effects are quite large. Pre-program maternity leave-taking

for the treatment group averages 5.4%. Relative to this baseline, our estimates suggest that PFL

increased leave use by 115 to nearly 140%, depending on the choice of control groups. Such

substantial effects seem reasonable since eligibility for California PFL is much wider than for

other programs and, particularly, contrasts with the firm size, work history and other exclusions

limiting eligibility under the FMLA. Moreover, some workers who cannot afford to take unpaid

time off work may be able to do so when receiving partial wage replacement.

        It is also informative to interpret these results in terms of effects on the length of

maternity leaves taken. We do not measure such durations directly but instead know whether

women with infants are on leave during the reference week. Under reasonable assumptions, we

can infer from this the percentage of weeks that such mothers use leave during their child’s first

year of life. Specifically, if they were on maternity leave 5.4% of the weeks during the pre-

program period, this corresponds to an average leave duration of 2.8 weeks (52 weeks ×

0.054/week). The findings above indicate that PFL increased leave-taking by 6.1 to 7.4

percentage points, corresponding to an additional 3.2 to 3.8 weeks of leave, and implying that

these mothers used between one-half and three-fifths of the paid leave made newly available to

them.

        The DD estimates could be biased if the “effects” of PFL are actually due to unobserved

factors affecting the treatment group differently than the control groups, or if they affect other

types of leave-taking in addition to maternity leave. We have already addressed the second of

these concerns, through our placebo tests on other types of leave. To examine the first



                                                Page 13
possibility, we conducted an additional falsification test by estimating DD specifications for

other states with temporary disability insurance program – Hawaii, New York, and Rhode Island

– but that did not implement paid family leave policies during the analysis period.19 Since other

TDI states offer some (although more limited than California) paid leave, it seems likely that we

would see qualitatively similar, although presumably smaller, estimated effects for these states if

the California results are due to unobserved correlates of paid leave-taking. By contrast, if PFL is

causing leave-taking to increase, we would not expect to see any effects for the other TDI states.

        The results of this falsification test are summarized in Table 3. Across all four control

groups, we see only small (two to three percentage point) and statistically insignificant effects of

the placebo PFL treatment post-2004.20 This raises the possibility that our previous estimates

slightly overstate the effects of California’s PFL program. However, the overall findings do not

change – for instance, even a three percentage point reduction due to unobserved confounding

factors would imply a 3.1 to 4.4 percentage point rise in leave-taking, corresponding to a 57 to

82% increase or an additional 1.6 to 2.3 weeks of leave.

        Finally, we tested the robustness of our main results to two additional alternative

specifications. In the first, we varied the minimum child age threshold for women in the control

group, estimating specifications where control group 1 was successively modified to include

mothers with youngest children aged 2-17, 3-17, 4-17, 5-17, 6-17, 7-17, or 8-17. In all cases,

PFL program was associated with a statistically significant 6.2 to 6.4 percentage point increase in

leave-taking. Second, to examine whether leave-taking in California might have been influenced


19
   Specifically, the treatment group consists of women with infants who were employed in the previous year and
resided in Hawaii, New York, and Rhode Island. Control groups 1, 2, and 3 consider the same populations as before
(in these states). The one change is that since New York is a TDI state, control group 4 now consists of women with
a youngest child <1 year old in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas (large non-TDI states). The other TDI state, New
Jersey, implemented a paid family leave policy in 2008 and so is excluded from this analysis.
20
   Conversely, main effects on leave-taking for the treatment group are large and statistically significant.


                                                     Page 14
by pre-existing differential trends between the treatment and control groups, we added to the

basic model, interactions between the treatment group dummy variable and indicators for time

periods 1-2 years and 3-4 years prior to PFL implementation (i.e. for 2002-2003 and 2000-2001

respectively). If there were differential trends, we would expect the coefficients on these

interactions to be large and significant. Instead, they were always small (-1 to 0.5 percentage

points) and insignificant, and their inclusion did not materially affect the estimated post-

treatment PFL effect.

B. California’s PFL Program Reduces Disparities in Leave-Taking

       We next investigate whether California’s PFL program had heterogeneous effects on the

leave-taking of women with infants, using our preferred specification, where the control group

consists of employed (in the previous year) women whose youngest children are aged 5-17. As

mentioned, past research suggests that unpaid maternity leave primarily benefits relatively

advantaged (e.g. college-educated and married) mothers and so it is interesting to examine

whether paid time off work makes leave-taking more accessible to disadvantaged mothers.

       Tables 4 and 5 present difference-in-difference estimates of the effects of PFL on leave-

taking for subgroups of women stratified by education (high school degree or less, some college,

college or more), marital status, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic). We

present the pre- and post-period means (descriptive statistics) for the treatment and control

groups, as well as the simple pre versus post and treatment versus control differences and the

corresponding differences-in-differences (in bold), again without other controls. Finally, in each

panel, the bottom rows and right-most columns present regression-adjusted differences, from

models that include all of the demographic controls; the (bolded) regression-adjusted difference-




                                               Page 15
in-difference estimate comes from the key interaction coefficient in equation (1), estimated for

each subgroup.21

        Differences in baseline leave-taking across demographic groups are striking. For

example, in the pre-program period (1999-2004), only 2% of non-college educated treatment

group mothers employed reported being on maternity leave during the reference week; this

contrasts with over 9% of corresponding mothers with a college degree or more. Just 2% of

unmarried treatment group mothers were on maternity leave, versus 6% of their married

counterparts, and only 2% of such black mothers, as opposed to 7% of non-Hispanic whites.

        Although rights to paid parental leave increased its use among all groups of mothers, both

the relative and absolute magnitudes of the effects are larger for the disadvantaged. For example,

leave-taking among new mothers with a high school degree and some college rose 5.3 and 7.8

percentage points, respectively, compared to a statistically insignificant 4 points for mothers with

a college degree (see Table 4). Leave-taking grew 7.3 percentage points for unmarried mothers,

versus 6.0 points for their married counterparts. The increases are estimated to be 11.8 and 6.0

percentage points among black and Hispanic mothers, as compared to a statistically insignificant

4.4 points among non-Hispanic whites. Similar patterns are obtained using the broader definition

of leave (see Table 5).22

        The growth in leave-taking was even larger for disadvantaged versus advantaged new

mothers, when measured in relative terms, given their lower rates of baseline usage. For instance,

the use of maternity leave increased over threefold for non-college educated mothers with infants

(from 2.4 to 7.7%), nearly fivefold for those who were unmarried (from 1.9 to 9.3%), and

21
   We omit appropriate controls for each subgroup specification. For example, race covariates are omitted when we
estimate regressions separately by race. The single treatment-control regression-adjusted differences also include
year fixed effects.
22
   The tables also show that the control group saw essentially no change in maternity leave-taking or in the broader
measure of leave use,


                                                      Page 16
sevenfold for blacks (from 2.0 to 13.7%).23 These results imply that non-college educated,

unmarried and black treatment group mothers increased average time on leave from around 1

week to about 4, 5, and 7 weeks, respectively. By contrast, college-educated, married, and non-

Hispanic white mothers were predicted to use 6 to 7 weeks of paid leave after implementation of

California’s PFL program, versus 5, 3, and 4 weeks before it. The California paid leave program

thus substantially reduced previous disparities in leave-taking.

C. Medium-Term Effects on Maternal Labor Market Outcomes

        We explore the medium-term effects of California PFL on labor market outcomes –

specifically looking at mothers whose children are aged 1, 2, or 3. Two restrictions limit the

scope of this investigation. First, the March CPS data do not permit us to directly identify women

affected by the program, because we do not observe whether these mothers were employed

around the time of childbirth. Second, the recent implementation of the program implies that the

post-treatment period is short.

        Table 6 summarizes the results. As expected, given the relatively small number of post-

treatment years and our inability to identify employment in the birth year, many of the estimates

are imprecise. The most consistent finding is that paid leave rights are estimated to raise

reference week work hours by a statistically significant 6 to 9%, conditional on being employed

(the estimate is statistically significant at the 5% level for mothers of 1- and 3-year-olds, and

marginally significant at the 10% level for mothers of 2-year-olds). This corresponds to 2 to 3

additional hours of work, from the pre-PFL baseline average of around 35 hours. We also see

marginally significant 5 to 6% increases in usual weekly work hours during in the previous year.

California PFL is also associated with a (statistically insignificant) increase in wage income


23
   These estimates are calculated by adding to the predicted treatment group pre-program levels of leave-taking
(from the first column of the table) the regression-adjusted DD estimate (the last cell in each panel).


                                                   Page 17
during the previous year consistent with what we would expect given the increase in work hours,

although lack of precision implies that these estimates should be interpreted with caution. There

is no evidence that the availability of paid family leave affected subsequent employment

probabilities, and small sample sizes imply that we do not have the statistical power to test for

differences across subgroups of mothers.

Discussion

        An important objective of government-provided entitlements to parental leave is to allow

parents (particularly mothers) to have more time at home following the birth of a child. Yet there

is a good deal of evidence that rights to largely unpaid leave in the United States have had only

limited success in accomplishing this goal. For example, Han et al. (2008) find that two-thirds of

women giving birth in 2001 and employed during pregnancy, returned to work within three

months after birth. Laughlin (2011) shows that 43% of women becoming first-time mothers

between 2006 and 2008, and who worked until the last month before delivery, had returned to

jobs within one month after childbirth.24 Our analysis suggests that new mothers in California

typically only took around 3 weeks of maternity leave, prior to the availability of PFL.

        This limited leave-taking probably results, at least in part, from restrictions on the

eligibility for job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act and, even for those

who qualify, difficulties in financing unpaid time off work. The latter issue is particularly salient

for disadvantaged mothers, who generally earn less and have fewer financial resources. The

provision of payment during the leave period may help to ameliorate these difficulties, thereby

both raising overall leave-taking and reducing disparities in its use.




24
  Moreover, Laughlin (2011) indicates that 26% of women employed during pregnancy either quit or were let go
from their jobs, implying that even this relatively rapid return to work overstates the use of maternity leave.


                                                     Page 18
       Our study of California’s first in the nation paid family leave program verifies both

possibilities. We show that the overall use of maternity (but not paternity) leave increased by an

average of 3 to 4 weeks, after the program was enacted, with especially large growth occurring

for non-college educated, unmarried, and nonwhite mothers. These groups typically used only

around 1 week of leave, prior to the enactment of PFL, compared to between 3 and 5 weeks for

their advantaged counterparts. After rights to paid leave were provided, however, high school

educated, unmarried, and black mothers took 4, 5, and 7 weeks of leave, respectively,

approaching the estimated 6 to 7 weeks used by their more advantaged peers.

       Parental leave entitlements may also either help or damage the longer-run labor market

outcomes of women. For instance, they may provide benefits by increasing job continuity, and

thereby preserving job-specific human capital, or be harmful, if they cause employers to restrict

the jobs available to women. Our exploratory analysis of medium-term outcomes fails to uncover

any negative effects but instead provides suggestive evidence of 6 to 9% increases in work hours,

conditional on employment, 1 to 3 years after the birth, and possibly with similar growth in wage

income.

       Our analysis indicates that California’s PFL program achieved the first-order objective of

increasing leave-taking among new mothers, particularly those who are disadvantaged.

Moreover, it probably did not damage their medium-term labor market outcomes and may have

yielded some benefits. It would next be of interest to understand the impacts for longer-term

outcomes for both mothers and their children. In regard to the latter, prior research finds that

maternity leave extends durations of breast-feeding, but with mixed evidence on the impact for

children’s future health and development (Ruhm and Waldfogel, in press). Even with California

PFL, the time mothers spend at home with newborns remains relatively short, in comparison to



                                               Page 19
leaves taken in Canada and European countries. That said, leave-taking during the first weeks

and months of a child’s life may be particularly beneficial, so, it will be of great interest to

examine longer-term effects for health and development, as the children afforded coverage by

California’s PFL grow older, and data on such outcomes become available.

Notes: Each column in each panel is from a separate regression. The data come from the 1999-2010 March CPS surveys. The treatment group
consists of women with a youngest child aged <1 year in the household who reported working any hours last year and who reside in California. All
regressions include controls for age categories (<20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+), indicators for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black,
Hispanic, other), indicators for marital status (married, divorced, separated, widowed, never-married), an indicator for being born in the US, and
indicators for education categories (<HS, HS, some college, college+). All regressions include dummies for the year of the survey. The regressions in
the 1st and 3rd panels (Control Groups 1 and 3) also include indicators for single years of youngest child's age.The regressions in the 4th panel
(Control Group 4) include state fixed effects and state-year unemployment rates. Standard errors are robust to heterogeneity.

Notes: The data come from the 1999-2010 March CPS surveys. The treatment group consists of women with a youngest child aged <1 year in the
household who reported working any hours last year and who reside in California. Control group 1 consists of women with a youngest child aged 5-17
years in the household who reported working any hours last year and who reside in California.
The outcome is an indicator for being absent from work last week for maternity leave. Regression-adjusted differences control for age categories
(<20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+), indicators for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, other), indicators for marital status (married,
divorced, separated, widowed, never-married), an indicator for being born in the US, and indicators for education categories (<HS, HS, some college,
college+). The treatment-control regression-adjusted differences and the regression-adjusted differences-in-differences also include indicators for
youngest child's single years of age, and dummies for the year of the survey -- appropriate controls are omitted for subgroup analysis.
Significance levels: +p<0.10 **p<0.05 ***p<0.001. All statistics are weighted by the March CPS Supplement person weights.

Notes: Each column in each panel is from a separate regression. The data come from the 1999-2010 March CPS surveys. The sample of analysis
includes women whose youngest children are in the household in California. The control group consists of women with a youngest child aged 7-
17 years in the household who reside in California. Regressions in panel A are estimated on a sample omitting year 2005; regressions in panel B
are estimated on a sample omitting year 2006; regressions in panel C are estimated on a sample omitting year 2007. Regressions in panel A
control for whether the woman has any other children < 1, regressions in panel B control for whether the woman has any other children aged <1
or 1, and regressions in panel C control for whether the woman has any other children aged <1, 1, or 2. All regressions include controls for
mother's age categories (<20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+), indicators for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, other),
indicators for marital status (married, separated, divorced, never-married), an indicator for being born in the US, indicators for education
categories (<HS, HS, some college, college+), and indicators for youngest child's single years of age. All regressions include dummies for the year
of the survey. Standard errors are robust to heterogeneity.
Significance levels: +p<0.10 **p<0.05 ***p<0.001. All regressions are weighted by the March CPS Supplement person weights.
