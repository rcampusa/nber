                                             ABSTRACT

Mexico's experience before and after trade liberalization presents a challenge to neoclassical trade

theory. Though labor abundant, it nevertheless exported skill-intensive goods and protected labor-

intensive sectors prior to liberalization. Post-liberalization, the relative wage of skilled workers rose.

Courant and Deardorff (1992) have shown theoretically that an extremely uneven distribution of

factors within a country can induce behavior at odds with overall comparative advantage. We

demonstrate the importance of this insight for developing countries. We show that Mexican regions

exhibit substantial variation in skill abundance, offer significantly different relative factor rewards,

and produce disjoint sets of industries. This heterogeneity helps to both undermine Mexico's

aggregate labor abundance and motivate behavior that is more consistent with relative skill

abundance.

       The increase in income inequality experienced by many Latin American countries

after trade liberalization presents a challenge to neoclassical trade theory. If a country is

relatively labor abundant, then an increase in openness should boost the relative return of

less-skilled labor and cause a decline in income inequality rather than an increase. In

fact, the relative demand for skill in Latin America rose following liberalization (Wood

1997). The rising demand for skill in Mexico, one of the first Latin American countries

to liberalize, has received considerable attention (Cragg and Epelbaum 1996, Revenga

1997, Feenstra and Hanson 1997, Meza 1999, Feliciano 2000, Robertson 2000, Esquivel

and Rodriguez-Lopez 2003, Verhoogen 2004).

       A partial explanation for this trend is that tariff reductions raised the relative price

of skill-intensive goods.    Hanson and Harrison (1999) and Robertson (2004), for

example, show that, prior to liberalization, Mexico imposed higher tariffs on labor-

intensive goods and that, after liberalization, the country disproportionately reduced

tariffs on labor-intensive products. Robertson (2004) demonstrates that tariff changes

alone account for about one third of the change in Mexican relative prices.               This

explanation, however, merely raises the more fundamental question of why a labor-

abundant country like Mexico would act in a manner inconsistent with theory and protect

its abundant rather than scarce factor.

       Relatively high protection for labor-intensive sectors is not the only puzzling

feature of Latin American trade. Mexico’s relatively high exports of skill-intensive

goods, for example, also contradict theory. Before 1986, the year Mexico joined the

GATT, more than half of the country’s exports were in Chemicals and Machinery, which

use skilled workers relatively intensively (Figure 1). Table 1 reveals that these industries
                                                                                             1

have the third and fourth highest average education levels and the second and fourth

highest non-production to production worker ratios in Mexico. Exports of textiles, which

are relatively labor-intensive, in contrast, were low. As a result, Mexico’s trade pattern,

like its tariff structure, was more consistent with that of a skill-abundant country than a

skill-scarce country.

        In this paper, we argue that Mexico’s behavior is driven in part by its internal

distribution of factors. Courant and Deardorff (1992) have shown theoretically that

extreme factor “lumpiness” across regions within a country can prompt production and

trade patterns that contradict the country’s overall comparative advantage. To our

knowledge, their contribution has not yet found any empirical support. Our focus on

Mexico’s factor lumpiness here, therefore, serves to both highlight the empirical

relevance of Courant and Deardorff’s result and to help resolve a puzzle about the effect

of liberalization in Latin America that has received a great deal of attention in the

literature.

        In Mexico’s case, sufficient regional concentration of skilled workers forces skill-

abundant regions to offer relatively low skilled wages and thereby specialize in the

production of relatively skill-intensive goods. As a result, the country becomes a net

importer of labor-intensive products and has an incentive to protect its abundant rather

than scarce factor. In the language of trade theory, factor lumpiness distributes Mexican

regions across two or more cones of diversification, where the word cone refers to the set

of region endowment vectors that select the subset of industries in which regions

specialize.

        We examine the plausibility of factor lumpiness as an explanation for Mexico’s

behavior by testing one of its key implications, namely whether relative factor prices are
                                                                                          2
                                      Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


equal across the country’s regions. We use a technique developed by Bernard and Schott

(2003) that is based on very general assumptions about production, markets and

unobserved differences in region-industry factor quality. We find that the relative skilled

wage varies significantly and substantially across Mexican regions and that this variation

is associated with product-mix specialization.               As implied by theory, regional skill

abundance and the relative skilled wage are negatively correlated.

         Our analysis demonstrates that Courant and Deardorff’s insight is particularly

important for understanding the impact of trade liberalization on developing countries. In

a skill-abundant country like the United States, skilled-worker lumpiness merely

reinforces aggregate comparative advantage by promoting relatively higher exports of

skill-intensive goods.1        In labor-abundant countries like Mexico, however, extreme

regional concentration of skilled workers can result in exporting and import protection

that contradict the implications of the standard model.

         As a result, our findings highlight the usefulness of factor lumpiness in explaining

why Latin America presents such a persistent “challenge to conventional wisdom”

(Wood 1997).         They also emphasize the need for further empirical and theoretical

research into its consequences. Table 2, for example, reveals that Latin America as a

whole, and Mexico in particular, have exceptionally high rates of urbanization among

developing countries. If skilled workers tend to cluster in cities to a greater extent in

Latin America than in other parts of the developing world, then Latin American

economies may be more susceptible to rising income inequality as they liberalize. More

generally, reducing trade barriers in Latin America may have very different consequences

than similar reforms in Asia or Africa, where skilled workers are distributed more evenly.

        This paper makes two additional contributions to the study of globalization. First,

our findings regarding intra-national factor price equality complement the broader

literature on the extent to which relative factor prices are equal across countries. Indeed,

given that regions within a country may more closely approximate an integrated

equilibrium than countries within the world trading system, a lack of relative factor price

equality within a country casts further doubt upon its existence internationally.2

        Our analysis also reveals that gauging the degree of regional specialization within

countries is critical for understanding the within-country effects of trade liberalization

across countries. By expanding the set of goods countries produce, factor lumpiness

extends the product-mix overlap of countries with very different relative factor

endowments. This expansion elevates the level of direct competition between countries

with markedly different relative wages, thereby rendering them susceptible to relative

wage movements via price-wage arbitrage that would not occur under a more even

internal distribution of factors.

        The remainder of the paper unfolds in six sections. First, we review the findings

of Courant and Deardorff (1992) to illustrate how factor lumpiness influences production

and trade patterns. Since we do not extend the theory, we present only a brief graphical

description to illustrate the basic concepts. In Section II we describe the data and stylized

facts that emerge from them. Section III outlines our test for factor price equality.

Empirical results are presented in Sections IV and Section V discusses the potential

influence of maquiladora production on our results. Section VI concludes.

I. Trade and Lumpiness

           To illustrate the insights of Courant and Deardorff (1992), consider a world with

two goods (X and Y) that are produced with two factors (N and P for skilled workers and

unskilled workers, respectively) in a country with two regions (A and B). Further assume

that the country is small and open in the sense that it takes relative goods price as given,

and that factors do not move between regions within a country.3 The consumption vector

is therefore fixed, as relative consumption depends only on relative prices. Assume good

X is skill (N) intensive and good Y is labor (P) intensive.

           The basic intuition is straightforward. We begin by assuming that the two factors

are evenly distributed between the two regions and that the regions are of

(approximately) equal size. Given a usual production technology, the initial relative

endowment of factors within the country can be represented by the familiar Edgeworth

box shown in Figure 2 as point 1. The points along the upward sloping diagonal OAOB

are the points that represent an equal relative distribution of factors in the two regions A

and B.        Endowments falling into the area of the parallelogram OAaOBb represent

endowments that would elicit production of both goods by both regions as well as factor

price equalization (FPE) within the country. Along the diagonal OAOB both regions

would produce identical relative amounts of the two goods. Endowments within the

parallelogram above (below) the diagonal result in region A producing relatively more of

good X (Y).

    We address the empirical validity of this assumption later in the text.
                                                                                          5
                                      Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


         If factor N were reallocated from B to A, such as along the arrow from point 1 to

point 2, production of X would increase in A and fall in B until the border of the

parallelogram was reached. This would have no effect on international trade, however:

given fixed relative demand, the increased production of X in A is offset by a decrease in

the production of X in B.

         At the border of the parallelogram, however, region B would stop producing X

altogether and completely specialize in the production of Y. Moving further along the

arrow to point 2 (outside the parallelogram) increases the production of X by A without a

corresponding decrease in the production of X by B. Since world prices are fixed by

assumption, the excess production of X is exported. In fact, any endowment point in the

areas labeled “Export X” represents an allocation of factors that is sufficiently lumpy to

induce exporting of X.

         Regional endowments within the parallelogram result in relative factor price

equalization across regions. As a result, factor allocations from point 1 to the border of

the parallelogram have no effect on relative wages. Once the endowment point crosses

the border, however, regional relative wages and product mix diverge. It is precisely this

implication of the model – a breakdown of relative factor price equality and concomitant

differences in regional product mix – that we test for in the Mexican data.4

         The relationship between factor lumpiness and the pattern of trade protection is

straightforward.       Without geographically concentrated factors, the relative wage of

skilled workers in Mexico would fall with trade costs as Mexico takes advantage of its


4
  Deardorff (1994) offers an alternate approach for verifying factor lumpiness that indirectly tests for the
conditions that give rise to factor price equality, i.e. whether the factor abundance of regions is bounded by
the factor intensity of industries as illustrated in Figure 2. The reliability of this approach, however,
depends upon the relative aggregation of industries and regions (Debaere 2004 and Bernard et al. 2004).
                                                                                                             6
                                    Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


overall comparative advantage in labor-intensive goods. With skilled-worker lumpiness,

however, the relative wage of skilled workers rises because opening to trade increases

exports of the skill-intensive good, raising its price and the relative wage of skilled

workers along with it. Since there is no mechanism for unbalanced trade, increased

exports of the skill-intensive good mandate greater imports of the less-skill-intensive

good, providing an incentive for protection of the abundant factor.

        A many-good, multiple-cone equilibrium extension of the model can be

represented with the traditional Lerner diagram displayed in Figure 3.                     The figure

displays two Mexican regions, MA and MB, which have equal numbers of unskilled

workers but an unequal allocation of skilled workers. These regions inhabit cones of

diversification defined by four goods, denoted by Leontief unit value isoquants, that

increase in skill intensity from 1 to 4.5 The skill intensities of each good are noted by

dashed lines emanating from the origin.               Figure 3 also notes Mexico’s aggregate

endowment point.

        Without lumpiness Mexico occupies the middle cone of diversification. In this

position, it would be a producer of goods 2 and 3 and offer workers the same relative

wage, w AN / w AP , in each region. Assuming it was sufficiently labor abundant within the

middle cone of diversification, it would be also be an exporter of relatively labor-

intensive good 2 and an importer of goods 4, 3 and 1. As a result, protection of the skill-

intensive import sector would be most likely. As a resident of the middle cone, aggregate

Mexico would produce one good that overlaps with the most skill-abundant cone and one

                                                                                                          7

good that overlaps with the most skill-scarce cone. Occupants of these cones might

include United States and China, respectively.

         Factor lumpiness within Mexico forces MB into a more labor-intensive cone of

diversification than region MA via the same logic outlined above. As a result, MB

produces goods 1 and 2 rather than 2 and 3 and offers a relatively high skilled wage

compared to region MA, i.e. w AN / w AP < wBN / wBP . The geographic concentration of skilled

workers induces the country into being an exporter of the relatively skill-intensive good

(3) and an importer of its relatively labor-intensive good (2), thus changing the country’s

incentives for protection.           Indeed, the potential demand for import protection is

heightened by the fact that MB now produces a product-mix (goods 1 and 2) that is

identical to the product mix of the world’s most labor-abundant countries. As a result,

relative wages in Mexico are susceptible to product price movements in good 1 as well as

goods 2 and 3. Declines in the relative price of good 1, due to China’s emergence as a

major exporter, for example, lower the relative wage of low-skilled workers in region MB

and heighten the country’s overall income inequality more so than would occur if the

country’s factors were evenly distributed.

         Both Hanson and Harrison (1999) and Robertson (2004) speculate that the threat

of competition from countries more labor-abundant than Mexico may have been a factor

in the country’s decision to protect labor-intensive industries relatively heavily both

before and after joining the GATT in 1986.6 Factor lumpiness – by increasing the set of

  Hanson and Harrison (1999) present evidence showing that, prior to GATT, Mexican tariffs were higher
on less-skill-intensive industries. This pattern remains after GATT as well. A bivariate, industry-level
regression of average MFN tariff rates (percent) on industry skill intensity (i.e., the ratio of non-production
to production workers), weighted by industry employment, yields coefficients (and standard errors) of -17.6
(4.7) and -7.1 (2.5) for 1985 and 1987, respectively. The relatively large tariff reductions on less-skill-
                                                                                                             8
                                    Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


industries Mexico and the world’s most labor-abundant countries produce in common –

provides a rationale for this concern.         Indeed, the expansion of Mexico’s product mix

means that relative wages in Mexico are influenced by a greater number of goods via

price-wage arbitrage than would be the case if all regions of the country inhabited the

middle cone of diversification.

        It may seem intuitively appealing to suggest that Mexico had an incentive to

protect and be a net importer of labor-intensive goods in the absence of factor lumpiness

if it were primarily concerned about trade with relatively labor-abundant trading partners.

Several facts, however, are at odds with this explanation. First, data from the NBER

trade database show that, from 1970 to 1992, Mexico’s annual average trade share with

countries that were clearly relatively skill abundant was greater than 90 percent

throughout the period, including the United States and Canada (69 percent), Europe7 (16

percent), and Japan, Australia, and New Zealand (5 percent).                      Second, Mexico’s

dominant import substitution industrialization paradigm, which shaped tariffs and is often

said to have formally ended when Mexico joined the GATT, was motivated by concerns

about the adverse effects of trade with more-developed, not less-developed, countries.

These facts suggest that concern about trade with more labor-abundant countries –

without factor lumpiness – is not a compelling explanation of Mexico’s behavior.

to change the protection bias towards less-skill-intensive industries.

         The ideal data for analyzing lumpiness in Mexico would include comprehensive

information (over both regions and industries) on employment and wages over a

relatively long time period. Mexico's Industrial Census, conducted by the Institutio

Nactional de Estadística Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), Mexico's national statistical

agency, is well suited for this exercise. For this study, we use manufacturing data from

the 1986, 1989, 1995, and 19998 Industrial Censuses, which provide data for the prior

year.    The Census contains information on the employment of production workers

(obreros) and non-production workers (empleados), as well as aggregate payments to

each type of worker (the wagebills).9 The data classify Mexican industries using the

Clasificación Mexicana de Actividades y Productos (CMAP) which, over all years,

contains 314 six-digit industrial categories (the industries listed in Table 1 represent the

first two digits of the six-digit classification system).

         The data cover 32 Mexican regions (31 states and the Federal District (basically

Mexico City)). Figure 4 shows the Mexican states, and Table 3a shows the distribution

of total manufacturing employment across states. In 1985, the central region of Mexico

(Mexico City and Mexico State) had 35% of all manufacturing employment. This share

falls over time, which Hanson (1997) notes and attributes to trade liberalization that shifts

the focus of the market towards the border. (We discuss this shift in more detail in

Section V.)

         Table 3b reports the number of industries produced in each region. The number

of industries is highest in Mexico State and Mexico City and lowest in Baja California

  Use non-production worker status as a proxy for skilled workers seems to capture much of the skill
segregation between industries in Mexico. Robertson (2004) shows that Mexican production workers have
less education in every industry than non-production workers, and that industries with a higher ratio of non-
production workers also have higher average education levels.

Sur, Campeche, Queretaro and Quintana Roo. A key implication of factor lumpiness is

that regions in different cones produce different sets of goods. Below, we test whether

product mix overlap across regions is a function of estimated relative factor rewards.



III. Production Structure and Relative Wages

        We test for the equality of relative wages across Mexican states using an

empirical approach developed by Bernard and Schott (2003). This test is robust to

differences in unobserved factor quality as well as variation in the composition of factors

both across regions and industries. We briefly review the derivation of the approach

here.

        We begin by assuming that production in industry j and region r can be

represented with a constant returns to scale technology that combines quality-adjusted

skilled workers (N) , unskilled workers (P) , and capital (K). Using B to denote the unit

cost function, θ rjz to denote the unobserved quality of factor z, and wrz to represent the

wage of the quality-adjusted factor z, cost minimization generates the following relative

demand for observed labor:

                                   N% rj θ rjP ∂Brj / ∂wrN
                                        =                  .                             (1)
                                   P%rj θ rjN ∂Brj / ∂wrP

The null hypothesis is that quality-adjusted relative wages are the same across all regions

within each industry. Under the null, observed wages differ across regions within an

industry only because of unobserved differences in factor quality. Using region s as a

benchmark and a tilde (~) to denote observed values, observed relative wages can be

represented as

                                          w% rP θ rjN w% sP

        If we then multiply observed relative wages and employments in (1) and (2), the

unobserved factor quality terms cancel out.                 If quality-adjusted relative wages are

equalized across regions and relative unit factor input requirements are the same, then

observed relative wage bills W% would equalize across regions:

                                           W%rjN W%sjN
                                                =      .                                       (3)
                                           W%rjP W%sjP

The alternative hypothesis is that quality-adjusted relative wages differ across regions r

and s by a factor γ rs . The source of the regional variation in quality-adjusted relative

wages is taken to be exogenous and can include variation in factor endowments, trade

costs, or non-tradable amenities. A key implication is that relative unit inputs would also

vary within an industry, which, in turn, implies that observed relative wage bills differ

across regions. The difference in wage bills would be a function of γ rs , which we

represent as η rsj ( γ rs ). Under the alternative hypothesis,

                                         W%rjN        W%sjN
                                               = η rsj % P ,                                   (4)
                                         W% P
                                           rj         W     sj



so that a finding that η rsj ≠ 1 is sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. To test this

hypothesis empirically, we normalize the relative wage bill in each region r by the

relative wage bill in some region s. Taking logs, we then obtain the following empirical

specification:

                                      ⎛ RWrj    ⎞
                                   ln ⎜         ⎟⎟ = ∑ r α r d r + ε rsj

                                      ⎜ RWsj
                                      ⎝          ⎠


                                                                                               12

in which RW=WN/WP, dr is a set of regional dummy variables, and ε rsj is a stochastic

error term. Finding that the set of regional dummy variables is jointly significant is the

empirical analog to finding that ηrsj ≠ 1 and therefore is sufficient to reject the null

hypothesis. Furthermore, as described by Bernard and Schott, positive estimated values

of α rs imply lower relative wages for skilled workers in region r relative to the base

region.



IV. Empirical Results

A. Baseline Estimates

          We begin by estimating (5) using all of Mexico as the base region. The base

region relative wage is calculated by summing the wage bill for each of the two types of

workers across all regions by industry, and then dividing these sums. The relative wage

for each industry-region is calculated by summing all of the payments to each type of

worker within each industry-region and taking the ratio of the sums. The dependent

variable in (5) is the latter divided by the former.

          Table 4 contains the initial results for each census year. Several results are

noteworthy.     First, nearly all of the estimated coefficients on the regional dummy

variables are statistically significant. They are also jointly significant, which is sufficient

to reject the null hypothesis of factor price equalization across Mexican states. Second,

the vast majority of coefficients are negative. In fact, there are only two statistically

significant positive coefficients: Mexico City and Mexico State. These two regions have

the largest shares of manufacturing employment as well as the largest shares of skilled

workers.

                                                                                            13
                               Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


       Table 4 also shows the results to be relatively stable across time periods. In all

years, Mexico and Mexico City are the only regions with positive and statistically

significant coefficients. As well, the vast majority of the coefficients that are negative

and significant in 1985 are also negative and significant in 1999. The similarity of

coefficients across time in Table 4 also reveals that relative wage differences are

relatively stable. The estimated coefficients for Mexico State, for example, are the same

in 1986 and 1999. For Mexico City, the coefficients for 1986 and 1999 are 0.218 and

0.233. Assuming a CES production function and an elasticity of substitution of 2.0, these

two estimates would correspond to relatively skill-abundant Mexico City having quality-

adjusted relative wages for skilled workers (compared to unskilled workers) that were

24% and 26% lower than the average for Mexico in 1986 and 1999. Comparing the

states of Mexico and Puebla, the results suggest that quality-adjusted relative wages for

skilled workers in relatively skill-scarce Puebla were 52% higher than those in the state

of Mexico.

       One potential concern with the results in Table 4 is that they might be overly

dependent on the presence of Mexico City and Mexico State. We therefore drop Mexico

City and Mexico State from the data and repeat the analysis. Table 5 contains the results.

As indicated in the table, overall results without these two regions are very similar to

those reported in Table 4. The relatively poor states (Oaxaca, Michoacan, Guerrero)

remain near the bottom, and Nuevo Leon emerges at the top. The results in Table 5 are

also stable across time. The Pearson correlation coefficient between 1985 and 1999 is

0.908 and all pairwise Pearson coefficients (matching all possible year combinations) are

above 0.90. Mexico City and Mexico State certainly do stand out as positive outliers, but



                                                                                       14
                                 Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


the same states emerge near the bottom with large, negative, and significant coefficients

regardless of whether or not Mexico City and Mexico State are included.

        The relative stability of the estimates raises the question of labor mobility within

Mexico: why is it that persistent regional relative wage differentials are not arbitraged

away by the movement of labor across regions?                       Hanson (2003), using Mexican

Population Census data, finds within-country migration to be relatively small; workers

within Mexico do not seem to move enough to erase large regional wage differentials.

Topel (1986) suggests that less-skilled workers are less mobile than more skilled

workers, which may apply to Mexico. If migration costs (including information) are

higher than the expected gains, workers will not migrate to erase regional wage

differentials.



B. Relative Wages and the Production Structure

        The results in Table 4 suggest that relative wages are not equalized across regions

within Mexico. Theory predicts that regional variation in relative wages coincides with

differences in regional production patterns. We test for such differences formally via the

OLS regression

                            Z rs = β 0 + β1 αˆ rs + β 2 I r + β 3 I s + υrs ,                (6)

where Zrs represents a the number of industries common to regions r and s, the αˆ rs are the

estimated bilateral relative wage bill differences from equation (5), and the final term

represents a stochastic error. The intuition behind this regression is that regions that have

larger differences in estimated relative wages should have fewer industries in common. Ir

and Is represent the number of industries produced by regions r and s, respectively, and

                                                                                             15
                                        Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


are included to capture the possibility that simply having more industries makes industry

overlap between other regions more likely.

           The results are shown in Table 6. In all census years, the number of industries in

common falls as the absolute difference in the relative wage bill rises. This evidence

offers strong and consistent support for the idea that the differences in regional relative

wages affect the distribution of regional production. Based on the results in Table 4 for

1999, the estimated relative wage differences between Mexico City and Guerrero

accounted for 23 fewer industries in common.

           The results of this section are sufficient to reject relative factor price equality

across Mexican states. Together with our estimates of product mix differences across

states, these results lend support for the view that Mexico’s distribution of factors is

lumpy enough to influence the country’s pattern of trade and, therefore, its pattern of

trade protection.



V. The Role of Foreign Investment

           An important trend in Mexican manufacturing over the past 25 years has been the

development of maquiladora establishments.                   Maquiladoras are “in-bond” assembly

plants that import parts into Mexico, assemble them, and then export the assembled

products.10 In this section we show that maquiladoras are concentrated in relatively skill-

scarce industries in relatively skill-scarce regions. As a result, it does not appear as if

their rise over time explains Mexico’s status as a net exporter of relatively skill-intensive

goods.

     For a good introduction to the maquiladora industry, see Vargas (1999).
                                                                                             16
                                    Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


          Maquiladoras are primarily foreign owned and, by law, had to locate in the U.S.

border region prior to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This was to

the advantage of the firms, since this location minimized transportation costs of imported

inputs.    It also worked to the advantage of the Mexican government because the

government considered the maquiladora program part of its border development

program.11 In any case, since they exist for assembly, it is perhaps not surprising that

they would locate in regions that historically have had a higher proportion of less-skilled

workers. Figure 5 reports the concentration of maquiladora employment by state in 2000,

while Figure 6 illustrates the rise in maquiladora establishments and employment from

1978 to 2003.

          Feenstra and Hanson (1997) have shown that maquiladoras raise the relative

demand for skilled workers. We, too, find that controlling for industry, maquiladoras do

employ a higher ratio of non-production workers than other manufacturing plants.12

Official statistics, however, reveal that maquiladoras are concentrated in relatively low-

skill industries as measured by production worker intensity. This concentration is evident

in Table 7, which compares the industrial census data described above with official

maquiladora statistics.13 Two trends are noteworthy. First, the tendency of maquiladoras

to produce in low-skill industries is manifest in the non-production worker to production

worker employment ratio being lower in maquiladoras than in overall manufacturing in


11
   In fact, the maquiladora program was established in response to the end of the Bracero Program in 1965
when Mexico needed an employment strategy for migrant workers returning from the United States.
12
   Using data from Mexico's ENESTYC, we estimate a plant-level regression from the 1992 survey of the
non-production/production worker ratio on a maquila dummy variable, the amount spent on machinery and
equipment, two-digit industry dummy variables, and a constant (N=4855). The maquiladora variable has a
coefficient (standard error) of 0.485 (0.146). See Alvarez and Robertson (2004) for a more detailed
description of these data.
13
   Maquiladora data are available from INEGI at
http://dgcnesyp.inegi.gob.mx/BDINE/J15/J1500002.HTM.
                                                                                                      17
                                Is Mexico a Lumpy Country?


all regions. Taking into account each state’s share of maquiladora employment in total

manufacturing employment (in the first column of Table 7) indicates that this disparity

can be quite strong. The Census versus Maquiladora N/P ratios for Baja California Norte

in 1998, for example, are 0.153 and 0.078, respectively, even though 87 percent of the

state’s manufacturing workers are employed by maquiladoras.             Second, the table

indicates that Southern states generally have very little, if any, maquiladora employment.

       We also find that the large increase in maquiladoras does not explain Mexico's

relatively large exports of skill-intensive goods. First, the results just reported indicate

that though maquiladoras are more non-production worker intensive when controlling for

industry, they inhabit generally less-skill-intensive industries. Second, Mexico’s data

collection practices allow for a comparison of maquiladora versus non-maquiladora

exports. The discrete break 1991 in the export trends reported in Figure 1 occurs because

prior to that year, maquiladora exports were not counted as exports. As is evident from

the figure, their inclusion does result in a slight drop (increase) in the share Chemicals

(Machinery) exports, but the overall pattern of exporting remains the same.

       Finally, we note that maquiladoras may actually contribute to Mexico’s lumpiness

by attracting less-skilled workers to the border. Table 3a, for example, shows Mexico

City's falling share of manufacturing employment and the border's rising share of

employment.



VI. Conclusions

       Prior to trade liberalization, skill-scarce Mexico protected less-skill-intensive

industries and exported skill-intensive goods. One explanation for this puzzling behavior

is Courant and Deardorff’s (1992) theoretical insight that geographic concentration of
                                                                                         18

factors within a country can influence countries’ patterns of trade and production. A key

consequence of factor lumpiness is significant variation in regional relative wages. In

this paper we examine whether Mexico is a “lumpy” country by testing for intra-national

relative factor price equality. We find that the relative skilled wage varies significantly

across Mexican regions. We demonstrate that this variation is negatively correlated with

regional skill abundance and positively associated with regional product-mix

specialization, as implied by theory.   Our analysis implies that Mexico’s overall labor

abundance may be undermined by regional heterogeneity.

       Our findings suggest several extensions. First, with respect to the debate about

trade liberalization and wage inequality in developing countries, it would be useful to

measure the extent to which factor lumpiness contributes toward rising inequality in a

broader set of countries. Mexico’s internal distribution of factors, for example, may be

different from those of other countries which experienced declining wage inequality

following trade liberalization (Wood 1997, Inter-American Development Bank 2002). It

would also be worthwhile to investigate whether Mexico's exports are more skill-

intensive than those from similarly endowed but less lumpy countries.

       Another fruitful extension of our analysis would be an examination of the

determinants of factor lumpiness, such as urban agglomeration. While we find in this

paper that Mexico is sufficiently lumpy to affect its trade and protection patterns, we do

not formally inquire into the extent to which this is due to the lure of cities versus the

influence of Mexico's unique northern border with the United States, where low-skill

workers have concentrated.

Notes: Total Employment and the ratio of non-production workers (N) to production workers (P)
come from the 1986 Mexican Industrial Census (data from 1985). Average wages come from the
Encuesta Industrial Mensual (because the Census does not have hours data) for 1988. Average
education data come from the Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Urbano for 1988. The averages are
simple averages (not weighted by production value). See Robertson (2004).
