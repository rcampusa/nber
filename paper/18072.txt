                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we use cross-industry, cross-country panel data to test whether industry growth is positively
affected by the interaction between the reactivity of real short term interest rates to the business cycle
and industry-level measures of financial constraints. Financial constraints are measured, either by
the extent to which an industry is prone to being "credit constrained", or by the extent to which it is
prone to being "liquidity constrained". Our main findings are that: (i) the interaction between credit
or liquidity constraints and monetary policy countercyclicality, has a positive, significant, and robust
impact on the average annual rate of labor productivity in the domestic industry; (ii) these interaction
effects tend to be more significant in downturns than in upturns.

          In this paper, we use cross-industry, cross-country panel data to test whether industry growth is
      positively aﬀected by the interaction between the reactivity of real short term interest rates to the
      business cycle and industry-level measures of financial constraints. Financial constraints are measured,
      either by the extent to which an industry is prone to being "credit constrained", or by the extent to
      which it is prone to being "liquidity constrained". Our main findings are that: (i) the interaction
      between credit or liquidity constraints and monetary policy countercyclicality, has a positive, significant,
      and robust impact on the average annual rate of labor productivity in the domestic industry; (ii) these
      interaction eﬀects tend to be more significant in downturns than in upturns.

1     Introduction
Macroeconomic textbooks usually draw a clear distinction between long run growth and its structural de-
terminants on the one hand, and macroeconomic policies (fiscal and monetary) aimed at achieving short run
stabilization on the other. In this paper we argue instead that stabilization policies can aﬀect growth in the
long run. Specifically, we provide evidence that countercyclical monetary policies, whereby real short term
interest rates are lower in recessions and higher in booms, have a disproportionately more positive impact
on long-run growth in industries that are more prone to being credit-constrained or in industries that are
more prone to being liquidity-constrained.
    In the first part of the paper, we present a simple model of an economy populated by entrepreneurs
who must borrow from outside investors to finance their investments. At the initial investment stage,
entrepreneurs may borrow on the credit market if they need to invest more than their initial wealth. Credit

markets are imperfect due to the limited pledgeability of the returns from the project to outside investors
(as in Holmström and Tirole, 1997). Once they are initiated, projects may either turn be "fast" and yield
full returns within one period after the initial investment has been sunk, or they may turn out to be "slow"
and require some reinvestment in order to yield returns within two periods. The probability of a project
being slow, and therefore requiring reinvestment, measures the degree of potential liquidity dependence of
the economy in the model. However, the actual degree of liquidity dependence will also depend upon the
aggregate state of the economy. More precisely, we assume that if the economy as a whole is in a boom, then
short-run profits are suﬃcient for entrepreneurs to finance the required reinvestment whenever they need to
do so (i.e whenever their project turns out to slow); in contrast, if the economy is in a slump, then reinvesting
requires that the entrepreneur downsize and delever her project (and therefore reduce her expected end-of-
project returns) in order to generate cash to pay for the reinvestment. However, the entrepreneur can
somewhat reduce the need for deleveraging in case the project is slow, if she decides ex ante to invest part of
her initial funds in liquid assets. Hoarding more liquidity reduces the need for ex post downsizing but this
comes at the expense of reducing the initial size of the project.
   A more countercyclical interest rate policy enhances ex ante investment by reducing the amount of
liquidity entrepreneurs need to hoard to weather liquidity shocks when the economy is in a slump. The
model generates two main predictions. First, the lower the fraction of returns that can be pledged to
outside investors, the more investment enhancing it is to implement a more countercyclical interest policy.
Second, the higher the liquidity risk measured by the probability that a project requires refinancing, the more
investment enhancing it is to conduct a more countercyclical interest rate policy. Third, the diﬀerential eﬀect
of more countercyclical interest rates across firms with diﬀerent degrees of liquidity dependence, is stronger
in recessions than in expansions.
   In the second part of the paper, we take these predictions to the data. Specifically, we build on the
methodology developed in the seminal paper by Rajan and Zingales (1998) and use cross-industry, cross-
country panel data to test whether industry growth is positively aﬀected by the interaction between monetary
policy cyclicality (i.e the sensitivity of short-run real interest rates to the business cycle, computed at the
country level) and industry-level measures of financial constraints computed for each corresponding industry
using U.S data. This approach provides a clear and net way to address causality issues. Indeed, any positive
correlation one might observe between the countercyclicality of macroeconomic policy and average long run
growth, might equally reflect the eﬀect of countercyclical policy on growth or the eﬀect of growth on a
country’s ability to pursue countercyclical policies. However, what makes us reasonably confident that our
regression results capture a causal link from countercyclical monetary policy to industry growth, is the fact
that: (i) we look at the eﬀect of macroeconomic policies implemented at the country level on industry-level
growth; (ii) individual industries are small compared to the overall economy so that we can confidently rule
out the possibility that growth at the industry level should aﬀect the cyclical pattern of macroeconomic
policy at country level; (iii) our financial constraint variables are computed for US industries and therefore

are unlikely to be aﬀected by policies and outcomes in other countries. Financial constraints at the industry
level are measured, either by the extent to which the corresponding industry in the US is dependent on
external finance or displays low levels of asset tangibility (these two measures capture the extent to which
the industry is prone to being credit constrained), or by the extent to which the corresponding industry in
the US features high labor costs to sales or high inventories to sales (i.e the extent to which the industry is
prone to being liquidity constrained).
    Our main empirical finding is that the interaction between credit or liquidity constraints in an industry
and monetary policy countercyclicality in the country, has a positive, significant, and robust impact on the
average annual rate of labor productivity of such an industry. More specifically, the higher the extent to which
the corresponding industry in the United States relies on external finance, or the lower the asset tangibility
of the corresponding sector in the United States, the more growth-enhancing it is for an industry, to pursue
a countercyclical monetary policy. Likewise, the more liquidity dependent the corresponding US industry is,
the more growth-enhancing it is for an industry to pursue a more countercyclical monetary policy. Moreover,
the interaction eﬀects between monetary policy countercyclicality and each of these various measures of credit
and liquidity constraints, tend to be more significant in downturns than in upturns. These eﬀects are robust
to controlling for the interaction between these measures of financial constraints and country-level economic
variables such as inflation, financial development, and the size of government which are likely to aﬀect the
country’s ability to pursue more countercyclical macroeconomic policies.
    Finally, we look at how monetary policy cyclicality aﬀects the composition of investment: more specific-
ally, we show that more countercyclical monetary policy shifts the composition of investment towards R&D
disproportionately more in industries with tighter borrowing or liquidity constraints.
    The paper relates to several strands of literature. First, to the literature on macroeconomic volatility and
growth. A benchmark paper in this literature is Ramey and Ramey (1995) who find a negative correlation
in cross-country regressions between volatility and long-run growth. A first model to generate the prediction
that the correlation between long-run growth and volatility should be negative, is Acemoglu and Zilibotti
(1997) who point to low financial development as a factor that could both, reduce long-run growth and
increase the volatility of the economy. Acemoglu et al (2003) and Easterly (2005) hold that both, high
volatility and low long-run growth do not directly arise from policy decisions but rather from bad institutions.
Our paper contributes to this debate by showing a significant growth eﬀect of more countercyclical monetary
policies on industries which are all located in OECD countries with similar property rights and political
institutions.1
    Second, we contribute to the literature on monetary policy design. In our model, monetary policy
operates through a version of the credit channel (see Bernanke and Gertler 1995 for a review of the credit

   1 See also Aghion et al (2009) who analyze the relationship between long-run growth and the choice of exchange-rate regime;

and Aghion, Hemous and Kharroubi (2012) who show that more countercyclical fiscal policies aﬀect growth more significantly
in sectors whose US counterparts are more credit constrained.

channel literature).2 But more specifically, our model builds on the macroeconomic literature on liquidity (e.g
Woodford 1990 and Holmström and Tirole 1998). This literature has emphasized the role of governments in
providing possibly contingent stores of value that cannot be created by the private sector. Like in Holmström
and Tirole (1998), liquidity provision in our paper is modeled as a redistribution from consumers to firms in
the bad state of nature; however, here redistribution happens ex post rather than ex ante. This perspective
is shared with Farhi and Tirole (2012), however their focus is on time inconsistency and ex ante regulation;
also in their model, unlike in ours, there is no liquidity premium and therefore, under full government
commitment, there is no role for a countercyclical interest rate policy.
     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlays the model. Section 3 develops the empirical analysis.
It first details the methodology and the data. Then it presents the main empirical results. Section 4
concludes. Finally, proofs and sample and estimation details are contained in the Appendix.



2      Model

2.1      Model setup

There are three periods,  = 0 1 2. Entrepreneurs have utility function  = E[2 ] , where 2 is their date-2
consumption. They are protected by limited liability and their only endowment is their wealth  at date 0.
Their technology set exhibits constant returns to scale. At date 0 they choose their investment scale   0.
     At date 1, uncertainty is realized: the aggregate state is either good (G) or bad (B), and the firm is
either intact or experiences a liquidity shock. The date-0 probability of the good state is , and the date-0
probability of a firm experiencing a liquidity shock is 1 − . Both events are independent.
     At date 1, a cash flow  accrues to the entrepreneur where, depending on the aggregate state,  ∈
{     }. This cash flow is not pledgeable to outside investors. If the project is intact, the investment
delivers at date 1; it then yields, besides the cash flow , a payoﬀ of 1 , of which 0  is pledgeable to
investors.3 If the project is distressed, besides the cash flow , it yields a payoﬀ at date 2 if fresh resources
 ≤  are reinvested. It then delivers at date 2 a payoﬀ of 1 , of which 0  is pledgeable to investors.
The variable 0 we take as an inverse measure of credit-constraint. In particular a lower 0 is likely to be
associated with lower asset tangibility.
     The interest rate is a key determinant of the collateral value of a project. It plays an important role in
determining the initial investment scale  as well as the reinvestment scale . The gross rate of interest is
equal to 0 between dates 0 and 1, and 1 between dates 1 and 2 where 1 ∈ {1  1 } depending on the
aggregate state.

    2 Thereare two versions of the credit channel : the "balance sheet channel" and the "bank lending channel". Our model
features the balance sheet channel, focusing more on the eﬀect of interest rates on firms’ borrowing capacity.
   3 As usual, the “agency wedge”  −  can be motivated in multiple ways, including limited commitment, private benefits
                                     1    0
or incentives to counter moral hazard (see for example Holmström and Tirole 2011).




                                                           4
     The following assumption is necessary to ensure that entrepreneurs are liquidity constrained and must
invest at a finite scale.

Assumption 1 (liquidity constraint) 0  min{0  1  1 }

     The following assumption will guarantee that: (i) in the good state, date-1 cash flows will be enough
to cover liquidity needs and reinvest at full scale in the event of a liquidity shock, even with no hoarded
liquidity or issuance of new securities; and (ii) in the bad state, date-1 cash flows will not be enough to cover
liquidity needs and reinvest at full scale so that downsizing will take place if no liquidity is hoarded at date
0.

Assumption 2 (cash-flows)   1 and 1 − 0 1    

     Because cash flows are not enough to cover liquidity shocks in the bad state, entrepreneurs might wish
to engage in liquidity policy. They can purchase an asset that pays oﬀ  at date 1 in case of a liquidity
shock in the bad state. The date-0 cost of this liquidity is (1 − )(1 − )0 , where  ≥ 1 When   1,
the date-0 cost of this liquidity is greater than (1 − )(1 − )0 . This corresponds for example to a
situation where, as in Holmström and Tirole (1997), consumers cannot commit to pay back at date 1 a firm
that would try to lend them resources at date 0. As a result, firms which desire to save have to use a costly
storage technology.
     Assumption 6 in the Appendix guarantees that the projects are attractive enough that entrepreneurs will
always invest all their net worth.
     At the core of the model is a maturity mismatch issue, where a long-term project requires occasional
reinvestments. The entrepreneur has to compromise between initial investment scale  and reinvestment
scale  in the event of a liquidity shock. Maximizing initial scale  requires minimizing hoarded liquidity
and exhausting reserves of pledgeable income. This in turn forces the entrepreneur to downsize and delever
in the event of a liquidity shock. Conversely, maximizing liquidity to mitigate maturity mismatch requires
sacrificing initial scale .
     Besides short term profits , liquidity  represents cash available at date 1 in the event of a liquidity
shock ( is the analog of a liquidity ratio). We assume that any potential surplus of cash over liquidity
needs for reinvestment is consumed by entrepreneurs. The policy of pledging all cash that is unneeded for
reinvestment is always weakly optimal. Pledging less is also optimal (and leads to the same allocation)
if the entrepreneur has no alternative use of the unneeded cash to distributing to investors. However, if
the entrepreneur can divert (even an arbitrarily small) fraction of the extra cash for her own benefit, then
pledging the entire unneeded cash is strictly optimal.
     At date 1, in the bad state, if a liquidity shock hits, the entrepreneur can dilute initial investors by issuing
new securities against the date-2 pledgeable income 0 , and so its continuation  ∈ [0 ] must satisfy:

                                                                    0 
                                                 ≤ ( +   ) +
                                                                    1

                                                      = min                     , 1 
                                                                         1 − 
                                                                               0

This formula captures the fact that lower interest rates facilitate refinancing. An entrepreneur would never
choose to have excess liquidity and so we restrict our attention to  ∈ [0 1 − 0 1 −   ].
       The entrepreneur needs to raise  −  from outside investors at date 0. If no liquidity shock hits,
the entrepreneur returns 0  to these investors at date 1. If a liquidity shock hits in the good state, the
entrepreneur returns 0  to these investors at date 2. If a liquidity shock hits in the bad state, these
investors are committed to inject additional funds ; moreover, they are fully diluted. As a result, its
borrowing capacity at date 0 is given by:

                                                 0                                   

       Assumption 7 in the Appendix guarantees that the entrepreneur optimally chooses to hoard enough
liquidity  = 1 − 0 1 −  to withstand a liquidity shock in the bad state without downsizing.

2.2       Illiquidity, pledgeability, and countercyclical interest rate policy

We want to derive comparative static results with respect to the cyclicality of interest rate policy. For this
purpose, it will prove useful to adopt the following parametrization:  = ,  = , and 0 = .4

       First, we look at the interaction between countercyclical interest rate policy and firms’ vulnerability to
liquidity shocks. Countercyclical interest policy helps the refinancing of firms that experience a liquidity
shock in the bad state. It also hurts the refinancing of firms that experience a liquidity shock in the good

   4 This   is for the sake of presentation. In the welfare analysis below, we remove these restrictions.




                                                                          6
state. However, it helps the former more than it hurts the later, since firms do not need to hoard costly
liquidity for the good state but do for the bad state. Indeed, in the good state, they can finance their liquidity
needs with their short term cash flows. It is then natural to expect more liquidity dependent firms (with
a higher probability 1 −  of a liquidity shock) to benefit disproportionately from a more countercyclical
interest rate policy if the probability of the bad state 1 −  is high enough, and if the liquidity premium  − 1
is high enough. The following proposition formalizes this insight.

                                                                     2 log 

need to hoard to weather liquidity shocks in the bad state. This releases more pledgeable income for more
liquidity dependent firms (with a higher 1 − ) as long as the probability of the bad state 1 −  and the
liquidity premium  − 1 are both suﬃciently high. As a result, those firms can expand in size more.
   We now want to investigate how this comparative static result is aﬀected by the state of the business
cycle. We view expansions and recessions as corresponding to diﬀerent values of : in an expansion, the
probability  of the good state is high and it is low in a recession. The next proposition establishes that
the diﬀerential eﬀect of countercyclical interest rate policy across firms with diﬀerent degrees of liquidity
dependence is stronger in recessions than in expansions.

    One implication from this latter result is that projects with lower asset tangibility, should benefit more
from more countercyclical monetary policy in expansions than projects with higher degree of asset tangibility.
    Propositions 1,2, 3 and 4 summarize the key comparative statics of the model that we wish to confirm
in the data. But before we turn to the empirical analysis, let us look at suﬃcient conditions under which
countercyclical monetary policy is welfare improving.


2.3     Welfare analysis

So far, we have maintained a positive focus. This allowed us to keep some aspects of the economy in the
background. In order to explore the normative implications of our model, those aspects now need be fleshed
out.


Closing the model. Suppose that the economy involves a continuum of firms which may diﬀer in their
probability of facing a liquidity shock or in their level of income pledgeability , i.e with respect to  and 0 .
Firms might also diﬀer with respect to the share of income that accrues to owners-consumers. We denote
by  the corresponding cumulative distribution function.
    We introduce investors in the following way. There are overlapping generations of consumers: generation
0 lives between dates 0 and 1, and generation 1 lives between dates 1 and 2. We model those two generations
slightly diﬀerently. There are also two short-term storage technologies between dates 0 and 1 and between
dates 1 and 2. We explain in turn how we specify consumers and storage technologies between dates 0 and
1, and between dates 1 and 2
    We assume that consumers born at date 0 have linear utility 0 + E0 [1 ]. They are endowed with a large
amount of resources  when born. There are also short-term storage technologies corresponding to diﬀerent
sets of states of the world at date 1. For a set of date-1 states of probability , these technologies are such
that  ≥ 1 units of goods invested at date 0 yield  units of goods at date 1. The interest rate between
dates 0 and 1 is pinned down by the preferences of consumers at 0 = 1. However this interest rate is not
available to firms. One reason already mentioned above (see Holmström and Tirole, 1997), is that consumers
lack commitment. In particular, they cannot commit to pay back at date 1 a firm that would try to lend
them resources at date 0. As a result, firms which desire to save have to use a costly storage technology with
rate of return 0   0 .


                                                        9
    We assume that consumers born at date 1 have utility E1 [2 ]. They are endowed with a large amount
or resources  when born. We introduce a short-term storage technology between dates 1 and 2 that yields
1 at date 2 for 1 unit of good invested at date 1. For the date-1 interest rate to be ̃1 6= 1 , the storage
technology must be taxed at rate 1− ̃1 1 (see below for an interpretation). The proceeds are rebated lump
sum to consumers at date 2. We assume that  is large enough to finance all the necessary investments in
the projects of entrepreneurs at each date . As a result, consumers always invest a fraction of their savings
in the short-term storage technology.5

Assumption 3 (interest rate distortion): The set of feasible interest rates is [1  1 ] where 1  0 for
all 0 in the support of  and 1 ≤ 1 . Furthermore, there exists a fixed distortion or deadweight loss
(̃1 ) ≥ 0 when the interest rate ̃1 diverges from its natural rate 1 defined by: (1 ) = 0 (1 ) = 0 and
 is decreasing on [1  1 ].

    The upper bound 1 for the interest rate ̃1 is not crucial but simplifies the analysis. One can justify this
assumption by positing arbitrage (foreigners or some long-lived consumers would take advantage of ̃1  1 )
or by assuming that marginal distortions 0 (̃1 ) are very high beyond 1 . But again, we want to emphasize
that this particular assumption only simplifies the exposition and plays no economically substantive role in
the analysis. The lower bound at 1 for the interest rate ̃1 also simplifies the analysis at little economic
cost.

Assumption 4 (consumers): Suppose that date-0 investment is equal to , that firms hoard liquidity  and
thus can salvage  =  (1 − 0 ) in case of crisis. Up to a normalizing constant, date-1 consumer welfare
is  = −(̃1 ) − (1 − ̃1 )0 ̃1 .

   The second term in  stands for the implicit subsidy from savers to borrowing firms. Indeed date-1
                                                      ³           ´
consumers’ return on their savings e is e + (1 − ) e − 0  (the last term representing the lump-sum
rebate on the amount e − (0 ) invested in the storage technology), or e − (1 − )0 .6 Finally, we
ignore the welfare of date-0 consumers as they have constant utility 0 = .
    Comments. The deadweight loss function  can also be interpreted as a reduced form of a more standard
distortion associated with conventional monetary policy, as emphasized in the New-Keynesian literature.
Here we have in mind not a short-term intervention, but a prolonged reduction of interest rates (a year to
several years, for example thinking of Japan). Even though our model is entirely without money balances,
sticky prices or imperfect competition, it captures a key feature of monetary policy in New-Keynesian models
routinely used to discuss and model monetary policy. In New-Keynesian models, the nominal interest rate is

   5 Although we think of this as roughly capturing interest rate policy, this modelling device could more generally be thought of

as a way of capturing a range of policy interventions that reduce borrowing costs for firms. For instance, taxing the short-term
storage technology and rebating the proceeds lump-sum to consumers is essentially equivalent to subsidizing investment in the
firms and financing this subsidy by a lump-sum tax on consumers. We do not introduce any other instrument.
   6 Note that we use the notation    instead of  for the savings of date-1 consumers. This is because under our interpretation
below, some of the savings  of date-1 consumers are invested in alternative wasteful investment projects. As a result, only a
part  of their savings are split between reinvestment in banks and the short-term storage technology.


                                                               10
controlled by the central bank. Prices adjust only gradually according to the New-Keynesian Phillips Curve,
and the central bank can therefore control the real interest rate. The real interest rate regulates aggregate
demand through a version of the consumer Euler equation–the dynamic IS curve. Without additional
frictions, the central bank can achieve the allocation of the flexible price economy by setting nominal interest
rates so that the real interest rate equals to the “natural” interest rate. Deviating from this rule introduces
variations in the output gap together with distortions by generating dispersion in relative prices. To the
extent that these eﬀects enter welfare separately and additively from the eﬀects of interest rates on banks’
balance sheets–arguably a strong assumption–our loss function  () can be interpreted as a reduced form
of the loss function associated with a real interest rate below the natural interest rate in the New-Keynesian
model.7 8 Under this interpretation, monetary policy works both through the usual New-Keynesian channel
and through its eﬀects on firms via a version of the “credit channel”.9
    The asymmetric treatment of the first and second periods is meant to build the simplest possible model
that allows us to capture the following features. First we want a model embodying the key friction in
Holmström and Tirole (1997), namely, that consumers cannot commit to reinvest funds in the firm in
subsequent periods, which in turn generates a liquidity premium  − 1. Second, we need the interest rate ̃1
between dates 1 and 2 to be a policy variable. Because our focus is not on the interest rate between dates 0
and 1, this interest rate is exogenous in our model.


Optimality of countercyclical interest rate policy. Before moving on to computing welfare, we make
one more assumption:

Assumption 5 (short-term profits and reinvestment): Short-term profits generated at date 1 by firms can
only be used to reinvest in the firm. If they are not reinvested in the firm, these profits are dissipated.

    Welfare is then given by

and  is the relative welfare weight on the utility of entrepreneurs.

    7 Yet another cost, absent in cashless New Keynesian models, is the so called inflation tax which arises when money demand

is elastic.
    8 Because they are not our focus, we imagine here that the traditional time-inconsistency problems associated with monetary

policy in the New-Keynesian model have been resolved. As is well known, this is the case if a sales subsidy is available to
eliminate the monopoly price distortion.
    9 There are two versions of the credit channel (see Bernanke-Gertler 1995 for a review): the “balance sheet channel” and the

“bank lending channel”. Our model is consistent with the former in its emphasis on the eﬀect of interest rates on collateral
value.

This establishes the proposition
   The intuition for this proposition is simple. Firms need to hoard liquidity in order to weather liquidity
shocks if the aggregate state is bad. This liquidity hoarding is costly (the rate of return on hoarded liquidity
is equal to 0   0 ) because of the lack of commitment of consumers. Reducing interest rates in bad
times lowers the amount of hoarded liquidity, by increasing the ability of firms to leverage their net worth.
This eﬀect is weaker when the aggregate state is good because in that state, short-term profits are enough
to cover reinvestment needs so that no liquidity needs to be hoarded to weather liquidity shocks that occur
in that aggregate state of the world. Hence a higher marginal benefit of reducing interest rates in bad times
relative to good times. This eﬀect is strong enough to overcome a countervailing eﬀect arising from the
fact that lowering interest rates in bad times leads to an implicit subsidy from consumers to entrepreneurs,
explaining that optimal interest rate policy is countercyclical.

3     Empirical analysis

3.1     Methodology and data

The model in the previous section predicts that a more countercyclical monetary policy should foster growth
disproportionately more in industries which face either tighter credit constraints or tighter liquidity con-
straints. To test these predictions, we adopt the following empirical framework. Our dependent variable is
the average annual growth rate in labor productivity in industry  in country  for the period 1995-2005.10
On the right hand side, we introduce industry and country fixed eﬀects {    } to control for unobserved
heterogeneity across industries and across countries. The variable of interest, () × () , is the interac-
tion between, on the one hand, industry ’s level of credit or liquidity constraint and on the other hand the
degree of (counter) cyclicality of monetary policy in country  over the same time period of time over which
industry growth rates are computed, here 1995-2005. Finally, we control for initial conditions by including
the ratio of labor productivity in industry  in country  to labor productivity in the overall manufacturing
                                                                            
sector in country  at the beginning of the period, i.e. in 1995. Denoting  (resp.  ) labor productivity
in industry  (resp. in total manufacturing) in country  at time , and letting  denote the error term,
our baseline estimation equation is expressed as follows:

           Now, turning to the stabilization policy cyclicality measure, () , in country , it is estimated as
the sensitivity of the real short term interest rate to the domestic output gap. We therefore use country-level
data to estimate the following country-by-country “auxiliary” equation over the time period 1995-2005:


                                             =   + ()  +                                             (3)


where  is the real short term interest rate in country  at time  —defined as the diﬀerence between
the three months policy interest rate set by the central bank and the 3-months annualized inflation rate-
;  measures the output gap in country  at time  (that is, the percentage diﬀerence between actual
and potential GDP).11 It therefore represents the country’s current position in the cycle;   is a constant;
and  is an error term. For example, a positive (resp. negative) regression coeﬃcient () reflects
a countercyclical (pro-cyclical) monetary policy as the short term cost of capital tends to increase (resp.
decrease) when the economy improves (resp. deteriorates).

 1 0 Two  measures of labor productivity, either per worker or per hour worked are available. We will use the latter in order
to take into account the possible procyclicality of hours worked per worker. Some results where the dependent variable is the
growth rate in real value added will also be presented.
  1 1 The output gap is estimated as the diﬀerence between the log of real GDP and the HP filtered series of the log of real

GDP, using the standard smoothing parameter for quarterly data. Moreover the time span 1995-2005 is such that we can avoid
beginning- and end-of-sample problems in the estimated of trend GDP and output gap. We have enough data both before the
beginning and after the end of our sample to estimate properly the GDP cycle for all the period we use.


                                                             13
    To deepen our analysis of monetary policy countercyclicality, and also for the sake of robustness, we shall
consider variants of (3). In a first variant (4), we control for the one-quarter-lagged real short term interest
rate:
                                       =  + −1 + ()  +                                             (4)

In a second variant (5), we control for the one-quarter-forward real short term interest rate:


                                       =  + +1 + ()  +                                             (5)


    Next, cyclicality in the real short term interest rate reflects the cyclical pattern of the nominal interest
rate and/or the cyclical pattern of inflation. We shall thus estimate a system of two equations in which the
first equation corresponds to a Taylor rule (6) whereby the nominal short term interest rate () depends
on current inflation  and the current output gap 


                                          =  +   + ( )  +                                            (6)


and the second equation corresponds to a Phillips curve (7) whereby inflation depends on one-quarter-lagged
inflation and the current output gap


                                          =  +  −1 + ( )  +                                            (7)


Monetary policy is more countercyclical the larger  and/or the lower  
    The cyclicality estimates obtained from estimating (3) are less likely to be biased than those we would
obtain from using Taylor rules (4) and Phillips curves (5) as auxiliary equations. This also explains why we
focused on a relatively recent period, namely 1995-2005. Had we extended the sample period to the early
nineties, even the real short term interest rate would become non-stationary. We also chose to concentrate
on the most recent period 1995-2005, during which monetary policy was essentially conducted through short
term interest rates to make sure that our auxiliary regression does capture the bulk of monetary policy
decisions.12
    Last, when two countries diﬀer in their monetary policy cyclicality estimates, it is worth knowing whether
this diﬀerence comes mainly from what happens in expansions versus recessions. To this end, we shall
estimate the following variant of the auxiliary equation:

                                                             +               −
                                     =  + (+ )  + (− )  +                                         (8)

  1 2 Yet, it is fair to say that even during this period, some countries like Japan did conduct monetary policy using other means

than interest rates decisions. The country actually went through a long period of “unconventional”monetary policy during
which the central bank was massively buying government bonds. In this particular case, equations (3) and (6) may provide a
wrong assessment of monetary policy cyclicality. For this reason, we have chosen to keep Japan out of our sample.




                                                               14
           +                                                                                                −
    Here,  is the output gap if it is higher than its historical median and zero otherwise. Similarly,  is
the output gap if it is lower than its historical median and zero otherwise. The estimated coeﬃcient +
(resp. − ) measures how strongly the real interest rate reacts to variations in the output gap during
an expansion (resp. a recession). This will help determine whether the growth eﬀect of monetary policy
cyclicality, if any, comes from what happens during expansions versus recessions.
    Turning now to industry-specific characteristics, we follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) in using firm-level
data pertaining to the United States. We concentrate on two set of financial constraints aﬀecting firms,
credit constraints and liquidity constraints. We consider external financial dependence and asset tangibility
as proxies for credit constraints. External financial dependence is measured as the median ratio across firms
belonging to the corresponding industry in the US of capital expenditures minus current cash flow to total
capital expenditures. Asset tangibility is measured as the median ratio across firms in the corresponding
industry in the US of the value of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets. These two indicators
measure an industry’s long term needs for external capital, and as such can be considered as proxies for an
industry’s credit constraints. Now to capture an industry’s short-term liquidity needs, that is the industry’s
degree of liquidity dependence (or constraint), we consider two alternative indicators. First, the median ratio
across firms belonging to the corresponding industry in the US of inventories to total sales. In particular
industries with longer production cycles typically maintain a higher level of inventories.13                      Our second
measure of liquidity dependence is the median ratio across firms in the corresponding industry in the US of
labor costs to total sales. This captures the extent to which an industry needs short-term liquidity to meet
its regular payments vis-a-vis its employees. These two last measures (inventories to sales and labor costs to
sales) thus reflect an industry’s need for short-term financing.
    Using US industry-level data to compute industry characteristics, is valid as long as (a) diﬀerences
across industries are driven largely by diﬀerences in technology and therefore industries with higher levels of
credit or liquidity constraints in one country are also industries with higher level levels of credit or liquidity
constraints in another country in our country sample; (b) technological diﬀerences persist over time across
countries; and (c) countries are relatively similar in terms of the overall institutional environment faced
by firms. Under those three assumptions, our US-based industry-specific measures are likely to be valid
measures for the corresponding industries in countries other than the United States. We believe that these
assumptions are satisfied for industries within our OECD country sample. For example, if pharmaceuticals
require proportionally more external finance or have lower labor costs than textiles in the United States,
this is likely to be the case in other OECD countries as well. Finally, to the extent that the United States
is more financially developed than other countries worldwide, US-based measures are likely to provide the
least noisy measures of industry-level credit or liquidity constraints.

   1 3 Liquidity dependence can also be proxied with a cash conversion cycle variable which measures the median across firms in

the corresponding industry in the US of the time elapsed between the moment a firm pays for its inputs and the moment it is
paid for its output. Results available upon request are very similar to those obtained with the inventories to sales ratio, which
is not surprising since the correlation coeﬃcent between the two variables is around 0.9.



                                                               15
    Turning now to the estimation methodology, we follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) in using a simple ordin-
ary least squares (OLS) procedure to estimate our baseline equation (2) with a correction for heteroskedasti-
city bias. In particular, the interaction term between industry-specific characteristics and country-specific
monetary countercyclicality is likely to be largely exogenous to the dependent variable for three reasons.
First, industry specific characteristics are measured on a period -the eighties- prior to the period on which
industry growth is computed -1995-2005-. Second industry specific characteristics pertains to industries in
the United States, while the dependent variable involves countries other than the United States. It is hence
quite implausible that industry growth outside the United States could aﬀect industry specific characteristics
in the United States. Last, monetary policy cyclicality is measured at a macroeconomic level, whereas the
dependent variable is measured at the industry level, which again reduces the scope for reverse causality as
long as each individual industry represents a small share of total output in the domestic economy.
    Our data sample focuses on 15 industrial OECD countries. In particular, we do not include the United
States, as this would be a source of reverse causality problems.14 Industry-level labor productivity data are
drawn from the European Union (EU) KLEMS data set and restricted to manufacturing industries.15 These
industry level data are available on a yearly frequency. The primary source of data for measuring industry-
specific characteristics is Compustat, which gathers balance sheets and income statements for US. listed
firms. We draw on Rajan and Zingales (1998), Braun (2003) and Braun and Larrain (2005), and Raddatz
(2006) to compute industry-level indicators for borrowing and liquidity constraints. Finally, macroeconomic
variables -such as those used to compute monetary policy cyclicality estimates- are drawn from the OECD
Economic Outlook data set (2011). Note that monetary policy cyclicality indicators are computed using
quarterly data while other macroeconomic data are annual.16


3.2     Results

3.2.1    First stage estimates

The histogram depicted in Figure 1 shows the results from the auxiliary regression (3). In particular it shows
that Great Britain and Sweden are the countries with the most countercyclical real short term interest rates
in ou sample. A natural explanation for this, is that both countries conduct their own monetary policies,
and through independent central banks. The least countercyclical among the countries in our sample are
Spain, Portugal and Finland. These three countries are all part of the Euro area; moreover, all three are
"small economies" in GDP terms compared to the Euro area as a whole, therefore they are unlikely to have

Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and United Kingdom.
  1 5 See table 1 in the Appendix for the list of industries in the sample.
  1 6 Using quarterly data brings two advantages. First, it reduces the standard error around the estimate for monetary policy

cyclicality. Second, it helps partly address the causality issue, namely that the higher the frequency of the underlying data, the
more likely our first stage regressions capture the reaction of monetary policy to changes in the output gap since the output
gap is unlikely to react to changes in monetary policy contemporaneously, within one quarter. Had we used data with lower
frequency, this would have been more likely.




                                                               16
much influence on the European Central Bank’s policy.17 finally, inflation is notoriously pro-cyclical in these
countries, which in turn results in a real short term interest rate which is higher in recessions than in booms.

    Alternatively we consider the results of the auxiliary regression (6) which provide the country-by-country
estimate for the output gap coeﬃcient in the Taylor rule (see figure 2). The results are fairly comparable
to those from the previous estimation exercise. In particular, Great Britain and Sweden are still the most
counter-cyclical countries while Spain and Portugal are still (the most) procyclical countries.

    Next we investigate variables that may correlate with the estimates for monetary policy countercyclicality.
First, the cross country evidence shows that countries that have run a more countercyclical monetary policy
have also experienced a higher cost of capital, both in the short and in the long run. The real short term
interest rate as well as the real long term interest rate were higher in countries where monetary policy was
more countercyclical.

                                                       3 

    Then splitting the real cost of capital between the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate, the cross
country evidence shows that they have played a similar role in terms of magnitude.18 This means that
the positive cross-country correlation between monetary policy countercyclicality and the average real cost
of capital is due, in equal terms, to a positive correlation between monetary policy countercyclicality and
the average nominal interest rate on the one hand and to a negative correlation between monetary policy
countercyclicality and the average inflation rate on the other hand. The conclusion is hence that countries
that maintain high inflation rates and/or low interest rates tend to run procyclical monetary policies.

    Second, we investigate the correlation between monetary policy countercyclicality and macroeconomic
volatility. In theory, a country which runs a more counter-cyclical monetary policy should experience a lower
volatility since monetary policy would then help dampen cyclical fluctuations. Yet, the counter-cyclical
pattern of monetary policy is only one possible determinant of macroeconomic volatility. It hence could be
that a country runs a more countercyclical monetary policy because its "natural" volatility is higher, so that
overall it would still be more volatile than a country that runs a procyclical monetary policy. The empirical

  1 7 On top of that, Finland happens to be the country with the most procyclical inflation in our sample, which mechanically

reduces its real short term interest rate countercyclicality.
  1 8 The left hand panel in figure 4 shows the correlation between monetary policy cyclicality and the average nominal short

term interest rate controlling for average inflation while the right hand panel in figure 4 shows the correlation between monetary
policy cyclicality and the average inflation rate controlling for the average nominal short term interest rate. A similar remark
holds for figure 5 where the average nominal long term interest replaces the average nominal short term interest.


                                                               17
evidence shows that even in the absence of such a control for the "natural"volatility, there is a negative
correlation between macroeconomic volatility and monetary policy countercyclicality.

   Last, we look at the evidence on the correlation between monetary policy countercyclicality and fiscal
policy. If anything, the data shows that there is no significant correlation between the cyclical pattern of
monetary policy and fiscal discipline understood as the average fiscal balance to GDP. Similarly, there is no
significant correlation with government size: countries where fiscal expenditures represent a larger fraction
of GDP do not show significantly more or less countercyclical monetary policies..

3.2.2   Baseline regressions

The subsequent tables show the results from the main (second-stage) regressions. Table 2 shows the results
of estimating the baseline equation (2) with the average annual growth rate in real value added over the
period 1995-2005, as the left hand side variable, using financial dependence or asset tangibility as measures
of credit constraints, and the countercyclicality measure () being derived first from (3), then (4), and
finally (5). The first three columns show that growth in industry real value added growth is significantly
and positively correlated with the interaction of financial dependence and monetary countercyclicality: a
larger sensitivity of the real short term interest rate to the output gap tends to raise industry real value
added disproportionately for industries with higher financial dependence. A similar type of result holds for
the interaction between monetary policy cyclicality and industry asset tangibility: a larger sensitivity of the
real short term interest rate to the output gap raises industry real value added growth disproportionately
more for industries with lower asset tangibility.

                                                2 

   We now repeat the same estimation exercise, but moving the focus to measures of industry liquidity
constraints. As noted above, a counter-cyclical monetary policy should contribute to raise growth in the
sectors that are most liquidity dependent by easing the process of refinancing. Indeed the empirical evidence
in Table 3 shows that for each of our two measures of liquidity constraints, the interaction of counter-cyclical
monetary policy and liquidity constraints does have a positive eﬀect on industry real value added growth.
Moreover, as in the case of borrowing constraints, these results do not depend on the specific measure for
monetary policy countercyclicality. At this point it is worth making two remarks. First the correlations
between the two diﬀerent measures of liquidity constraints is around 0.6, which means these two variables
are not simply replicating a unique result. Moreover, the correlation between indicators of credit constraint
and liquidity constraint is also far from being one. It ranges actually between 0.4 and 0.7 (when financial
constraints are measured with external financial dependence, correlations being the same but negative when

                                                      18
using asset tangibility). Credit and liquidity constraints are therefore two distinct channels through which
monetary policy countercyclicality can aﬀect industry growth.

                                                3 

   Tables 4 and 5 below, replicate the same regression exercises as Table 2 and 3 respectively, but with
average annual growth in labor productivity per hour as the left hand side variable. We therefore aim at
understanding whether the positive eﬀect of countercyclical monetary policy on real value added growth for
financially/liquidity dependent industries comes from higher productivity growth or if it simply reflects an
increase in employment growth in which case, the growth eﬀect would simply be related to factor accumu-
lation. What Tables 4 and 5 show is that the interactions between credit or liquidity constraints on the one
hand and the countercyclicality of monetary policy on the other hand has a significantly positive eﬀect on
labor productivity per hour growth. The factor accumulation hypothesis can hence be dismissed in favor of
a true improvement in productivity growth.

   Next, we provide estimations for labor productivity growth where we focus on the 1999-2005 period during
which EuroZone countries eﬀectively had a unique nominal short term interest rate. Indeed our original
estimation time span covered two diﬀerent periods. In the first period from 1995 to 1998, future EuroZone
countries still had national monetary policies, although these countries were already in the convergence
process aiming at closing cross-country gaps in nominal short term interest rates. By contrast, in the second
period 1999-2005, EuroZone countries had a unique monetary policy determined by the European Central
Bank, with a unique nominal short term interest rates. To make sure that our above results are not driven
by the mix of these two diﬀerent regimes, we reestimate our main regression equation (2) focusing on the
period 1999-2005. During this period, diﬀerences in monetary policy cyclicality across EuroZone countries
were either related to diﬀerences in cyclical positions or diﬀerences in the cyclical pattern of inflation.
   Tables 6 and 7 show that focusing on the 1999-2005 period yields very similar results to those in our
previous tables. In particular labor productivity growth is still positively and significantly correlated to
the interaction of monetary policy cyclicality and industry financial constraints, be they credit or liquidity
constraints. Moreover, the estimated coeﬃcients are very similar to those obtained using the longer time
span 1995-2005.

3.2.3   Disentangling interest rate and inflation cyclicality

So far we have focused on the cyclicality in the real short term interest rate. However, the cyclical pattern
of the real short term interest rate may either reflect the cyclical movement of the nominal interest rate or
the cyclicality of inflation. Here we disentangle these two components of real interest rate cyclicality when

                                                       19
looking at the eﬀect of countercyclical monetary policy on growth. Columns (i) and (ii) in Table 8 show
that the eﬀect of the interaction between inflation procyclicality and industry financial dependence is at best
weakly significant once controlling for the interaction between financial development and the cyclicality of
the real short term interest rate. In other words the cyclicality of inflation does not have an eﬀect beyond
that already embedded in the real short term interest rate countercyclicality. Columns (iv) and (v) in Table 8
confirm this result for the interaction of inflation procyclicality and industry level asset tangibility. In other
words, what matters for labor productivity growth is the cyclical pattern of the real short term interest
rate, no matter whether it relates to the nominal interest rate or to the inflation rate. Column (iii) and
(vi) in Table 8 propose another way to answer this question by running a horse race between the cyclicality
of nominal interest rates based on estimating a Taylor rule as (6)) and the cyclicality of inflation based on
estimating a Phillips curve as (7)). The estimated coeﬃcient for inflation procyclicality is larger -in absolute
value- than the one for nominal interest rate countercyclicality. The estimation however shows that these
two eﬀects are not statistically diﬀerent from each other. In other words, they are of similar magnitude,
which is indeed consistent with the view that what matters is the extent to which the real short term interest
rate is countercyclical, not the source for its countercyclicality.
   Next, Table 9 performs the same analysis but focusing now on industry measures of liquidity depend-
ence. Looking first at columns (i)-(iii), the results are somewhat diﬀerent from those obtained in Table 8
as inflation countercyclicality appears to be the main force behind the eﬀect of real short term interest rate
countercyclicality on labor productivity growth. To be sure, nominal short term interest rate countercyclic-
ality does still play a role; however the corresponding eﬀect is either small (less than one fourth of the eﬀect
of inflation countercyclicality, according to column (i) & (ii)) or not significantly diﬀerent from zero (column
(iii)). This result is not so surprising: to the extent that firms use their inventories as collateral or as guar-
antee for credit, a more procyclical inflation will tend to reduce the value of inventories during downturns,
that is when firms’ borrowing needs are highest. This may explain the eﬀect of inflation cyclicality on the
growth performance of industries that maintain a high level of inventories.

3.2.4   Dealing with the uncertainty around the monetary policy cyclicality index

An important limitation of the empirical analysis carried out so far, is that monetary policy cyclicality cannot
be directly observed, it can only be estimated. Yet, in our analysis so far, the index for monetary policy
cyclicality -obtained from first stage regressions- has been treated as an observed variable whereas in reality
all we know are the first and second moments of the distribution of monetary policy cyclicality estimates
for each country. Because monetary policy cyclicality is a generated regressor, it might well be that taking
the uncertainty around our monetary policy cyclicality coeﬃcients into account could make the interaction
between monetary policy countercyclicality and financial constraints become insignificant. To deal with this
problem, we adopt the following three-stage procedure:

                                                        20
   First, instead of considering the coeﬃcient () estimated in the first stage regression as an explanatory

standard error for the coeﬃcient () estimated in the first stage regression. Each draw yields a diﬀerent

Running this regression yields an estimated coeﬃcient   and an estimated standard deviation    . We

averages  and   . The results of this estimation procedure are provided in Table 10 (for interactions with
credit constraints) and Table 11 (for interactions with liquidity constraints). The interaction of monetary
policy cyclicality and industry financial constraints still has a significant eﬀect on industry growth. Yet, the
estimated parameters are somewhat smaller -in absolute value- than their counterpart in the simple OLS
regressions in Tables 4 and 5. Note however that the diﬀerence is by no means statistically significant. Thus
the interaction of industry financial constraints and monetary policy cyclicality has a genuine significant eﬀect
on industry growth which is not simply reflecting a bias stemming from the use of a generated regressor.
The simple OLS regressions therefore do not seem to provide significantly biased results.

3.2.5   Competing stories and omitted variables

We have established that monetary policy cyclicality does enhance disproportionately the growth rate of
sectors that face tighter credit or liquidity constraints. Yet a concern is to which extent are not we picking
up other factors or stories when looking at the correlation between industry growth and the cyclicality
of fiscal policy? The next four tables address this issue. First, it could be that diﬀerences in monetary
policy countercyclicality reflect long-run diﬀerences in monetary policies. For example we have seen that
countries which run countercyclical policies maintain higher real interest rates. The question is therefore
worth asking whether the eﬀect of countercyclical monetary policy on labor productivity growth may not
be simply capturing the eﬀect of high real interest rates. Second, it could be that a more countercyclical

                                                           21
monetary policy reflects a higher degree of financial development in the country, and financial development
in turn is known to have a positive eﬀect on growth, particularly for industries that are more dependent on
external finance (Rajan and Zingales, 1998). Last, monetary policy countercyclicality may also be related
to fiscal policy. We hence need to investigate whether the eﬀect of countercyclical monetary policy does not
capture the eﬀect of government size or fiscal discipline on labor productivity growth.
   Table 12 performs horse-races between the interaction of asset tangibility and monetary policy counter-
cyclicality and the interaction of asset tangibility with measures of financial development, average monetary
policy and average fiscal policy.
   The first three columns control for asset tangibility interacted with three diﬀerent measures of financial
development, namely the ratio of bank credit to bank deposits, the ratio of private bond market capitalization
to GDP and the real long term interest rate, which measures the cost of capital. These three interaction
terms have negative coeﬃcients, meaning that industries with less tangible assets benefit more from higher
bank credit to bank deposits or higher private bond market capitalization to GDP. Similarly, industries
with more tangible assets benefit more from lower cost of capital. Yet only the estimated coeﬃcient for the
interaction term with bank credit to bank deposits is significant while the interaction of asset tangibility and
monetary policy countercyclicality is always negative and significant. Monetary policy cyclicality hence does
not capture the eﬀect of financial development on labour productivity growth. Last it is worth noting that
the estimated coeﬃcient for the interaction between asset tangibility and monetary policy countercyclicality
is very similar to those estimated in Table 4, where there are no control variable. Controlling for financial
development has therefore very negligible implications for the magnitude of estimated coeﬃcients.
   The next two columns focus on average monetary policy to check if the cyclical pattern of monetary
policy may not reflect tighter or slacker monetary policy on average. Column (iv) shows that monetary
policy countercyclicality fosters labor productivity growth disproportionately more for industries with less
tangible assets, independently of the level for the real short term interest rate or the inflation rate. In other
words diﬀerences in average monetary policies do not explain diﬀerences in productivity growth. Moreover,
as is the case for financial development, the estimated coeﬃcient for the interaction of asset tangibility and
countercyclical monetary policy is very similar to our previous estimates.
   The last three columns control for the interaction between asset tangibility and average government
primary surplus, average government debt and average government expenditure to GDP ratios. The first
column controls for fiscal discipline, the latter two control for government size. Again, controlling for the
corresponding interactions does not aﬀect the magnitude nor the significance of the interaction coeﬃcient
between asset tangibility and monetary countercyclicality.

   Table 13 repeats the same exercise, but using external financial dependence as the measure of credit
constraint. The basic conclusions are the same as in the previous table, namely that controlling for the

interaction between financial dependence and financial development, or for the interaction with average
monetary policy or average fiscal policy does not modify the conclusion that the interaction between financial
dependence and monetary countercyclicality has a significant eﬀect on labor productivity growth. Yet the
estimations in column (iii) and (v) show that adding controls can aﬀect the significance and magnitude
of the estimated coeﬃcients. Control variables like average inflation provide a complementary but not an
alternative story to the one highlighted in this paper.

                                                      13 

    Tables 14 and 15 perform the same horse race exercises as the previous two tables, but using liquidity
constraint measures -inventories to sales ratios and labor costs to sales respectively- as industry character-
istics. As one can see in these two tables, the interaction between these two measures of liquidity constraints
and the countercyclicality of monetary policy overwhelms the interaction of the same liquidity constraints
measures with inflation, financial development and government size/budgetary discipline in the sense that
none of these other interactions ever comes out significant. This in turn suggests that monetary policy
countercyclicality is of paramount importance especially for those sectors that are more prone to be liquidity
constrained.

    Note finally that these results do not imply that the control variables we consider do not matter for
industry growth in industries that are more liquidity constrained. It rather means that if they matter, it is
primarily through their eﬀects on the central banks’s ability to implement a countercyclical monetary policy.


3.2.6    Magnitude of the eﬀects

How large are the eﬀects implied by the above regressions? This question can be answered by computing
the predicted diﬀerence in labor productivity between on the one hand an industry at the first quartile
of the distribution for borrowing (liquidity) constraints located in a country at the first quartile of the
distribution for monetary policy countercyclicality and on the other hand, an industry at the third quartile
of the distribution for borrowing (liquidity) constraints located in a country at the third quartile of the
distribution for monetary policy countercyclicality.19
    This diﬀerence ranges between 0.7 and 2 percentage points per year for borrowing constraints (financial
dependence and asset tangibility) and between 2.7 and 3.7 percentage points per year for liquidity constraints
(labor cost to sales and inventories to sales). These magnitudes are fairly large. As a matter of compar-
ison, the corresponding figures in Rajan and Zingales (1998) —the diﬀerence in value added growth from

  1 9 The presence of industry and country fixed eﬀects prevents evaluating the impact of a change in monetary policy cyclicality

for a given industry or conversely the eﬀect of a change in industry characteristics in a country with a given cyclical pattern of
monetary policy.



                                                               23
moving from the first to the third quartile in the level of financial dependence and financial development
simultaneously- is roughly equal to 1 percentage point per year.
    However, it is important to note that these are diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence (cross-country/cross-industry) ef-
fects, which are not interpretable as country-wide eﬀects.20 Second, the relatively small sample of countries
implies that moving from the first to the third quartile in the distribution of monetary policy countercyclic-
ality corresponds to a dramatic change in the design of monetary policy over the cycle. Third, this simple
computation does not take into account the possible costs associated with the transition from a situation
with low monetary policy countercyclicality to one with high monetary policy countercyclicality. Yet, this
quantification exercise still suggests that diﬀerences in the cyclicality of monetary policy are an important
driver of the observed cross-country/cross-industry diﬀerences in value added and productivity growth.


3.2.7      Upturns versus downturns

Table 16 runs the second stage regression (2), separating monetary policy cyclicality in upturns from monet-
ary policy cyclicality in downturns. Our main purpose here is to check whether the positive eﬀect of monetary
policy countercyclicality on labor productivity growth comes from maintaining high real short term interest
rates during booms or keeping low real short term interest rates during slumps. This table shows one im-
portant result, namely that the interaction between financial constraints and monetary countercyclicality is
always significant in downturns, no matter if we use financial dependence, asset tangibility, labor cost to
sales or inventories to sales ratio as the industry characteristic. However, the interaction between financial
constraints and monetary countercyclicality tends to be more significant in downturns than in upturns. In
particular, the interaction of industry financial constraints and monetary policy countercyclicality in upturns
is never significant at the 5% level. This in turn is consistent with the idea that labor productivity growth
of more financially constrained industries is more significantly aﬀected by countercyclical real short term in-
terest rates when countercyclicality relates to downturns periods where financial constraints are more likely
to bind.

3.2.8      Instrumenting monetary policy cyclicality

The empirical methodology used in this paper is essentially designed to address the reverse causality problem.
As already stressed above, to the extent that monetary policy cyclicality is estimated at the country level
while growth is measured at the industry level, and to the extent that each individual industry is too small to
aﬀect the design of monetary policy in the overall economy, causality should in principle run from monetary
policy cyclicality to industry growth. Yet, this does not rule out the possibility of a reverse causality. For

  2 0 It could be that adopting a monetary policy with more countercyclical real short term interest rates simply redistributes

productivity growth across sectors leaving aggregate productivity growth unchanged.




                                                              24
example, monetary policy makers could choose to run more countercyclical policies in economies where
industries which contribute more to macroeconomic growth face tighter credit or liquidity constraints. To
overcome this problem, we can rely on instrumental variable estimations. Basically by taking variables that
are known to be exogenous -in the sense that they can aﬀect monetary policy cyclicality while monetary
policy cyclicality cannot aﬀect them- we can get rid of the possible endogeneity problem. To this end,
we restrict the set of instruments to variables such as the legal origin of the country (French, English,
Scandinavian, and German), the population’s religious characteristics (share of Catholics in total population
in 1980, share of Protestants in total population in 1980) and the number of years since the country’s
independence.21 Running the regressions with (a subset of) these instruments -Tables 17 and 18 below-
shows a significant eﬀect of the interaction between monetary policy countercyclicality and industry credit
or liquidity constraints on industry labor productivity growth. In other words, previous results are not
related to the existence of a reverse causality bias. Actually a striking feature of the IV regressions is the
similarity in the estimated coeﬃcients when compared with those obtained in the OLS estimations, which
actually confirms the prior that the cyclical pattern of monetary policy is likely to be exogenous to industry
labor productivity growth. Finally, the test for the validity of instruments is passed in the case of industry
credit constraints as well as in the case of liquidity constraints.

3.2.9    R&D investment

In the model developed above, monetary policy cyclicality aﬀects growth through the composition of in-
vestment. Specifically, entrepreneurs reduce the amount of liquidity they need to hoard to weather li-
quidity shocks when monetary policy is more countercyclical. Moreover, this reduction is larger in more
credit/liquidity constrained industries. To test this prediction, we now consider the composition of invest-
ment between R&D and capital expenditures at the industry level as our left-hand side variable in the main
regression, and we investigate whether the share of R&D investment in total (R&D plus capital) investment
is significantly aﬀected by the interaction between monetary policy countercyclicality and industry financial
constraints. To the extent that R&D expenditures are longer term investments than capital expenditures, our
prediction is that a more countercyclical monetary policy should raise the share of R&D in total investment
disproportionately more for industries with tighter credit/liquidity constraints.
   To test this prediction, we run the equivalent of our baseline regressions using average R&D intensity of
investment -defined as the ratio between R&D expenditures and the sum of R&D and capital expenditures
for each industry- as the dependent variable instead. The dependent variable is measured for each industry
 and country  for the period 1995-2005.

  2 1 Following Persson, Tabellini and Trebbi (2003), the independence year is set at 1748 for countries that have never been

colonized.




                                                             25
    In these regressions we control for the initial relative R&D intensity of investment (defined as the ratio of
the industry’s R&D intensity of investment to total manufacturing R&D investment intensity in 1995). As
previously, we introduce industry and country fixed eﬀects {    } to control for unobserved heterogeneity
across industries and across countries, and again we include the variable of interest, () ×() , namely the
interaction between industry ’s intrinsic characteristic and the degree of (counter) cyclicality of monetary
                                                                    
policy in country  over the same time period 1995-2005. Denoting  (resp.  ) the ratio of R&D
expenditures to R&D and capital expenditures in industry  (resp. in total manufacturing) in country  at
time , and letting  denote the error term, we thus estimate:

                                                                          1995
                                                                       
                              =  +   + () × () +              + 
                                                                       1995

where  represents the average ratio of R&D expenditures to R&D plus capital expenditures in industry
 in country  over the period 1995-2005. The data for R&D and capital expenditures are drawn from
the OECD database on structural analysis. The sample covers the same countries as those included in the
analysis for productivity growth. Yet, the coverage for industries is much more narrow: this sample is about
50% smaller than the sample used for the analysis of industry labour productivity growth.
    Table 19 shows the eﬀects on average R&D intensity of the interaction between monetary policy coun-
tercyclicality and credit constraints (external financial dependence and asset tangibility) whereas Table 20
shows the eﬀects on average R&D intensity of interacting monetary countercyclicality with our two measures
of liquidity constraints. We see that a more countercyclical real short term interest rate tilts the composition
of investment more towards R&D in more credit constrained or liquidity constrained sectors. The interac-
tion eﬀects are always significant, especially when monetary policy cyclicality is interacted with financial
dependence or asset tangibility.

    Thus the empirical results vindicate our view that the positive eﬀect of monetary policy cyclicality on
growth relates -at least partly- to the composition of investment being tilted towards longer term growth-
enhancing investments like those in R&D.



4     Conclusion
In this paper we have developed a simple framework to look at how the interaction between the cyclical-
ity of (short-term-) interest rate policy and firms’ credit or liquidity constraints, aﬀects firms’ long-term
growth-enhancing investments. Three main predictions came out of our mode, namely: (i) the more credit-
constrained an industry, the more growth in that industry benefits from more countercyclical interest rates;
(ii) the more liquidity-constrained an industry, the more growth in that industry benefits from more counter-
cyclical interest rates; (iii) the growth enhancing eﬀect of countercyclical interest rate policies in more credit-

                                                        26
or liquidity-constrained sectors, is more significant in downturns than in upturns. Then, we have successfully
confronted these predictions to cross-industry, cross-country OECD data over the period 1995-2005.
   The approach and analysis in this paper could be extended in several interesting directions. First, one
could revisit the costs and benefits of monetary unions, i.e the potential gains from joining the union in terms
of credibility versus the potential costs in terms of the reduced ability to pursue countercyclical monetary
policies. Here, we think for example of countries like Portugal or Spain where interest rates went down after
these countries joined the Eurozone but which at the same time were becoming subject to cyclical monetary
policies which were no longer set with the primary objective of stabilizing the domestic business cycle or
domestic inflation.
   Second, one could look at the interplay between cyclical monetary policy and cyclical fiscal policy: are
those substitutes or complements?
   Third, one could embed our analysis in this paper into a broader framework where interest rate policy
would also aﬀect the extent of collective moral hazard among banks as in Farhi and Tirole (2010). There a
countercyclical monetary policy would have ambiguous eﬀects since lowering interest rates during downturns
would encourage short-term debt borrowing by banks while raising interest rates in booms would rather curb
such incentives.
   Finally, we would like to test the same predictions on firm-level panel data. However, such data are
not available cross-country. The strategy there would be to focus on particular countries, using firm-level
measures of credit and liquidity constraints. We are currently exploring such data for France.

Note: The dependent variable is the average annual growth rate in real value added for the period 1995-2005 for each industry in each country. Initial share in
manufacturing value added is the ratio of industry real value added to total manufacturing real value added in 1995. Financial Dependence is the median
fraction of capital expenditures not financed with internal funds for US firms in the same industry for the period 1980-1989. Asset Tangibility is the median
fraction of assets represented by net property, plant and equipment for US firms in the same industry for the period 1980-1989. Real Short term Interest Rate
Counter-Cyclicality I is the coefficient of the output gap when Real Short Term Interest Rate is regressed on a constant and the output gap for each country.
Real Short term Interest Rate Counter-Cyclicality II is the coefficient of the output gap when Real Short Term Interest Rate is regressed on a constant, the
output gap and the lagged Real Short Term Interest Rate for each country. Real Short term Interest Rate Counter-Cyclicality III is the coefficient of the output
gap when Real Short Term Interest Rate is regressed on a constant, the output gap and the forward Real Short Term Interest Rate for each country. The
interaction variable is the product of variables in parentheses. Standard errors -clustered at the industry level- are in parentheses. All estimations include
country and industry dummies. Significance at the 1% (resp. 5%; 10%) level is indicated by *** (resp. **; *).
