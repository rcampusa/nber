                                          ABSTRACT

We propose a dynamic heterogeneous agents model which generates testable hypotheses about
the formation, timing and bursting of asset price bubbles in the presence of short-sale constraints,
given a calibration that is consistent with momentum and reversal effects for unconstrained
assets. Consistent with the model, all short-sale constrained stocks earn strong negative risk-
adjusted returns in the first year after portfolio formation. However, the calibrated model predicts
strong differences in the mispricing persistence of past-winners and losers. After one year, the
alpha of past-losers is approximately zero (0.23%/mo, t=0.85), while the alpha for past-winners is
-0.75%/mo (t=-5.82) over the following four years.

1      Introduction
When there is disagreement about the value of a security, and when pessimists are constrained


from short-selling, only the views of the most optimistic agents will be reected in the security


price (Miller, 1977). Thus, such securities can become overvalued bubble stocks. We nd


that negative returns persist for about ve years for some bubble rms.                    In contrast, for


others, the negative abnormal returns last only about a year.


    We explain the dierences in these decay rates with a psychology-based model that


combines approaches originally introduced several decades ago designed to explain momen-

                                                                                            1
tum, value, and other cross-sectional return patterns among common stocks.                      Among those


proposed were representative agent models (Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998, Daniel,


Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 1998), and heterogeneous agent models (Hong and Stein,


1999). None of these three studies explored the consequences of short-sale restrictions and,


to our knowledge, no subsequent work has examined the predictions of these models for the


behavior of short-sale-constrained stocks, or examined how momentum and value eects are


modied when rms are short-sale constrained. That is what we do here.


                                      [INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]


    Our empirical analysis shows that, among constrained rms, the winner momentum eect


ips in the sense that the rms with the highest past one-year return earn strikingly


negative returns over the following year, and indeed over the following ve years. Over the


rst year, the negative abnormal returns that these constrained winners earn are roughly


consistent with the negative abnormal returns earned by constrained losers. However, where


the constrained winners and losers dier is in the duration of the negative abnormal returns.


This can be seen in Figure 1. As a proxy for short sale constraints, we use a combination of

    1 Note that we refer to value and long-term reversal interchangeably, consistent with the early behavioral
nance literature.

low institutional ownership and high short interest. Finally, we consider winners and losers

                                                          2
(highest/lowest 30% of past one-year returns).


    Figure 1 shows that, after the rst year, the abnormal returns of constrained past losers


are not statistically dierent from zero. In contrast, the constrained winners earn equally


strong negative abnormal returns for the rst year, but then continue earning negative ab-


normal returns for approximately four more years. Loosely speaking, we can say that both


the constrained winners and the constrained losers are bubble stocks, in the sense that both


portfolios earn predictable strong negative returns, consistent with the denition suggested

                     3
in Fama (2014).          However, the bubble collapses quickly for the past losers, and over an


extended period for the past winners.


    The long decay rates for constrained past winners allow us to construct a large value-


weighted portfolio which generates remarkably negative abnormal returns going forward. The


portfolio construction relies on our nding that, even for rms that were constrained winners


up to ve years ago, the expected abnormal returns today are still negative. Consequently, a


value-weighted buy-and-hold portfolio of all stocks that have been constrained winners in the


previous   60   months, should be diversied and earn negative abnormal returns. This is what


we nd: The number of constrained winners in any given month, is                   51   on average, but the


number of rms which have been constrained winners at                 any   point during the previous ve


years is   390,   on average. The time-series average of the portfolios' monthly excess returns

   2 Specically the stocks in the constrained portfolio are in the lowest 30% of institutional ownership, as
a proxy for lending supply, and in the highest 30% of short interest, to identify stocks where agents disagree
about the value.    For the losers, we additionally make sure that these have not been in the constrained
winner portfolio within the past ve years. This is to lter out bubbles that are already in the process of
bursting. The gure plots annualized alphas of 12-month buy-and-hold calendar-time portfolios by holding-
year. Alphas are calculated with respect to the three Fama and French (1993) factors and the Carhart (1997)

       We show that our empirical ndings are consistent with a heterogeneous agent model


which features overcondence and slow information diusion, and which is calibrated to


explain value and momentum in unconstrained stocks. Disagreement, a key feature in our


model, arises endogenously with the arrival of new information. The intuition behind the


model is the following: rst, recall that value eects among unconstrained stocks persist on


the order of ve years (Daniel and Titman, 2006), a time-frame that we label as long-term.


In contrast, momentum eects are short-term, in that they persist about one year (Hong,


Lim, and Stein, 2000, Jegadeesh and Titman, 2001). Our model features informed overcon-


dent agents who receive private signals about which they are overcondent, and where this


overcondence persists in the long run, leading to a long-run value eect for unconstrained


stocks.     The momentum eect, in contrast, is explained by a dierent set of agents who


are like the newswatchers in Hong and Stein (1999). The fact that the momentum eect


is far less persistent than value suggests that the diusion of public information should be


considerably faster than the resolution of overcondence in an empirically sound calibration


of our model.


       For unconstrained securities, the interaction of the overcondent agents and the newswatch-


ers leads to standard momentum and value eects in our model. However, when in this model


a set of securities are hard to borrow, either the overcondent agents or the newswatchers


can become constrained, meaning that they no longer set prices in the market.


       To see the eect of borrowing constraints in this setting, rst consider a strong positive


private information shock to an unconstrained stock.                 The informed overcondent agents


see the shock rst and, owing to their overcondence, overreact and immediately drive the


price up. The newswatchers do not see the full shock (and ignore the information content

   4    The details of the value-weighted buy-and-hold portfolio construction are explained in Section 5.2.
A simple value-weighted portfolio approach, where all stocks' weights are simply their previous month's
market-capitalization, yields an alpha of   ‚àí0.81 (t-statistic: ‚àí5.93).

of prices), so their estimate of rm value is updated insuciently. Therefore, in response to


the price rise they short the stock. However, as the positive shock is gradually revealed to


the newswatchers, they reduce their short position as they update their valuation of the rm


upward. This results in a positive drift of the rm's price, i.e., momentum, and of course


eventual reversal as the overcondence of the informed agents is gradually reduced.


   However, if the rm's stock cannot be shorted, the newswatchers' views will not be fully


incorporated into the price, and the price will reect the informed overcondent agents' views


only.   Thus, without short-selling, the shock will result in a stronger positive reaction, as


the newswatchers are completely sidelined. Moreoever, there will be no momentum, as the


newswatchers' learning does not aect prices, since they are not participating in the market.


There is only a long-term reversal. In line with the duration of the value eect, this reversal


is a long-term phenomenon in the model. Consistent with these predictions, we document


empirically that for short-sale-constrained winners, there is no momentum, only a reversal


which persists for about ve years.


   In contrast, consider the release of a negative private signal. For constrained stocks, the


overcondent informed agents would like to short, but the costs of shorting prohibit them


from doing so. Thus, only the newswatchers  who are the optimists in this scenario 


play a role in setting prices. Now we see an enhanced momentum eect, in the sense that the


stock price falls on the information release date as the overcondent agents leave the market,


and continues falling subsequently as the information diuses through the newswatchers


population. Here however, the duration of the constrained stock's underperformance is far


shorter because information diusion is a faster process. So this model is consistent with the


return patterns that we observe both in constrained and unconstrained stocks and captures


the asymmetry between positive and negative news shocks we observe in the data.

2      Related Literature
Much of the literature on disagreement and asset prices goes back to Miller (1977). Miller


argues that disagreement about future prospects can lead to overpricing in the presence of


short-sale constraints. Subsequent empirical research has explored this argument in great


detail. Consistent with the divergence-of-opinion part of Miller's argument, rms for which


the dispersion of analysts' forecasts of future earnings is high earn lower future stock returns


(Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina, 2002, Danielsen and Sorescu, 2001).                  Overpricing tends


to be most signicant if disagreement and short-sale constraints are simultaneously present


(Boehme, Danielsen, and Sorescu, 2006). Demand shocks in the lending market have pre-


dictive power for future returns (Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter, 2005, Cohen, Diether, and


Malloy, 2007), while shocks to lending supply have no signicant eect (Cohen, Diether,


and Malloy, 2007, Kaplan, Moskowitz, and Sensoy, 2013).                  Returns of constrained stocks


are substantially negative around earnings announcements, which is consistent with the idea


that earnings announcements at least partly resolve disagreement (Berkman, Dimitrov, Jain,


Koch, and Tice, 2009). Anomaly returns tend to be concentrated in stocks that are expen-

                                                                                                          5

In a similar vein, Engelberg, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2018) relate loan fee uncertainty and

straints or costs, including Figlewski (1981), Asquith and Meulbroek (1996), Desai, Ramesh, Thiagarajan,
and Balachandran (2002), or, alternatively, using data on loan fees and/or loan quantities (Jones and Lam-
ont, 2002, Cohen, Diether, and Malloy, 2007, Blocher, Reed, and Van Wesep, 2013). Asquith, Pathak, and
Ritter (2005) consider institutional ownership to proxy for supply and short-interest for demand. The use
of short interest as a single empirical proxy to test Miller (1977) has been criticized by Chen, Hong, and
Stein (2002), among others.   Previous research, such as Asquith and Meulbroek (1996), Dechow, Hutton,
Meulbroek, and Sloan (2001), Desai, Ramesh, Thiagarajan, and Balachandran (2002), Asquith, Pathak, and
Ritter (2005), Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2008), Diether, Lee, and Werner (2009), or Drechsler and Drech-
sler (2016), generally reach signicantly abnormal returns based on short-sale activity with equal weighting
or for short-term horizons.   The empirical approach we develop here provides robust negative long-term
return predictability from high short-interest with value-weighted portfolios.

   D'Avolio (2002) and Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2002) are early papers that study the


lending market using proprietary data. A major takeaway of these studies is that all but


a few percent of common stocks can be borrowed at low cost for short selling purposes.


Results reported by Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2013) suggest that, among the set


of rms with high shorting demands, supply is fairly inelastic, meaning that further increases


in borrowing demand lead to substantial increases in borrowing rates.


   Our model combines key features of these literature strands in one parsimonious model,


makes concrete predictions concerning empirically observable quantities, links the dynamics


of disagreement to the price dynamics and stands in the tradition of other models that


formalize the idea that divergence-of-opinion combined with short-sale constraints inuences


asset prices (see, e.g., Harrison and Kreps, 1978, Diamond and Verrecchia, 1987, Due,


1996, Chen, Hong, and Stein, 2002, Hong and Stein, 2003, Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003,


Gallmeyer and Hollield, 2007, Ang, Shtauber, and Tetlock, 2013, Hong and Sraer, 2016).


Due, G√¢rleanu, and Pedersen (2002) explicitly model the complex search and matching


process on the lending market. Our approach is to model the lending market as a market


where supply and demand determine equilibrium quantities in the same way as on the stock


or a standard goods market, like in the static model of Blocher, Reed, and Van Wesep


(2013). This approximation of the complex search process for borrowing stocks in the real


world allows us to endogenize borrowing costs in a simple way. Our approach keeps the model


as tractable as possible, while still capturing the intertwined supply and demand mechanism


on the lending and stock market that we are interested in and that is at the heart of our


empirical analysis.


   As discussed in more depth in the introduction and the model section, the basis for the


psychological biases of our agents is the behavioral nance literature. Our modeling of the


slow diusion of information among    newswatchers   comes from Hong and Stein (1999), as


does the assumption that these agents ignore the information impounded in prices. Implicit


in our modeling is the assumption that information is costly in terms of eort.       Daniel,




                                              6
Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) argue that when agents expend eort to extract in-


formation, those agents tend to become overcondent about this information, which will


lead them overestimate its precision. This premise is based on the observations that peo-


ple believe that they are better-than-average in what they are doing (see, e.g., Svenson,


1981).   Our second group of agents is therefore motivated by the                informed overcondent
traders of Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998).                Deeper discussions of how the


investor overcondence assumption emerges from the psychological literature as well as fur-


ther applications of overcondence in the nancial literature can be found in Odean (1998),


Odean (1999), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (2001), Barber and Odean (2001),


and Scheinkman and Xiong (2003), among others.


    Our paper further speaks to the ongoing debate whether or not bubbles are empirically

               7
identiable.       The empirical challenge in identifying asset pricing bubbles has been the lack


of observability of the fundamental value which leads to the joint hypothesis problem (Fama,


1970). Recent work by Greenwood, Shleifer, and You (2018) shows that sharp price increases


of industries, along with certain characteristics of this run-up, help to forecast the probability


of crashes and thereby help to identify and time a bubble. Our work adds to this strand


of literature, as we show, on an individual stock basis, that price run-ups can be used to


forecast low future returns when paired with indications of limits of arbitrage. Consistent


with this, previous research shows that short-sale constraints are positively related to the


protability of quantitative strategies designed to exploit mispricing (Nagel, 2005, Hirshleifer,


Teoh, and Yu, 2011, Drechsler and Drechsler, 2016, Engelberg, Reed, and Ringgenberg, 2018).


Our theoretical and empirical approach can be interpreted as a methodology for identifying


individual stock bubbles, and determining the decay rates of these bubbles.

   7 The theoretical literature on limits of arbitrage highlights the possibility of persistent mispricing by
identifying numerous forces that inhibit arbitrage. For example, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) show how biased
beliefs can have an impact on asset prices in the presence of noise trader risk, while Abreu and Brunnermeier
(2002, 2003) introduce synchronization risk to explain why prices can be disconnected from fundamentals.
Gromb and Vayanos (2010) survey and summarize the literature on limits of arbitrage.

3      Model
The empirical work we present in Section 5 suggests that the dynamics of equity prices for


rms which are short-sale constrained are distinctly dierent than those of unconstrained


rms.     Because short-sale constraints will only aect prices if there are dierences across


agents, the price patterns documented here and elsewhere suggest heterogeneity across


agents.    We therefore propose a heterogeneous agent model in which agents dier in the


way that they process new information about rms.                      This model is completely consistent


with value and momentum eects for unconstrained rms, but also matches our new empir-


ical ndings for constrained rms.




3.1       Overview


The equilibrium price of an asset is the price at which all agents believe their holdings


are optimal.      In heterogeneous agent models with risk-averse agents, frictionless markets


and agents who ignore the information contained in prices, the equilibrium price is a linear


function of the weighted average of the beliefs held by these agents (see, e.g., the discussion


of the competitive equilibrium in Chapter 12 of Campbell, 2018). Short sale costs can partly


or fully sideline some of these agents, leading to a dierent equilibrium price that no longer

                                                              8
fully reects the beliefs of all market participants.


    In our model, heterogeneous agents with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) trade


an asset that will pay a liquidating dividend at            T     that is the sum of dividend innovations


about the rm observed each period from           t = 1, . . . , T .   Agents may disagree about the mean


and the variance of these dividend innovations, but as these agents observe the innovations


each period they update their priors.

    8 By sideline,   we mean here that the agent would choose to short the security in the absence of the
costs of borrowing. Agents may be partly sidelined, in the sense that they short less of the security than
they otherwise would, or fully sidelined in the sense that they choose not to participate at all (i.e., to short
zero shares).




                                                       8
    For modeling convenience, we follow recent behavioral models (see, e.g., Barberis, Green-


wood, Jin, and Shleifer, 2018, Da, Huang, and Jin, 2018) in assuming that each period                    t,
                                                                  9
each agent maximizes his utility as of period            t + 1.       To solve this portfolio optimization,


each agent needs to determine the distribution of the equilibrium price in period              t + 1, which
will be based on the beliefs of all agents in the economy. We assume that, in calculating this


distribution, each agent makes the strong assumption that disagreement will be resolved in


the following period in such a way that all other agents will come to agree with him. This


makes the solution far more tractable, and moreover is consistent with the illusion of valid-

ity of Kahneman and Tversky (1973).              In other words, agents believe that their views are


correct, and that others will gure that out sooner rather than later.


    A key model feature that drives our results is that access to private information is paired


with overcondence. Motivated by this, in our model there are two types of agents. The


rst set of agents are informed        overcondent       agents.       They receive all new information


immediately. Consistent with Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), this access to


information makes them overcondent about the signal they receive, in that they assess the


signal precision to be higher than it actually is.


    The second set of agentswho we label          newswatchers are similar to the newswatchers of
Hong and Stein (1999) in that the new information (that the informed observe immediately)


slowly diuses through the population of newswatchers.                     Crucially, we follow Hong and


Stein (1999) in assuming that newswatchers ignore the information content of prices; that


is they fail to infer informed agents' signals from prices.                Slow information diusion has


been put forward as an explanation of shorter-term momentum eects (Hong and Stein,


1999), while the resolution of overcondence has been used to explain longer-term value

   9 Alternatively, agents might assume that they will never trade again and hold their portfolio until the
nal period (see, e.g., Hong and Stein, 1999). The resulting empirical predictions of such a modied model


  10 Kahneman and Tversky (1973) suggest the term illusion of validity for the observation that people
(not reported) are qualitatively the same.


are prone to experience much condence in highly fallible judgments. Kahneman (2011) links this illusion
to the nancial industry (see pages 212 to 216 for a discussion on what Kahneman calls the illusion of
stock-picking skills).




                                                     9
eects (Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 1998). Consistent with this, we assume that


the resolution of overcondence requires more time than the information diusion process,


and show that the interaction of newswatchers and overcondent agents generates standard


short-term momentum and long-term value eects for unconstrained stocks, consistent with


empirical ndings.


   The intuition for the key model implications is straightforward. First, consider an un-


constrained stock for which there is strong positive news about cashows. This information


is rst observed by the informed (and overcondent) agents who, by virtue of their overcon-


dence, put too much weight on the information. The newswatchers do not initially receive


this information, and moreover ignore the information content of prices.      Thus, the price


moves up as the overcondent agents buy and the newswatchers sell. Moreover, as the new


information diuses through the population of newswatchers, the price moves up further,


generating momentum, and overreaction because of the informed agents' overcondence. Fi-


nally, as more information is released, the overreaction is corrected, producing a value eect.


For unconstrained stocks, the momentum/value eect is symmetric for positive or negative


information releases. This is not the case for constrained stocks.


   For constrained stocks that become winners as a result of a strong positive information


release, newswatchers will be sidelined. This implies that price dynamics largely follow the


belief dynamics of overcondent agents and these rms quickly become overpriced.          The


resolution of overcondence takes as long as for unconstrained stocks, resulting in low long-


term returns for these stocks.


   For constrained rms that become losers as a result of bad news about cashows, it


will generally be the overcondent agents who will be sidelined, and the newswatchers will


therefore set prices. These loser stocks are overpriced as well, as the negative information


diuses slowly into the price. However, in contrast to constrained winners, strong negative


returns of constrained losers will only be observed over the short time period over which


information diuses.




                                              10
       Thus, our model, which produces standard value and momentum eects for unconstrained


stocks, suggests that for constrained stocks, there will be no momentum eect for winners,


but an exaggerated momentum eect for losers.                          Our model further suggests that both,


constrained winners and constrained losers, can be labeled as bubble rms, as both earn


strong negative future returns. An interesting implication of our model is that, for the past-


loser rms, the bubble will collapse over the short horizon over which momentum is observed,


i.e. about 1 year. For the past-winner rms the bubble collapse will take as long as value


eects, i.e. about ve years.                These predictions are consistent with the empirical ndings


documented in Section 5.




3.2       General Model


There are two assets: a risk free asset with fully elastic supply which earns a return of zero


each period, and a risky asset which pays a liquidating dividend                      DÃÉT   at time   T.   To capture


the information dynamics that drive the dynamics of return predictability, we follow Hong


and Stein (1999) and specify that the liquidating dividend is a sum of dividend innovations


each period      t ‚àà {1, . . . , T }.   11
                                             That is:




                                              DÃÉT = D0 + Àú1 + Àú2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ÀúT .                                (1)




Hong and Stein (1999) specify that the innovations are mean zero.                             In contrast, in our


specication the innovations 
                             Àút               ‚àº N (¬µ , œÉ 2 ) are i.i.d. draws from a distribution with constant
variance    œÉ2   and (time invariant) mean              ¬µ .   The agents in our model do not directly observe


¬µ .   They do have a valid, common prior distribution at time                       t = 0, ¬µ ‚àº N (0, Œ∂ 2 ),    and


over time agents observe, partly or completely, the realized dividend innovations (t 's) and


update their beliefs about              ¬µ   based on these observations. All agents are Bayesian, but do


not optimally use all information available to them.

  11 We follow Hong and Stein (1999) and call the 's dividend innovations or just innovations. An alternative
term in the literature is cash-ow shocks (Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer, 2018).




                                                                11
    The motivation for this specication is the following: given symmetric information at


t = 0,   all agents agree on the rm value in period            t = 0.   However, because after this point


they see dierent parts of the information set and process this information dierently, they


will start to disagree about the rm's value over time. Their disagreement will be captured


by dierent posterior distributions for      ¬µ .   One group will become relatively more optimistic,


meaning they think that the rm will generate higher average cashows going forward, and


the second group will be relatively more pessimistic. Our objective in writing the model this


way is to develop an understanding of how this disagreement will evolve over time, and how


this disagreement will aect price dynamics.


    Given our modeling assumptions, each agent's posterior distribution for                      ¬µ will be normal,
but the distributions will have dierent means and variances. Specically, for an agent from


subgroup    i,   we denote the mean and variance of their posterior distribution over                     ¬µ ,   after


observing the new information at time           t,   as   ¬µ ‚àº N (Œ±ÃÇit , Œ∑ÃÇit2 ).   What kind of information


dierent agents see and how they update their priors will dene the subgroup of an agent,


and will be specied later.




3.2.1 Agents

There are multiple groups of agents in our model.                   Each group consists of a measure of


agents with identical information and preferences, and who form beliefs in the same way.


The rst group consists of passive investors.              In aggregate, the group of passive investors


demands exactly the total outstanding supply of shares, independent of the share price. The


set of passive investors is further stratied into institutional and individual investors.                         In


our setting, the only dierence between these sub-groups is that institutional investors are

                                                                                            12
willing to lend out shares at zero cost, while individual investors do not.


    Any further group of agents is assumed to be active.                   Each active agent forms beliefs,


trades, and sets prices so as to maximize individual utility.                       Since the passive investors

  12 This assumption is consistent with evidence presented in D'Avolio (2002) showing that lendable shares
are predominantly supplied by large institutional investors like passive index funds.




                                                      12
demand the total outstanding supply of shares, active agents must therefore hold zero shares


in aggregate; they compete with each other on the basis of their diering beliefs about the


value of the risky security. Each period t, all active agents maximize utility over their period


t+1       wealth.      Their utility is exponential with risk-aversion coecient              Œ≥i ,   where index        i
denotes the active agents' group.


      There are no trading costs. However, as in the markets we examine later on, all active


agents are required to rst locate and borrow any shares they sell short. Search frictions, as


specied below can lead to a borrowing cost of            ct (per period, per share), which is determined
endogenously. To simplify, we assume that share lending takes place in a centralized market


so the cost       ct   is the same for any agent borrowing the stock. We further assume that any

                                                                               13
active agent who buys shares does not lend out these shares.                        In the following, we refer to


active agents by using the single word agents (as opposed to passive investors, who do not


trade actively).




3.2.2 Demands and the equilibrium price

At time      t,   given a posterior distribution    ¬µ ‚àº N (Œ±ÃÇit , Œ∑ÃÇit2 ),   an agent from group        i   expects a


liquidating dividend of:


                                         Eit [DT ] = Dit + Œ±ÃÇit (T ‚àí t).                                             (2)


                          Pt
where     Dit = D0 +         s=1 it is the sum of the realized dividend innovations           t 's    through time


t.   He thinks that each upcoming piece of information will have a mean of                     Œ±ÃÇit .   The variance


of the predictive return distribution for the upcoming dividend innovation is                        œÉÃÇit2 = œÉ 2 + Œ∑ÃÇit2 ,
the sum of the variance of innovations and the variance of the own parameter estimate about


¬µ    (see, for example, Brandt, 2010).

     13 Note that the existence of hard-to-borrow stocks is not possible if every agent makes their shares freely
available for borrowing, for example through a margin account, and brokers lend out all available shares. In
equilibrium, pessimists would just short exactly the number of shares that optimists demand and shorting
fees would always be zero. Our extreme assumption is made to capture the empirical regularities that stocks
do become costly to borrow and that not all investors lend out their shares (see Reed, 2013, for a recent
survey of the literature on short selling).




                                                        13
    In this CARA-normal setting, myopic demand is just the expected price next period


Eit [pt+1 ],   minus the current price              pt ,   scaled by the risk-aversion coecient times the payo


variance.      Thus, the demand function depends on an assumption regarding agents' beliefs


about the price in the next period (Eit                      [pt+1 ]).   We assume that agents are overcondent in


the sense that they believe that all other agents will agree next period that they were actually


right. As a consequence, they think that there will be no disagreement in the next period,


which directly implies         Eit [ct+1 ] = 0             for all groups    i.   They further believe that the market


price will be equal to their belief about the nal payo next period. As we will see shortly,


this is consistent with the equilibrium price function in the sense that the equilibrium price


is, in our setting, just the identical belief of all agents if there is no disagreement. Expressed


mathematically, we have           Eit [pt+1 ] = Eit [Ei,t+1 [DT ]],               a term that is equal to           Eit [DT ]   by the


law of iterated expectations. We nally obtain                           Eit [pt+1 ] = Dit + Œ±ÃÇit (T ‚àí t) by using equation
(2).


    So given an equilibrium price               pt ‚â§ Eit [DT ], the demand of an agent in group i is positive
                   14
and given by:



                            Eit [DT ] ‚àí pt   Dit + Œ±ÃÇit (T ‚àí t) ‚àí pt
                    dit =             2
                                           =                                                  if   pt ‚â§ Eit [DT ] .                (3)

However, if the price is above what the agent expects the payo to be (i.e., if                                       pt ‚â• Eit [DT ]),
he may elect to borrow the stock and sell it. To do so, the agent must pay the per-unit cost


of borrowing the shares from               t   to   t + 1,    which we denote         ct .   He will thus choose to go short


if and only if the dierence between what he receives from shorting (pt ), is greater than the


the sum of the expected cost of buying back the share next period                                         (= Et [pt+1 ] = Eit [DT ])
plus the cost of borrowing          ct .   His demandwhich will be negativeis:



               Eit [DT ] + ct ‚àí pt    pt ‚àí (Dit + Œ±ÃÇit (T ‚àí t)) ‚àí ct
       dti =               2

Note that, if        ct > 0,   the demand of an agent in group                           i    will be zero for a range of prices


Eit [DT ] ‚â§ pt ‚â§ Eit [DT ] + ct .        For an equilibrium                 pt   in this range, the agents in group i will

adjustment accounts for their risk aversion (Œ≥i ) and their perceived parameter uncertainty

(œÉÃÇit ).   Œ±ÃÇmt   is then the weighted average expectation of                      ¬µ , and Dmt        is the weighted average of


the sum of privately observed dividend innovations                               's.   For an unconstrained stock (ct               = 0),
equation (5) shows that the market price is simply a weighted average of single beliefs


specied in equation (2). The weights depend on how aggressively a group trades. equation


(5) shows further that constrained stocks are overpriced relative to the average market belief


and that the degree of overpricing is proportional to the per-share shorting cost                                       ct .

3.2.3 The cost of borrowing shares

Consistent with US institutional restrictions, we require that stock must be borrowed before

it can be sold short.             Borrowing costs are determined in equilibrium, and are the price at


which the supply of shares are equal to the demand from agents (as in Blocher, Reed, and


Van Wesep, 2013). The supply is determined by the costs of nding new shares to borrow.


We model the supply of shares                Xt   to the lending market as a function of the borrowing cost

where        Q      is the number of shares outstanding.         The intuition for this specication is as


follows: rst, a fraction           Œª   of the passive investors are always willing to lend out their shares


in the lending market, regardless of the borrowing cost. We can think of this as institutional


lending supply, coming from index funds, pension funds, etc., that have set up a stock lending


program. As long as the demand to borrow shares is less than the institutional supply of


ŒªQ,        the institutions compete in the lending market, driving the cost of borrowing to zero.


However, after the institutional lending supply is exhausted, nding additional shares to


borrow requires the payment of search costs.


          We implicitly assume that the lending market is a perfectly functioning market, meaning


that each stock borrower must pay the equilibrium cost per stock                ct and not the marginal cost
of nding his own additional share. We can imagine a clearinghouse that collects the supply


and demand schedule and then sets the equilibrium price for lending accordingly. The passive


investors earn the rents from lending their shares but, by assumption, this does not aect


their decision to hold the underlying shares. Similarly, those who can nd shares to borrow


at a cost of less than         ct   are (eectively) assumed to borrow those shares at the equilibrium


cost of      ct .   The per-unit borrowing cost       ct , for every share borrowed, is therefore equal to the
     15   Further, stock may only be borrowed for the purpose of short selling.     Thus, the number of shares
borrowed is at all times equal to the number of shares sold short.

marginal cost, that is the cost of nding the last share that is borrowed. Furthermore,                                     ct   is


also equal to the average search cost per share.


    Rearranging equation (9) gives the cost per share of borrowing stock as a function of the


total number of shares borrowed (Xt ):




                                       ct (Xt ) = max (0, œÑ (Xt ‚àí ŒªQ)) .                                                    (10)

The rst derivative with respect to short-interest                   Xt    (for   Xt > ŒªQ)       is equal to
                                                                                                                   ‚àÇXt

is the amount by which the borrowing cost                ct    increases for each additional share borrowed.


Consistent with the empirical evidence documented by Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg


(2013), we specify that marginal search costs increase with the number of shares borrowed,


and in our specication they increase linearly in                   Xt ,   once demand exceeds the institutional


supply. Note also that,       ceteris paribus,       borrowing a share is cheaper for stocks with higher


institutional lending supply.

Intuitively, costs increase with the adjusted measure of short-sellers (                                i‚ààSt   Œ†it ),   and with


the magnitude of the short-sellers' disagreement with the market beliefs ((Dmt ‚àí Dit + (Œ±ÃÇmt ‚àí


Œ±ÃÇit )(T ‚àí t)).   Further intuition for equation (12) is given in Appendix A.II.


    An equilibrium in period           t   is a situation where market clearing conditions (5) and (12)


hold and where each agent acts optimally given the equilibrium prices and shorting costs.


Note that this also implies that agents in set             Lt   choose optimally a positive demand, agents

in set   St   prefer a negative demand, and agents who are in neither set have a zero demand in


equilibrium.




3.3         Heterogeneous Agents


In this subsection, we specify an application of the general model outlined above. Specically


we specify that, in addition to the set of passive investors, there are two groups of actively


trading agents. Each group has its own set of biases and/or information disadvantages.


    As noted earlier, the key assumptions that drive the information processing of our two


types of agents are that:        (1) informed agents are    overcondent    (Daniel, Hirshleifer, and


Subrahmanyam, 1998), and (2) the uninformed              newswatchers,   who receive this information


slowly, are not overcondent.


    The informed agents are all quick, in that they receive all new information immediately.


They perceive each signal to be a private signal, as all other market participants are unable to


fully observe their signal t at time t. Consistent with Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam


(1998), their overcondence about their signal leads them to overestimate signal precision,


and thus to overweight the signal. In contrast, the newswatchers see only a part of             t   in the


upcoming periods. They form beliefs by Bayesian updating, but they ignore the information


contained in prices.




3.3.1 Timing of Information

We dene       Œ¥t = t ‚àí ¬µ   as the (mean zero) surprise component of each dividend innovation


release. Following Hong and Stein (1999), each surprise         Œ¥t is decomposed into n sub-surprises
Œ¥tt+i , i ‚àà [0; (n ‚àí 1)],   with mean zero and variance   œÉ 2 /n.
                                                                                          Pt+n‚àí1
    The overcondent agents see the entire innovation         Ot = t = ¬µ +Œ¥Ot = ¬µ +    j=t        Œ¥tj   at


time   t.   The newswatchers see signals based on sub-surprises one after another. Specically,


newswatchers observe a signal         N t   based on all sub-surprises with superscript    t   at time


n ‚â§ t < T,      i.e.,



                                                    18

                                                                                 X

                                                                             j=t‚àín+1


                                                 INSERT Table 1 HERE



       Table 1 illustrates the timing of information for a information diusion period of                                      n = 3.
Each surprise         Œ¥t   has its own row in the table and is the sum of sub-surprises                                     Œ¥tt+i , i ‚àà
[0; (n ‚àí 1)].   The signal's surprise component of overcondent agents (Œ¥Ot 's) are exactly equal


to these row sums. The newswatchers see one sub-surprise from each previous period that


lies in   [t ‚àí n + 1; t].       The surprise component          Œ¥N t   of their signal is the column sum in Table


1. Newswatchers think that all of their signals                     Œ¥N t   have variance          œÉ2,   which is correct except

                                            16
for a start- and an end-eect.                   For example, their signal in period 3 is the sum of three


sub-surprises that originate in periods one, two, and three, respectively.




3.3.2 Formation of Beliefs

In period 0, we assume that the common prior distribution of all agents accurately reects


the distribution from which                ¬µ    was drawn.      In each following period, overcondent and


newswatchers observe their dividend innovation                             Ot   and    N t ,   respectively.        Subsequently,


trading takes place. After trading has taken place in the last period,                                   DT   is paid out.


       Agents form beliefs about the unknown value of                            ¬µ    at time     t    after having seen their


innovation      Ot   or     N t   and before trading takes place. Newswatchers assume that the signal


is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the unknown mean                                             ¬µ   and known


variance    œÉ2.   The informed (and overcondent) agents incorrectly believe that their signals


have variance         Œ∫œÉ 2    with    0<Œ∫<1       lower than the true variance                   œÉ2.
       All agents use Bayes' rule to combine their prior belief about                              ¬µ   and their signal         Ot   or


N t   into a posterior belief.           The beliefs of overcondent agent evolve according to                                Œ±ÃÇOt =
  16 See Table 1. In the rst periods, there are not enough sub-surprises available and equation (13) eectively
                           Pt       t
becomes    N t = ¬µ  +        j=1 Œ¥j . In the nal period  t = T,   newswatchers are assumed to observe all remaining
                                                            Pt         t

demands in period         t    on these beliefs.




3.4       Implications


Before we turn to the asset pricing implications, we study the endogenously arising disagree-


ment among overcondent agents and newswatchers in the case of extreme fundamental


shocks.     To set the stage, assume that the starting dividend                         D0 = 50,        that   T = 12      and


nature determines        ¬µ     to be equal to    2.   Overcondent agents and newswatchers do not know


the true value of       ¬µ ,   but their uncertainty about the unknown value can be described by a

                                                                                              2      2      2
common normally distributed prior with zero mean and variance                               Œ∑ÃÇO0 = Œ∑ÃÇN 0 = Œ∂ = 1.          Let


the known variance of dividend innovations                     œÉ2   be   2.   As in Table 1, we set the information


diusion period to        n = 3.
      Assume now that there is a large surprise                     Œ¥1 = Œ¥Q1 = 4        in the rst period and that


all following surprises are zero. The overcondent investor thus perceives this as an initial


innovation of O1      = 6, followed by a series of Ot = 2 for all remaining time periods t ‚àà [2; 12].
      As in Hong and Stein (1999), information travels slowly for the newswatchers. Instead of


observing the large surprise in the rst period immediately, they see sub-surprises assumed


to be equal     Œ¥11 = 2, Œ¥12 = 1.5,        and   Œ¥13 = 0.5,    respectively. Together with the assumption of


zero surprises in periods 2 to 12, this leads, in our example, the newswatcher population


to perceive dividend innovations of               N 1 = 4, N 2 = 3.5, N 3 = 2.5,             and    N t = 2   for periods


t ‚àà [4; 12].

it, and become far too optimistic about the value of the nal liquidating dividend                Dt .   Over


time, the overcondent agents learn (slowly) from further dividend innovations the true value


of   ¬µ .   In contrast, it takes three periods for the newswatcher to see all the positive informa-


tion that the overcondent agents see in the rst period. However, they do not overreact,


and, as a consequence, their belief step-wise approaches the rational expectation belief. In


period      t = 3,   beliefs of newswatchers and rational expectation beliefs nally coincide.


      What are the consequences for asset prices? For unconstrained assets (Œª                =1    in Panel


B), our heterogeneous agent model states that the equilibrium price is simply a weighted


average of single beliefs. As a consequence and given the beliefs of overcondent agents and


newswatchers, the asset price in an unconstrained market, the blue line in Panel B of Figure 2,


is the weighted average of the beliefs shown in Panel A. Overcondent agents are long, while


newswatchers are short in the stock. The price path exhibits short-term momentum caused


by slow information diusion among the newswatchers (as in Hong and Stein, 1999). After


newswatchers have learned the correct value of             ¬µ ,   the stock is overpriced, as overcondent


agents are still too optimistic (as in Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 1998) about


the nal liquidating dividend        DT .   The overpricing vanishes in the long run, consistent with

                               17
long-term value eects.


      The dynamics of prices are fundamentally dierent for a constrained winner (Œª                  =0    in


Panel B). For simplicity, we consider in our example an extreme short-selling constraint,


modeled through a combination of no institutional lending supply (Œª                = 0)   and unaordable


search costs (œÑ        ‚Üí ‚àû).   The opinions from the newswatchers, who are the pessimists in the


case of good news, are now completely sidelined from the market and the overcondent


agents are setting the price. As a consequence, the price overshoots with the large surprise

     17 Note that we have deliberately chosen a calibration of our model that predicts a short-term momentum
and a long-term value eect for unconstrained stocks.      It is possible to choose extreme parameterization,
where there are no such eects. However, such calibrations are clearly inconsistent with the large empirical
evidence on momentum and value for unconstrained stocks.

in period    t = 1.   We do not see a momentum eect. The source of the momentum eect,


slow information diusion, plays no role in the price setting process, as newswatchers' beliefs


are no longer reected in the market price. The stock experiences long-term negative price


changes caused by the slow resolution of overcondence.


     Panel C and Panel D of Figure 2 show beliefs and prices for a loser stock. The assumptions


of our example are unchanged, except that all surprises and             ¬µ are multiplied with ‚àí1.     Beliefs


in Panel C and the dynamics of prices of an unconstrained loser mirror the beliefs and price


dynamics of a unconstrained winner. The overcondent agents, who overreact on the large


negative surprise in the rst period, are now the pessimists and short the stock. Short-term


momentum is again caused by slow information diusion and long-term value has its roots


in the resolution of overcondence over time.


     The symmetry between winners and loser breaks down for the constrained case.                        The


friction sidelines the opinion of the pessimists, who are now the overcondent agents. The


dynamics of prices reect the newswatchers' dynamics of beliefs. An exaggerated momentum


eect results, as prices in the rst and the second period are higher than they would be in


the unconstrained case. After the newswatcher have seen all the negative information, there


is no value eect.       The opinions of pessimistic overcondent agents, who are causing the

                                                                                             18   19

4       Data
We collect monthly and daily return, market capitalization and volume data from the Center


for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Our sample consists of all common ordinary NYSE,

                                                                   20

a constrained loser. However, the eect would be smaller than in the unconstrained case, as the beliefs of

overcondent agents would be partly sidelined.


    20 Specically, we only consider stocks with exchange code 1, 2 or 3, and share code 10 or 11.


                                                      22
     In the next section, we form portfolios based on a number of rm-specic variables. The


rst sorting variable is a measure of each rm's cumulative            past return   from month     t ‚àí 12
to   t ‚àí 2,   relative to formation at the beginning of month          t.    This is just the measure of


momentum used in Carhart (1997).


     The second sorting variable, the    institutional ownership ratio (IOR), is based on Thomson-
Reuters Institutional 13-F lings until June 2013, and on WRDS-collected SEC data after

              21
June 2013.         We divide the number of shares held by institutions by the number of shares


outstanding from CRSP to get the institutional ownership ratio (IOR). We update portfolios


every quarter and assume that the holdings data is in the investors' information set with a

                      22
lag of one month.


     The third sorting-variable, the     short-interest ratio (SIR),        is constructed based on data


from two sources:          From June 2003 on, we use Compustat.             Short interest data prior to

                                                                                     23
June 2003 data come directly from the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ.                              The pre-2003/06

complemented with exchange data whenever there is no Compustat record for a given rm-

that. Compustat coverage of NASDAQ is scarce before June 2003, which is why exchange data is the primary
source for NASDAQ before that date.     Furthermore, data from NASDAQ in February and July 1990 are
missing, as pointed out in, e.g., Hanson and Sunderam (2014), and we consequently completely eliminate
these months from all analyses. See Curtis and Fargher (2014), Ben-David, Drake, and Roulstone (2015),
and, Hwang and Liu (2014) for other papers using these data sources.

     Analyst-forecasts of scal-year-end earnings are from Institutional Broker's Estimate Sys-


tem (IBES). We use the summary le unadjusted for stock splits, to avoid the bias induced by


ex-post split adjustment, as pointed out by Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002).                 Earnings-
forecast-dispersion (EFD)        is the standard-deviation of forecasts normalized by the absolute


value of its mean. We eliminate values where the mean forecast is between -0.1 and +0.1,

                                                                                          25
as very low mean forecasts lead to extremely large values that bias results.




5       Empirical Results
We start by assessing the model's main predictions about the price dynamics.                         We use


institutional ownership as a proxy for lending supply. It is closely related to lending supply


(see, e.g., D'Avolio, 2002) and has been used to proxy for borrowing constraints (see, e.g.,


Nagel, 2005).      Second, high disagreement implies high short-selling activity (as agents in


the model hold a zero net position in aggregate).              It can be measured by calculating the


short-interest ratio (SIR), which is reported in the middle of the month. Last, we use the


past 12-month return (skipping the most recent month) as a proxy for the direction of


fundamental shocks that can potentially be accompanied by disagreement.                        This choice is


consistent with the large literature on momentum.


     We single out candidate overpriced stocks by an independent triple sort: We divide the


universe of stocks into three buckets according to their past return (MOM), short-interest


(SIR) and the institutional ownership (IOR). The breakpoints are 0.3 and 0.7, as in Fama and


French (1993). Making this an independent sort helps get more independent variation in all


three variables. The three-by-three-by-three sort provides us with 27 portfolios. Each port-


folio is value-weighted, both to avoid liquidity-related-biases associated with equal-weighted

    25 As an alternative specication, we follow Johnson (2004) and use total assets to normalize. Results are
available upon request and do not change any conclusions, consistent with the ndings in Johnson (2004).

portfolios, and to ensure that the eect we document is not only driven by extremely low


market capitalization stocks. The portfolio of stocks that are in the low institutional own-


ership and high short interest bucket will be called the constrained portfolio, for each


past-return bucket (winners or   W , medium momentum or M , and, losers or L), respectively.
   The model implies dierent return patterns for dierent horizons. Consistent with the


literature on momentum and value, we assume information diusion to take about a year, and


the decay of overcondence to take about ve years. Consequently, over the rst year after


formation, all constrained stocks are predicted to underperform.     Since it takes longer for


overcondence to be resolved, and overcondent agents are optimists in the case of positive


news, we expect a prolonged decay of prices among winners  on the order of ve years.


In the empirical tests that aim at capturing the asymmetry between positive and negative


news, we focus on the rst 5 years, as the return-eects are predicted to be strongest in the


earlier periods, and fade out towards the end (see Panel B in Figure 2).


   We additionally split the constrained losers into losers that were (‚àà W) or were not (‚àà
                                                                                         / W)
a constrained winner within the past 5 years. Our model predicts that constrained winners'


prices fall for a long period of time.   Ceteris paribus, they will hence still be constrained


stocks after the rst few years. However, they will have already lost in value over those rst


few years, potentially making them constrained losers. These constrained losers are not losers


based on a negative information shock, followed by slow information diusion (as the red


prole in Panel D in Figure 2). Rather, these are former constrained winners that are already


somewhere in the process of disagreement (and prices) adjusting downwards, through waning


overcondence (e.g. a stock whose price behaves like the red line in Panel B of Figure 2,


at period 2 or 3). Consequently, ltering those L(‚ààW) stocks out of the constrained loser


portfolio should give us a portfolio that better reects the return patterns associated with


slow information diusion and short-sale constraints.     We call that portfolio constrained


losers that were not constrained winners in the past 5 years, or in short: L(‚àà
                                                                              / W).

Some basic characteristics about our portfolios are reported in Table 2.                   We can see that,


on average, each month, 51 stocks are classied as constrained winners, and 88 as con-


strained losers. 48 of those, on average, were also constrained winners in the past 5 years.

                                                                                                     27
The representative constrained winner stock has a market capitalization of $2.43B.                          Con-


strained losers are all considerably smaller.         Past returns are large in absolute magnitude


for winners/losersclose to doubling/halving in size over the formation period.                      Institu-


tional ownership is around 16.14% for all constrained stocks, indicating a good chance of


these stocks being hard to borrow. The third sorting variable, short-interest (SIR) shows an


average of 6.52%, conrming a pronounced demand for short-selling these stocks.


    A rm's book-to-market ratio can be interpreted as a noisy proxy for mispricing. Table


2 conrms that our identied constrained winners are the most expensive relative to their


book-value, with a ratio of 27%, which is in line with their relative outperformance over the


ranking period. In addition to this, the constrained stocks exhibit the largest idiosyncratic


volatility relative to a Fama and French 3-factor model within the month prior to portfolio


formation, as well as large levels and increases in turnover, consistent with disagreement


among traders.      Turnover for L(‚ààW) went down over the previous year, consistent with


waning overcondence and declining disagreement.


    The model also predicts that the selected stocks became very expensive to sell short


over the formation period. The last few rows display the levels and changes of the Markit


indicative and simple average loan fee.          It clearly shows that the fees in the constrained

                                                                                                       28
portfolios are large and that there was a large increase over the previous 12 months.

that short-selling our constrained stocks might be prohibitively expensive. However, investors can simply




                                                     26
   As the Markit data is only available from 2004, we calculate two additional measures


for the full sample period going back to 1988.           The rst one is SIRIO, i.e., the number


of stocks currently being shorted (short interest) divided by the number of stocks held


by institutions (institutional ownership), following Drechsler and Drechsler (2016).                This


measure is particularly attractive as it has an interpretation within our model. It tells us


how close or how far above we are to the institutional lending supply threshold. Assuming


the unknown fraction of institutions that are willing and able to lend out for free is one half,


for instance, a SIRIO measure above 50% would indicate that the demand for short-selling


is larger than institutional lending supply and thus, investors are willing to pay high search


costs in order to still be able to short the stock.


   The numbers in Table 2 clearly speak in favor of this phenomenon.                   On average, the


constrained winners exhibit a SIRIO of 87.57%, which would push them above point of free


lending in the example above and make short-selling these stocks highly expensive. A further


proxy for short-sale costs is calculated with options data. Following Cremers and Weinbaum


(2010), we display the volatility spread at month-end of matched put/call option pairs. A


large negative number indicates a strong deviation from put-call parity in the direction of


the put-option being relatively expensive. This has been linked to short-sale constraints by,


e.g., Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004). Again, all constrained portfolios exhibit large


negative values here.




5.2     Short-term Performance


                                      [INSERT Table 3 HERE]


We rst analyze the short-term return implications. Table 3 reports the average monthly


excess returns of the 9 winner (Panel A), 9 medium momentum (Panel B) and 9 loser (Panel


C) portfolios. Portfolios are displayed according to our triple-sorting procedure: Institutional


ownership (IOR), going from high to low, on the x-axis; Short interest (SIR) going from low

benet from the insights of this paper by avoiding past constrained winners, when running medium/small-cap
momentum strategies, as indicated by Table B.6 in the Appendix.



                                                   27
to high on the y-axis; and past-return, going from winners to losers in Panels A to C.


The stocks where we expect the largest overpricing, i.e., those with the lowest institutional


ownership and with the largest short-interest (constrained stocks), have average monthly


excess returns of -0.47% and -1.54% for winners and losers, respectively.                 Consistent with


the model, the returns for the most extreme past return portfolios, i.e., constrained winners


and constrained losers, are larger in magnitude than those for the constrained medium past-

                     29
return portfolios.


       For winners, short-sale constraints change the sign of the prediction, making it an ideal


testing ground for our theory.        Indeed, the average return for the corner winners appears


particularly low when compared to the other winner portfolios. All other winner portfolios

                                                                                        30
feature large positive excess returns with an average around 1% per month.                   Comparing the


constrained winners to the high-IOR/high-SIR winners, results in a dierence of -1.52% per


month with a Newey-West t-statistic of -5.06. The rightmost column show the alpha from


a Fama-French four-factor regression, which is also highly statistically signicant. Similarly,


taking the column's bottom vs. top dierence produces an excess return of -1.54% per month


(t-statistic -3.91), which can also not be explained by the four factors.


       The results extend to a holding period of one year.             To assess longer-term holding-


period returns in way that realistically reects a historical investor's experience, we rely


on calendar-time portfolios, as advocated by Fama (1998). In order to make the approach


less trading-intensive, and thus even more realistic when taking trading-costs into account,


we construct buy-and-hold calendar-time portfolios. Each month, we perform the triple-


sort, to determine the allocation to the most recent portfolio. The investor then invests                1
  29   Notice, as shown in Table B.4 in the Appendix, that the majority of stocks is concentrated on the
diagonal from bottom-left to top-right, consistent with short-selling being more (less) prevalent where it is
easier (more dicult) to implement.    The largest stocks are medium IOR, on average, consistent with a
u-shaped association between institutional ownership and size, as also evident in the signicantly negative

winners and losers. However, as mentioned in the previous footnote, the majority of stocks is concentrated
on the diagonal from bottom-left to top-right, and the largest stocks are found in the medium IOR-buckets.
Averaging returns over all but the bottom-right-corner portfolio, there is a signicant momentum eect, i.e.,
winners outperform losers by about 65 BP/month.

portfolio held in month              t   then consists of each of the last 12 constrained winner portfolios


formed in months              t ‚àí 12 up to t ‚àí 1.   In contrast to Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), we weight


each of the 12 portfolios held by its cumulated dollar value, i.e., we do not rebalance the


invested amount for             T   (here   T = 12)   months, and the portfolio return calculation reects a

                                    31
buy-and-hold approach.


     Due to the distinction between                ‚ààW     and     ‚àà
                                                                  / W,   and the necessity to look back 5 years, to


determine if a stock had been a constrained winner before, our sample period shrinks by 5


years. Hence, the rst time we can invest in our                       T = 12-month buy-and-hold strategy is July
1994, i.e., when we were, for the rst time, able to allocate stocks into the W, L(‚ààW), and


L(‚àà
  / W) portfolios for 12 months in a row. Table 4 displays the results. Panel A shows the
raw monthly average returns as well as the number of months (T), average number of unique


stocks per portfolio each month (AvgN) and the Sharpe ratio (SR). Constrained losers (L),

    Traditional equal-weight calendar-time portfolios with overlapping holding-periods, as in Jegadeesh and
Titman (1993), can be found in Appendix C.III. We prefer the buy-and-hold specication as it requires less
rebalancing and thus minimizes trading costs.
    In addition, we also construct a version of the portfolios, where we just include any stock that falls into
        p at any point in time during the formation period (the past 12 months here) weighted by the stock's
portfolio
market equity at the end of the formation period      t ‚àí 1. The main dierence to our default buy-and-hold
approach is that a stock that fell into a portfolio more than once during the past T months is only considered
once here. The results of this can be found in Appendix C.IV.

the factorsnot even a factor that is based on the ratio of short-interest to institutional ownership, as in
Drechsler and Drechsler (2016).

winners and losers underperform in the short runalbeit for dierent reasons. For the losers,


information takes a short amount of time to diuseon the order of a year. For the winners,


overcondence wanes slowly, implying eects that persists about ve years, which we will


assess in the following section.


         Also noteworthy are the loadings of the portfolios on the factors. Both losers and winners


covary with growth stocks, consistent with their market prices being relatively high. Fur-


thermore, they all have positive loadings on SMB, and constrained losers load negatively on


momentum, while constrained winners seem not to covary signicantly with other winners.

constrained past-winners and losers fall persistently over the whole sample period, conrming


that our eect is not driven by a particular subperiod. An initial investment of $1,000 into


the hedged past winners (losers) is worth $33.21 ($23.36) at the end of June 2018.




5.3         Long-term Performance


The model predicts strong negative returns for all constrained stocks in the rst year post


formation.       We calibrate our model in such a way that short-term momentum is caused


by slow information diusion while the value/reversal eect is a result of the long-lasting


resolution of overcondence. In the unconstrained case, this leads to standard momentum


(due to slow information diusion) in the short term and reversal or value eects (due to

sample regression of the portfolio excess returns on Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, and MOM. Then, using the full-

                                                                                            Mkt *(RMkt -

the hedged excess returns. The factor return data comes from Kenneth French's data library.

overcondence) in the longer term.           Short-sale constraints are predicted to have dierent


eects depending on the sign of the news: Following negative news (i.e.                    for past-losers),


the overcondent investor is pessimistic and short-sale constrained, and the newswatcher


sets prices. This leads to more extreme negative returns, compared to other losers, in the


rst year post formation, but no longer-term predictability. For positive news (identied by


looking at winners), the overcondent investor is optimistic and, since there are no constraints


on buying, sets prices. Since overcondence takes about ve years to resolve, we expect a


prolonged price decline for constrained winners.


                                       [INSERT Table 5 HERE]


    Figure 1 suggests that the predictable negative abnormal returns of the constrained win-


ners (W) persist longer than do the negative abnormal returns of the constrained loser stocks


(L(‚àà              Both W and L(‚àà
             34
   / W)).                      / W) underperform signicantly in the rst year. However, losers
never exhibit signicant underperformance thereafter. In contrast, winners have signicantly


negative alphas up to ve years and negative but mostly insignicant alphas even in years 6

        35
to 9.


    In order to assess the statistical signicance of the dierences in long-term abnormal


returns, we proceed as follows. We focus on years 2-5 post formation for two reasons. First,


the model predicts similar underperformance for both winners and losers in year 1. Second,


as the eect of overcondence fades out (see Panel B in Figure 2) roughly following an


exponential decay, the largest dierences can be expected in the rst four years that follow.


Consequently, we calculate buy-and-hold returns, as explained in Section 5.2, but instead of

  34 Specically, we calculate the buy-and-hold return, as explained in Section 5.2 for the rst holding-year,
for each following year, in the same fashion.   We then run a time-series regression of the monthly excess
returns of these 12-month buy-and-hold portfolios on the four Fama-French-Carhart factors. The annualized
alpha as well as the 95% condence interval, constructed based on Newey-West standard errors, are plotted

plot here. The reason is that averaging historical returns by holding month rst and then cumulating over
averages, does not represent the historical experience of any actual investor. Depending on distributional
characteristics of returns, visual inferences can be strongly biased. Furthermore, we advocate for the yearly
buy-and-hold approach as it gives us the opportunity to calculate reasonable standard errors. Each monthly
return observation corresponds to a perfectly tradable portfolio. A CAR plot can nevertheless be found in
Appendix B.IV Figure B.1.

       Table 5 presents the results. The number of stocks is quite large now, e.g., the portfolio


of stocks that were constrained winners between 2 and 5 years prior to formation includes,


on average, 322 unique stocks.           The upper panel presents raw excess returns and Sharpe


ratios of those portfolios. We see that the portfolio of stocks that were constrained losers


between 2 and 5 years before formation do not exhibit a signicantly negative alpha.                             In


columns (1) and (2) we split the loser portfolio into stocks that were (L(‚ààW)) and were not


(L(‚àà
   / W)) constrained winners in the 5 years before they became constrained losers. We can
see that only L(‚ààW) have a negative (albeit insignicant) alpha.                        The dierence between


the two is signicant at the 10% level. Winners signicantly underperform relative to the


Fama-French-Carhart model, with an alpha of -0.75 and a t-statistic of -5.82. The dierence


in abnormal returns of winners and losers is signicant, and the dierence between winners


and L(‚àà
                                                                                           37   38

       In Figure 3 Panel B, we can see that the long-term return patterns are consistent over


the whole sample period and the results are not driven by a particular sub-sample.




5.4       Fama-MacBeth Regressions


                                         [INSERT Table 6 HERE]

  36    Each month, the most recent (12-month old) constrained portfolio is added with $1 and then no
adjustment is made to the investment amount for the remaining 48 months of holding. The rst holding-
month is July 1998, i.e., the rst time when we were able to determine portfolio membership for 48 months


  37
in a row.
        Moreover, spanning tests, shown in Appendix B.IV Table B.3 show that constrained winners help
explain the long-run returns of constrained losers, whereas the opposite is not true.           The result holds for
raw returns as well as when the the three Fama and French (1993) factors and momentum are included.
This is consistent with the L(‚ààW) stocks driving the low long-run returns of the combined constrained loser

formation, yields a four-factor Information Ratio of -1.08 (see Appendix B.IV Table B.2). Such a portfolio
has 390 unique stocks in it. Moreover, using the simple value-weight approach, described in footnote 31, a
strategy using allocation between months    t ‚àí 60   and   t‚àí1   generates a four-factor Information Ratio of -1.03




                                                           32

We assess the robustness of that result by running Fama-MacBeth regressions.                           To see


whether returns of constrained winners are dierent than the other constrained stocks, turn


to the coecient on      having been a constrained winner during the past 5 years (except for the
most recent 12 months)       in Table 6 Panel B, labeled Constr.W. It is signicantly dierent


from zero, whereas, neither the coecient for having been a constrained loser (Constr.L)


nor the coecient for having been any type of constrained stock (Constr.) is (columns 2-3).


Hence, controlling for stocks being past (i.e. between months           t ‚àí 60   and   t ‚àí 13)   constrained


winners, constrained losers do not exhibit abnormally low long term returns, conrming the


results in Table 5.


       The result is robust to including well-known return predictors such as past return, the


log-book-to-market ratio, log-size and idiosyncratic volatility (column 4). Even if we include


the ratio of short interest to institutional ownership (SIRIO, as in Drechsler and Drechsler


(2016)), as a proxy for current diculty of short-selling, constrained past-winners underper-


form all other stocks signicantly (column 6) and other constrained stocks (although not

                                        40
statistically signicant, column 5).


       In contrast, Panel A shows that both constrained winners and losers of the previous 12


months underperform, and the seemingly stronger underperformance of losers (column 2)

                                                           41
disappears once the control variables are included.

  39 Observations are weighted by the previous month's market cap in cross-sectional weighted-least-squares
regressions, to alleviate the inuence of extremely small stocks on the results (see, e.g., Green, Hand, and


  40
Zhang, 2017).
       Note, however, that including the dummies for being a constrained stock in the past and being a
constrained winner/loser in the past in the same regression, imposes a multicollinearity problem (as every
constrained winner/loser is also constrained, and there are few constrained stocks, that were never a win-
ner/loser at any point during the 48-month look-back-period). Hence, test-power for individual coecients

5.5     Dynamics of Disagreement


Disagreement arises endogenously in the model, from the slow information incorporation of

                                                                                      42
one set of agents and the overcondence-based overreaction of the other.                   In this subsection,


we check the model's implication that an increase in disagreement in the past is quickly


followed by a substantial decrease of disagreement. We use earnings forecast dispersion data


as a proxy for any form of disagreement (and remain agnostic about which form it is), and

                                                                             43
examine, using this proxy, how disagreement evolves over time.                    To analyze the dynamics


of beliefs, we rst sort stocks into 10 portfolios based on the preceding year's change in

                                  44
earnings forecast dispersion.


                                       [INSERT Figure 4 HERE]


    Figure 4 plots earnings forecast dispersion from 1 year before until 5 years after portfolio


formation. The high change portfolio distinctly reverses to a similar level as before within

                                                                                            45
roughly 5 years, consistent with the resolution of disagreement hypothesis.                      The timing is


consistent with the return patterns we observe, where constrained winners lose signicantly


in value for roughly 5 years. The second highest change portfolio already exhibits a much


lower increase in disagreement, indicating that large changes are very rare. There seems to be


a small predictability in the other direction, as the low change portfolio slightly bounces up

  42 This highlights the close relationship between excessive optimism/pessimism and disagreement. A shock
to disagreement is often assumed to be an increase in the range of beliefs, i.e., an equal rise in pessimism
and optimism. Hence, such a symmetric shock aects the variance of the belief distribution but leaves the
mean of the distribution unchanged. An alternative assumption is that only one side of the distribution is
aected, e.g., optimists become even more optimistic, while pessimists do not change their beliefs. This also
implies increase in variance, but in this case it is accompanied by an increase in the mean of the distribution
as well. Such a one-sided disagreement modeling approach is thus consistent with limits-of-arbitrage models,


  43 While earnings forecast dispersion has been used in the literature to proxy for disagreement, it is only
featuring arbitrageurs and, typically, one type of biased agents (see, e.g., Shleifer and Vishny, 1997).


available for larger stocks where we typically do not observe binding short-sale constraints. For example, only
19% of the stock-month observations that we identify to have low institutional ownership (i.e., in the bottom
30%) have non-missing earnings forecast dispersion. Hence, to study returns, in the previous sections, we
resort to the proxy generated by our model, i.e., a high past return accompanied by high short interest.
By doing so, we assume that dynamics of earnings forecast dispersion apply to the dynamics of latent

disagreement of all stocks in general, including those where earnings forecast dispersion is not available.


  45 Johnson (2004) suggests to normalize the standard deviation of earnings forecasts by total assets per
share, but nds his results changing very little. Our conclusions are also unaectedresults are available

after portfolio formation. This increase is tiny in magnitude compared to the predictability


of the high change portfolio, though, and the level arrives nowhere near its previous high,


but rather in the neighborhood of all other stocks after 5 years.


                                  [INSERT Table 7 HERE]


   In Table 7 we predict future changes in earnings forecast dispersion over 1 year with


positive and negative earnings forecast dispersion changes over the past year, using the


Fama and MacBeth (1973) procedure. The results conrm that positive past changes strongly


predict negative future changes. In contrast, including negative past changes to the regression


barely increases the time-series average of the cross-sectional   R2 .   The coecient estimate


for positive past changes is larger by an order of magnitude than that of the negative past


changes.


   We conclude that the dynamics of beliefs approximately follow a two-state Markov pro-


cess. Most stocks in the US cross-section have low levels of disagreement and uctuate around


that level. Occasionally, we observe large unpredictable jumps in disagreement. These are


followed by resolution of disagreement, which is the only stylized fact we identify that is


predictable with ex-ante available information. Except for this, past disagreement in beliefs


does not help predict future disagreement. In particular, stocks where disagreement came


down in the past are not more likely to become high disagreement stocks in the future again


than other stocks.




5.6    Earnings Announcements


                                 [INSERT Figure 5 HERE]


One point in time when disagreement is likely to be resolved is when rms announce their


earnings (see, e.g., Berkman, Dimitrov, Jain, Koch, and Tice, 2009), which usually happens


once per quarter. Figure 5 displays average cumulative abnormal returns (ACAR) of con-


strained winners and losers around earnings announcements, for stocks selected to one of


the portfolios in the previous year (Panel A) or the 4 years preceding that year (Panel B).

Daily abnormal return is dened as the return adjusted for the four Fama-French-Carhart

           46
factors.        Constrained winners and losers fall considerably on the rst ve days following


the announcement for stocks selected in the preceding 12 months, and continue to underper-


form thereafter (Panel A). For stocks where the portfolios allocation dates back more than


a year, a much stronger reaction can be observed for winners than for losers. Moreover, the


pre-announcement rise is larger than the post-announcement drop for losers in Panel B.




5.7     Equity Issuance


Financial economists have now accumulated substantial empirical evidence consistent with


the view that manager's try to time the market in their capital structure choices (see Baker


and Wurgler, 2002, and the references therein). CFO's themselves state that they are re-


luctant to issue equity if they perceive their market valuation to be below the fundamental


value (Graham and Harvey, 2001).              Following this logic, managers who view their equity


to be overvalued should issue equity to let current shareholders benet from high market


valuations. Although, perceived overvaluation is much less common than perceived under-


valuation among corporate managers (Graham and Harvey, 2001, p. 219), we hypothesize


that at least some managers of rms in the constrained winner portfolio think their equity


is overvalued.


   To test this idea, we look at the composite equity issuance measure of Daniel and Titman


(2006). They dene this quantity as the part of the change in a rm's market capitalization


that cannot be explained by a rm's stock return (see also Ponti and Woodgate, 2008).


We build the composite equity issuance measure for each rm over a six-month time period,


starting three months before portfolio formation (at the end of month t) and ranging to


three months after portfolio formation. The individual measure is dened as


                                                          

where t is the month of portfolio formation. The composite equity issuance measure of a


portfolio is calculated as the value-weighted average of individual composite equity issuance


measures. We build   Œπt‚àí2,t+3   for all 27 portfolios. The quantity measures the net eect of all


issuance activity like equity issues, employee stock option plans, share repurchases or cash


dividends around the time of portfolio formation, i.e., around the time where constrained


winners are supposed to be overpriced due to a positive shock to disagreement.



                                     INSERT Table 8 HERE



    Table 8 presents the results. Consistent with previous literature, winner stocks tend to


issue equity on average. The issuance in Table 8 is highest in the bottom-right-corner for


all momentum buckets, and constrained winners and losers issue about twice as much as


constrained medium-momentum stocks. For example, 7.48 percentage points of the increase


in market capitalization of constrained winners cannot be attributed to their stock returns.


Similarly, constrained losers issue substantially more than other loser stocks. Constrained


stocks as a group are therefore much higher net issuers of equity than the groups of rms


in any other portfolio, consistent with the idea that managers of these constrained stocks


consider their equity to be overvalued and that they are trying to use this window of oppor-


tunity in favor of their shareholders. Given that most managers appear to be overoptimistic


regarding their own rm's prospects (Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey, 2013), we consider


the dierences in the composite equity issuance measure to be substantial.




6     Conclusion
If optimists set prices for short-sale constrained rms, their stocks can become   overpriced   and


such bubbles predictably collapse going forward (Miller, 1977). We show that constrained


winners underperform for about ve years, while constrained losers only lose for about a year.


The nding for winners strongly contrasts with the empirical regularity of price momentum;


that high past return rms continue to experience high future returns. We argue that the


                                                37
reason the momentum eect remains strong among winners in aggregate is because relatively


few rms are short-sale-constrained (consistent with the empirical evidence on the lending


market presented by D'Avolio, 2002). In line with this argument, our empirical procedure


identies 51 stocks per month as constrained winners, on average.       However, since the


phenomenon is so long-lasting, we can construct a portfolio of all stocks that have been a


constrained winner at some point within the last ve years. Such a portfolio contains 390


unique stocks, on average, over the sample period. If we trade those overpriced winners in a


value-weighted portfolio, such a well-diversied strategy generates an information ratio with


respect to the four Fama-French-Carhart factors of -1.03. This drastic underperformance of


such a large number of stocks, which is present during our whole sample period, also speaks


to the ongoing discussion about the presence of bubbles in nancial markets.


   Our empirical evidence cannot be explained by behavioral models originally designed


to capture momentum and value for unconstrained stocks. Neither the Daniel, Hirshleifer,


and Subrahmanyam (1998) nor the Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) models are able to


capture the empirically observed asymmetry between constrained winners and constrained


losers  a heterogeneous agent model is necessary. Also, the Hong and Stein (1999) model


with momentum traders cannot explain the results, as this would imply the existence of


winner momentum for constrained stocks, which is not present. However, by combining some


of the key ingredients of these papers in one parsimonious heterogeneous agents model, we


are able to explain the observed asymmetric behavior of both constrained and unconstrained


stocks, for positive and negative news shocks, respectively. For future research, our analysis


suggests that short-sale constraints can be used as a unique testing ground for heterogeneous


agent models, as their predictions for constrained and unconstrained assets will typically


dier, when some agents are sidelined from the market.

of highest (lowest) past-return rms with low institutional ownership and high short interest.
For the constrained losers, we additionally impose the condition that they have not been in
the constrained winner portfolio within the past ve years, to isolate the long-run eects of

Figure 3: Performance of hedged constrained portfolios over calendar-time.
This gure presents the investment value for a set of hedged portfolios.                                                 To calculate
the portfolio value, we assume an investment at the beginning of the sample of $1,000.
We also assume that the exposures to Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, and MOM are hedged.                                                       We
calculate the hedging coecients by running a full-sample regression of the portfolio ex-
cess returns on Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, and MOM. Then, using the full-sample regression
coecients, we subtract the returns of the (zero-investment) hedge-portfolio [bMkt (RMkt -
Rf,t )+bSMB SMBt +bHML HMLt +bMOM MOMt ] from the portfolio returns to generate the
hedged portfolio returns.                          Panel A plots the evolution of the $1,000 invested in calendar-
time 12-month buy-and-hold constrained winners and losers (that were not winners in the
past 5 years). Panel B contains calendar-time 48-month buy-and-hold portfolios that skip
the rst 12 months.

the day (D=0) of an earnings announcement that occurs in the quarter after portfolio for-
mation (months t to t+2).                    We include all stocks that were in the respective portfolio in
months t-12 through t-1 (Panel A) and t-60 to t-13 (Panel B) and calculate their buy-and-
hold weight from formation to each day plotted by using the price change adjusted by the
cumulative price adjustment factor (CFACPR in CRSP). Abnormal returns are calculated by
adjusting for the four Fama-French-Carhart factors. For each stock, loadings are estimated
in a 1-year window of daily returns prior to the month in which the earnings announcement
occurs.   To construct the gure, daily abnormal returns are rst centered around the day
of announcement (D=0). They are then cumulated by stock (cumulative abnormal return,
CAR) and averaged (ACAR, weighted by the buy-and-hold weight) by portfolio and day
relative to announcement. See Appendix B.III for details.

Table 1: Timing of surprises.
Sub-surprises are aggregated into surprises for overcondent agents and newswatchers. The
table shows an example with               T =5     and      n = 3.         Overcondent agents see all information
immediately, while information diuses slowly to newswatchers.

Table 2: Characteristics of constrained portfolios.
This table shows time-series averages of value-weighted mean characteristics of the con-
strained portfolios in the month of portfolio formation. Shown are the average number of
stocks, the average market equity (in billion US dollars), return from month t-12 to the end
of month t-2 (in %), level of short interest two weeks prior to formation (in %) and change
from 11.5 months ago to 2 weeks ago (in PP), institutional ownership (in percent of number
of shares outstanding) and its change over the preceding year (in PP), the ratio of book
equity of the most-recently observed scal year to last month's market equity (in %), the av-
erage standard deviation of daily idiosyncratic returns in each portfolio (daily, in %) over the
month prior to formation (Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang, 2006), levels (in %) and changes
(in PP) over the preceding 12 months in turnover, the ratio of short interest to institutional
ownership (SIRIO) as in Drechsler and Drechsler (2016) (in %), the open-interest weighted
average of dierences in implied volatilities between matched put and call option pairs at
month-end (in %), as in Cremers and Weinbaum (2010), the level (in %) and change (in PP)
(over the preceding 12 months) in the Markit indicative as well as simple average loan fee.
The sample period is 1988/07 to 2018/06. For a comparison with the broader universe of
stocks, averages for the remaining portfolios are displayed in Table B.4 in Appendix B.IV.

Table 3: Monthly excess returns of winner and loser portfolios.
This table contains monthly average excess returns of the 9 winner (Panel A), 9 medium
momentum (Panel B) and 9 loser (Panel C) portfolios from an independent triple sort on the
past 11-month return lagged by one month, institutional ownership (IOR) and short interest
(SIR). The last two columns present the dierence of low and high institutional ownership
portfolio returns and the alpha of that portfolio from a Fama-French-Carhart four-factor
regression.   Similarly, the bottom two rows show the return-dierence between high and
low SIR portfolios and the respective four-factor alpha.     The sample period is 1988/07 to
2018/06. Newey and West (1987)    t-statistics   are shown in parentheses.

Table 4: Calendar-time portfolio returns of stocks that were constrained within
months t ‚àí 12 to t ‚àí 1 prior to formation).
This table shows average excess returns (Panel A), as well as results from Fama-French-
Carhart four-factor regressions (Panel B) for constrained calendar-time 12-month buy-and-
hold portfolios. The stocks in the portfolios were in the lowest group of institutional own-
ership and the high group of short interest at some point during months       {t ‚àí 12, ..., t ‚àí 1}
before formation. To calculate the calendar-time buy-and-hold portfolio return, each month,
the most recent portfolio is added with $1 and then no adjustment is made to the investment
amount for the remaining 12 months of holding. The columns L (W) are the intersection
of this constrained portfolio with the lowest (highest) 11-month return lagged by 1 month;
M is the portfolio in between. L(‚ààW) / L(‚àà
                                         / W) contain constrained losers that had / had
not been constrained winners over the past 5 years prior to allocation. Columns containing
a minus sign go long the rst and short the second portfolio.       Newey and West (1987)       t-
statistics are shown in parentheses. The rst return is calculated in July 1994, i.e., the rst
time when we invested 12 times in a row and we had the chance to see if a constrained loser
had been a constrained winner over the previous 5 years. AvgN is the average number of
unique stocks in the portfolio. The row labeled SR displays the Sharpe Ratios and IR the
Information Ratios. The sample period is 1988/07 to 2018/06.

Table 6: Fama-MacBeth regressions for stocks that were constrained in the past.
This table shows results of Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions of excess returns on a num-
ber of predictors. The variable Constr. (Constr.W, Constr.L) is a dummy variable indicating
that the stock has been a constrained stock (winner, loser) anytime during the indicated
months.        RET(t‚àí12)‚àí‚àí‚àí(t‚àí2)   is the one-month lagged past 11-month-return .                     log(BE/M E) is
the logarithm of the previous month's book-to-market ratio,                      log(M E) is the logarithm of the
previous month's market equity and                ivol   is the volatility of daily residuals from a Fama and
French (1993) three-factor regression of daily excess returns within the past month.                             SIRIO
is the ratio of short interest to institutional ownership. Newey and West (1987)                             t-statistics
are shown in parentheses. The sample period is 1988/07 to 2018/06.

forecast dispersion.
The change in earnings forecast dispersion over one calendar year is regressed on positive
(Column 1) and both positive and negative changes (column 2) in earnings forecast dispersion
over the previous calendar year in the cross-section of stocks. We value-weight observations
in the cross-sectional regressions by their market capitalization.   Following the Fama and
MacBeth (1973) procedure, the time-series average of the regression coecients is presented.
Standard errors are calculated following Newey and West (1987). The time-series average of

This table shows time-series averages of the value-weighted composite equity issuance mea-
sure of the 9 winner (Panel A), 9 medium-momentum (Panel B) and 9 loser (Panel C)
portfolios.    The composite equity issuance measure of a rm is the part of the change in
a rm's market capitalization that cannot be explained by a rm's stock return, following
Daniel and Titman (2006). It is calculated over a six-month horizon, starting three months
prior to portfolio formation and ranging to three months after portfolio formation.   The
sample period is 1988/07 to 2018/06.
