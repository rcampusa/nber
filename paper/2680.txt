                    PRECAUTIONARY SAVING AND THE TIMING OF TAXES


                                               ABSTRACT




     This   paper   analyzes   the   effects      of governeent debt and income taxes on

consumption and saving in a world of infinitely—lived households having

uncertain and heterogeneous incomes.               The special structure of the model

allows exact aggregation across households despite incomplete mmrkets.                  The

effects of government debt are shown to be substantial, roughly comparable

to those resulting from finite horizons, and crucially dependent on the length

of time until the debt is repaid.               Also, anticipated changes in taxes are

shown to cause anticipated changes in consumption.                 Finally, an index of

fiscal stance is derived.

I.   Introduction

     Economists are increasingly aware of the importance of heterogeneity

among individuals for issues in macroeconomics.   One such issue is the

interaction between individual income uncertainty and tax policy.     Since an

individual's personal tax liability is typically contingent on his income, and

since future income is uncertain, future taxes provide a form of insurance.

This insurance effect of income taxes has normative implications regarding the

desirability of the taxes (Varian, 1980) and positive implications regarding

their impact on consumption and saving (Chan,   1983; Barsky, Mankiw, Zeldes,

1986).

     The purpose of this paper is to study the response of consumption to the

timing of labor income taxes.   We assume that individuals are infinitely

lived, so that the taxes do not redistribute across generations.     We also

assume that labor supply is inelastic, so that the taxes are not

distortionary.   The failure of Ricardian equivalence in our model is fully

attributable to the insurance effect of the income tax system.     This failure

of Ricardian equivalence, which was discussed by Barro (1974, p. 1115) and

Tobin (1980, p. 59—60), was first analyzed explicitly by Chan using a

two—period model.   Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes argued that this insurance

effect is likely to be quantitatively   important; they examined multi-period

examples but only through the use of computer simulations and under the

assumption that income is independently distributed in each period.     Here we

allow individual income to follow a Markov process.    Under the assumption that

the utility function is exponential, we are able to examine analytically the

response of consumption over time to various policy interventions.
                                       —2—


       After describing the model and its solution in Section II, we examine in

Section III the impact of changes in the timing of income taxes.      All the

policy interventions satisfy an intertemporal government budget constraint.

If contingent claims markets were complete or if utility were quadratic, one

would obtain the Ricardian result that these interventions have no impact on

consumption.   We assume, however, that individuals face idiosyncratic inccme

risk and that, since tax liabilities are contingent on individual income,

changes in the timing of these liabilities change perceived risk.     This change

in risk interacts with the precautionary motive for saving (Leland, 1968;

Sandmo, 1970; Dreze and Modigliani, 1972).    Am in Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes,

the implied behavior appears in some ways more Keynesian than Ricardian.

       First, we examine a current tax cut, coupled with a tax increase in the

future to repay the additional debt and accumulated interest.     We show that

the horizon over which the debt is repaid is crucial to the effect of the tax

cut.   Tax reschedulings over short periods of time have little impact on

consumption, while tax reschedulings over long periods of time have

substantial impact.

       Second, we consider the empirically plausible case in which a tax cut is

coupled with a permanently higher level of debt.     In this case, all future tax

rates are raised just enough to service the debt.     We obtain partially

Ricardian results.    A one dollar tax cut increases consumption, but by less

than does a one dollar increment to wealth.     For reasonable parameter values,

the marginal propensity to consume out of such a tax cut is about half the

marginal propensity to consume out of wealth.

       Third, we examine the impact of an announced future tax cut.   We show

that this announcement causes an immediate increase in the level of
                                             —3—



consumption, followed by further increases in consumption as the tax cut

approaches.   Hence, while news about future taxes has an immediate impact on

consumption, anticipated changes in taxes are also associated with anticipated

changes in consumption.

      Fourth, we derive an index of fiscal stance analogous to that suggested

by Blanchard (1985).      The index implies that fiscal policy has similar effects

on aggregate demand in precautionary-saving models and finite—horizon models,

even though the mechanisms are very different.

      We share with much recent work the strategy of examining the implications

of capital market imperfections without deriving the imperfections from the

economic environment.      (See,   for example, Scheinkman and Weiss (1986)              and

Hubbard and Judd (1986).)      A crucial assuaption of our model is that individual

human capital risk cannot be diversified.              It would of course be better to

derive this feature from the more primitive informational considerations of

moral hazard and adverse selection.          We hope that our model can provide a

prelude to a more complete analysis of the interactions between precautionary

saving and the timing of taxes.



II.   The Model2

      Consider an infinitely lived consumer who has additively time—separable

von Neumann—Morgenstern utility f e5u(c+ )ds.     The consumer is assumed to
                                0
face a constant real interest rate, r, and stochastic income following a

continuous-time Markov process.3           Let A =    [A..]   be the Markov transition

matrix among the   J   states with
                                     A     for   i   t j representing the instantaneous

probability of moving from state       i   to state     j   and
                                                                  A   =   -   A..   representing

the instantaneous probability of leaving state i.4                The optimization problem

for the consumption and saving decision can then be written as follows:

        We examine the special case in which the consumer has constant absolute

risk aversion, that is,



(2.3)                =
              u(c)

Given this assumption, (2.2) can be solved explicitly.6                        In particular, there

is a solution of the form



(2.4)                    =    _                                                            i=1            3.

This can be demonstrated as follows.                    First, the maximization on the right—

hand side of (2.2)           implies the first order condition

                         =
(2.5)         u'(c)          V(w1it)                                                             i=1    3,



where        is the optimal rate of consumption if in state                     i   at time t.     In
        c7
words, the marginal utility of a dollar's worth of consumption must be set

equal to the marginal value of a dollar in the overall program.                            Given the

utility function assumed and the value function we are trying out, (2.5)

implies

                    i                    i



(2.6)         e
                  -7cr
                         =e _Y(rw+a)                                                             i=1    3,


which means that


(2.7)         c = rw+a7                                                                          i=1


Thus a       is the intercept of the "consumption function"                     in state i at time t,


and r is the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth.

        Gn substituting (2.3), (2.4) and                 (2.7)   into (2.2), and dividing by



     e_Y(rw+a) we obtain

                                                    y(a'_sJ)                .

In (2.8), the consumer's wealth
                                               w has dropped         out, leaving a set of ordinary

differential equations in the vector of consumption intercepts.                            The solution

to (2.8) therefore indicates a solution to Bellman equation (2.2) of the

proposed form (2.4).

        It can be shown that given a fixed vector y of incomes in each state,

(2.8)    has a unique steady—state vector of consumption intercepts a.7                      Given a

steady-state solution for the vector of consumption intercepts a, we can

readily find the effects on consumption of marginal changes in the income

available in various states at various times.                         Oenoting marginal departures

from stemdy—state values by a tilde (-), and the steady—state values

themselves by the omission of the time subscript, we can "totally

differentiate" (2.8) to obtain

        To find the impact of income changes on aggregate consumption, we must

know the distribution of consumers across income states.                                     Assuming that there

are many consumers in the economy facing independent Markov transitions but

with the same transition matrix, and that Markov transitions have been taking

place for     a    long time,         the distribution of consumers across states will be

A Special Case

        To gain a better understanding of how the precautionary saving aotive

affects consumption, it is helpful to examine the precautionary saving effect

   in the special case in which there are only two states —- a high income

state (state 1) and a low income state (state 2) -— and the transition matrix

A is symmetric; that is,


(2.16)      A =
                   {:
where p is the instantaneous probability of a transition from one state to the

other.    With A as in        (2.16),    'V    is given by


                 = [—px         px

(2.18)      x =                      =


The quantity x is the ratio of marginal utilities between the high income and

low income states (for a given value of non—human wealth) in the initial

steady state.          Its value can be determined from the following equation, which

is derived by subtracting the steady—state version of (2.8) with i=1 from the

steady—state version of (2.8) with i=2, and then using the definition                 (2.18):


(2.19)       ln(x) +     (x — )      =   y(y1    —
                                                     y2).

Equation (2.19) is simple enough that it can readily be solved for x with the

help of a pocket calculator.                  Given x, all other calculations we make can be

done explicitly.

        To find saving per capita                          in the steady state, we can add together the

steady-state versions of (2.8)                            for i=1,2,     obtaining

                                                                              at+a2

It    is clear that the part of saving due                           to the interaction of individual

income uncertainty with the precautionary saving motive is                                        +   - 2),

since this term is zero when there is no income uncertainty (p=0 or x=1),

while the other term                         is unaffected by income uncertainty.            We use this

expression below to calculate the magnitude of precautionary saving.

Summary

        Individuals face idiosyncratic risk, but there is no aggregate

uncertainty.         In our special case, half of all                                individuals at time t are in

the good state earning income
                                                 y and half are                  in the bad state earning income

III. The Timing of Taxes

          We can now analyze the effects of a tax rescheduling.             Some assumption

must be made about the type of tax used.               Any component of a tax that falls

equally on both high income and low income consumers has no precautionary

saving effect, because it does not affect              y    -
                                                                y÷.    Thus, Ricardian

equivalence holds for lump-sum taxes.

          We examine here the polar opposite case in which taxes are levied only on

high income individuals.         Since at any time half of the population is composed

of high—income individuals, a $1 per capita tax increase overall requires a $2

per capita tax increase on "the rich'.            Therefore, if             is the overall per
                                                                      t+s
capita tax increase in period           ts   and taxes fall entirely on the high-income

individuals, then
                                                        —12-



(3.1)                 -              =



Substituting      this expression              into (2.30), we find that



(3.2)             = 9 f   e5(1           -
                                               e5)?ds.
The parameters 9 and             a   have an important influence on the effects of various

tax changes, as will become clear below.

        Equation (3.2) shows the precautionary saving effect of tax changes.                   A

balanced budget tax rescheduling has no iamediate impact on the sum Wt+Ht of

aggregate human and financial wealth.                     Thus the sole initial impact of a

balanced budget tax change is the precautionary saving effect
                                                                                r.
        If the tax change is first announced at time 0, then


(3.3)             =
                      r[     +           +




                  =r-ferN-C              t—T
                                               dt+—t

                  =                            +
                      r[—r           t_dT

At   time zero, when the tax change is newly announced, this simplifies to



(3.4)             =       = rO f         e5(l      -
                                                       e8)T5ds.


The immediate precautionary saving effect on consumption,                         is the

interesting effect.              The other term in (3.3) involving lagged consumption

changes
           --   or,   equivalently, lagged precautionary saving changes
                                                                        -—             is   just

what is necessary to insure that consumers do not violate their budget

constraints:     if they consume SI more in one year, they must consume Sr less

every year from then on to make up for it.            The key insight is that the

insurance effects of an income tax can induce consumers to consume more now

without any immediate change in their aggregate resources                +
                                                                             H.

Policy Experiment       1


        There are several interesting special cases.         The simplest is a tax

cut repaid k                later.   If such a tax cut begins in period 0,    then


(3.5)           = e(1       —




where      is the size       of the initial tax cut and the initial addition to the

national debt as a result of that tax cut.            Equation (3.5) indicates that an

income tax cut followed by a compensating income tax increase the next year

has very little effect on consumption, but a tax cut followed by a tax

increase many years later has a much larger effect.            In other words, the

interval between tax cut and tax increase is crucial to the impact of the tax

cut.     Individuals face little uncertainty about their income next year and

there is correspondingly little insurance effect of higher income taxes next

year.     But individuals face much more uncertainty about their income ten or

twenty years from now and, as a result, higher income taxes ten or twenty

years in the future have a substantial insurance effect.

        The theory presented here is one way to rationalize the intuitive notion

that tax rescheduling within a year or any other short period of time should

not have much effect, but that tax rescheduling over longer periods of time

should have    substantial effects        on consumption.   A common   debating point   for
                                        —14—


Ricardians has been that if tax rescheduling within a year does not matter,

then tax rescheduling over the course of 20 years also should not matter.        We

have identified here a clear distinction between tax rescheduling over short

periods of time and tax rescheduling over long periods of time, even for

infinitely—lived consumers.


Some Illustrative Calculations

       To judge the magnitude of the precautionary saving effects,    it is


necessary to calibrate the model      There are two key parameters:     y(y1-y2) and

p/r.    From these two magnitudes, the other parameters of interest, such as     9


and ô/r, can be computed.10

       The first parameter, y(y1-y2), incorporates both the degree of risk

aversion y and the cross-sectional dispersion in income (y1 -    y2).     Note that

y(y1-y2) can be written as 7y2Ny1/y2)—1] and that    y2   is the coefficient of

relative risk aversion evaluated at the level of income in the bad state.        If

we make the conservative assumption that income    in the good state is twice

income in the bad state, so that the cross-sectional coefficient of variation

in income is only 1/3, then y(y1-y2) can be interpreted simply as the

coefficient of relative risk aversion.     We therefore allow this parameter to

range over the region from 0.5 to 10.

       The second parameter is p/r.   Note that the transition probability p has

the same units as the interest rate r; hence, p/r is a pure number.        We allow

p/r to vary from 0.10 to 5.0.    If r is 2 percent per year, then p is varying

from 0.2 percent per year to 10 percent per year.     To judge the magnitude of

p, note that over a 25-year horizon, the probability that an individual leaves
                                                  —1.5—




the state in which he begins is 12 percent if p is 0.5 percent and is 64

percent if p is 4.0 percent.

         Tsbles 1, 2, and    3   present the values of 9, air, and x for these

parameter values.      Assuuing for the moment that the debt and accumulated

interest associated with          a   tax cut are pushed far enough into the future that

e6       can be ignored, equation (3.5)          shows that the marginal propensity to

consume out of a tax cut is 9 times the marginal propensity to consume out of

wealth.      Table 1 shows that the value of 9 is usually in excess of             and is

often close to one.         These numbers, together with equation (3.5),        imply that

the precautionary saving effect can be quite potent.

         The numbers for air in table        2   can be used to see how quickly e61<

declines with k.      For an interest rate r of 2 percent par year, a value for a

of   4   percent per year is likely.        For k = 25,   eOk   is 0.37.   Hence, for a tax

liability pushed 25 years into the future, the marginal propensity to consume

out of the tax cut is 0.63 9 times the marginal propensity to consume out of

wealth.

         Table 3 presents x, the ratio of marginal utility in the bad state and

good state given equal non-human wealth in both states.               These numbers imply

that marginal utility in the bad state is about two to five times marginal

utility in the good state.            This ratio is, of course, larger if the

cross-sectional dispersion in income is larger, if individuals are more risk

averse, or if the transition probability is smaller relative to the interest

rate.

                 2y(y     y )r
It is clear that the amount of precautionary saving can be substantial.   It

should be remembered, though, that in general equilibrium the precautionary
                                              —16-


saving    motive might show up as much in a lower interest rate r as in increased

saving. 11


Policy Experiment        2


        Another interesting experiment is ! permanent increase in government

debt, with the interest on the extra debt financed pj higher taxes.           For this

experiment, (3.2) implies that


(3.6)        o           =


In   words, consumers act as if a permanent addition to government debt is at

least partially net wealth, where the fraction that is treated as net wealth

is   ——6.
     r+S
             Table   5   shows this fraction for alternative values of the

parameters.      It is clear from Table 5 that substantial departures from

Ricardian equivalence are likely.           Yet government debt is still far from being

treated as 100% net wealth,           Whether this model gives results closer to full

Ricardian neutrality or naive neglect of future tax liabilities depends on the

parameters, but the best guess is probably halfway in between.12

       The numbers in Table 5 are similar in magnitude to figures derived from a

life-cycle model of consumption.          Poterba and Summers (1987) simulate a

realistic model of life-cycle saving; they compute the fraction of government

debt that is net wealth assuming that taxes are levied to service the debt.

Their Table 1 reports that, depending on the parameters, this fraction varies

from 0.53 to 0.85.           Hence, the precautionary saving effect highlighted here

can potentially provide as great a deviation from the Ricardian benchmark as

Policy Experiment         3


        A final experiment of interest is a tax rescheduling announce. several

periods in advance.            Let k be the time at which the tax change is to begin but

let that change be announced at the beginning of period 0.                       Equation (3.2)

implies that for 0             t    k,

where the key        simplification in            the first line results from the fact that

the tax change is a balanced budget tax change.                        Then using (3.3), we can

find the overall effect on consumption:

tax policy we have identified a factor that can affect expected variances of

individual income and therefore expected changes in consumption in a

systematic way.


An Index of Fiscal Stance

        Blanchard (1985) has recently suggested an index of fiscal stance to

summarize the impact of fiscal policy on aggregate demand                        His model is

non—Ricardian because agents have finite horizons:                   they die at rate q and are

replaced with newly born individuals.             Blanchard's index of fiscal stance is


(3.9)
             g   =
                     (+P)[O
                                  -   7   e)s   T+5ds          +



where       is the debt,    is government purchases,               and        is taxes.    This index
                         Gt                                              Tt
includes the direct effect of governeent purchases and the indirect effects of

government debt and taxes on consumption.

        The model of precautionary saving presented here suggests an
                                                                     analogous
index of fiscal stance.           Equations (2.27), (2.28), and (3.2)             indicate that the

appropriate index is


(3.10)       g   =
                     r[D
                            -
                                (1-9) 7   -rs Tds      -   e   7              1+5ds]
                                                                                       +




This    index includes the effect of debt through non—human wealth     the effect
                                                                   W5,
of taxes through human wealth     and the effect of taxes through the
                              Ht.

precautionary saving term

        In the limiting case in which 0 =         1,   the two indices of fiscal stance are

almost identical.          The marginal propensity to consume is q + p in Blanchards

index, while it is r in ours.             More important, the discount rate for future
                                                            -19-


taxes is r       +   q in Blanchard's         index,        while    it     is       r + 5 in ours.         In both

cases,       the discounting       of   tax   liabilities           at     a rate       higher   than   r       is the


reason for the failure of Ricardian equivalence.13

         Remember that the index in (3.10) is derived under the assumption that

taxes fall only on the high—income individuals.                                  More generally, suppose a

fraction f of taxes falls on the poor and (1-f) falls on the rich.                                               Such a tax

can be decomposed as 2f lump—sum and (1-2f)                               falling only on the rich.

Therefore, the more general index is



                                                  erslt+sds 6'
                               —   (1—6)                   —                                                +
(3.11)          g       r[Dt                  f                                  f    e'''Tt+5ds]               G.

where 6' =       9(1-2f).      A fraction 6' of future taxes is discounted at rate

r   +   5,   while the remainder         i    discounted at rate r.                      The index thus readily

handles any degree of progressivity.



IV.      Conclusion

        This paper has analyzed rigorously the role of the timing of taxes in a

world in which taxes are contingent on individual income and individual income

is Subject       to non—diversifiable idiosyncratic risk.                                Casual empiricism, as

well as the more formal empirical work discussed by Barsky, Mankiw, and

Zeldes, suggests that the sort of heterogeneity examined here is substantial

Such heterogeneity among individuals has potentially important aggregate

effects.        Under reasonable auxiliary assumptions, these aggregate effects can

be explicitly derived.

         Previous authors analyzing the interaction between taxes and

precautionary saving have typically relied on two-period examples.                                               Our goal
                                     —20—


has been to extend the analysis to a more general and more realistic setting.

The infinite horizon model presented here is much richer in its implications,

is more easily compared with standard dynamic models, and should prove a   more

useful guide for empirical work.

1.      This insurance effect of the taxes also affects many other decisions,

such as the accumulation of human capital (Eaton and Rosen, 1980).

2.      Some readers may wish to skip to the summary at the end of this section.

3.      The assumption of a constant real interest rate is maintained throughout

this paper.           The model can be viewed as "partial equilibrium;" alternatively,

one can posit a small open economy or a linear storage technology.

5.   See Ksmien and Schwartz (1981(, pp. 238-242. They call it "the

fundamental partial differential equation" of dynamic programming.

8.      One could guess that this would be so from the example of optimal

consumption with random income on p. 398 of Merton (1971).

7.      Using the notstion defined below, since           '1   has row sums that add to zero,

it is a continuous-time Markov matrix and has all nonpositive eigenvalues.

Thus,   'Y
             -   rI   has strictly negative eigenvalues, which proves by the implicit

function theorem that (2.8) has a unique steady-state solution for the vector

a given the vector y, since with a set to zero, totally differentiating                 the

steady state version of (2.8) yields rj =               (rI    -   t).
8.      If   h   were not equal to zero, then as          became large, the linearization

around the steady-state would become inappropriate, but these nonlinesrities

would not prevent the violation of the budget constraint.

9.      The marginal propensity to consume out of wealth, r, is the same as under

certainty equivalence when r=p.           The "excess sensitivity" discussed by Barsky,

Mankiw, and Zeldes arises with constant relative risk aversion but not with
                                          —22—


constant absolute risk aversion.      The effect of uncertainty on the marginal

propensity to consume is discussed in Kimball (1988).       If uncertainti raises

the marginal propensity to consume, any departure from Ricardian equivalence

is magnified.


10.   The interest rate   r   can be viewed as fixing the time unit; all other

rates are given relative to the interest rate.

11.   In (2.21), a reduction in r may not at first reduce saving, since a lower

interest rate can increase the precautionary component of saving (see Table

4), but if r falls low enough, saving will begin to decline.

12.   It should be remembered that these numbers are based on the assumption

that all taxes fall on the high—labor—income half of the population.       Less

progressive taxation would lead to smaller effects, as discussed below.

13.   The parameter 5 should not be interpreted as simply a risk premium.        The

higher discount rate arises from a precautionary saving effect (a pos,tive

third derivative) rather than from risk aversion (a negative second

derivative).    For instance, in the case of quadratic utility, certainty

equivalence obtains:      the precautionary saving effects are absent, despite the

presence of risk aversion.
