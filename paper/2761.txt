                  DIFFERENCES IN INCOME ELASTICITIES AND TRENDS
                              IN REAL EXCHANCE RATES


                                     ABSTRACT


     One might expect that differences in income elasticities     in trade and/or

differences    in growth rates among countries would give rise to strong secular

trends in real exchange rates; for example, fast-growing countries might need

steady depreciation to get the world to accept their growing exports.     In

fact, however, income elasticities are systematically    related to growth rates

by the "45-degree rule", under which fast-growing countries appear to face

high income elasticities of demand for their exports, while having low income
elasticities of import demand.     The net effect of this relationship between

elasticities and growth rates is that secular trends in real exchsngerstes

are much smaller than one might otherwise have expected:     relative PPP holds

fairly well.    This paper documents the existence of a "45-degree rule", and

suggests an explanation    in terms of increasing returns and product differ-

entiation.

        What    determines equilibrium real             exchange rates?          In    the


practical attempt to determine equilibrium                     rates,     international

economists generally exhibit          a       kind of    schizophrenia.         When we

analyze short and medium run balance of payments developments,                          we


use   an    income-and-price    elasticity framework that presumes that

the exports       of different countries        are imperfect substitutes              for


one     another    --   and indeed    empirical         implementation         of     this


framework suggests fairly          low price      elasticities,           implying    that


goods    produced by different countries are not close substitutes.

However,       such a framework seems to          imply       that    there   should be

substantial       changes in equilibrium real rates                   over    time,    due

either to differences          in income      elasticities       or     differences     in


growth rates. This is an implication that somehow we are unwilling

to accept: when we do long run analysis                 we all seem to reveal a


deep-seated belief in some form of purchasing power parity.

        The purpose of this paper is twofold. First,                  I   want to point

out   an empirical regularity;        second,      I    want to argue that this

empirical regularity lends           support       to     a    particular view          of

international      trade that reconciles the seemingly contradictory

views      of many international    economists about the short and long

runs.

Fast-growing countries seem to face a high income                                  elasticity of

demand for their exports, while having a low income elasticity of

demand       for    imports.        The   converse is             true      for      slow-growing

countries.         The result of this difference in income                           elasticities


is, it turns out, just about sufficient to make trend changes in

real                       rates                              That         is,      although       an
         exchange                     unnecessary.


income-and-price-elasticity framework                        in     principle should give

rise to substantial          shifts in equilibrium real exchange rates over

time,    in practice the             income     elasticities         turn out to be just


right    to make this unnecessary.                   I will       refer to this empirical

regularity as the "45-degree rule".

        The    theoretical          point      that       follows     from         this   is     more


                     I argue that the results on income elasticities                              are
questionable.

unlikely       to     be     a      coincidence.           Instead,         estimated          income


elasticities        probably reflect a confounding of income effects with

                               -   - a point     that many authors have made.                     The
supply-side effects

new point here is that in order to explain the 45-degree rule with

its implication        that there are not                 strong trends in real exchange

rates,       it    is        necessary to        suppose         that     there     is    not     much

comparative        advantage among industrial countries,                          and that their

specialization at                   any    point     in    time     is     largely        arbitrary

specialization due to increasing returns rather than comparative

advantage trade.

       The    paper is in four parts.                     The first part considers                 the


conventional income-and-price-elasticityanalysis,                                 and shows that

this     analysis             will        normally       imply     substantial           shifts     in


equilibrium real exchange rates over time. The second part reviews

some historical estimates of income elasticities                              in world trade,


and shows that these show a characteristic                              pattern of correlation

with rates of growth,                     such that countries            in general need much

less real         exchange rate movement over time than one would have

                               --    the 45-degree        rule. The third part offers an
expected a priori

explanation        of        this    result that draws on the modern theory of

trade based on increasing returns                         and imperfect       competition.         The


fourth       part        then        offers     some       updated        results        on     income

elasticities            in    the     1970s    and l980s,         arguing that            these    new

results support the general approach offered in this paper.




1.   Th Significance f Income Elasticities



                                                     3
        A1tht        much      theoretical    literature      in    international

economics is set in a general equilibrium                 framework with fairly

complex production structures and many                   relative    prices,        the

workhorse of practical trade balance analysis is still, as it was

a generation       ago, the partial equilibrium         analysis of trade flows

that are assumed to depend on real             income    and a single relative


price.     This     framework     can   be   defended as       a    pretty     close


approximation to a more carefully specified framework in which

expenditure       as well as income enters into import demand;               in any

case,    since     this   framework is       still    the way most      practical

analysis is done,         it will    be used as the starting point here

without much apology.
                                                                                        *
     Consider,      then, a two-country      world in which we define          y,   y
                                                 *
as domestic      and foreign     real output, p,p as the prices          in local


currency of these outputs, and          e as the     price of foreign currency
                                            *
in tens    of domestic. Define r        — ep /p      as the real exchange rate,

which is in this case the price of foreign relative to domestic

goods.   Then the standard trade balance model may be written as

follows.   Export volume depends on foreign output and the relative

price of domestic goods:




                                         4
                                  *
                           x — x(y ,r)                                          (1)




                                 on domestic             income   and the   relative
     Import volume depends

price of imports:




                            m       m(y,r)                                       (2)




     The trade balance (in domestic currency) may be written



                                                  *
                           B —     px    -
                                                 ep m                            (3)


                               —   p[x       -
                                                 rm]



so that the trade balance in terms of domestic output is simply




                                b —     x-rm                                     (4)




     Now it was pointed out in the l950s by Johnson (1958) that if

the framework (l)-(4) is   a   reasonable description of trade balance


                 then economic growth                 is likely to require secular
determination,

          in real exchange rates.         To see why, define         the following.
changes

Let



    — incomeelasticity of demand             for exports

        income elasticity of demand for imports


        price elasticity of demand for exports

        price elasticity of demand for imports

y   —   rate   of growth of domestic output,        i,e,, (dy/dt)/y

y   —   rate   of growth of foreign output

r   =   rate   of real depreciation




Now differentiate (4). We have




               db/dt —   x[cy* +             -
                                                 'm'   +   (l-e)r]              (5)




Suppose that initially b —          0,   so that x     — rm. Then    in order    to

keep a zero trade balance, we must have


                                A                  A
                            -       +    (e+e-l)r      — 0                      (6)




        This implies a trend in the real exchange rate of




                                         6
                                      -




      Equation   (7)   immediately        identifies two reasons        why   there may


be a trend in the equilibrium exchange rate: either countries may

face different elasticities           of import and export demand, or they

                                                              we
may have different long term rates of growth. More generally,

there will be a trend in the real exchange rate unless



                                                    *
                                xm                                                  (8)




which we would a priori imagine to be unlikely.

      Suppose    in particular that income elasticities are assigned

to   countries randomly,        based on whatever happens to be                   their


comparative     advantage.     Then       (7)   would lead us to expect rapidly

growing countries to experience secular depreciation on average,

needing progressively to cut the relative prices of their goods in

order to be able to sell ever increasing volumes on world markets.

      Even    without     careful          econometric      analysis,     it     should

immediately     be clear to even casual observers that this assertion

is   not     true.     Japan   has        not       experienced   progressive      real


depreciation vis-a-vis the United States; if anything, the reverse




                                                7
has bean                Thus there must be        scching         systematic     about    the


relationship        of       relative    growth         rates     to     relative      income

elasticities.       Let       us now turn briefly to            some      old econometric

evidence to pin that relationship                down.




2.   The 45- deg                in      19 50s and 19 60s




       In 1969 Houthakker and Magee published a paper that remains a

benci-imark for     comparative      estimation of trade equations                   across   a


large number of countries.              Their main conclusion was               that    there

were   large differences          among countries          in their       relative income

elasticities        -   -    specifically,       that     Japan        faced   the     highly

favorable combination of a high income elasticity of demand for

its exports       and a low income elasticity of import demand, while

the US and the UK faced the reverse. While Houthakker and Magee

did of course notice that Japan was the fastest growing country in

their sample, while the US and the                 UK were      the slowest,         they did

not explicitly consider the possibility                    that the differences in

underlying growth rates were somehow systematically related to the

differences       in estimated income elasticities.

       Yet   it    is       difficult to     escape      this   conclusion.          Table    1




                                             8
                                                                      results     for
presents      the    Houthakker-Magee income             elasticity

industrial countries,             together with the       growth rates   of     those


countries over the period 1955-1965. The relationship                 is striking;


it becomes even more so when the ratio                      is graphed against y,


a plot shown in Figure 1.


        Basically,   what the Houthakker-Magee           results show is that (8)


holds    --   that   is,    the    ratio    of income elasticities over their

estimation period was             such as      to   allow countries to have very

different growth rates without strong trends in equilibrium real

exchange rates. This may be confirmed more formally, by regressing

the natural logarithm of the Houthakker-Magee elasticity ratio on

the national growth rates1:




              — -1.81   +    1.210    ln(y/y
                            (0.208)



   — 0.754, SEE         0.211




1ldeally      we should use the ratio of domestic to foreign growth,

but I was not able to reconstruct                   the "foreign"   growth for the

                                                      data below
Houthakker-Magee sample. In the analysis of post-1970

the correct ratio is used.




                                               9
In   this     rsion we       see that on average, if country               A   grew twice

as rapidly as country B over the period 1955-65,                         then country A

turned out       to   have   an   estimated ratio             of      export to   import

elasticities     that was twice that of country B.

        The result of this systematic relationship between growth

rates    and income     elasticities     was        to    make relative purchasing


power parity hold much better than one would have expected if one

assumed that income elasticities               were identical,           or distributed


randomly.      One might have expected Japan to need to have rapidly


falling relative export prices                 in        order   to    accommodate   its


extremely rapid economic growth
                                           -   - but       the   combination of high

export elasticity and low import elasticity took care of that. One

might have expected the UK to receive                     compensation for its low

but     the   combination of      low   export       elasticity and high import

elasticity deprived it of that benefit.

        Clearly something is going on here.                  It seems     unlikely that

the systematic association of growth rates and income elasticities


is a pure coincidence.         So our next step is to turn to potential


explanations.




                                          10
3.   Explaining apparent income elasticity differences



       The     close    association      between      growth     rates     and     the


favorableness      of   income    elasticities       could have two        types    of


explanation.      On one side,       income     elasticities      could determine

              countries   that     happen      to    face    unfavorable       income
growth:

elasticities could         find    themselves running           into     balance    of

                                               If this forces them
payments problems whenever they try to expand.

into   stop-go economic      policies that inhibit growth,               the   result


could be to limit growth to a level consistent with little real

                                                      occur if a
exchange rate change over time. The same result would

                          prevents effective          real     depreciation;       then
wage-price spiral

countries would not        be     able   to    achieve   the    real depreciation

                                                            the
necessary to grow faster than the relative rate dictated by

income elasticities.

       The other basic explanation is that differential                 growth rates

affect trade flows in such a way as to create apparent differences

in income elasticities.          That is, we may conclude that there is a

                 element in the apparent differences               in    demand that
supply-side

countries face.

       I     am simply going to      dismiss        a priori the     argument that




                                          11
income                      determine economic growth,          rather than the

other    way    around.   It just seems          fundamentally implausible         that

over stretches of decades balance of payments problems                       could be

preventing long       term growth,         especially for      relatively closed

economies like the US in the l950s and l960s. Furthermore,                     we all

know     that    differences    in    growth       rates   among     countries are

primarily determined by differences               in the rate of growth of total

factor productivity,        not differences          in the   rate    of    growth of

employment;      it   is hard   to    see       what channel links         balance of

payments due to unfavorable income elasticities                    to total    factor


productivity growth.

       Thus we are driven to a supply-side            explanation of the income

elasticities.      It is important, however,          to think about what kind

of supply-side explanation is needed.                 Simply to posit a supply

curve for exports         for each country will not help:              as a country


grows,   its supply curve will shift out, but this will simply move

it         the demand      curve,    not    shift the curve.         Admittedly,     if

countries face        upward-sloping supply curves             for     exports     and

imports there will be some bias in empirical estimates that ignore

this; but this seems unlikely to explain the basic stylized fact

that countries seem able to grow at different rates without the




                                           12
need for trend shifts in real exchange rates.

        A more         sophisticated            view would draw on              the       traditional


analysis of            the    effects of           growth        on the     terms    of    trade,      as


                        Johnson           (1958)         and     Rhagwati     (1958,1961).           That
developed by

literature points out that when countries are not specialized in

trade    --    that     is,    when they produce import-competing as well as

exported products              -   -    growth     may     have    ambiguous        effects     on    the


terms    of trade.           Growth that is biased toward exports will indeed

require    a secular deterioration in                          the terms of trade, but growth


that    is biased toward imports                     may actually improve                 the   growing

country's terms of trade. The key question is the effect of growth

on   the      demand for               imports:     if    growth reduces        the       demand for

imports       at   a    given terms              of trade,         as   will be      the    case      for


sufficiently import-biased                      growth,        then a growing country's terms

of trade will improve over time.

        There may be something to this. In the 1950s and l960s, the

fast-growing country was Japan, while the slow growing countries

were the US and the UK. Japan was clearly playing catch-up with

the rest of the industrial world, which meant that it was becoming

more    similar to             the        its     trading       partners.     Now     suppose that

initially Japan had a comparative                               advantage in labor-intensive




                                                     13
goods bw::     omparative         disadvantage     in capital-intensive goods.

As it    becam more      similar to other industrial countries,               it would

become relatively better at producing capital-intensive goods, so

that its growth would be biased toward the sectors in which it did

not initially have a comparative              advantage and away from those

sectors   in which it did. This is precisely import-biased                     growth,

and could explain why Japan did not need declining terms of trade.

Conversely,   the US and the UK were being caught up to: the world

was becoming more similar to them, which would other things equal

tend to worsen their terms of trade

      Although     the    argument that          fast-growing          countries   were

experiencing import-biased growth is appealing in many respects,

however, I am doubtful about its relevance in explaining the data

in   Figure   1,   for    three    reasons.      First,     it   explains why       the


apparent income elasticities          could be favorable for fast-growing

countries, but not why they are favorable to almost precisely the

extent    needed to yield zero          trend    in   the    real      exchange rate.


     more elaborate formulation of how technological                      catch-up can

progressively worsen the terms            of     trade    of     the    country being

caught up to is offered in Krugman (1985) which in turn draws

heavily on Dornbusch, Fischer, and Satnuelson (1977).




                                         14
Second,   this story has an implication about the shares of trade in

income. Suppose that an economy grows, while the rest of the world

does not. If the growing economy is not to have a deterioration in

its terms of trade, it must have no increase in its import demand.

Hence the     share   of imports     in    national income       must fall:       the


economy must become more closed over time. Admittedly this result

can be softened by making ceteris not paribus,                 e.g. by imagining

that global trade      liberalization is taking place, and that there

is also    some growth in other countries. However,                the   fact    that


stable    terms   of trade were in fact consistent with growing trade

relative to       income   cast   doubt on the view that            import-biased

growth in catch-up countries could explain the real exchange rate

developments (or more to the point, the lack of them) in the 1950s

and l960s.

     The third reason for skepticism about the traditional                      trade


and growth explanation is           that       it   is   a   contingent one:      the


45-degree rule could happen, but there is no particular reason why

it should.    In particular,      it should not be expected to be stable


over time. As we will see, however,             the 45-degree rule has on the


whole been stable over time, persisting in the 1970s and 1980s

despite a major shift in relative growth rates. Thus                I at least am




                                          15
inspired t:    Tok     for more unusual explanations.


        In   looking    for    a    more         fundamental        explanation of       the


45-degree      rule,let       me    engage            in    a     bit    of    professional

self-psychoanalysis.          Why      do        international          economists     mostly

believe at a gut level that rough purchasing power parity should

obtain among industrial countries over the long run? The answer,                           I


would submit, is that it is because we believe that the industrial

nations are basically all pretty much the same. Germany and the US

can produce pretty much the same things, and produce them about

equally well; so if costs and prices in either country were very

far off those in the other for an extended period,                            all production

would    tend to     move     there.        In    the      long   run,   then,    we   expect

competition over        the    location of              production to         keep relative

prices from moving too far apart.

        But if Germany and the US are pretty much alike why do they

trade at all? The answer has to be some arbitrary specialization


that is driven not by comparative                     advantage but by the inherent

advantages of specialization itself, which is to say by increasing

returns.     Thus (not surprisingly)              I   would argue that the 45-degree

rule is best explained         by appealing             to the new theory of trade         in


which similar countries trade because of increasing returns rather




                                                 16
than comparative advantage.

        The story runs        as    follows.      Fast   growing countries expand

their share of world markets,            not by reducing the relative prices

of   their    goods,      but by   expanding      the range of      goods   that    they

produce      as   their   economies grow. What we measure as exports and

imports are not really fixed sets of goods, but instead aggregates

whose definitions change over time as more goods are added to the

list.    What we call "Japanese exports" is a meaningful aggregate

facing a downward-sloping demand curve at any point in time; but

as the Japanese economy grows over time,                      the definition of that


aggregate changes          in such a way as to make the apparent demand

curve shift outward. The result is to produce apparently favorable

income elasticities that allow the country to expand its economy

without the need for a secular real depreciation.

        To make this point more concrete,                let us consider a minimal


formal    model.     No effort will be made              at   realism;   instead,    the


purpose is         simply to       offer a     suggestive example of how the

45-degree rule could arise out of an increasing returns model of

international trade.

         The model we consider is the "rock-bottom"                 model introduced

in   Kruginan (1980),        based on the          Dixit-Stiglitz(l977)      model of




                                             17
monopoiit:         :impetition.        We suppose that there are two countries,

Home and Foreign, and that each can produce and consume any of an

infinite number of product varieties.                     These product varieties all

enter symmetrically into consumption,                      with everyone sharing the

instantaneous      utility function3



                         U —   (0 c)V0                      0<0<1                               (10)




We suppose that each country has only one factor of production,

which we will call "labor"                   but which may be              envisaged as           an


aggregate of        resources;         the    key point is          that    we        ignore    any

differences       in relative factor endowments among countries or                                in

factor intensities          among goods that would give rise to comparative

advantage.       Instead,      trade    arises         because of increasing returns,

which enter the           model    through the            assumption that              the     labor

    I   ignore     the     question          of    how      consumption          is     allocate

intertemporally.         For the sake of argument, suppose that there is

no capital mobility and that we ignore                       investment.         Then at each

point in time people simply maximize their instantaneous                                 utility

subject to their current income. Adding investment and capital

flows will complicate the picture a little, but not much.

where   1.   is the quantity of resources                used to produce any good

with nonzero output, and           x    is the output of the good.


       For each country there is             a   full employment constraint:




                                        L—Xl.                                       (12)




       As pointed out           in the work of Dixit and Stiglitz,           a closed

economy      with        this     utility        and     technology   will   have      a

                                                               Each   good   that     is
monopolistically competitive equilibrium.

                                            since a firm could
produced will be produced by only one firm,
                                                                                     and
always choose to start a new good that
                                       is equally profitable,


thus has no      incentive        to    contest       markets with other firms. The

firm    producing any particular good will face                     an elasticity of

demand



                                        —   l/(l-9)                                 (13)




                                                 19
       Given    tHs elasticity           of    demand,     each firm will charge a

price that is a markup over the wage rate:




                                    p/w — fl/O                                    (14)




       The    zero-profit condition then determines                the             and
                                                                         output

employment per product:




                            x(p/w         -
                                              )    —   a                          (15)

                       >    x   —       aO/fl(l-O)


and




                                1   —    a/(l-9)                                  (16)




      It follows    that the number of product varieties produced in a


country is simply proportional to its labor force:




                            n       —   L(l-8)/a                                  (17)




      Next,    consider trade between two such economies,                with labor

forces L            and         L      If    transport costs              may be     neglected          these


trading economies simply constitute a world economy with labor

force        L +                wage rates and the prices of representative                             goods

will be equalized whatever the relative                                    size     of   the       economies.


Trade will result                   from the desire of consumers in each country to


diversify their purchases:                          with Home producing n varieties and
                *
Foreign n           ,   each consumer              spends a fraction of his                income n/(n +

 *                      *                                                  *                   *        *
n    )
         =   L/(L+L         )   on Home goods, a fraction n /(n+n*)                         L /(L±L         )   on

Foreign goods.

         Now note               that        Home   income       deflated by          the    price       of       a


representative                  product is




                                             y   = wL/p         L8/                                         (18)




The volume of Home imports is therefore

                                             M —    [n/(n+n         )]y                                     (19)




and the volume of Home exports, analogously,                                   is



                                                     *          * *
                                             X —   [n    /(n+n )]y                                           (20)




                                                           21
      Now consider what happens                   if the Home and foreign economies

are growing over time. We may represent growth as increases                                  in L
      *
and L     ,    recognizing     that productivity gains can be represented as

increases        in the effective labor forces.                       Then we may immediately

note that even if the labor forces grow at different rates,                                   the


prices        of representative          products      in the two countries            will still


be equalized. That is, there will be no real exchange rate change.

The   reason is that the faster growing country will be able to

increase        its share of world expenditure                    by increasing the number

of goods it produces faster than the other country, allowing it to

sell more without a reduction in its relative price.

      By differentiating (19) and (20), we find that



                    A     A     A    *        *            A*            *
                    X —   M     y[y /(y+y         )]   +   y    [y/(y+y )]                    (21)



Now suppose         a    naive econometrician were                     to    attempt   to   fit   a

conventional trade model to this data. She would find an apparent

income elasticity of export demand equal to



                         AA*        AA*       *            *
                                                                  +
                                                                              *
                     —
                         X/y   —    (y/y   )[y /(y+y )]               y/(y+y   )             (22)




                                                  22
and similarly an apparent income elasticity of import demand equal

to



                               *       *                           *
                   —   M/y —y /(y+y     )   +    (y   /y){y/(y+y )J                   (23)




      We note immediately          from (22) and (23) that the higher the

relative growth rate of Home,               the higher will            be the apparent

income     elasticity of demand for its exports                  (other things equal)

and the      lower     the   apparent income            elasticity of         demand for

imports.    This of course         simply   reflects          the effects    of changing


numbers of products that we have already alluded                       to.   Furthermore.

the   ratio of these         apparent income            elasticities will        in   fact


precisely fulfill the 45-degree condition:



                                            -



      We    see,   then,     that a    simple         model    in which trade arises

because of economies of specialization                        rather than comparative

advantage in effect predicts that an ecorlometrician will find the

45-degree rule.        The fundamental logic is that if countries are




                                            23
basically alike,           then the prices of their typical              traded outputs


should be the same, and apparent income elasticities will be such

as to make continued price equality possible.

        If   the   45-degree rule      is really      a reflection of         something

fundamental about trade flows rather than something contingent on

particular circumstances,           we should expect to find that it holds

over different time periods.           In particular,        we should find that if


a     country's relative growth rate              changes,    its    apparent income

elasticities           should change    as    well,     so    as    to    preserve the

45-degree rule. Thus our next step must be to examine the validity

of the 45-degree rule in the 1970s and l980s.

        Tables     2   and 3 report the results of a set of standard export

RMP =      relative    price      of manufactures    imports, calculated as ratio

          All data is from OECD Economic Outlook. All equations were

estimated in log-linear form; where severe serial correlation was

evident,      a correction was made.


          By and large,      these estimates        look fairly decent;     taken one

at a time, they might suggest                  the need for more careful     cleaning

of data,      addition of some extra variables,               etc., but they would

not         discourage             a         researcher      from        using    the


income-and-price-elasticityframework. The major exception is the

UK, whose import equation refuses to make sense;                    I have not been

able to resolve this puzzle,                 and will drop the UK from subsequent

discussion.




                                               25
       What we may    note, however,       is that there is still, as in the


Houthakker-Magee results,         a systematic tendency for high-growth


countries to face favorable income elasticities.Table                   4 presents


a                   estimated income                         their                   and

growth rates (calculated by fitting trens to domestic and foreign

GNP). When these results          are plotted in Figure          2,   the result is


less striking than for the Houthakker-Magee data in Figure 1                          -   -


partly    because the spread of growth rates is smaller                 -   - but    the


upward-sloping relationship           is    still    apparent.    On   average the

45-degree rule        continues     to     hold,    although with        much       less


confidence:

                        (0.609)



R2     0.322, SEE      0.401




       Perhaps     a more   illuminating        test is to look at the way in

which estimates       changed from the           earlier   period to        the    later


period.    In the    l9SOs and 1960s,           as Houthakker and Magee noted,


Japan was the country with highly favorable income elasticities,

while the US and the UK were the countries disfavored.                            In the




                                           26
l970s    and l9SOs there was a general convergence          of growth rates.

European growth rates decline more than those of the US, so that

the US     grew almost as rapidly as its trading partners;             Japan,

though still fast growing, was not as far out of line as before,

Tf the analysis above is right, we should expect to find a decline

in Japan's             ratio and a rise in that of the US. And indeed we

do find this: according to the estimates made here, Japan's ratio

of elasticities,       while still high, is lower in my estimates          than

in   the       Houthakker-Magee results,     while   the    US   actually is

estimated to have a       c/c   greaterthan   one.




Conclusions




         This    paper has   suggested that the surprising thing about

long term trends in real exchange rates is their absence. That               is,


over     the    long   run relative purchasing power parity for              the


manufactures outputs of industrial countries holds better than we

would    expect given the       fairly low    price elasticities usually

estimated.       The way that conventional   econometrics    justifies this

is by      finding that countries with high growth          rates   face    high


income     elasticities   of demand for their exports       while having low




                                      27
income   elasticities       of import demand,        with the result being that

their faster growth is accommodated without a need for secular

real depreciation.      I   have offered this as a stylized fact in the

                                                      rule".       Like most stylized
data, and christened it the "45-degree

facts, this needs a little squinting to see in the charts,                          but    I


would argue that        there    is       enough evidence          for    a systematic

association between apparent income                  elasticities and            relative


growth rates to be regarded as something that needs explaining.

      The   best explanation,         I    would argue,       is    that    trade      among


industrial countries largely does                  not reflect          country-specific

                advantages,       leading        countries         to     face   long-term
comparative

downward-sloping demand           for      their     unique    products.         Instead,


countries specialize to           take      advantage of       scale economies at

different levels; as countries grow they can expand their range of

outputs,    and hence increase        their share of world markets without

the necessity of secular real depreciation.

      It    should be clear that this is only a preliminary study.

Ideally we would like to go beyond the simple                            regressions     and


simple     model presented here to develop a model that explicitly

links the long run to the short and medium run dynamics in which

                                                                                           a

believe is an important if fuzzy empirical regularity,        it will

have served its purpose.
