Aggregate and sectoral comovement are central features of business cycle data. Therefore, the ability
to generate comovement is a natural litmus test for macroeconomic models. But it is a test that most
existing models fail. In this paper we propose a unified model that generates both aggregate and sectoral
comovement in response to contemporaneous shocks and news shocks about fundamentals. The fundamentals
that we consider are aggregate and sectoral TFP shocks as well as investment-specific technical change.
The model has three key elements: variable capital utilization, adjustment costs to investment, and
a new form of preferences that allow us to parameterize the strength of short-run wealth effects on
the labor supply.

                                             ABSTRACT


   Aggregate and sectoral comovement are central features of business cycle data. Therefore,
the ability to generate comovement is a natural litmus test for macroeconomic models. But
it is a test that most existing models fail. In this paper we propose a uni…ed model that

generates both aggregate and sectoral comovement in response to contemporaneous shocks

and news shocks about fundamentals. The fundamentals that we consider are aggregate and

sectoral TFP shocks as well as investment-speci…c technical change. The model has three

key elements: variable capital utilization, adjustment costs to investment, and a new form

of preferences that allow us to parameterize the strength of short-run wealth e¤ects on the

labor supply. (JEL E3)



   Business cycle data feature two important forms of comovement. The …rst is aggregate

comovement: major macroeconomic aggregates, such as output, consumption, investment,

hours worked, and the real wage tend to rise and fall together. The second is sectoral

comovement: output, employment, and investment tend to rise and fall together in di¤erent

sectors of the economy.

   Robert Lucas (1977) argues that these comovement properties re‡ect the central role that
aggregate shocks play in driving business ‡uctuations. However, it is surprisingly di¢ cult
to generate both aggregate and sectoral comovement, even in models driven by aggregate

shocks. Robert J. Barro and Robert G. King (1984) show that the one-sector growth model

generates aggregate comovement only in the presence of contemporaneous shocks to total fac-
tor productivity (TFP). Other shocks generate a negative correlation between consumption

and hours worked. Lawrence Christiano and Terry Fitzgerald (1998) show that a two-sector
version of the neoclassical model driven by aggregate, contemporaneous TFP shocks does
not generate sectoral comovement of investment and hours worked.

       In this paper we propose a model that generates aggregate and sectoral comovement in
response to both aggregate and sectoral shocks. The shocks that we consider are aggregate
TFP shocks, investment-speci…c shocks, and sectoral TFP shocks to the consumption and

investment sectors. We consider both contemporaneous shocks and news shocks. News

shocks consist of information that is useful for predicting future fundamentals but does not

a¤ect current fundamentals.

       The early literature on business cycles (e.g. William H. Beveridge (1909), Arthur Pigou

(1927), and John Maurice Clark (1934)) emphasizes news shocks as potentially important

drivers of business cycles. The idea is that news shocks change agents’expectations about

the future, a¤ecting their current investment, consumption, and work decisions. There is a

revival of interest in this idea, motivated in part by the U.S. investment boom of the late

1990s and the subsequent economic slowdown. Figure 1 displays some suggestive data for this

episode. The …rst panel shows data obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System

on the median analyst forecast of the value-weighted long-run growth rate of earnings for
companies in the Standard & Poors 500 index. The second panel shows the level of investment

and realized earnings for the same companies. We see that after 1995 the expected annual
earnings growth rate rises rapidly, from roughly 11:5 percent to 17:7 in 2001.1 Investment
and earnings forecasts are positively correlated, whereas investment and realized earnings are

negatively correlated.2 One plausible interpretation of these data is that high expectations
   1
     The realized average annual earnings growth rate is nine percent for the 1985-95 period and 11 percent
for the 1995-2000 period.
   2
     The correlation between investment and earnings growth forecasts is 0:60 for the whole sample and 0:71
for the 1995-2004 period. Earnings forecasts lead investment; the correlation between the earnings forecast
at time t and investment at time t + 1 is 0:55 for the full sample. The correlation between investment and
realized earnings is 0:21 for the whole sample and 0:46 for the 1995-2004 period.


                                                    2
about earnings growth driven by the prospects of new technologies lead to high levels of
investment and to an economic boom. When the new technologies fail to live up to what

was expected, investment falls, and a recession ensues.
       It is surprisingly di¢ cult to make this story work in a standard business cycle model.
John H. Cochrane (1994), Jean Pierre Danthine, John B. Donaldson, and Thore Johnsen

(1998), and Paul Beaudry and Frank Portier (2004, 2007) …nd that many variants of the
neoclassical growth model fail to generate a boom in response to expectations of higher future
total factor productivity (TFP). Good news about future productivity make agents wealthier,

so they increase their consumption, as well as their leisure, reducing the labor supply. This

fall in labor supply causes output to fall. Therefore, good news about tomorrow generates a

recession today!

       Our model introduces three elements into the neoclassical growth model that together

generate comovement in response to news shocks. These same elements generate comove-

ment in response to contemporaneous shocks. The …rst element, variable capital utilization,

increases the response of output to news about the future. The second element, adjustment

costs to investment, gives agents an incentive to respond immediately to news about future

fundamentals.3 The third element, a weak short-run wealth e¤ect on the labor supply, helps

generate a rise in hours worked in response to positive news. We introduce this element by

using a new class of preferences which gives us the ability to parameterize the strength of
the short-run wealth e¤ect on the labor supply. These preferences nest, as special cases,

the two classes of utility functions most widely used in the business cycle literature, those
characterized in Robert G. King, Charles Plosser, and Sergio Rebelo (1988) and in Jeremy
Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz, and Gregory Hu¤man (1988).

       In our quantitative work, we consider a one-sector and a two-sector version of our model.
The latter is used to study sectoral comovement. Using our preferences to vary the strength
   3
    The …rst two elements, variable capital utilization and adjustment costs to investment, are generally
necessary to generate comovement in response to contemporaneous investment-speci…c shocks, see Jeremy
Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz, and Per Krusell (2000).



                                                   3
of short-run wealth e¤ects on the labor supply we …nd that these e¤ects lie at the heart
of the model’s ability to generate comovement. We can generate aggregate comovement in

the presence of moderate labor-supply wealth e¤ects. However, low short-run labor-supply
wealth e¤ects are essential to generate sectoral comovement that is robust to the timing and
nature of the shocks.4

       Our work is related to several recent papers on the role of news and expectations as
drivers of business cycles. Beaudry and Portier (2004) propose the …rst model that produces
an expansion in response to news. Their model features two complementary consumption

goods, one durable and one non-durable. Both goods are produced with labor and a …xed

factor but with no physical capital. The model generates a boom in response to good news

about TFP in the non-durable goods sector. Lawrence Christiano, Cosmin Ilut, Roberto

Motto, and Massimo Rostagno (2007) show that habit persistence and investment adjustment

costs produce aggregate comovement in response to news about a future TFP shock. In their

model, intertemporal substitution in the supply of labor is large enough to compensate for

the negative wealth e¤ect of the news shock on the labor supply. However, hours worked fall

when the shock materializes because there continues to be a negative wealth e¤ect on labor

supply, but there is no longer a strong intertemporal substitution e¤ect on labor supply.

Wouter Denhaan and Georg Kaltenbrunner (2005) study the e¤ects of news in a matching

model. Matching frictions are a form of labor adjustment costs, so their model is related to
the version of our model with adjustment costs to labor, which we discuss in section 4. Guido

Lorenzoni (2005) studies a model in which productivity has a temporary and a permanent
component and agents have imperfect information about the relative importance of these
two components. Simon Gilchrist and John Leahy (2002) discuss the e¤ects of news in both

a sticky price model and in a version of the model proposed by Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler,
and Simon Gilchrist (1999). Olivier Blanchard (2007) emphasizes the importance of news
   4
    Guido Imbens, Donald Rubin, and Bruce Sacerdote (1999) provide microeconomic evidence that is
consistent with the view that short-run wealth e¤ects on the labor supply are weak. Their evidence is based
on a sample of lottery prize winners. They …nd that prizes of $15,000 per year for twenty years have no
e¤ect on the labor supply.

about future fundamentals in an open economy setting.
      Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we propose a one-sector model that gener-

ates aggregate comovement with respect to news about TFP and investment-speci…c shocks.
In Section 3 we explore the role that capital utilization, adjustment costs, and preferences
play in these results. In Section 4 we present a two-sector model that generates sectoral

comovement with respect to both contemporaneous and news shocks to fundamentals. The
fundamentals that we consider are aggregate TFP shocks and sectoral TFP shocks to con-
sumption and investment. In Section 5 we study simulations of a version of our one-sector

model with investment-speci…c technological progress in which agents receive forecasts about

future output growth. Section 6 concludes.


I.      The one-sector model

Our model economy is populated by identical agents who maximize their lifetime utility (U )

de…ned over sequences of consumption (Ct ) and hours worked (Nt ):
                                                                      1

and E0 denotes the expectation conditional on the information available at time zero. We

assume that 0 <       < 1,    > 1,     > 0, and             > 0. Agents internalize the dynamics of Xt
in their maximization problem. The presence of Xt makes preferences non-time-separable in

consumption and hours worked. These preferences nest as special cases the two classes of

utility functions most widely used in the business cycle literature. When               = 1 we obtain
preferences of the class discussed in King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988), which we refer to

as KPR. When         = 0 we obtain the preferences proposed by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and

Hu¤man (1988), which we refer to as GHH.

and labor:

Here At represents the level of TFP. Capital services are equal to the product of the stock
of capital (Kt ) and the rate of capital utilization (ut ). Output can be used for consumption
or investment (It ):

The variable zt represents the current state of technology for producing capital goods. We

interpret an increase in zt as resulting from investment-speci…c technological progress, as in

Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000). Combining (3) and (4) we obtain:

costs in the steady state, and that            (1) > 0. Lawrence Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and

Charles Evans (2005) (henceforth CEE) argue that this form of adjustment costs is better at

mimicking the response of investment to a monetary shock than the speci…cations in Robert
Lucas and Edward Prescott (1971), Andrew Abel and Olivier Blanchard (1983), and Fumio

Hayashi (1982).5

       The function (ut ) represents the rate of capital depreciation. We assume that deprecia-

    David Lucca (2007) provides microfoundations for the CEE adjustment cost formulation. He shows that
these adjustments costs are equivalent, up to a …rst-order approximation, to a model in which there is time

discount factor              to 0:985, implying a quarterly steady-state real interest rate of 1:5 percent.

The share of labor in the production function,                                             , is set to 0:64. We set the value of                                                     to

0:001, so preferences are close to a GHH speci…cation. We choose the second derivative of

rises slowly with the level of utilization. In this case, the level of capital utilization is highly

responsive to shocks, resulting in a powerful ampli…cation mechanism. Since there is little

the robustness of our results to these parameters. We solve the model by linearizing the

equations that characterize the planner’s problem around the steady state.

                                                                                  7
News shocks Given these parameter values, the model produces aggregate comovement
in response to both contemporaneous shocks to At or zt and to news about future values

of At or zt . Most macroeconomic models generate aggregate comovement in response to
contemporaneous shocks. For this reason, we focus our discussion on the response of our
model to news shocks.

       The timing of the news shock we consider is as follows. At time zero the economy is in
the steady state. At time one, unanticipated news arrives. Agents learn that there will be
a one-percent permanent increase in At or zt beginning two periods later, in period three.

Figure 2 depicts the response of the economy to this news. In all cases, there is an expansion

in periods one and two in response to positive news about future productivity. Consumption,

investment, output, hours worked, average labor productivity, and capital utilization all rise

in periods one and two even though the positive shock only occurs in period three.6

       Figure 2 shows that the impact of news about At is less important than the realization

of the At shock. An increase in At , once it materializes, has an immediate, direct impact

on output. On the other hand, news of a future increase in At a¤ects output only through

changes in the supply of labor and in the amount of capital that is accumulated before the

shock arrives.

       In contrast, with investment-speci…c technical change, most of the rise in output occurs

in period one, when the news arrives, not in period three, when the zt shock materializes.
This property results from the fact that an increase in zt does not have a direct e¤ect on

output. Output is only a¤ected by changes in the supply of labor and in the amount of
capital accumulated both before and after the realization of the shock.
       Table 1 shows that there is a wide range of parameters that generate aggregate comove-

ment in response to news about future At and zt . This table is constructed by using our
benchmark calibration and changing one parameter at a time to …nd the range of values for
   6
    Beaudry and Portier (2007) provide a useful characterization of the class of models that cannot generate
aggregate comovement in response to news about future TFP. Our model has preferences and investment
adjustment costs that are outside the set of speci…cations that they consider.



                                                     8
this parameter consistent with aggregate comovement in the period in which the news ar-
rives. We …nd that adjustments to investment do not have to be high, ( 00 (1) > 0:4), varying

utilization can be relatively costly ( 00 (u)u= 0 (u) < 2:5), and the labor supply does not need
to be very responsive ( < 10). The value of              has to be lower than 0:4. Therefore, although
the model does not generate aggregate comovement when preferences take the KPR form,

short-run wealth e¤ects on the labor supply can still be substantial.


II.     The elements of the one-sector model

In this section we discuss the role played by the three features of the model that generate

comovement between consumption, investment, output, and hours worked in response to

news about the future values of At or zt . In discussing the in‡uence of capital utilization

and adjustment costs on investment decisions it is useful to consider a version of the model

with GHH preferences ( = 0). In this case Xt is constant so, to simplify, we normalize the

level of X to one. The …rst-order conditions for the planner’s problem for this version of the

model are:

(13)                                    Ct         Nt        =    t,



(14)                              Nt    1
                                            = At (ut Kt )1            Nt       1
                                                                                   ,

together with (10), (11), and (12).


Variable Capital Utilization To explain the role played by capital utilization, we con-

sider a version of the model with constant capital utilization. To obtain the planner’s …rst-
order conditions for this model, we eliminate the …rst-order condition for ut , (10), set ut = 1
in equations (5) and (14), and (ut ) =           in equation (6):

                                             1
(15)                                   Nt        = At Kt1        Nt    1
                                                                           .

This equation implies that Nt does not respond to news about future changes in At or zt . The

positive wealth e¤ect of future shocks reduces the marginal utility of consumption today,           t.


                                                     9
Equation (13) implies that Ct rises. When ut = 1, equation (5) implies that investment must
fall. Therefore, labor and output do not respond to the news shock, consumption rises, and

investment falls. In the case of variable utilization, equation (14) implies that an increase
in utilization raises the marginal product of labor. This increase provides an incentive for
hours worked to rise.


Preferences To understand the role of preferences in shaping the e¤ects of news about
the future it is useful to study the problem of a worker in our economy.

        We …rst consider the response of a worker to a contemporaneous, permanent increase

in the real wage, wt . To simplify, we abstract from uncertainty and assume that the real

interest rate is constant and given by: r = 1=                1. The worker’s problem is to maximize

(1) subject to the budget constraint:

                                      at+1 = (1 + r)at + wt Nt        Ct ,

and to the non-Ponzi game condition, limt!1 at+1 =(1 + r)t = 0, and the initial value of the

worker’s assets, a0 . The timing is as follows. At time zero, the worker is in the steady state

with a constant wage rate. At time one, there is an unanticipated, one percent permanent

increase in wt . The …rst panel of Figure 3 shows the response of Nt for four di¤erent values

of : zero, 0:001, 0:25, and one. The strongest response of Nt occurs with GHH preferences

(   = 0). However, in this case hours worked are not stationary, they rise permanently.7

With KPR preferences (            = 1), Nt converges back to the steady state after the shock,

but its short-run response is very weak. When                  is equal to 0:001 or 0:25, the short-run
impact of the wage rise on Nt is in between that obtained with GHH and KPR preferences.

Lower values of       produce short-run responses that are closer to those obtained with GHH

preferences. As long as 0 <            1, hours worked converge to the steady state.
    7
     A simple way to make hours stationary when preferences take a GHH form is to introduce a trend in the
utility function such that the utility cost of supplying labor increases at the same rate as the real wage. This
trend can be justi…ed by appealing to home production. However, we …nd that, in models with stochastic
technical progress, this formulation can generate large recessions through an implausible mechanism. In
periods with low rates of technical progress, hours worked can fall signi…cantly because the trend increase
in the utility cost of supplying labor is not o¤set by increases in the real wage rate.

                                                      10
       We now compute the Hicksian wealth e¤ect on hours worked of the real wage increase.
We denote by U and U the lifetime utility of the worker before and after the permanent

increase in wt , respectively. To calculate the wealth e¤ect we compute the path of Nt for a
worker who does not bene…t from the wage increase but who receives an output transfer at
time one that raises his utility to U . Our results are displayed in the second panel of Figure

3. The wealth e¤ect is zero for GHH preferences and negative for KPR. In both cases the
wealth e¤ect is constant over time. When 0 <                 < 1 the wealth e¤ect varies over time. In
the long run, this e¤ect is similar to that with KPR preferences. In the short-run, the e¤ect

is actually positive, helping to raise the labor supply. This positive wealth e¤ect results from

the fact that the disutility of work is high when Xt is high.8 Since consumption rises over

time, Xt also increases over time, and the disutility of work is higher in the future than in

the present.

       It is easy to see why it is generally di¢ cult to generate an expansion in response to good

news about the future with KPR preferences. Suppose we tell a worker with KPR preferences

that his real wage goes up in the future but not in the present. This news generates a wealth

e¤ect that reduces the worker’s supply of labor today.


Investment Adjustment Costs The …rst-order condition for labor, (14), implies that,

unless the rate of capital utilization changes, Nt does not respond to news about the future.

The …rst-order condition for capital utilization, (10), implies that                 t= t   must fall in order for
ut to rise. A fall in    t= t   requires the presence of adjustment costs to investment. Without

adjustment costs,       t= t   = zt and the capital utilization equation reduces to:


                                   (1    )At ut Kt1       Nt = zt 0 (ut )Kt .


Since zt and At both remain constant at time two, this equation along with (14) implies that

both Nt and ut remain constant.
   8                                                                            1
    The disutility of labor at time t is given by:   Ct      N t Xt      Nt         Xt . It is easy to see that this
disutility is increasing in Xt .



                                                      11
       We can now put all the elements of the model together to explain how we can generate
comovement in response to news about the future. A future increase in At or zt implies

that investment will rise in the future. In the presence of investment adjustment costs it is
optimal to smooth investment over time, and so investment rises in period one. An increase
in investment leads to a decline in        t= t,   the value of installed capital in units of consumption.

This fall occurs because the adjustment costs embedded in (6) imply that higher levels of
investment today reduce the cost of investment tomorrow.
       The fall in   t= t   lowers the value of installed capital. Capital is less valuable because it is

less costly to replace, so it is e¢ cient to increase today’s rate of capital utilization. The rise

in utilization increases the marginal product of labor. This increase provides an incentive

for hours worked to rise. As long as the wealth e¤ect on the supply of labor is small enough,

hours rise and we see an expansion in response to good news about future values of At or zt .


Implications for the Value of the Firm The ratio                                 t= t   is equal to Tobin’s marginal

q, which is the value of an additional unit of installed capital. Therefore, to generate co-

movement, good news about future productivity must lead to a fall in Tobin’s marginal q.

A natural question is: does this fall imply a decline in the value of …rm? The answer is no

because with CEE adjustment costs, average q (the ratio of …rm value to the capital stock)

is di¤erent from marginal q. To see this result, de…ne the end-of period value of the …rm as

the result of the following problem:9

                                                X
                                                1     t
                                                              t
              V (K1 ; I0 ; A0 ; z0 ) = max E0                     At (ut Kt )1    Nt       wt Nt   It =zt ,
                                                t=1       0


subject to (6). The expression V (K1 ; I0 ; A0 ; z0 ) represents the time-zero value of the …rm

after it receives the cash ‡ow (Y0           w0 N0 ), incurs investment expenses (I0 =z0 ), and chooses

values for I1 and K1 . We show in Nir Jaimovich and Sergio Rebelo (2008) that V (K1 ; I0 ; z0 )
   9
    Our motivation for using the end-of-period value of the …rm is as follows. In a discrete-time version of
the Hayashi (1982) model marginal and average q coincide only when they are based on the end-of-period
value of the …rm. This timing is not required in continuous time, see the Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008).




                                                          12
can be written as:

                                          0                           0   0    I0       I0
(16)           V (K1 ; I0 ; A0 ; z0 ) =       (1   ) K0 + I0 1=z0 +                                 .
                                          0                           0       I 1      I 1

       The value of the …rm is the sum of two components. The …rst component, ( 0 = 0 ) (1                      ) K0 ,
is the value of the capital stock. The second component, is the value of investment. This

second term is present because higher investment today lowers the cost of higher investment
in the future.
       News about future At or zt reduce the value of the capital stock but can raise the value

of investment. For our parameter values, the value of the capital falls and the value of the

investment rises. The …rst e¤ect dominates so the overall value of the …rm falls.

       An easy way to overturn this implication without changing any of the other key properties

of our model is to introduce decreasing returns to scale into the production function. We

…nd that the value of the …rm rises in response to news about future increases in At or zt

when the degree of returns to scale is lower than 0:9. A production function that exhibits

decreasing returns to capital and labor can be written as: Yt = At (ut Kt )                  1
                                                                                                 Nt 2 T 1   2    3
                                                                                                                     ,

where      1   +    2   < 1, and T can be interpreted as a production factor that belongs to the

…rm.10 The value of this factor increases whenever there is an increase in the future values

of At or zt .11 This e¤ect produces an overall increase in the value of the …rm.


III.           The two-sector model

To study sectoral comovement we consider a two-sector version of our model with a con-

sumption sector and an investment sector.12 Preferences are described by (1) and (2). The
  10
     A degree of returns to scale of 0:9 is consistent with the estimates in Craig Burnside (1996). The factor
T can be interpreted as organizational capital, see Edward Prescott and Michael Visscher (1980).
  11
     Another avenue to generate an increase in the value of the …rm in response to news shocks is to introduce
adjustment costs to labor (see Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008)). These adjustment costs add a term similar to
the investment value to the overall value of the …rm.
  12
     See Greg Hu¤man and Mark Wynne (1998) for evidence on sectoral comovement. These authors propose
a model that generates sectoral comovement in response to contemporaneous shocks. Their model does not
produce comovement in response to news shocks because it has no forces that can compensate for the negative
wealth e¤ect on the labor supply of news about future fundamentals.



                                                        13
resource constraint (5) is replaced with the following two equations:

(17)                               Ct = At ztc (uct Ktc )1        (Ntc ) ,


                                                              1
(18)                            Itc + Iti = At zti uit Kti           Nti       ,

where the superscript c and i denotes variables that are speci…c to the consumption and
investment sector, respectively. The capital accumulation equation, (6), is replaced by:

                         c                        Itc
(19)                    Kt+1 = Itc 1                          + [1          (uct )]Ktc ,
                                                 Itc 1


                             i                     Iti
(20)                        Kt+1 = Iti 1                      + [1          (uit )]Kti .
                                                  Iti 1

Finally, we introduce the condition:

                                            Ntc + Nti = Nt .

   Before turning to our results it is useful to review Christiano and Fitzgerald’s (1998)

discussion of why sectoral comovement of hours worked cannot arise with KPR preferences.

Combining the …rst-order conditions for consumption and labor for the case of                        = 1 yields

the following expression:



                                                          1
(21)                                       Ntc + Nti          = =Ntc .

Equation (21) implies that Ntc and Nti cannot move in the same direction. The analogous

equation for the case of GHH preferences is:

                                                          1         Ct
(22)                                       Ntc + Nti          =         .
                                                                    Ntc

Equation (22) shows that with GHH preferences it is possible for Ntc and Nti to move in the

same direction. The fact that comovement is not possible with                        = 1 but it is possible with

  = 0 suggests that wealth e¤ects on the labor supply plays a crucial role in determining

                                                   14
sectoral comovement.13 Our preferences allow us to consider intermediate values of                       to
obtain a better understanding of the role played by short-run wealth e¤ects on the labor

supply in generating sectoral comovement.
       We now discuss numerical results for a version of the model calibrated with the same
parameter values used for the one-sector model. Figure 4 shows the e¤ects of three di¤erent

permanent, contemporaneous one-percent shocks. The …rst shock is an aggregate TFP shock
(At ). The second is a sectoral shock to TFP in the consumption sector (ztc ). The third is
a sectoral shock to TFP in the investment sector (zti or, equivalently, zt ). The timing is as

follows. The economy is in the steady state at time zero and the shock occurs at time one.

It is clear from Figure 4 that the model generates both aggregate and sectoral comovement

in response to all three shocks.

       Figure 5 shows the response to news about the same three shocks (At , ztc , and zti ) . The

timing is as follows. The economy is in the steady state at time zero. At time one the economy

learns that there is a permanent, one-percent increase in one of the three shocks in period

three. Figure 5 shows that the model generates both aggregate and sectoral comovement in

response to news about all three shocks.


Robustness To understand better the mechanism that drives the results displayed in

Figures 4 and 5 we now discuss the range of parameters that generate sectoral comovement

with respect to contemporaneous and news shocks. We follow the same procedure we use to
study robustness in the one-sector model.

       Table 1 shows that it is easy to generate comovement with respect to contemporaneous

shocks to ztc , even with KPR preferences. Generating sectoral comovement in response
to contemporaneous shocks to At requires only that short-run wealth e¤ects be somewhat

weaker than those implied by KPR ( < 0:6). In both of these cases minimal adjustment
  13
    The results in Riccardo DiCecio (2005) also suggest that wealth e¤ects play a central role in generating
sectoral comovement in response to contemporaneous shocks. In his model there is sectoral comovement
because wages are sticky. Workers have to supply the number of hours demanded by …rms at a …xed nominal
wage, and so the wealth e¤ect on the labor supply plays no role in the short run.



                                                    15
costs to investment are required and variable utilization is not necessary. It is much more
di¢ cult to generate sectoral comovement in response to contemporaneous shocks to zti . We

need very weak short-run wealth e¤ects ( < 0:11) and a responsive labor supply ( < 2). We
also need variable utilization, but increasing utilization can be relatively costly ( 00 (u)u= 0 (u)
< 2:8).

   Finally, it is essential to have low values of        ( < 0:006) to obtain sectoral comovement
in response to news about At , ztc , and zti . We also need moderate investment adjustment costs
( 00 (1) > 1), a low elasticity of the cost of utilization with respect to the rate of utilization

( 00 (u)u= 0 (u) < 0:25), and a responsive labor supply ( < 1:6).

   We …nd that sectoral comovement of labor and of investment are driven by di¤erent

features of the model. Low values of         are essential to generate comovement of labor in the

two sectors. Investment adjustment costs are important to generate comovement in sectoral

investment.


Adjustment Costs to Labor We now consider a version of our model that incorporates

adjustment costs to labor, along the lines of Thomas Sargent (1978) and Timothy Cogley

and James M. Nason (1995). We replace equations (17) and (18) with the following two

equations:

                         Ct + Ntc '(Ntc =Ntc 1 ) = At ztc (uct Ktc )1        (Ntc ) ,
                                                                         1
                       Itc + Iti + Nti '(Nti =Nti 1 ) = At zti uit Kti          Nti     ,

where '(:) is a function such that '(1) = '0 (1) = 0, '0 (:)             0, and '00 (:) > 0.

   We …nd that adjustment costs to labor help generate aggregate comovement with respect
to news shocks. These costs provide an incentive to increase the labor supply immediately

in anticipation of future increases in the labor supply that occur in response to the shock.

In the presence of adjustment costs it is not e¢ cient to reduce the labor supply today and
then increase it in the future once the shock occurs. As a result, the short-run wealth e¤ect

on the labor supply can be stronger than in the benchmark model. Indeed, we …nd that the


                                                    16
introduction of labor adjustment costs allows the model to generate aggregate comovement
in the one-sector model in response to news about At or zt for a much wider range of

parameters, including high values of . However, we …nd that adjustment costs to labor do
not help with generating sectoral comovement in response to news shocks in the two-sector
model.


IV.       Model Simulations

We have shown that our model can generate expansions and contractions in response to good

news about future productivity. One natural question is whether this success comes at a cost

of the model’s ability to generate empirically recognizable business ‡uctuations. That is, can

the model, when calibrated with the same parameters used in the experiments discussed so

far, generate volatility, comovement, and persistence of macroeconomic aggregates that are

empirically plausible? To answer this question we simulate a version of our model driven by

stochastic, investment-speci…c technical progress and compute the standard set of business-

cycle statistics.14 We assume that log(zt ) follows a random walk:

                                      log(zt+1 ) = log(zt ) + "t+1 .

We use the method proposed by George Tauchen and Robert Hussey (1991) to estimate a

two-point Markov chain for "t . We measure zt using quarterly data on the U.S. real price of

investment for the period 1947.I to 2004.IV. These data were constructed by Fisher (2006)

using National Income and Product Accounts series for the consumption de‡ator and Jason
Cummins and Giovanni Violante’s (2002) updated series for Robert Gordon’s (1989) quality-

adjusted producer durable-equipment de‡ator.15 The support of the estimated Markov chain

is: f0:00, 0:0115g. The transition matrix is:

                                               0:7378 0:2622
(23)                                     =                         .
                                               0:2622 0:7378
  14
     Jonas Fisher (2006) and Alejandro Justiniano and Giorgio Primiceri (2005) argue that investment-speci…c
technical progress is the most important determinant of output variability.
  15
     We thank Ricardo DiCecio for providing us with an updated version of this time series.

                                                    17
We generate 1000 model simulations with 230 periods each. For each simulation, we detrend
the logarithm of the relevant time series with the Hodrick-Prescott …lter using a smoothing

parameter of 1600. In our main calibration we consider a setting in which agents receive
noisy news about the future. Our measure of news is based on the Livingston survey of
output forecasts.16 The Livingston survey pools professional forecasters to obtain forecasts of

di¤erent economic variables. Two-quarter ahead GDP forecasts are available for the period
1971.IV – 2003.IV. To study the robustness of the results to di¤erent assumptions about
the timing of information arrival, we simulate the model under two additional information

scenarios. In the …rst scenario agents receive no news. In the second scenario agents receive

perfect information about zti .


Noisy News Forecasts of future rates of investment-speci…c technical change are not avail-

able for our sample, so it is di¢ cult to choose the precision of signals about "t+2 . For this

reason, we consider a setting in which we provide agents with a signal, S y , for whether the

growth rate of output two periods later is going to be above or below the average. The signal

has two values, high (H) or low (L). We choose the signal to have the same precision as the

Livingston survey of output forecasts. To obtain a discrete signal with two possible values

we use the Tauchen and Hussey (1991) method to estimate a two-point Markov chain for

the Livingston survey forecasts. The precision of these forecasts is as follows:

                                y
(24)                        Pr(gt+2         Average(g y )jS y = H) = 0:70,
                                y
                            Pr(gt+2 < Average(g y )jS l = L) = 0:58,

       y
where gt+2 represents the growth rate of output at time t+2. The forecast precision is higher

in expansions than in recessions.17
       To provide agents in the model with a signal on output with the same precision as the
  16
     See Dean Croushore (1993) for a description of the Livingston survey. The Survey of Professional
Forecasters (SPF) is an alternative source of output growth forecasts for the U.S. economy. We also use SPF
forecasts to calibrate our model. The results are similar to those we obtain with the Livingston forecasts.
  17
     Using the Survey of Professional Forecasters, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh and Laura Veldkamp (2006) also
…nd that forecast precision is higher in expansions than in recessions.

                                                    18
Livingston survey forecast, we implement the following algorithm. First, we assume values
q1 and q2 for the following conditional probabilities:


                                Pr(S y = Hj"t+2 = H) = q1 ,

                                Pr(S y = Lj"t+2 = L) = q2 .


We simulate time series for "t and generate S y according to q1 and q2 . Agents receive these

signals and forecast "t+2 using both the signal and the current realization of "t :


                                        Pr(S y = ij"t+2 = H) Pr("t+2 = Hj"t )
            Pr("t+2 = HjS y = i; "t ) = X                                        .
                                           Pr(S y = ij"t+2 = j) Pr("t+2 = jj"t )
                                        j=H;L

We simulate the model and compute:

                                 y
                             Pr(gt+2       Average(g y )jS y = H),
                                 y
                             Pr(gt+2 < Average(g y )jS l = L).


We then revise the values of q1 and q2 until the precision of S y in the model coincides with

the precision (24) estimated in the data. We obtain q1 = 0:99 and q2 = 0:62.

    Column 5 of Table 2 shows the results for this version of the model. This model generates

business cycle moments that are similar to those in postwar U.S. data reported in column
1. Consumption, investment, and hours worked are procyclical. Investment is more volatile

than output, consumption is less volatile than output, and the volatility of hours is similar

to that of output. The model accounts for 64 percent of the standard deviation of output in
the data.


Robustness To understand the robustness of our results to di¤erent assumptions about

the timing of information arrival we consider two additional cases. In the …rst case agents
receive no news about the future. In the second case agents receive a perfect signal about
"t+2 .



                                                19
   Table 2 reports moments for U.S. data and model simulated data. These moments were
computed using data detrended with the HP …lter with a smoothing parameter of 1600.

Column 4 in Table 2 summarizes the business cycle properties of a version of our model in
which the economy receives no news. Forecasts of future values of "t are solely based on the
Markov chain (23). This version of the model generates business cycle moments that are

similar to those in the postwar U.S. data we report in column 1. Consumption, investment,
and hours worked are procyclical. Investment is more volatile than output, consumption is
less volatile than output, and the volatility of hours is similar to that of output. Column

6 of Table 2 summarizes the business cycle properties of our model when at time t agents

receive perfect signals about "t+2 , the growth rate of zt in two periods. This model generates

patterns of volatility and comovement that are similar to those of the model with no news.

   To summarize, Columns 4 and 6 show that the business cycle implications of our model

are robust to changes in the information structure of the shocks. Providing the economy with

news about the future does not alter the basic patterns of comovement or relative volatility of

the major macroeconomic aggregates. Therefore the business cycle properties of our model

are robust to the timing of information arrival. In contrast, the business cycle properties

of the neoclassical one-sector growth model depend heavily on the timing of information

arrival.


News and Volatility It is well known that in the past 60 years output volatility has
declined and output persistence has increased in virtually all developed countries. These

facts are documented for the U.S. in Table 2. Columns 2 and 3 provide statistics for the

U.S. for the period 1947-1982 and 1983-2003. The volatility of output declines from 1.88 in
the …rst sample to 0.97 in the second sample. The persistence of output, as measured by

the sum of the four estimated coe¢ cients in an AR(4) process for output, rises from 0.65 to

0.86.
   James Stock and Mark Watson (2003) document both the reduction in output volatility



                                              20
and the increase in persistence for the G7 countries and discuss several possible explanations,
including better monetary policy, changes in sectoral composition toward sectors with lower

volatility, and declines in the volatility of the shocks to the economy.
      Our model provides a complementary explanation for the volatility decline and persis-
tence increase. Advances in information technology have led to dramatic increases in the

volume of available data and in the ability to process these data. Let us assume that the
increase in information volume has made it easier to forecast the future. Under this as-
sumption, we can think of the increased volume of information as moving the economy

from Column 4 of Table 2 (no news) toward Column 6. An increase in the availability of

news makes it easier to forecast the future, thus reducing economic volatility and increasing

persistence.

      Evidence from the Livingston survey is consistent with the idea that business cycles

have become easier to forecast. The survey contains unemployment forecasts at a six-month

horizon from the fourth quarter of 1961 to the fourth quarter of 2003. The average absolute

percentage forecast error is 3.3 percent in the …rst part of the sample (1961.IV-1982.IV) but

only 1.5 percent in the second part of the sample (1983.I-2003.IV). Therefore, the forecast

error declined by 79 percent. This increase in forecast precision cannot be solely accounted for

by the reduction in unemployment volatility. The standard deviation of log(unemployment)

declined only by 23 percent between the …rst and the second part of the sample.


Recessions According to our estimated Markov chain, (23), the rate of technical progress is

always positive. This Markov process is a good approximation to the behavior of investment-

speci…c technical progress in the data. Declines in zt are rare (they occur in only 6 percent
of the quarters in our sample) and small in magnitude. The average percentage decline in zt

in quarters in which zt falls is 0:8 percent.

      The absence of technical regress in our calibration raises the question of whether the
model can generate recessions.18 To study this question we …rst describe a simple method to
 18
      Robert G. King and Sergio Rebelo (1999) propose a real business cycle model that generates recessions


                                                     21
determine the timing of recessions. Our strategy is similar to that used by the Business Cycle
Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) for comparing

di¤erent recessions (see Robert Hall, Martin Feldstein, Je¤rey Frankel, Robert Gordon,
Christina Romer, David Romer, and Victor Zarnowitz (2003)). It is also reminiscent of the
methods used by Arthur Burns and Wesley Mitchell (1946) in their study of the properties

of U.S. business cycles.
    To date the beginning of U.S. recessions, we compute trend output using the HP …lter
with a smoothing parameter of 1600. We identify periods in which output is below trend for

at least two consecutive quarters, say t and t + 1. Recessions are dated as starting at time

t   1. This timing method produces recession dates that are similar to those chosen by the

NBER dating committee.19

    We compute the average time series for di¤erent macroeconomic variables during recession

periods for the U.S. economy. The solid line in Figure 6 shows the average behavior during

recessions of the HP-detrended logarithm of real GDP, real consumption of nondurables and

services, real private investment, and hours worked. Time zero is the quarter in which the

recession begins. The dashed lines represent the 95 percent con…dence interval around the

average for each variable. The fall from peak to trough in output, consumption, investment,

and hours is 1:8 percent, 0:7 percent, 4:3 percent, and 1:7 percent, respectively.

    The dashed line in Figure 6 shows the average recession in our model. The model captures
the salient features of recessions in the data. The last graph in this …gure, which displays the

behavior of investment-speci…c technical change in the average recession, shows an interesting
feature of the recessions generated by the model. On average, recessions occur when there
in the absence of negative technology shocks. Their model shares one key feature with our model, which is
variable capital utilization, but it relies on a much higher elasticity of labor supply.
  19
     The HP procedure produces six recessions whose starting dates coincide with those chosen by the NBER:
1948.IV, 1957.III, 1960.II, 1980.I, 1981.III, 1990.III. There are four other recessions in which the HP proce-
dure produces recession dates that are within two quarters of the NBER dates (indicated in parentheses):
1953.III (1953.II), 1969.III (1969.IV), 1974.II (1974.III), and 2001.II (2001.I). The HP procedure identi…es
four additional recessions starting in 1962.II, 1967.II, 1986.III, and 1994.III. None of the latter episodes
involves a fall in output, which suggests that our procedure corresponds to a broader de…nition of recession
than that of the NBER.



                                                     22
is a high contemporaneous rate of change in investment-speci…c technical progress but the
economy learns that two periods later technical change will slow down. It is impossible to

identify what causes recessions in our model by lining up the usual suspects–contemporaneous
shocks to the economy. Recessions are driven not by bad shocks today but by lackluster news
about the future. This property is generally not present in a version of the model in which

agents do not receive news about the future. In the no-news version of the model recessions
tend to coincide with periods in which the rate of investment-speci…c technical change is low.
   The model only generates nine recessions, as opposed to 14 in the data. In addition,

recessions are more shallow in the model that in the data. These two di¤erences between the

implications of the model and U.S. data occur in part because the U.S. economy is a¤ected

by shocks, such as oil shocks, that are absent from the model.


V.     Conclusion

Aggregate and sectoral comovement are central features of business cycles data. Therefore,

the ability to generate comovement is a natural litmus test for macroeconomic models. But

it is a test that most existing models fail. In this paper we propose a uni…ed model that

generates both aggregate and sectoral comovement in response to both contemporaneous

shocks and news shocks about fundamentals. The fundamentals that we consider are ag-

gregate TFP shocks, TFP shocks to the consumption and investment sector, and shocks to
investment-speci…c technical change. The model has three key elements: variable capital

utilization, adjustment costs to investment, and a new form of preferences that allows us

to parameterize the strength of short-run wealth e¤ects on labor supply. We …nd that, in
order for comovement to be robust to the timing and nature of the shocks that bu¤et the

economy, short-run wealth e¤ects on the labor supply must be weak.
