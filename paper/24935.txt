We introduce a novel survey measure of attitude toward debt. Matching our survey results with panel
data on Swedish household balance sheets from registry data, we show that our debt attitude measure
helps explain individual variation in indebtedness as well as debt build-up and consumption behavior
in the period 2004–2007. As an explanatory variable, debt attitude compares well to a number of other
determinants of debt, including education, risk-taking, and financial literacy. We also provide evidence
that debt attitude is passed down along family lines and has a cultural element.

1. Introduction


The purpose of this study is to shed more light on the microfoundations of household debt behavior.

Cross-country comparisons based on microdata indicate considerable heterogeneity in how

households in different countries use debt. For example, Bover et al. (2016, p.71) report that “nearly

half of all Dutch households hold secured debt, while only one in ten Italian households do. Debt-

to-income ratios of Austrian debtholders are three times smaller than those of Dutch households.”

Moreover, the level of indebtedness of households has increased markedly in the past two decades.

Understanding how households use debt is important for understanding macroeconomic dynamics.

A standard starting point for economic analysis of household debt is a life-cycle/permanent income

model in which debt is used to smooth consumption over the life cycle. However, this model and

its extensions, which include other motives to save, have not been able to explain the many findings

we observe in the data.


Our hypothesis is that, in addition to standard microfoundations, interpersonal differences in debt

attitude may play a role in how households use debt. Specifically, debt behavior may also reflect a

learned affective response that makes some individuals less inclined to take on debt.6 By affective

we mean a response to an object (debt) that reflects how the respondents feels about that object. To

dislike or be uncomfortable with something are examples of negative affective responses. In other

words, individuals may have different attitudes toward debt, with some having a more negative

attitude. Keep in mind that in many languages, the words for “debt” are often synonymous with

“sin” or “guilt,” and several religions, including Christianity and Islam, have condemned interest

on loans (Graeber, 2013).

 For an in-depth discussion of learned affective responses and other definitions of attitudes, see Fishbein and Ajzen
(1975).

                                                          2
Our study makes three contributions to the understanding of debt behavior. Our first contribution

consists of a novel survey measure of debt attitude. While a link between attitudes and debt has

previously been explored using data from the US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), our study

used a simpler and more general question that focuses on the subject’s affective response.

Compared to the question on the SCF, expressed in terms of whether it is a good idea to buy things

on an installment plan, and a related set of more specific questions that link debt to a particular

purpose, such as buying a car (see Chien and Devaney, 2001, for details), our measure avoids

contract-specific terms such as “installment plan” that risk confounding attitudes toward debt and

attitudes toward repayment. However, our survey also includes the SCF questions about using debt

for specific purposes, and we show that our general measures align well with these questions, too.

Another advantage of our work is that we collect data on a representative sample of Swedish

individuals, rather than on a small pilot sample or students. We find there is a good deal of

interpersonal variation in responses, and these differences in measured attitudes map to differences

in debt behavior. Specifically, those who are uncomfortable with debt have considerably lower

ratios of debt to income, 1.24 compared to 1.71. The difference is sizeable; on average, it is a bit

more than half a year’s disposable income. In addition, there are striking differences in debt

attitudes across age groups and between men and women.


Our second contribution is that, by combining the survey results with information from registry

data on household balance sheets, we are able to show that the variation in debt attitude help explain

variation in debt behavior. Variation in debt attitude also sheds some light on heterogeneity in the

evolution of households’ indebtedness over time. We use registry-based panel data on Swedish

household balance sheets covering the period 2004–2007, allowing us to accurately measure levels




                                                  3
of and changes in debt, and to impute consumption expenses using the residual method (e.g.,

Browning and Leth-Petersen, 2003; Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Vestman, 2015).


Sweden represents a good laboratory to study debt because, as one of the Nordic countries, it has

a relatively equal distribution of income. Notably, Swedish household debt as a share of disposable

income has nearly doubled in two decades, rising from about 90 percent in 1995 to about 180

percent in 2018,7 a debt build-up that may have macroeconomic implications (see, for example,

Mian and Sufi, 2018). In terms of the estimated effect size, our debt attitude measure compares

well with the effect of a number of important variables. For example, the coefficient estimate of

the debt attitude measure is of the same magnitude as the difference between respondents with only

an elementary education and those with a university education.


The third contribution of this paper is compelling evidence that the general debt attitude that we

measure is, at least in part, a cultural factor that is passed down along family lines.89 Specifically,

we study the intergenerational transmission of debt attitudes by asking survey respondents about

their parents’ attitudes toward debt. Parents play an important role in fostering learned responses

in their children, such as social norms (Maccoby, 1992). Parental attitudes have been found to

predict children’s savings beyond what is normally explained by demographics and income

(Knowles and Postlewaite, 2005). Other studies that have found support for intergenerational – and

  In many countries, governments or civil society have propagated social norms that encourage thrift (Garon, 2013).
9
  One way to think about such transmission is that debt attitudes may be similar to social norms, as opposed to the
fast-moving effect of social interactions (the latter have been examined in relation to debt by, for example,
Georgarakos et al., 2014). Intra-family correlations could also reflect genetic factors or correlated environmental
factors other than culture. Recent research using data on adopted children and their biological and adoptive parents,
to separate genetic from environmental effects, has found that environmental influences are important for financial
saving behavior (Black et al., 2019). Our data do not allow us to disentangle these influences at the individual level.

                                                           4
cultural, as opposed to purely biological – transmission of economic preferences include Fernàndez

et al. (2004), Dohmen et al. (2012), and Alan et al. (2017).


Recent research has addressed links between culture and debt in a household portfolio context

based on cross-country comparisons (Breuer et al., 2012). This research aligns with ours in that it

points to substantial cross-country variation in the composition of household portfolios, including

the use of debt, when controlling for institutional differences (Bover et al., 2016) and when

comparing individuals with similar characteristics (Christelis et al., 2013). A related strand of

research examines the financial decision making of first- and second-generation immigrants. Early

studies (e.g., Carroll et al., 1994) found little support for a link between immigrants’ cultural origins

and financial decision making but recognized that this may have reflected data limitations. Recent,

data-rich work finds stronger links. For example, Haliassos et al. (2017) compare the financial

behavior of non-immigrant Swedish households to that of immigrant households, grouped by

cultural dimensions, and find differences in financial behavior between immigrant groups and

Swedish households. Similarly, Fuchs-Schündeln et al. (2017) study the saving behavior of second-

generation immigrants and how those behaviors relate to the attitudes and beliefs in the respective

countries of origin. They find second-generation immigrants from countries that value thrift and

wealth accumulation tend to save more in the host country. By linking parents to their children,

they also show that these attitudes are related to the saving behavior of both parents and children.

Guin (2017) examines the role of culture on household saving decisions by looking at historical

language borders within Switzerland. He shows that households located in the German-speaking

region are much more likely to save than similar households in the French-speaking region.


A motivation for relating personal finance to culture is the large observed differences between

countries, for example in terms of credit arrangements (Badarinza et al., 2016). Differences in

                                                   5
credit market development or tax rules are unlikely to fully explain large cross-country differences

in, for example, credit card use, the pervasiveness of mortgages, or the dominance of adjustable or

fixed rate mortgages (Campbell, 2013).


Our main results are as follows: A high percentage of respondents in our sample (56 percent) report

that they are uncomfortable with debt; thus, this attitude is widespread and can play an important

role. General debt attitude helps explain individual variation in debt levels, even after accounting

for a rich set of observable characteristics from both survey and registry data. Individuals who

report being uncomfortable with debt have lower debt-to-income ratios. On average, the difference

in debt-to-income correlated with being uncomfortable with debt is about one half of annual

disposable income. General debt attitude also helps explain individual variation in debt build-up

and consumption in the period 2004–2007. Individuals who report being uncomfortable with debt

consume less than other individuals. As further evidence of the importance of this attitude, we

found there is a strong correlation between respondents’ and parents’ attitudes toward debt,

suggesting a cultural component to debt attitude that is transmitted along family lines. The

correlation is stronger for respondents that report discussing personal finances with their parents.


We also find that foreign-born respondents are considerably more likely to be uncomfortable with

debt, controlling for socioeconomic variables. This lends further support to the view that there is a

cultural component to debt attitude (see also Haliassos et al., 2017). Our analysis is not intended to

be a rejection of the standard theory of consumption and saving but, rather, an extension. Allowing

for preference heterogeneity (Gomes and Michaelides, 2005; Vestman, 2018) or varying levels of

financial literacy (Lusardi, Michaud and Mitchell, 2017) gives rise to richer patterns of saving and

borrowing than can be explained by the standard life-cycle model alone. Our results suggest that



                                                  6
debt attitudes, in addition to reasons that include liquidity constraints and impatience, may help to

explain why households do not always smooth consumption over the life cycle.


The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a short description of our survey, while the

registry-based data that we used is described in section 3. Descriptive statistics are provided in

section 4, and in section 5, we report the findings from our empirical analysis. In section 6, we

perform a set of robustness checks. In section 7, we provide concluding remarks.


2. The survey

We collected our data in the fall of 2014 using a telephone survey carried out by Statistics

Sweden.10 The survey was targeted at individuals, rather than households, and participation was

not conditional on being the household’s main financial decision maker. The sample is

representative of the Swedish population age 25–7511 and it consists of 390 men and 454 women

(46 and 54 percent, respectively); Table 1 in the online appendix reports mean values of the main

variables in the sample.


Survey questions

The survey we designed contains a set of new questions not commonly present in national surveys,

including questions about attitudes toward debt. To measure general debt attitude we first sought

to elicit respondents’ affective response to debt by using the following question:




10
   The survey was commissioned by the authors and paid for through research grants from the Swedish Science
Council, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Agency, and the European Investment Bank. The survey was carried out
by Statistics Sweden through a subcontractor (Mind Research AB). One of the survey’s objectives is to better
understand household debt behavior.
11
   The sample was generated using the registry for the total population, which contains 6.1 million individuals in the
chosen age span. A total of 2,004 individuals were drawn from ten strata based on age and gender. Thirty-five of these
individuals were excluded (due to incarceration, etc.), resulting in a sample of 1,969 individuals. For each of these
individuals, at least twelve attempts to establish contact were made during eight weeks between September and
November 2014. After this time period, 844 individuals had responded.

                                                          7
     •   Do you feel uncomfortable with having debt?

This is a simpler, more general debt attitude measure than the question that was, for a time, included

in the SCF, which asks whether it is a good idea to buy things on an installment plan. Contract-

specific terms such as “installment plan” risk confounding attitudes toward debt with preferences

for repayment.


A related issue is whether people consider it appropriate to borrow money for specific purposes.

Previous research indicates that attitudes toward debt depend in part on what the debt is used for

(Chien and Devaney, 2001). We asked five questions, closely based on questions asked in the 1998

US Survey of Consumer Finances, about whether survey participants consider it appropriate to

borrow money for different purposes (see Table 1a). 12


At the policy level, there has been widespread concern that many Swedish mortgage holders do not

pay down the principal on their mortgages, or do so very slowly (Finansinspektionen, 2015), thus

carrying mortgage debt for a long period, possibly over their entire life cycle. We included a

question about the importance of paying down the principal, which is related de facto to debt (see

Table 1a for the full description of the list of possible answers):13


     Which one of the following statements do you think best describes how a person with a

     mortgage should handle their mortgage loan?

Our survey also contains a number of questions about intergenerational transmission of financial

knowledge and attitudes, i.e., to what extent these may be passed on within a family. This



12
   The only difference is in the first question, which in the 1998 SCF specified buying a fur coat or jewelry. We changed
the wording slightly because, while the objects are intended as a proxy for luxury goods in general, responses could
simply reflect opposition to fur coats. See Chien and Devaney (2001).
13
   If many respondents report that it is not important to pay off a mortgage, this provides further motivation for our
approach to measuring general debt attitudes, which does not mention the terms of repayment.

                                                           8
information helps explains where attitudes toward debt may come from. First, we asked about the

general debt attitude of survey participants’ parents:


   •   Would your mother/father say that she/he feels uncomfortable with debt, or if she/he is

       deceased, would she/he have said that she/he felt uncomfortable with debt?

Respondents were only asked about one parent; in other words, they were asked about either their

mother or father. The gender was randomized. Asking about only one gender reduces sample size

in each cell but may be important to reduce bias if the answer about one parent is anchored by the

answer about the other parent.


Finally, to get a sense of the extent to which people discuss personal financial matters with their

family members compared to colleagues and friends, respondents were asked the following

questions:


   •   Do you often discuss personal financial matters with your family?

   •   Do you often discuss personal financial matters with friends and acquaintances?

   •   Do you often discuss personal financial matters with colleagues?

We also asked a number of questions related to personal finances, including measures of risk

aversion, long-term savings, and financial literacy (see the survey questionnaire in the online

appendix).



3. Registry data


We match individuals in the survey to registry-based data. Doing so allows us to shed more light

on who is uncomfortable with debt. It also allows us to link our survey measure of general debt

attitude to actual debt, consumption, and saving behavior.

                                                  9
Statistics Sweden provided detailed information on individuals’ balance sheets for 2003 to 2007.14

The debt value is observed per lender but contractual terms beyond the current value and the

interest expense paid in the year are not available. Statistics Sweden also provides information on

sociodemographic variables such as country of birth, gender, education, age, and disposable

income (gross labor income and pension income plus transfers minus taxes), which are important

control variables.


Based on this information, we constructed an imputed measure of consumption from the budget

constraint for each individual (Browning and Leth-Petersen, 2003; see also Koijen, Van

Nieuwerburgh, and Vestman, 2015). This enabled us to analyze the impact on consumption and

savings of differential debt behavior. What we measure is as follows:


𝑐"# + 𝑟"#& 𝑑"#() = 𝑦"# + 𝑎"#() (1 + 𝑟#/ ) − 𝑎"# + ℎ"#() 31 + 𝑟"#4 5 − ℎ"# − 𝑑"#() + 𝑑"# + 𝑦"#6    (1)


where the left-hand side denotes consumption expenses on goods and services and interest

expenses in year 𝑡, 𝑦"# denotes disposable income, 𝑎"#() (1 + 𝑟#/ ) − 𝑎"# denotes the savings flow

in financial assets in year 𝑡 , ℎ"#() 31 + 𝑟#4 5 − ℎ"# denotes the flow into housing (e.g., home

improvements), −𝑑"#() + 𝑑"# denotes the growth in debt, and 𝑦"#6 denotes additional sources of

capital income.


Using data from 2003 to 2007, we impute consumption from 2004 to 2007. For practical reasons,

we impose some sample restrictions. Transaction values of houses and apartments, returns on

housing, and home improvements are not measured accurately in our data set so we exclude

individuals in 𝑡 if they change housing tenure status between 𝑡-1 and 𝑡 or if a homeowner changes



14
 See Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Vestman (2015) and Vestman (2019) for basic information about the Swedish
wealth data set.

                                                    10
primary address. With these restrictions in place, we choose to set ℎ"#() (1 + 𝑟"#4 ) − ℎ"# = 0.15 In

total, we impute consumption in at least one year for 704 individuals, which amounts to 2324

individual-year observations, covering the period 2004–2007. Our baseline sample on debt and

other registry-based outcomes has 708 individuals and 2480 individual-year observations.16


4. Descriptive statistics


Our findings are striking: More than half of respondents in our sample (56 percent) report being

uncomfortable with debt (Table 1a). This is a high proportion, showing that our debt attitude

measure has the potential to play an important role. We also note a gender difference in comfort

with debt: Women are more likely than men to be uncomfortable with debt.


Table 1a about here


Table 1a also shows that respondents’ attitudes toward debt are dependent on the purpose of the

debt. For example, most respondents consider debt to be OK for buying a car or for educational

purposes, but very few (6%) consider it OK to cover household expenses. Thus, some respondents

may not follow the dictate of the life cycle model, if consumption smoothing may involve taking

on debt. Regarding management of mortgage loans, the large majority of respondents (84 percent)

consider it appropriate to pay down the principal. Respondents who are uncomfortable with debt

are less likely to consider it OK to take on debt for various purposes. 17 Respondents who are



15
   In addition, we follow Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Vestman (2015) and exclude, in each year, observations
that belong in the top and bottom one percent of disposable income and observations that are in the top and bottom
one percent of changes in net worth. We also exclude negative values of consumption. One difference to Koijen, Van
Nieuwerburgh, and Vestman (2015) is that we impute consumption at the level of the individual rather than at the
level of the household, which is likely to exacerbate the measurement error due, for instance, to intra-household
transfers.
16
   This is after excluding a few outliers on the debt-to-income ratio (values above 20).
17
   The exception is taking on debt to cover household expenses, where those who report being uncomfortable with
debt are slightly more likely to consider it OK.

                                                       11
uncomfortable with debt are also more likely to consider it appropriate to pay down the principal

on a mortgage (87 percent compared to 79 percent of those who are not uncomfortable; Pearson

chi-squared p<0.022).


Table 1b about here


When asked about the attitudes of their parents, 62 percent of respondents reported that their

parents are/were uncomfortable with debt, an even larger share than among the respondents

themselves. Figure 1 illustrates the observed cohort pattern by showing the share of respondents

reporting that they are uncomfortable with debt or that a parent was uncomfortable with debt (by

birth cohort of the respondent and the respondent’s parent, excluding those who responded “do not

know” or “do not want to answer”; we also report the 95% confidence intervals). Younger cohorts

are less likely to be uncomfortable with debt compared to older cohorts. While this suggests that

the share of the population that is uncomfortable with debt could be declining over time, our survey

data is cross-sectional and so does not allow us to distinguish between time and cohort effects.

Similarly, if we were to look across age (of respondents and parents), we could not disentangle age

from cohort effect.


Figure 1 about here


In the parents’ generation as well, mothers were less comfortable with debt than fathers; both male

and female respondents recognized that about their mothers (Table 1b). And like their mothers,

female respondents continue to be more uncomfortable with debt than male respondents. The large

majority (70 percent) of respondents in our sample reported discussing personal financial matters

with their family, while only 22 percent of respondents reported discussing personal financial

matters with friends and acquaintances, and an even smaller proportion (13 percent) reported


                                                12
discussing personal financial matters with colleagues. Interestingly, women are less likely to

discuss personal financial matters with colleagues; thus, family and intergenerational transmission

of attitudes toward debt can be quite influential for women. Conditional on having children, the

majority (about 58 percent) of respondents reported talking to them about personal financial

matters. We do not observe any substantial differences in the treatment of sons and daughters in

this regard, regardless of the sex of the respondent.18


Consistent with the notion of intergenerational transmission of attitudes, we observe a strong

correlation between the respondent being uncomfortable with debt and his/her parents’ attitude

toward debt (correlation = 0.401, p-value <0.0001). The correlation is stronger for those who

reported that they discuss, or discussed, personal financial matters with their parents (0.491,

compared to 0.344 for those who do not, or did not, discuss with parents). This lends further support

to the idea that financial attitudes may be transmitted intergenerationally from parents to children.19

The correlation with parents is much stronger for women (0.495, p-value <0.0001) than for men

(0.293, p-value <0.0001).20


Table 2 about here


Table 2 reports summary statistics of survey and registry-based variables for individuals who report

being comfortable with debt (columns 1 and 2) and uncomfortable with debt (columns 3 and 4).


18
   Females are more likely to discuss financial matters with their daughters (41%) compared to fathers with daughters
(35%), the difference is, however, not statistically significant (p-value=0.1076).
19
   Dividing this by gender of the respondent, we find that the correlation between females who report that they discuss,
or discussed, personal financial matters with their parents is 0.552, and 0.541 if they report that they do not, or did not,
discuss with their parent. The equivalent correlations among males are 0.412 and 0.229.
20
   Some of these findings mirror some of the results in the literature that investigates the intergenerational
transmission of risk preferences. For example, Alan et al. (2017) find that the risk preferences of mothers are
correlated with the risk preferences of daughters but not of sons. This is why it is important to account for risk
preferences in our empirical work.



                                                            13
Women and older respondents (people age 65–75) are more likely to report being uncomfortable

with debt. Consistent with debt attitudes having a cultural component, we find that respondents

that are foreign born or have at least one foreign-born parent are more likely to be uncomfortable

with debt. Respondents who are uncomfortable with debt have less education and lower disposable

income. They are less patient, have slightly lower levels of financial literacy (see Appendix Table

2, in the online appendix, for the measure of financial literacy used in our work), and report being

less willing to take risk compared to those who do not feel uncomfortable with debt. They also

have slightly lower disposable income, consumption, and real estate assets but the same amount of

net wealth and financial assets, indicating that less real estate wealth on the asset side of the balance

sheet is mirrored by less debt on the liability side.


Table 3 about here


Table 3 shows that debt attitude differences are related to differences in debt behavior. Seventy-

two percent of respondents who report that they are uncomfortable with holding debt have debt,

whereas 89 percent of respondents who report not being uncomfortable with debt have debt.

Similarly, we find that 48 percent of individuals who report being uncomfortable with debt hold a

mortgage whereas 72 percent of individuals who report not being uncomfortable hold a mortgage.

The difference in total debt between the groups is approximately 110,000 SEK, of which 43,000 is

non-mortgage debt. 21 There are also difference in these two groups regarding the number of

creditors’ contracts (2.03 versus 2.61) and debt-to-income ratio (1.24 versus 171). Interest expenses




21
  Information about an individual’s assets and liabilities were collected by the Swedish tax agency in order to calculate
the tax base for the wealth tax. The wealth tax was abolished in 2007, and as a result this information is no longer
available. Notice that our registry data is dated prior to the survey, which makes our data format similar to Thustrup,
Kreiner et al. (forthcoming).

                                                           14
are higher (13,700 vs 8,700) for those who are not uncomfortable with debt, even among those who

do not have mortgages (5,900 vs. 3,500).


5. Regression results


To further investigate the impact and economic importance of our debt attitude measure, we also

perform a regression analysis. The starting point is an OLS regression with debt as the dependent

variable and a set of controls that are relevant to debt choice, as predicted by the life-cycle model.

We can write this as:


𝐷"# = 𝛽; + 𝛽) 𝑈" + 𝛽= 𝑋"# + 𝜋# +𝜀"#                             (2)


where 𝐷"# denotes our outcome variable for debt, 𝑈" is a dummy variable that indicates whether

the respondent is uncomfortable with debt, 𝑋"# is a set of covariates that determine debt holdings,

𝜋# are year fixed effects, and 𝜀"# is an error term. Our coefficient of interest is 𝛽) . If being

uncomfortable with debt has no effect on debt choice once we control for the socioeconomic

variables normally included in intertemporal models, we should find that 𝛽) = 0.


Table 4 about here


Table 4 reports our main results on debt behavior. The estimates reported in the first column show

a difference in the debt-to-income ratio of 0.62 between respondents that report being

uncomfortable versus comfortable with debt. Adding control variables only slightly reduces the

coefficient on being uncomfortable with debt, to 0.52. 22




22
  The coefficient on being uncomfortable continues to be statistically significant (p-value=0.002) if we estimate a
probit regression on the probability of having any debt using the same control variables as in column 2, Table 4. See
Appendix Table 3 in the online appendix.

                                                         15
In other words, even after controlling for socioeconomic variables including age, education, and

income, those who are uncomfortable with debt have considerably lower debt-to-income ratios.

Thus, our measure has an effect above and beyond, for example, education and risk preferences.

The difference is not trivial: on average, it represents a bit more than half a year’s disposable

income. The coefficient on our attitude measure is of the same magnitude as the difference between

respondents with an elementary education and those with a university education (the latter have

higher debt to income ratios), or equivalent to going from the lowest value to the highest value on

our measure of risk-taking (scale 0–10). Aside from debt attitude, age appears to be a strong driver

of debt to income ratios. Our estimates suggest a hump-shaped pattern, consistent with life-cycle

smoothing.23


Some of the variables included in the regressions, for example financial literacy or disposable

income, may be endogenous. We do not have good instruments to account for that endogeneity.

However, the purpose of this descriptive analysis is to show that our measure is able to explain

debt, even after accounting for an extended version of the life-cycle model and adding many

controls to our regression analysis.


The years 2004–2007 marked a steady rise in housing prices and a build-up of household debt in

Sweden. Column (3) of Table 4 indicates that individuals who are uncomfortable with debt

increased their debt-to-income ratios by 0.12 less in each year. This corresponds to an increase of

8 log points per year (column (4)). It also amounts to a difference in debt growth of SEK 10,400




23
  We have also estimated the correlation between the parents’ level of indebtedness and respondent reports of whether
the parent is uncomfortable or not with debt. We find that fathers and mothers who are uncomfortable with debt also
have statistically significantly lower levels of indebtedness. Findings are not reported in a table but available upon
request.

                                                         16
per year (column (5)), or 7 log points per year (column (6)). Cumulatively, the difference amounts

to SEK 43,000 (column (7)).


Table 5 about here


Table 5 explores how the differences in debt behavior impact consumption and saving behavior,

using the decomposition in equation (1). Panel A reports estimates without any control variables.

Individuals who report being uncomfortable with debt consume SEK 36,200 less per year (column

(1)). Of this difference, SEK 6,200 can be attributed todifferences in interest expenses (column

(2)). Slightly more than half of the difference in consumption, i.e., SEK 22,800, is due to

differences in disposable income (column (3)). The remainder, SEK 12,000, is due to differences

in growth in debt (column (4)). In contrast, there are no substantial differences in financial savings

(column (5)) or capital income (column (6)) which indicates that our survey measure captures an

attitude toward debt rather than prudence. Panel B adds many control variables. While the

estimated effects of being uncomfortable with debt are smaller, the qualitative pattern is the same.
24




Table 6 about here


Table 6 reports differential changes to individuals’ balance sheets from 2004 to 2007. Individuals

who report being uncomfortable with debt increase their debt by SEK 10,400 less per year,

controlling for observable differences (including differences in disposable income). This lower rate

of growth in debt is almost perfectly matched in magnitude by a lower rate of growth in housing

wealth, though the difference is not statistically significant (column (3)). In contrast, there is no




24
     The patterns are also robust to controlling for disposable income (see Appendix Table 4 in the online appendix).

                                                           17
marked difference in accumulation of financial wealth (column (2)). Columns (4) to (6) report

growth rates over the entire 2004–2007 period and the estimates are qualitatively similar.


The above analysis rests on the assumption that debt attitude is exogenous to debt. If exposure to

debt, for example, through having a mortgage, makes individuals less uncomfortable with debt

over time, there could be causality in the reverse direction. One possible way to address

endogeneity is to use the attitude of an individual’s parents as an instrument for the individual’s

own preferences. The attitude of parents is outside of the control of the individual and, as reported

in Table 1a, there is a strong correlation between a respondent’s attitudes and the attitudes of his/her

parents. We use this instrument in the first three columns in Table 7. In addition, we consider other

specifications for the instrument based on which parent is uncomfortable and an interaction term

with gender in the remaining columns we also include a dummy for the respondent being foreign

born. The F-values from the first stage regressions indicate that the instrument(s) have predictive

power. The IV estimates indicate that the effect of the debt attitude continues to be negative (it is

statistically significant at the 10% level in three cases) and is even larger in magnitude than

indicated in the OLS regressions.


6. Robustness checks


We performed a number of robustness checks. Because we had to drop some observations in the

empirical regressions, we compared the sample used in the regressions compare with the original

sample and find that the composition is very similar (see Appendix Tables 5 and 6 in the online

appendix). Moreover, because the question about parents’ debt attitudes is asked of the respondent

and not of the parent directly, one may worry that respondents’ answers do not accurately reflect

the attitude of his or her parents or conform to his or her view. Note, however, that a number of



                                                  18
respondents who indicate that they themselves are not uncomfortable with debt indicate that their

parents were uncomfortable with debt, and vice versa. Moreover and importantly, we are able to

look at the debt of parents in addition to the debt of the respondent. In Appendix Table 7 in the

online appendix, we show that the attitude of parents does explain some of the variation in the

parents’ debt behaviour. Thus, this variable has predictive power in the expected way.


To show that our measure is not capturing other respondent characteristics, such as preference for

risk, we also perform a “placebo test” and an OLS regression, as in Table 4, but using stock market

participation as the dependent variable (proxied by whether the respondent reports having directly

held stocks).    Appendix Table 8 in the online appendix shows that, as expected, being

uncomfortable with debt is not related to stock market participation.


Finally, to further explore how debt attitude varies by culture, we look at foreign-born respondents.

In Appendix Table 9 in the online appendix, we shows that foreign-born respondents are more

likely to be uncomfortable with debt compared to non-foreign born respondents, even when we

control for many of the demographic characteristics considered in the OLS regressions. Thus, our

measure may be related to culture and thus may point to the importance of culture in explaining

differences in financial behavior, as in Haliassos et al. (2017).


7. Conclusions


We introduce a simple and novel measure of general attitude toward debt. We find that many people

report being uncomfortable with debt, and this attitude helps explain debt behavior. While our

reduced form framework explains only some of the observed differences in debt behavior, the

general debt measure has an impact similar to education or risk taking. In addition, we find a strong

correlation between the debt attitudes of respondents and their parents, which suggests that there


                                                  19
is a cultural component to debt attitudes that is transmitted from one generation to the next, along

family lines. That foreign-born respondents are much more inclined to respond that they are

uncomfortable with debt lends further support for there being a cultural element to debt attitudes.


Our results are related to an extensive literature on the determinants of household intertemporal

behavior. In a survey of economic research on saving behavior, Browning and Lusardi (1996)

identify nine different motives for saving. The list blends standard economic motivations related

to consumption smoothing with motivations of a more psychological nature, such as greed. Many

of these motives seem relevant for debt choices, too. Clearly, many debt choices can be motivated

by the desire to smooth consumption, manage short-term shocks, or make productive investments

(for example, in human capital). But here, too, psychology can be expected to play a part. For

example, some individuals may borrow because they are tempted to; i.e., they lack self-control.

Our findings suggest an additional determinant: that people may decide to save or may refrain from

borrowing because they have a learned, affective response to debt that makes them less disposed

to take it on.


Our line of enquiry is related to the question of whether individual debt choices may be affected

by social norms. Previous economic research has linked social norms to decision areas such as

consumption patterns (Elster, 1989) or work effort (Lindbeck and Nyberg, 2006). Our analysis

takes a small step toward extending this analysis to household debt, but without testing the social

norm hypothesis directly. Our line of enquiry is similar in spirit to the analysis by Thustrup Kreiner

et al. (forthcoming), which has rich data on economic outcomes. Our analysis contributes to the

literature with a novel and more direct measure of financial attitudes and their correlation across

generations.



                                                 20
While certain social norms, such as those against cheating or free-riding, may mitigate moral

hazard or time inconsistency problems, resulting in more efficient outcomes, social norms that

discourage borrowing are not by definition good or bad. If not managed properly, debt can lead to

financial distress, (Lusardi and Tufano 2015), so a social norm that causes individuals to take on

less debt could be welfare improving. At the aggregate level, there might be negative externalities

from high household debt, for example through increased financial and macroeconomic

vulnerabilities (Mian and Sufi, 2018).


Our findings relate to the literature of the effect of culture on financial behavior (Haliassos et al.,

2017; Fuchs-Schundeln et al., 2017; and Guin, 2017) by indicating that debt behaviour can be

influenced by culture.


Our findings may have implications for research that aims to develop a better understanding of

economic inequality and gender differences as drivers of financial behavior. If families play an

important role in passing on social norms that shape debt attitudes, then families also contribute to

intergenerational persistence in economic outcomes. A large body of research has documented such

persistence (see, for example, Björklund and Jäntti, 2009), finding that family background explains

from one-fifth to one-half of the variance in long-run income (Corak, 2013).


Household debt is an important issue in many countries, and it is important that we improve our

understanding of its determinants. Our finding that debt attitudes may be one such determinant

should not be interpreted as a rejection of the standard theory of consumption and saving, but as an

indication that further research on debt attitudes might be a fruitful way to shed light on elements

of debt choice that are not captured well by a simple consumption-savings model. We encourage

further research in this area.

Standard errors are clustered at the individual level and are given in parentheses. The regressions in columns 1-3 also include year fixed
effects p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. Debt, financial assets, and real estate assets are defined as the yearly market values as given by the
individual tax records. Observations with a debt to income ratio above 20 are excluded. Yes, Uncomfortable is a 0/1 variable for the respondent
being uncomfortable with debt where yes=1 and no=0. Female is a dummy variable for being female (1=female, 0=male). Education is
measured by three dummy variables (elementary schooling, high school, university schooling [omitted category]). Age is divided into five
dummy age categories (25–34 is the omitted category). Disposable Income is the yearly disposable income divided by 10 000 SEK and is
comprised of the sum of labor income, social benefits, and transfers. Subjective Risk (0–10) refers to responses to “Do you see yourself as a
person who is fully prepared to take risks? Indicate your response on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 means “not at all willing to take risks” and
10 means “very willing to take risks.” Patience refers to a yes response to the question “As of today, do you have any personal long-term
savings?” Basic and advanced financial literacy are measured as the number of correct answers to each category of financial literacy,
respectively; see Appendix Table 2 for further description.

Household debt in Sweden
Many Swedish households use debt to invest in human capital or purchase a home, in particular
through publicly provided student loans and privately provided mortgages. About half of the
working age population has a mortgage, and the likelihood of having a mortgage increases with
education and income.25 The aggregate debt-to-income ratio has risen from about 80 percent of
disposable income in 1970 to about 180 percent of disposable income in 2018, which is higher than
in most European countries. High and rising household indebtedness has been identified as a
symptom of vulnerability of the Swedish economy by the IMF and the OECD as well as the
Riksbank and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Agency. The increase in debt has prompted
macroprudential measures, including a loan-to-value cap of 85 percent for mortgages, which was
introduced in 2010, and an amortization requirement for households, introduced in 2016.

The high indebtedness of Swedish households is a modern phenomenon—well into the 20th
century, households mainly used banks to make deposits, not to get loans. 26 Government
intervention in credit markets sought to ensure that households’ deposits were channeled into
financing the agriculture and industry sectors and to encourage household thrift. Indeed, Sweden
has a long history of public moralizing about consumption and saving decisions. In the 17th and
18th centuries, the state issued a number of edicts prohibiting excessive consumption, in part with
a mercantilist motive to reduce imports. In the 19th century, an ideal of frugality was depicted as
part of Swedish cultural identity. Such reasoning continued into the 20th century with the growth
of savings banks and the cooperative movement. The postwar period saw an expansion of lending
to households, in particular to purchase homes. The government also took on an increasingly active
role in providing credit to households. Between 1930 and 1960, lending to Swedish households for
the construction, improvement, or acquisition of homes increased tenfold. Moreover, the
government took a more active role to provide households with loans for investment in human
capital. Government-sponsored student loans, first introduced in 1919, expanded rapidly beginning
in the 1960s. Following rapid deregulation of credit markets in the second half of the 1980s, rapid
credit growth ensued, and household debt increased from 100 to 130 percent of disposable income
in just four years. This came to a stop during the great banking crisis of the early 1990s, when
several banks became insolvent.

Today, lending to households constitutes a large share of the assets of the large Swedish banks,
while deposits from households make up only a minor share of these banks’ funding. The



25
     By contrast, unsecured consumer credit constitutes less than one-tenth of Swedish households’ loans.

this dramatic shift is the main motivation for this work.
