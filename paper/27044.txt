Asset Prices and Aggregate Demand in a "Covid-19" Shock: A Model of Endogenous Risk
Intolerance and LSAPs

                                                 ABSTRACT

In this paper we: (i) provide a model of the endogenous risk intolerance and severe aggregate demand
contractions following a large real (non-financial) shock; and (ii) demonstrate the effectiveness of
Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAPs) in addressing these contractions. The key mechanism stems
from heterogeneous risk tolerance: as a recessionary shock hits the economy and brings down asset
prices, risk-tolerant agents' wealth share declines and their leverage rises endogenously. This reduces
the market's risk tolerance and generates downward pressure on asset prices and aggregate demand.
When monetary policy is unconstrained, it can offset the decline in risk tolerance with an interest rate
cut that boosts the market's Sharpe ratio. However, if the interest rate policy is constrained, new contractionary
feedbacks arise: recessionary shocks lead to further asset price and output drops, which feed the risk-off
episode and trigger a downward loop. In this context, LSAPs improve asset prices and aggregate demand
by transferring risk to the government's balance sheet, which reduces the market's required Sharpe
ratio. Optimal LSAPs are larger when the (consolidated) government has greater future fiscal capacity
and the downward spiral is more severe. In an extension, we show how corporate debt overhang problems
strengthen our mechanisms. The Covid-19 shock and the large response by all the major central banks
provide a vivid illustration of the environment we seek to capture.

 1.     Introduction
The Covid-19 shock is primarily a real (non-…nancial) shock with supply and demand elements.
However, the shock also generated a large reaction in …nancial markets that had the potential to
signi…cantly exacerbate the direct drop in aggregate demand caused by the real shock. Figure
1 illustrates that the (implied) stock market volatility spiked to levels comparable to the global
…nancial crisis of 2008–2009. Other indicators of …nancial distress exhibited similar patterns—
e.g., investment grade and high yield spreads tripled, and the S&P 500 dropped by 30% in a
matter of weeks (a drop, per unit time, larger than the worst drop during the Great Depression).
The Fed (with the backing of the Treasury) had to pledge close to 20% of US GDP in funding
for a wide range of credit and market supporting facilities to stop the free fall.1 Central banks
in the Group of Seven countries purchased $1.4 trillion of …nancial assets in March alone. The
…nal story is yet to be told.
   1
    Here is a brief chronology of the Fed’s main policy actions since early March until April 9th: On 03/03,
implements a 50bps emergency rate cut; on 03/12, adds repos of up to $500b/week, purchases wider range of
securities under current $60b/month program; on 03/15, cuts rates by 100bps to zero and initiates QE bond buying
program of $700b, lowers swap lines with major central banks by 25bps; on 03/17, establishes a commercial paper
funding facility to provide stability to short-term CP market; on 03/19, launches USD liquidity-swap lines with
a broad range of countries, including major Emerging Markets; on 04/09, implements $2.3t emergency measures,
among them a $500b Municipal Liquidity Facility for state and local governments, a $600b Main Street Lending
program, and a Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility for small businesses; expands the Primary and
Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities and the term loan facility to buy ABS securities to $850b and
includes asset purchases of HY bonds, HY ETFs, CLOs, and CMBS securities. All other major central banks
around the world have also pursued unprecedented …nancial markets interventions.



                                                       1
       Motivated by these events, in this paper we: (i) provide a model of the endogenous risk
intolerance and severe aggregate demand contractions following a large real shock; and (ii)
demonstrate the e¤ectiveness of Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAPs) in addressing these con-
tractions.
       Our model builds on a two-period version of the macroeconomic model in Caballero and
Simsek (2020b). That model is a variant of the New Keynesian model, but formulated in terms
of a risk-centric decomposition. Speci…cally, there we decompose the demand block of the equi-
librium into two relations: an output-asset price relation that captures the positive association
between asset prices and aggregate demand; and a risk balance condition that describes asset
prices given risks, risk attitudes, beliefs, and the interest rate. This decomposition facilitates
the study of the macroeconomic impact of a variety of forces that a¤ect risky asset prices.2 In
the current model, we extend that analysis by splitting investors into risk-tolerant and risk-
intolerant agents— we dub the risk tolerant agents “banks” (interpreted broadly to include the
shadow …nancial system and other agents able/willing to hold substantial risk) and the risk in-
tolerant agents “households”(also interpreted broadly). The key implication of this assumption
is that banks are levered in equilibrium, and therefore are highly exposed to aggregate shocks
and the sequence of events that these shocks may trigger.3
       To …x ideas, consider a large negative supply shock (e.g., the supply component of the Covid-
19 shock).4 This shock exerts downward pressure on risky asset prices (which include credit,
equity, real estate, as well as other assets). As banks incur losses, their leverage rises. With
higher leverage, banks require a higher Sharpe ratio (risk premium per unit of risk) to hold the
same amount of risky assets. Risk-intolerant households also require a higher Sharpe ratio to
hold the risky assets unloaded by banks wishing to reduce their leverage. Both of these channels
lead to a rise in the market’s required Sharpe ratio.
       As a benchmark, suppose that the banks’ initial leverage is not too high and the supply
shock is temporary. In this case, a small decline in asset prices may be all that is needed to
increase the Sharpe ratio as much as the market demands. Asset prices and aggregate demand
are relatively high and the natural interest rate (“rstar”) may not decline. Intuitively, supply is
temporarily low but asset prices and demand per unit of current supply are not necessarily low,
as investors expect a speedy recovery.
   2
      The decomposition is suported by a growing empirical literature that shows risky asset prices can substantially
a¤ect aggregate demand. See Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) on the e¤ect of credit spreads on investment and
consumption; Mian and Su… (2014) and Chodorow-Reich et al. (2019) on the e¤ect of house and stock prices,
respectively, on consumption and (nontradable) employment; P‡ueger et al. (forthcoming) on the e¤ect of …nancial
market risk perceptions on economic activity and interest rates.
    3
      Moreover, banks’leverage and exposure can be indirect. For example, the US entered the Covid-19 shock with
well capitalized (regular) banks and highly indebted corporations. However, to the extent that banks had lent to
these highly levered corporations, banks themselves are highly levered with respect to large aggregate shocks. It
is no accident that on 04/14/2020 JPMorgan Chase announced its highest loan-loss provision in a decade. Since
then, all other major banks have made similar announcements in their earnings reports.
    4
      As we show in Section 2, adding a demand shock exacerbates our main results. We chose to focus on the
supply component of the Covid-19 shock because it allows us to isolate the endogenous component of the aggregate
demand contraction.


                                                         2
   In contrast, we focus on scenarios in which banks’ initial leverage is high (or the supply
shock is su¢ ciently large). In this case, even a temporary supply shock greatly reduces e¤ective
risk tolerance and increases the required Sharpe ratio. This higher required Sharpe ratio exerts
substantial downward pressure on asset prices and aggregate demand, and reduces “rstar.”The
decline in risk tolerance overwhelms the expected recovery e¤ect and induces a disproportionate
decline in demand that exceeds the decline in supply. When the supply shock is more persistent,
the downward pressure on asset prices is stronger and the (negative) gap between aggregate
demand and supply becomes even greater.
   The …rst line of defense is conventional monetary policy that cuts the interest rate (consistent
with lower “rstar”). Cutting interest rates provides the market with the greater Sharpe ratio
that it requires and relieves the downward pressure on asset prices. Asset prices and aggregate
demand decline in proportion to the reduction in supply but no more. However, if the interest
rate is constrained, then asset prices decline beyond the reduction in supply. Lower prices
provide the market with a greater Sharpe ratio but they also generate a demand recession:
output falls beyond the reduction in potential output. To make matters worse, the decline in
asset prices further reduces the banks’ wealth share (and raises their leverage), which further
increases the required Sharpe ratio and depresses asset prices, triggering a downward spiral. We
show that, when banks’initial leverage is su¢ ciently high, the feedback between asset prices and
risk intolerance becomes so strong that multiple equilibria are possible. In the worst of these
equilibria, banks go bankrupt.
   This description of events suggests that policies where the consolidated government (e.g.,
the Fed and the Treasury in the U.S.) absorbs some of the risk that banks are struggling to
hold can be highly e¤ective. We loosely refer to these policies as large-scale asset purchases
(LSAPs). We show that, by transferring risk to the government’s balance sheet, LSAPs reduce
the market’s required Sharpe ratio. This improves asset prices and aggregate demand and
mitigates the recession. Moreover, LSAPs are powerful because they reverse the downward
spiral. In particular, when the aggregate demand ampli…cation of the supply shock is severe,
the government might …nd it optimal to deploy LSAPs even if it is less risk tolerant than
the market. The government optimally chooses larger LSAPs when it has greater future …scal
capacity. In the Covid-19 episode, the spike in VIX began to reverse immediately after the
major central banks’policy actions (Figure 1 and Footnote 1), which suggests the interventions
were e¤ective in containing the initial downward spiral.
   Finally, we extend the model to show how …rms’debt overhang problems interact with our
risk-centric mechanism. The corporate debt overhang problem creates a feedback between asset
prices and productivity. This feedback makes the market’s e¤ective risk tolerance (and hence the
required Sharpe ratio) more sensitive to asset prices, which in turn strengthens our ampli…cation
mechanism as well as the e¤ectiveness of LSAPs.
   Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 shows how LSAPs operate in this environment.
Section 4 presents an extension with debt overhang. Section 5 concludes. Appendix A contains

    Literature review. At a methodological level this paper adopts the risk-centric perspective
in Caballero and Simsek (2020b,a). The novel ingredient is that the supply shock endogenously
lowers risk tolerance. The mechanism of endogenous leverage and asset price spirals is also
central in He and Krishnamurthy (2013); Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014).5 Their focus is
on the …nancial frictions on the supply side of the economy rather than on the heterogeneity
of investors’portfolios and the feedback loops with aggregate demand when monetary policy is
constrained. Also related is Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009), who show how the endogenous
leverage of the US economy caused by the global demand for safe assets creates instability with
respect to supply shocks, but they do not discuss the role of aggregate demand and central bank
policy.
    While they do not look at the e¤ect of large real shocks, the mechanism in Kekre and Lenel
(2020) is close to ours. In particular, they calibrate a model in the spirit of Caballero and Simsek
(2020b) and show the power of monetary policy in a¤ecting the risk premium when agents have
heterogeneous risk tolerance. Similarly, Caballero and Farhi (2018) show that when a large
share of wealth is allocated to extremely risk-intolerant agents (Knightians) in a New Keynesian
framework with a zero lower bound on interest rates, the economy may fall into a “safety trap.”
Like our paper, they show that asset market policies where the government absorbs part of the
risk of the economy (and replace it with safe assets) can be highly e¤ective. However, their focus
is on the macroeconomic implications of a chronic scarcity of safe assets rather than on the role
of endogenous risk intolerance following a large real shock.
    In terms of whether demand factors can exacerbate the direct e¤ect of a supply shock, the
closest paper to ours is Guerrieri et al. (2020) (see also Baqaee and Farhi (2020); Bigio et al.
(2020)). They provide a clean decomposition of the ingredients needed for an a¢ rmative answer
in a two-period, deterministic model. They conclude that, in such a model, aggregate demand
cannot exacerbate the supply recession when the economy has a single sector, regardless of
whether markets are complete or incomplete. In contrast, they show that in a multi-sector
environment there are con…gurations of preference parameters where demand responds by more
than supply, especially if markets are incomplete. Our risk-based mechanism is orthogonal to
theirs. In fact, our model has a single sector.
    The Covid-19 shock has triggered a large response among macroeconomists. For example,
Eichenbaum et al. (2020); Faria-e Castro (2020) embed pandemic shocks and their constraints
on economic activity within DSGE models and study the role of …scal policy and di¤erent con-
tainment strategies. Baker et al. (2020) document the dramatic spike in uncertainty and study
its impact in a real business cycle model. Our analysis is complementary as we emphasize the
excessive aggregate demand contraction that results from supply shocks— which is exacerbated
by uncertainty— and we highlight the damage caused by the pricing of uncertainty. Fornaro

and Wolf (2020) provide a stylized New Keynesian model and capture the Covid-19 shock as a
decline in (exogenous and endogenous) expected growth. Their mechanisms and policy analysis
do not operate through endogenous spikes in risk intolerance and asset price spirals, which is
our focus. Correia et al. (2020) use the 1918 ‡u pandemic to empirically analyze the economic
costs of pandemics and …nd a role for both supply- and demand-side channels, consistent with
our analysis.6
    Our paper is also related to a growing empirical …nance literature that analyzes the drivers
of asset prices in the Covid-19 recession (e.g., Gormsen and Koijen (2020); Landier and Thes-
mar (2020); Ramelli and Wagner (forthcoming); Croce et al. (2020)). This literature typically
attributes the large decline and the subsequent recovery of risky asset prices in the Covid-19
recession to changes in the risk premium. From the lens of our model, the initial shock and its
ampli…cation increased the risk premium, whereas LSAPs helped to reduce it. In line with this
interpretation, the literature …nds that the central bank asset purchases had a large positive
impact on asset prices (Fed (2020); Cavallino and De Fiore (2020); Haddad et al. (2020)) even
in emerging markets (Arslan et al. (2020)).
    Finally, our policy analysis is related to a growing literature on the role of central bank asset
purchases in stimulating aggregate demand when conventional monetary policy is constrained.
Empirical evidence suggests these policies have a meaningful impact on asset prices (see Bernanke
(2020)) but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The literature emphasizes
either …nancial frictions (e.g., Gertler and Karadi (2011); Del Negro et al. (2017)), portfolio
balance e¤ects in segmented markets (e.g., Vayanos and Vila (2009); Ray (2019)), or signaling
e¤ects (see, e.g., Bhattarai et al. (2015)). The mechanism in our paper is di¤erent and relies on
the government’s ability to absorb aggregate risk using its future tax capacity in a non-Ricardian
model (see also Silva (2016)).7


 2.     A Model of Endogenous Risk Tolerance
We present a simple two period model that illustrates how a supply shock can reduce risk toler-
ance in …nancial markets and induce an aggregate demand contraction that ampli…es the supply
shock. Later on, we discuss how adding exogenous demand shocks (as in the case for Covid-19)
strengthens our results. The mechanism operates through heterogeneous risk tolerance: The
decline in asset prices due to the supply shock lowers the wealth share and increases the leverage
of risk-tolerant agents. As these agents attempt to lower their exposure to risk, the e¤ective risk
tolerance declines and reduces asset prices and aggregate demand. The demand-induced decline
   6
     There are also several papers that embed SIR type epidemiological models into macroeconomic models and
study the optimal containment policy that balances health concerns and economic costs (e.g., Alvarez et al. (2020);
Gourinchas (2020); Berger et al. (2020); Callum et al. (2020); Bethune and Korinek (2020)). We do not address
this important trade-o¤ and take as given the broad supply implications of the containment policies.
   7
     Our policy mechanism builds upon the extensive literature spurred by Holmström and Tirole (1998) on the
taxation power of the government to expand the supply of liquidity.

in asset prices further lowers the wealth share of risk-tolerant agents, and so on.

A two-period risk-centric aggregate demand model. Consider an economy with two
dates, t 2 f0; 1g, a single consumption good, and a single factor, capital. There is no investment
or depreciation and capital is normalized to one unit. We let zt denote the productivity of capital
in period t. Potential output is equal to productivity, zt , but actual output can be below this
level due to a shortage of aggregate demand, yt                           zt . We assume output is equal to its potential
at the last date, y1 = z1 , and focus on the endogenous determination of output at the previous
date, y0   z0 . We assume productivity at date 1 is uncertain and log-normally distributed,
                                                                                         2
                                                                                                    2
                                     log y1 = log z1             N        log z 1               ;       .                                  (1)
                                                                                        2

Note that z 1 captures the expected productivity, and                               captures its volatility.
    There are two types of assets. There is a “market portfolio” that represents claims to all
output (which accrue to production …rms as earnings), and a risk-free asset in zero net supply.
We denote the (ex-dividend) price of the market portfolio at date 0 with z0 Q0 , so that Q0
corresponds to the price per unit of productivity. We denote the log risk-free interest rate with
rf , and the log return of the market portfolio with

                                                                                z1
                                            r (z0 ; z1 ) = log                          .                                                  (2)
                                                                               z0 Q0

    There are two types of agents, i 2 fb; hg. Type b agents (“banks”) are more risk tolerant
than type h agents (“households”). Formally, agents have Epstein-Zin utility with risk aversion
parameters given by 1=       i   that satisfy      b   >        h.   We refer to            i   as agent i’s risk tolerance. Agents
also have common EIS equal to one (for simplicity), and common discount factor denoted by
e   .
    Agents are endowed with initial positions that satisfy:

                       ~b0 = max 0; ab0
                       a                                       ~h0 = min y0 + z0 Q0 ; ah0 ,
                                                           and a                                                                           (3)
                                      where
                       ab0       =     0 (y0   + z0 Q0 )             1+e               0 l0                                                (4)
                       ah0       = (1          0 ) (y0   + z0 Q0 ) + 1 + e                          0 l0 ,

                                      for some         0 ; l0   2 (0; 1) .

Eq. (4) describes banks’endowments and net wealth assuming they are not bankrupt. Banks
initially hold a fraction of the market portfolio,                       0,   and owe (1 + e                 )   0 l0   units of safe debt. We
have normalized these positions so that in the benchmark, de…ned as the case when there is no
demand recession (e¢ cient) and the supply shock is normalized to one, z0 = 1, banks’leverage
ratio (de…ned as their debt-to-asset ratio) is l0 . Households hold the mirror image positions:

                                                                     6
they hold the residual fraction of the market portfolio, 1                     0,   as well as banks’safe debt. Eq.
(3) adjusts agents’net wealth for the possibility of bankruptcy. When ab0 < 0, the value of banks’
assets is less than their outstanding debt. In this case, banks are bankrupt and their actual net
                ~b0 = 0. Households take over banks’assets and hold all of the market portfolio,
wealth is zero, a
                            ~h0 = y0 + z0 Q0 .
so their net wealth becomes a
      Given the initial endowments in (3), agents choose their consumption and new asset positions,
ci0   and ai0 , and what fraction of their assets to allocate to the market portfolio, ! i0 , with the
residual fraction invested in the risk-free asset. We formally state and solve the investors’
problem in the appendix. The assumption on the EIS implies that households spend a fraction
of their wealth,

                                                                                        a                       (5)

 Agents’optimal weight on the market portfolio is approximately given by
                                                                         2

This is a standard mean-variance portfolio optimality condition that says the risk of agents’
optimal portfolio (the left side) is proportional to the Sharpe ratio on the market portfolio (the
right side). This equation holds exactly in continuous time but only approximately in discrete
time. We assume the equation is exact to simplify the analysis.
      The asset markets clearing condition can be written as
                                              X
                                                    ! i0 ai0 = z0 Q0 .                                          (7)
                                               i

      The supply side of the economy is described by New Keynesian …rms that have …xed nominal
prices. These …rms meet the available demand at these prices as long as prices are higher than
their marginal cost. Output is determined by the aggregate demand for goods (consumption)
up to the capacity constraint,
                                                      X
                                              y0 =         ci0    z0 .                                          (8)
                                                       i

      Finally, we assume that the interest rate policy attempts to replicate the supply-determined
output level, subject to a lower bound constraint, rf                  0. Speci…cally, suppose monetary policy
follows a standard Taylor rule, rf = max (0;               (y0     z0 )). We focus on the limit           ! 1, in
which case this rule implies that either the interest rate is positive and output is at its potential,
rf = rf > 0 and y0 = z0 ; or the interest rate is constrained and there is a demand recession,
rf = 0 and y0       z0 . Here, rf denotes the natural interest rate consistent with potential output,
y0 = z0 [see Eq. (17) below].




                                                           7
Equilibrium characterization. We next characterize the equilibrium. Using Eq. (5), aggre-
gate consumption is a fraction of aggregate wealth,

                                                        1
                                               c0 =            (y0 + z0 Q0 ) .                                   (9)
                                                      1+e

Using y0 = c0 [cf. Eq. (8)], we obtain the following equation:

                                                       y0 = e z0 Q0 :                                          (10)

We refer to this equation as the output-asset price relation. This condition says that higher asset
prices increase aggregate wealth and consumption, which leads to greater output (see Remark
1 for discussion and various enrichments).
     Setting y0 = z0 in (10), we obtain the e¢ cient level of asset price per productivity as

                                                        Q =e         .                                         (11)

This is the asset price per unit of productivity that ensures the economy operates at the supply
determined level. If there is a supply shock that reduces z0 , asset prices should fall proportionally
to z0 Q , but no further. Any further reduction in asset prices would trigger a demand recession
as illustrated by (10).
     Next consider the characterization of the equilibrium asset price, z0 Q0 . To facilitate this
analysis, we de…ne banks’(post-z0 -shock) wealth share as

                                                                ab0
                                                         0           :
                                                               z0 Q0

                                                                     ah
Households’wealth share is the residual, 1                    0     z0 Q 0 .
                                                                       0
                                                                               Using this notation, we can write the
asset market clearing condition (7) as

                                                   b                   h
                                                 0!0   + (1        0) !0   = 1.                                (12)

The equilibrium asset price is determined by this condition together with agents’wealth shares,
 0; 1       0,   and their optimal portfolio weights, ! b0 ; ! h0 .
     To calculate the wealth shares, we use the output-asset price relation in (10) together with
agents’initial positions in (3) and their optimal saving rule in (5). For the banks’wealth share,
we obtain
                                                              l0                                 Q0
                              0   =   0 (z)   max 0; 1               0         where    z = z0      .          (13)
                                                              z                                  Q
To understand this expression, …rst consider the benchmark with Q0 = Q and the supply shock
normalized to one, z0 = 1. In this benchmark, z = 1 and banks’ wealth share is given by
 0   = (1        l0 )   0:   their initial assets net of their leverage. Now suppose asset valuations fall,


                                                              8
z = z0 (Q0 =Q ) < 1, either because of a decline in productivity, z0 , or a decline in the asset
price per productivity, Q0 . This causes banks’wealth share to fall below the benchmark (and
households’wealth share increases above the benchmark). Intuitively, since banks are levered,
a decline in asset valuations reduces their wealth more than it reduces households’wealth. This
mechanism will play an important role for our results. If asset valuations decline beyond banks’
initial leverage, z = z0 (Q0 =Q ) < l0 , banks are bankrupt and their wealth share falls to zero.
   To calculate the optimal portfolio weights, we use Eq. (6) together with the expected return
on the market portfolio from Eqs. (1              2) to obtain

                                                      log zz01           log (Q0 )       rf
                                      ! i0 =      i
                                                                                              .                   (14)

   Combining Eqs. (12        14), we arrive at the central equation of our analysis, the risk balance
condition:
                                                              log zz01     log (Q0 )          rf
                                                      =                                               :           (15)
                                          Q0
                                  0    z0 Q

Here,   0(   ) denotes the e¤ ective risk tolerance de…ned as

                                                      b                              h
                          0 (z)           0 (z)           + (1            0 (z))

                                                      h        h              l0                  b       h
                                  = max                   ;        + 1                   0                    .   (16)
                                                                              z

   Eq. (15) says that the risk the economy generates normalized by the e¤ective risk tolerance
(the left side) should be compensated by a su¢ ciently high reward for risk (the right side).
Speci…cally, the right side is the actual Sharpe ratio on the market portfolio: the risk premium
per unit of risk. In the rest of the paper, we refer to the expression on the left side as the
required Sharpe ratio, and note that the equilibrium in risk markets obtains when the required
and actual Sharpe ratios are the same.
   Eq. (16) illustrates that the e¤ective risk tolerance— which determines the required Sharpe
ratio— depends on a wealth-weighted average of investors’risk tolerances. The second line solves
                                                                          Q0
for the e¤ective risk tolerance and shows that it is increasing in z = z0 Q  . In particular, a decline
in asset prices— either through reduced productivity, z0 , or reduced valuation per productivity,
Q0 — reduces the e¤ective risk tolerance. Lower asset prices reduce banks’wealth share, which
lowers the e¤ective risk tolerance since          b   >         h.   If banks go bankrupt, the e¤ective risk tolerance
is the households’tolerance,                   h.
                                  0 (z)   =
   The equilibrium is then determined by the output-asset price relation (10), the risk balance
condition (15), and monetary policy.

Remark 1. The output-asset price relation can also be interpreted as a reduced form for various
channels that link asset prices and aggregate demand. For example, suppose we split consumers
(and income) between our agents (share                        ) and a group of hand-to-mouth consumers (share


                                                                     9
1    ). Then, Eq. (9) becomes

                                     c0 =               (y0 + z0 Q0 ) + (1               ) y0 .
                                            1+e

Using y0 = c0 , we once again obtain Eq. (10). In Caballero and Simsek (2020b) we show that
adding investment also leaves the relation qualitatively unchanged (due to a Q-theory mecha-
nism); and in Section 4 we show that adding a corporate debt overhang problem strengthens the
relation (output becomes even more sensitive to asset prices).

Temporary supply shocks can reduce aggregate demand and interest rates. We
next consider the comparative statics of temporary supply shocks— a reduction in z0 keeping z 1
unchanged. An example is the Covid-19 shock. In this context, we illustrate how, when banks’
outstanding leverage is su¢ ciently high, temporary supply shocks reduce aggregate demand by
more than the aggregate supply shock, and hence reduce interest rates.
    First suppose there is no lower bound on the interest rate. In this case, monetary policy
always ensures output is equal to its supply-determined level, rf = rf and y0 = z0 . This
outcome requires the asset price per productivity to be at its e¢ cient level, Q0 = Q [cf. (11)].
Combining this with Eq. (15), the interest rate also needs to be at a particular level,

                                                                  z1             2
                                            rf =        + log                        :                       (17)
                                                                  z0     0 (z0 )

    Consider a decline in z0 keeping z 1 unchanged. Eq. (17) illustrates that this decline exerts
two e¤ects on the risk-free interest rate. On the one hand, a decline in z0 increases the expected
               z1
growth rate,   z0 ,   which increases the interest rate. Intuitively, while asset prices are currently
relatively low, they are expected to recover. This raises the Sharpe ratio and induces agents to
invest in the market portfolio [cf. (14)], which exerts upward pressure on the asset price per
productivity. The interest rate increases to keep asset prices at the e¢ cient level. On the other
hand, a decline in z0 also reduces banks’ wealth share [cf. (13)], which decreases the interest
rate. Since banks are levered, a decline in asset valuations reduces their wealth more than the
households’wealth. This decreases e¤ective risk tolerance and puts downward pressure on asset
prices and the interest rate.
                                                           drf
    The second channel dominates (locally),                 dz0     > 0, as long as the parameters satisfy z0 > l0
(no bankruptcy) and

                                                                         2

                           z0
                                                           h             l0                b      h
                                where     0 (z0 )   =          + 1                   0                :
                                                                         z0

All else equal, temporary supply shocks are more likely to reduce aggregate demand by more


                                                               10
than supply when agents’risk tolerance is more heterogeneous (greater                         b   h,   keeping   0 (z0 )
constant), when banks have greater initial leverage (greater l0 ), and when the shock is more
severe (lower z0 ). In fact, when households are very risk intolerant,                   h    = 0, condition (18) is
satis…ed whenever the debt to productivity ratio exceeds a threshold,                    l0
                                                                                         z0     d~ 2 (0; 1).
   For the rest of the paper, we isolate our leverage mechanism and simplify the analysis by
assuming
                                           log z 1 = log z0 + g,                                                  (19)

where g is an exogenous growth parameter. Hence, we focus on permanent supply shocks, which
simpli…es the equations but is not necessary for our results: we could have instead worked with
parameters that satisfy (18). With Eq. (19), the risk-free interest rate is given by

                                                                  2
                                         rf =      +g                         .                                   (20)
                                                              0 (z0 )

In this case a decrease in z0 always (weakly) reduces aggregate demand and the interest rate.

Supply shocks can trigger downward asset price spirals. We next consider the case
where there is a lower bound on the interest rate. In this case, the supply shock can cause a
demand recession. We assume the parameters satisfy [cf. (16)]

The …rst inequality ensures that when supply is equal to its benchmark level, z0 = 1, there is an
equilibrium with an unconstrained (positive) interest rate. The second inequality ensures that,
if households control all the wealth in the economy, the interest rate is constrained (zero).
     Our next result characterizes the equilibrium for di¤erent levels of the productivity shock,
                                                                                 ~0   Q0
z0 . To state the result, we de…ne the normalized asset price per productivity, Q     Q 2 [0; 1],
which simpli…es the notation. We also de…ne two cuto¤s for productivity that we denote with
z h and z .
   Below the …rst cuto¤, z h , there is an equilibrium where banks go bankrupt and households
control all wealth. To calculate this cuto¤, suppose there is bankruptcy. Using the risk balance
condition (15) with       =   h   (and rf = 0), we obtain
                      0

                                         h                                2

                                        Q                                 h


Note that Q ~ h is the minimum normalized asset price. Suppose the price falls to this level,
~0 = Q
Q     ~ h . Then, Eq. (13) implies banks will indeed go bankrupt as long as productivity is
su¢ ciently low:
                                                             l0
                                             z0 < z h           .                                                 (23)

When z0 < z h , there is always a bankruptcy equilibrium. Note that the cuto¤ z h is increasing
in l0 : bankruptcy is more likely when banks have greater initial leverage.
   The second cuto¤, z , is the productivity level above which there is a supply determined
                                    ~ 0 = 1. To calculate this cuto¤, we use the risk balance
equilibrium with the e¢ cient price Q
                    ~ 0 = 1 and rf = 0 to obtain the value of z < 1 that solves
condition (15) with Q

                                                                2

When z0 > z , there is always an equilibrium with the e¢ cient asset price.

Proposition 1. Consider the equilibrium with condition (21). Let z h and z denote the cuto¤ s
de…ned by Eqs. (23) and (24).
    (i) If z0 > z h , then the equilibrium is unique and does not feature bankruptcy. If z0 2 z h ; z

   (ii) If z0                                                                          ~0 = Q
                z h , then there is a bankruptcy equilibrium with the low asset price, Q    ~ h < 1.
There might also be other equilibria. When z0 2 z ; z h (assuming the interval is nonempty),
                                                            ~ 0 = 1.
there is also an equilibrium with the e¢ cient asset price, Q

   The …rst part of Proposition 1 shows that the equilibrium is unique as long as the shock
is not severe enough to trigger bankruptcy (z0 > z h ). In this region, when the supply shock
is below a cuto¤ (z0 < z ), the equilibrium features a demand recession. More severe supply
shocks lead to lower asset prices and more severe demand recessions. As we will see below,
these supply shocks also generate downward spirals and have an ampli…ed e¤ect on asset prices
and aggregate demand. The second part of Proposition 1 shows that, when the shock is severe
enough to trigger bankruptcy (z0 < z h ), these ampli…cation mechanisms can lead to multiple
equilibria.
    To illustrate the …rst part, consider parameters that lead to a unique and interior equilibrium
price, z h < z0 < z . Substituting rf = 0 and Q  ~ 0 = Q0 =Q in the risk balance condition (15),
we …nd that the price solves Eq. (25). This equation has a natural interpretation. The right

transfer (relative) wealth from banks to households, which reduces the e¤ective risk tolerance
and requires a greater Sharpe ratio for agents to absorb the risk.
   Figure 2 plots these curves and the resulting equilibrium for a particular parameterization
that satis…es z h < z . The dashed lines correspond to the benchmark productivity level, z0 = 1,
which satis…es z0 > z (by assumption). In this benchmark case, there is a corner equilibrium
                                      ~ 0 = 1, and the interest rate is positive, rf > 0. The

solid lines consider a lower productivity level, z0 2 z h ; z , and illustrate how a supply shock
can generate severe downward spirals in asset prices. Starting from the benchmark, a decline
in productivity reduces asset prices and e¤ective risk tolerance. This shifts the curve for the
required Sharpe ratio upward. The central bank reacts by cutting interest rates, which increases
the actual Sharpe ratio, but the central bank encounters a lower bound constraint, rf = 0.
When the risk free rate cannot fall any farther, asset prices and aggregate demand decline more
than the decline in productivity— to increase the actual Sharpe ratio. The reduction in asset
prices further damages banks’ balance sheets and increases the required Sharpe ratio, which
further reduces asset prices, and so on.
   The …gure also illustrates that, due to this ampli…cation mechanism, the Sharpe ratio rises
more than the initial impact of the shock (captured by the vertical shift from the dashed to the
solid red line). Consequently, the asset price falls considerably more than the direct e¤ect of
the negative supply shock. Moreover, there is greater ampli…cation when the risk tolerance and
the required Sharpe ratio are more sensitive to asset prices (when the solid red line is steeper),
which happens with greater l0 or lower z0 [cf. Eq. (25)]. Hence, supply shocks induce a larger
contraction in asset prices and aggregate demand when banks have greater leverage or the shock

is more severe.
       To illustrate the second part of Proposition 1, consider parameters that allow for bankruptcy
and multiple equilibria, z < z0 < z h . Since z0 < z h , there is a bankruptcy equilibrium with
the lowest asset price, Q ~0 = Q
                               ~ h . However, since z0 > z , there is also an equilibrium with the

e¢ cient asset price, Q
       Figure 3 illustrates these equilibria by plotting the required and the actual Sharpe ratio
curves. The high and the low-price equilibria are marked with H and L, respectively.8 Starting
from the high-price equilibrium H, a decline in asset prices weakens banks’ balance sheets
substantially, which rapidly raises the required Sharpe ratio. This in turn reinforces the large
fall in asset prices and culminates in the low-price equilibrium L that features bankruptcy. As
this discussion suggests, multiplicity is more likely when banks have greater leverage. In fact,
the parameters used in Figure 3 are the same as those used in Figure 2, with the di¤erence that
we raise banks’initial leverage l0 (and also adjust banks’risk tolerance           b   to keep the benchmark
risk tolerance         0 (1)   unchanged).

Adding demand shocks. In our analysis we focus on the endogenous response of asset
prices and aggregate demand to a large supply shock. However, the Covid-19 shock is a complex
combination of supply and demand shocks. There are at least three ways to introduce these
demand shocks into our framework. First, as in Caballero and Simsek (2020b), agents’ risk
perception,           , may rise. Second, consumers may become more conservative and lower their

    There is also an interior equilibrium that corresponds to the intersection of the two curves. However, this
equilibrium is unstable: small deviations would bring the equilibrium to either H or L.

discount rate,   (increase saving). Third, consumers may become more pessimistic about growth,
g, as in Lorenzoni (2009); Caballero and Simsek (2020a). Eq. (20) illustrates that all these
channels put direct downward pressure on rf , which translates into a larger aggregate demand
recession once rf reaches the lower bound.


 3.    Large-scale Asset Purchases
The powerful downward spiral caused by the endogenous decline in risk tolerance suggests that
policy interventions that absorb some risky assets during such events can be very powerful.
We now introduce unconventional monetary policy in the form of large-scale asset purchases
(LSAPs) and demonstrate its e¤ectiveness in reversing the spiral.
   Modeling LSAPs requires introducing a …scal authority: even if the asset purchases are
made by the central bank, the gains and losses from these positions ultimately accrue to the
treasury. We merge the …scal and monetary authorities into a third agent which we refer to as
the government and denote by superscript g.
   Formally, the government is endowed with no resources in period 0 and a given amount of
resources in period 1, denoted by      gz                             gz
                                            1.   We think of                  1   as the government’s future tax capacity.
It can be “microfounded” by introducing a group of agents other than banks and households
(e.g., the future generation) from which the government will be able to extract some taxes. We
assume future tax capacity is proportional to future productivity, which simpli…es the analysis
but is not necessary for our results (in fact, making the government’s tax capacity safer would
strengthen our results). For simplicity the government starts with no assets. It then decides
whether and how much to borrow, bg0                 0, and what fraction of the borrowed funds to invest
in the risky asset,   ~ g0
                      !      0, with the residual fraction invested in the safe asset. In period 1, the
government receives its tax revenues as well as the returns from its investments, pays back its
debt, and spends the residual amount.
   In the appendix, we show that the government’s budget constraint can be rewritten anal-
ogously to the banks’ and households’ budget constraints. Speci…cally, the government’s net
wealth in period 0 is
                                                    ag0 = z0 Q0       g
                                                                          ,                                          (26)

and its total fraction of wealth invested in the market portfolio is

                                                            bg0 !
                                                                ~ g0
                                                  ! g0   =1+ g .                                                     (27)

The government can be thought of as selling its future tax receipts and reinvesting the proceeds
in the available assets. The value of its tax receipts is given by (26) and its net investment
is given by (27). The requirements bg0                         ~ g0
                                                         0 and !                  0 translate into a requirement that the
government takes a levered position,         ! g0         1. The government is already fully exposed to the

market portfolio through its future tax revenues, and it can further increase its exposure by
borrowing and investing in risky assets.
   Finally, the presence of the government changes the asset market clearing condition [cf. (7)]:
                                                  X
                                                         ! i0 ai0 = z0 Q0 (1 +        g
                                                                                          ).                             (28)
                                             i2fb;h;gg


The right side illustrates that the government’s tax capacity implicitly expands the supply of the
market portfolio. The left side illustrates that the government also expands demand. Given a
government portfolio choice ! g0                 1, our de…nition of equilibrium generalizes in straightforward
fashion. In the rest of the section, we characterize the equilibrium taking ! g0                               1 as given and
illustrate the comparative statics of LSAPs. We then introduce the government’s preferences
and characterize the optimal LSAP policy.

Equilibrium with large-scale asset purchases. Investors’ optimality conditions are the
same. Therefore much of the earlier analysis applies in this setting. Speci…cally, Eqs. (10) ; (13),
and (14) still hold. Using Eq. (28), we also obtain the analogue of the market clearing condition
(12):
                                             b                  h            g g                g
                                           0!0    + (1      0) !0    +        !0   =1+              .                    (29)

Combining these observations, we obtain the analogue of the risk balance condition (15):

                                               (1     )     g            log (Q0 )         rf
                                                          =                                     ,                        (30)
                                            0 (z0 Q0 =Q )


where         =     g   (! g0   1) and   0 (z)   is given by the same expression as before [cf. (16)].
   Eq. (30) illustrates that LSAPs e¤ectively take some risk out of the market. Speci…cally, the
risk balance condition is equivalent to an economy in which the risk is reduced by a fraction,
  =     g   (! g0       1). How much risk LSAPs remove depends on the government’s tax capacity,                           g,

and the riskiness of its portfolio,              ! g0    1. When         g   = 0 or   ! g0     = 1 the policy does not reduce
risk and the risk balance condition (and the equilibrium) is the same as before. In subsequent
analysis, we refer to             as the size of the LSAPs program.
   In this context, …rst consider the equilibrium when the interest rate constraint does not bind.
Substituting Q0 = Q = exp (                  ) into (30), we solve for the e¢ cient interest rate [cf. Eq. (20)]:

                                                                      2
                                             rf = g +                         (1      ).
                                                                    0 (z0 )

When the interest rate is not constrained, LSAPs do not a¤ect asset prices, z0 Q , or output,
y0 = z0 , but they translate into higher interest rates. As LSAPs take risk out of the market,
they exert upward pressure on asset valuations and aggregate demand. Conventional monetary
policy responds by raising the interest rate to keep asset prices and aggregate demand consistent

   We next consider the case in which the interest rate can be constrained and generalize
Proposition 1. We assume the following analogue of (21):

                                                            2                  h
                                         0 (1)                    >                .                                             (31)

   As before, we also de…ne two cuto¤ productivity levels, z h ( ) ; z ( ). Let

              zh ( ) =             where         ~ h ( ) = exp g +

As before, z h ( ) is the cuto¤ productivity below which there is a bankruptcy equilibrium, and
Q~ h ( ) is the normalized price in a bankruptcy equilibrium [cf. (22 23)]. Increasing increases
the normalized price, Q  ~ h ( ), and decreases the cuto¤, z h ( ): LSAPs increase the worst-case
asset price level and shrink the set of productivity realizations that allow for bankruptcy.
   Let z ( ) 2 (0; 1) denote the unique solution to

                                                                      2
                                             0 (z       )
                                                            =              .                                                     (33)

As before, z ( ) is the cuto¤ productivity above which there is a supply determined equilibrium
with e¢ cient prices [cf. (24)]. LSAPs expand the set of productivity realizations that allow for
an e¢ cient price equilibrium. The next result characterizes the equilibrium when it is unique and
interior. The case with multiple equilibria is similar to Proposition 1 and discussed subsequently.

Proposition 2. Consider the equilibrium with LSAPs,                                    =   g   (! g0       1)       0, and conditions
(31). Suppose z0 2    zh ( ) ; z ( ) given the cuto¤ s in Eqs. (32 33). There exists a unique

The normalized price is increasing in the size of the LSAP program,                                     d      > 0.

   Consider Figure 4, which illustrates Eq. (34). LSAPs shift the required Sharpe ratio curve
downward without a¤ecting the actual Sharpe ratio curve. In equilibrium, this leads to a lower
Sharpe ratio and a higher asset price. In fact, LSAPs have an ampli…ed e¤ect on the Sharpe
ratio: the change in the equilibrium Sharpe ratio is much greater than the initial downward
shift of the curve. As LSAPs increase asset prices, they improve banks’ balance sheets, which
further reduces the required Sharpe ratio and raises asset prices. Essentially, LSAPs help undo
the downward spirals created by supply shocks illustrated in Figure 2.

librium.

    LSAPs can have even more powerful e¤ects when there are multiple equilibria. Figure
5 illustrates this by plotting the e¤ect of LSAPs for parameters that lead to multiplicity. The
solid red line illustrates the risk premium curve without policy, which leads to multiple equilibria
(denoted by L and H in the …gure). The dashed red line illustrates the e¤ect of LSAPs with
the same magnitude as in the previous case with a unique equilibrium. In this case, LSAPs
eliminate the low-price equilibrium. By removing risk from the market, the policy reduces the
required Sharpe ratio and increases asset prices, which triggers a virtuous spiral that culminates
in the high-price equilibrium (denoted by H 0 in the …gure).

Optimal large-scale asset purchases. We next introduce an objective function for the
government and analyze the resulting optimal LSAPs policy. Suppose the government chooses

government’s portfolio. We assume the government has similar preferences as agents but with
risk tolerance       g.   The remaining term captures the residual risk in agents’ portfolios. The
government evaluates these risks according to the benchmark e¤ective risk tolerance,                                        0 (1)—
ignoring changes in the e¤ective risk tolerance due to the shock. This does not play an important

role beyond simplifying the analysis (and it makes the case for LSAPs weaker). Finally, the
government weights its own utility and the agents’utility with                          g    and 1, respectively (the initial
endowments of the market           portfolio).9
       We also assume the government is weakly less risk tolerant than the agents:

                                                        g
                                                                 0 (1) .                                                           (36)

This ensures that, if there was no demand recession, the government would not use LSAPs.
That is, the reason for LSAPs in our model is not a …nancial friction. Instead, the government
uses LSAPs to respond to the demand recession when it cannot cut interest rates. To see this
reasoning, we rewrite (35) in terms of the size of the LSAP program,                               =       g   (! g0       1), to obtain

     The functional forms in (35) re‡ect agents’utility functions and they are motivated by the standard Pareto
criterion. In Appendix A.2, we consider a slight variant of the model in which banks and the households are
merged into a single agent, “the market,” with exogenous risk tolerance m . We derive a constrained Pareto
problem and show that it features the objective in (35) with m = 0 (1).

government might …nd it optimal to use LSAPs.
   Eq. (37) also suggests that the size of the optimal LSAPs satis…es intuitive comparative
statics (which we verify in numerical simulations). The optimal LSAP is increasing in the
government’s risk tolerance,          g   > 0, and its tax capacity,       g   > 0. Greater capacity helps because
it enables the government to achieve the same impact on …nancial markets with a smaller impact
on its own risk exposure.
   More subtly, we …nd that (as long as banks are not bankrupt under the optimal LSAPs) the
government tends to engage in larger LSAPs when the supply shock is more severe (lower z0 )
and when the private sector initially has greater leverage (greater l0 ). Figure 6 illustrates these
results for the parameters in our earlier analysis (see Figures 2 and 4). We set the government’s
risk tolerance to be the same as households’risk tolerance,                     g   =   h,   so it is quite costly for the
government to absorb risk. Nonetheless, the government chooses to use LSAPs. The left panel
shows that increasing the severity of the shock increases the size of the optimal LSAPs. The
right panel shows that increasing banks’initial leverage has the same e¤ect. In this panel, as we
increase l0 we also adjust banks’ risk tolerance to keep the e¤ective benchmark risk tolerance
 0 (1)   unchanged (which leads to a more meaningful comparison).
   To see the intuition, consider how the severity of the supply shock a¤ects the equilibrium and
the government’s trade-o¤. Our earlier Figure 2 shows that a lower z0 increases the steepness
of the required Sharpe ratio curve. When the required Sharpe ratio curve is steeper, downward
spirals are more severe. LSAPs then have a greater impact on asset prices because they help
undo these spirals [cf. Figure 4]. Consequently, lower z0 increases the marginal bene…t from the

           Q
             0
                     which implies larger optimal LSAPs. Likewise, greater initial l0 exacerbates the
downward spirals and increases the marginal bene…t from LSAPs.
   As this intuition suggests, these results apply for an interior equilibrium but they might
not hold for a corner equilibrium in which banks are bankrupt. With bankruptcy, there are
parameters where improving productivity z0 increases the optimal LSAPs. This happens when
the government …nds it too costly to save the banks via a large LSAPs program. As z0 improves,
the government at some point …nds it optimal to save the banks, which induces a discrete upward
jump in the optimal LSAPs. Likewise, when banks are bankrupt, decreasing their initial leverage
might increase the optimal LSAPs.

 4.          Debt Overhang and Firm Insolvencies
Since our main goal in this paper is to isolate the feedback between investors’endogenous risk
tolerance and a large supply shock, we removed all other …nancial mechanisms. One …nancial
mechanism that is particularly concerning in the context of the Covid-19 shock is …rms’ debt
overhang. In this section we add debt overhang and show how it interacts with our risk-centric
mechanism. E¤ectively, the corporate debt overhang problem creates a feedback between asset
prices and productivity. This feedback makes the market’s e¤ective risk tolerance (and hence
the required Sharpe ratio) more sensitive to asset prices, which strengthens our ampli…cation
mechanism and makes LSAPs more e¤ective.
   Recall that our baseline model features (New Keynesian) production …rms that manage
capital, produce (according to demand), and distribute their earnings to the households. The
market portfolio (which the agents trade among themselves) is a …nancial claim on all production
…rms. In this section, we assume production …rms not only manage capital but also have debt
liabilities (or debt claims) on each other. The market portfolio consists of the outstanding equity
shares of all production …rms. The value of an individual …rm’s equity is the value of its capital
net of its debt liability (or plus its debt claim). Firms’debt liabilities and claims sum to zero (for
simplicity), so the value of the market portfolio is still equal to the value of aggregate capital.
However, the value of an indebted …rm’s equity share is less than the value of its capital. If the
outstanding debt is too large, then the …rm becomes insolvent.
   Formally, there is a continuum of mass one of …rms denoted by                                                 2 [0; 1]. Each …rm manages
one unit of capital and starts with an outstanding debt position, b0 ( ), that must be settled at


                                                                           21
date 0. If b0 ( ) > 0, the …rm has a debt liability to other …rms. If b0 ( ) < 0, the …rm has debt
claims on other …rms. These outstanding positions are distributed according to a cumulative
                                          R
distribution function dF ( ) that satis…es b0 ( ) dF ( ) = 0.
       The …rm can pay its debt using its earnings y0 ( ), or by issuing new claims backed by the
(end-of-period) value of its assets (capital) z0 Q0 . To make the analysis stark, we assume the
…rm faces no borrowing constraints. For concreteness, consider a …rm whose debt exceeds its
earnings, b0 ( ) > y0 ( ). First suppose the …rm’s debt is not too large,

                                          b0 ( )    y0 ( ) + z0 Q0 .                                     (38)

We assume this …rm issues new equity shares without frictions so that (at the end of the period)
the …rm becomes entirely equity …nanced and previous debtholders own a fraction of the …rm
  2 [0; 1] that satis…es b0 ( )      y0 ( ) = Q0 z0 .10 Next consider a …rm with more debt that
violates condition (38). These …rms cannot fully pay back their debt: they become insolvent
and go through a bankruptcy process that restructures their debt.
       We assume bankruptcy is costly: speci…cally, insolvent …rms’productivity shrinks to a frac-
tion of solvent …rms’ productivity,           2 [0; 1] (for both periods 0 and 1). The parameter
captures the e¢ ciency of bankruptcy (or reallocation, when bankruptcy is not available). If
  = 1, a bankrupt …rm continues to operate at the same productivity as before. If                < 1, which
is empirically more likely, bankruptcy lowers the …rm’s         productivity.11
       To close the model, we assume aggregate demand at date 0 is distributed among the solvent
and insolvent …rms according to their relative productivity levels. Speci…cally, let y0 denote
output of a solvent …rm. We assume output of an insolvent …rm is given by                       y0 . Letting
S 2 (0; 1) denote the fraction of solvent …rms, aggregate output is given by

                       y 0 = Sy0    where      S = S + (1      S)      =   + (1    ) S.

Likewise, we denote the value of a solvent …rm’s assets by Q0 z0 . Then, the aggregate value of
assets (or the market portfolio) is given by Sz0 Q0 . Note that the asset price per (e¤ective)
productivity is still given by Q0 . The rest of the model is unchanged.
       Most of the analysis is similar to Section 2. Speci…cally, we have the following analogue of
Eq. (9):
                                                1
                                       c0 =           S (y0 + z0 Q0 ) .
                                              1+e
Using the aggregate resource constraint, y 0 = Sy0 = c0 , we …nd y0 = e z0 Q0 . That is, the
  10
     While we describe a speci…c …nancing arrangement, other arrangements would also work and would lead to
identical allocations. Under no arbitrage (which holds in our model) and no borrowing constraints (which we
assume) the …rm’s value is independent of whether it issues debt or equity (or other claims) and from whom it
borrows.
  11
     The parameter     is likely to be especially low in the Covid-19 recession because the virus and lockdown
measures have restricted bankruptcy courts’capacity.



                                                     22
output-asset price relation in (10) applies for a solvent …rm. The e¢ cient asset price per pro-
ductivity is still given by Q = e . As before, we de…ne Q  ~ 0 = Q0 =Q 2 [0; 1] as the normalized
price per productivity.
       Combining these observations with the solvency constraint (38), we solve for the fraction of
solvent …rms:                  n                              o
                         S = Pr b ( )         1+e           ~0 = F
                                                         z0 Q                1+e       ~0 .
                                                                                    z0 Q

This in turn implies the following aggregate output-asset price relation [cf. (10)]:

               y0 = S Q      ~0
                      ~ 0 z0 Q            where         ~0
                                                      S Q             + (1    )F    1+e          ~0 .
                                                                                              z0 Q      (39)

       Intuitively, debt overhang strengthens the output-asset price relation. Higher asset prices
not only increase aggregate demand, as in our earlier analysis, but they also increase aggregate
supply by enabling a greater fraction of indebted …rms to remain solvent.
                                                                                          ~ 0 2 [0; 1].
       Next consider the characterization of the normalized asset price per productivity, Q
Most of the analysis from Section 2 applies in this case. The main di¤erence concerns banks’
wealth share, which is now given by

                                      0   =   0 (z)
                                                                  ~ 0 z0 Q
                                                      where z = S Q      ~ 0.

Here,      0 (z)   is the same function as before [cf. (13)]. Consequently, the risk balance condition
is now given by [cf. (15)]:

                                                                 +g        ~0
                                                                       log Q       rf
                                                        =                               .               (40)
                                 0
                                       ~ 0 z0 Q
                                     S Q      ~0

       Intuitively, debt overhang strengthens the impact of asset prices on risk tolerance. An
increase in …rm insolvencies (a decrease in S) reduces the aggregate value of assets, which in
turn reduces banks’wealth share. This reduces the market’s e¤ective risk tolerance and increases
the required Sharpe ratio.12
       The equilibrium is characterized by Eqs. (39) and (40) and the interest rate policy. Figure
7 illustrates the equilibrium for the earlier example that features a constrained interest rate
rf = 0. We assume the outstanding claims are uniformly distributed over [ b; b] for some b                0.
As before, the left panel shows the equilibrium as the intersection of the required and actual
Sharpe ratios. The dashed red line plots the required Sharpe ratio for the baseline case in which
…rms either do not have outstanding debt, or bankruptcy is very e¢ cient. The solid red line
shows the required Sharpe ratio when …rms are indebted and bankruptcy is less e¢ cient. Debt
overhang shifts the curve for the required Sharpe ratio upward. This lowers the normalized asset
  12
   The actual Sharpe ratio remains unchanged because asset prices and future payo¤s both scale linearly with
S: that is, log Sz

        The right panel sheds further light on the mechanism by plotting the fraction of solvent

        Importantly, Figure 7 illustrates that debt overhang also worsens asset price spirals (captured
by the steepening of the required Sharpe ratio curve)— as it makes the e¤ective risk tolerance
more sensitive to asset prices [cf. (40)]. This feature, together with our analysis in the previous
section, suggests debt overhang also makes LSAPs more e¤ective (e.g., Figure 4), which we
verify in numerical simulations.


 5.        Final Remarks
In this paper we show that real (non-…nancial) shocks can endogenously reduce the market’s
risk tolerance and induce large contractions in asset prices and aggregate demand, and we
demonstrate the e¤ectiveness of LSAPs in mitigating these contractions. The key ingredient is
heterogeneity in investors’risk tolerance. As aggregate conditions worsen, asset prices and the
wealth share of risk tolerant agents decline. Thus, the “representative agent” becomes less risk
tolerant and demands a higher Sharpe ratio to hold risky assets. With unconstrained monetary
policy, a cut in interest rates is the most e¤ective mechanism to increase the market’s Sharpe
ratio. If the central bank cannot cut interest rates, asset prices drop further and drag down
aggregate demand and the wealth share of risk tolerant agents, triggering a downward spiral.
LSAPs improve asset prices and aggregate demand by transferring risk to the government’s


                                                    24
balance sheet, and can be powerful since they reverse the downward spiral. Optimal LSAPs are
larger when the government has greater future …scal capacity and when the economy is more
unstable at the outset, which happens when bank’s initial leverage is greater and when the shock
is more severe. Corporate debt overhang problems strengthen our mechanisms by making the
wealth share of risk tolerant agents (and thus the market’s risk tolerance) more sensitive to asset
prices.
   Our analysis lends support to the unprecedented (in terms of size and speed) asset market
interventions by the Fed and other major central banks around the world in response to the
…nancial distress caused by the Covid-19 shock, and it highlights the importance of targeting
assets held by levered investors. Importantly, the rationale for this policy in our framework is
not to protect “the …nancial pipeline,” however important this may be, but to boost aggregate
demand when conventional monetary policy is constrained.
   While we focus on LSAPs, our analysis also supports other policy mechanisms that help
reestablish equilibrium in risk markets. For example, loosening capital requirements is likely to
increase e¤ective risk tolerance and hence reduce the required Sharpe ratio. Likewise, any public
guarantee or put policy that reduces perceived volatility is likely to reduce the gap between the
required and actual Sharpe ratios at any given asset price level. We will explore some of these
policies in future work.
   An important practical concern with policies that support asset markets is the perception
that they are distributionally unfair. Two observations diminish these concerns. First, in our
framework the goal of these policies is not to transfer resources to risk-tolerant agents (“banks”)
but to boost aggregate demand. As such, these policies increase everyone’s income (see Remark
1 for an example where hand-to-mouth consumers can be a main bene…ciary). Second, the
wealth share of “banks” in our model declines more than in a benchmark frictionless model in
which outcomes are supply determined. Appropriately designed LSAPs (as well as conventional
monetary policy) do not make “banks” wealthier— they only mitigate the additional decline
in their wealth share that results from a demand recession. A similar argument mitigates the
concern that LSAPs can exacerbate moral hazard (see Bornstein and Lorenzoni (2018) for a
formal analysis in the context of conventional monetary policy).
   Finally, we do not argue that asset market policies should substitute for all other aggregate
demand policies. In fact, the global expansion in …scal policy in response to the Covid-19 shock
has been as fast and remarkable as that of central banks, and this seems appropriate to us. A
pragmatic response to any severe recessionary shock mixes monetary and …scal policy responses.
Our paper highlights that LSAPs share many features with conventional monetary policy, and
therefore provide an appropriate response when conventional monetary policy is constrained.

 A.       Appendix: Omitted derivations
This appendix presents the derivations and proofs omitted from the main text. We start by
presenting the details of the baseline case without LSAPs. We then consider the case with
LSAPs. Throughout, recall that the market portfolio is the claim to all output. Combining Eqs.
(1) and (2), the return on the market portfolio at date 1 is also log normally distributed, that
is,
                                            z1                            z1                                   2
                                                                                                                           2
                     r (z0 ; z1 ) = log                        N    log        log (Q0 )                           ;            .        (A.1)
                                           z0 Q0                          z0                                  2
For most of our analysis, we also assume log zz01 = g, which further simpli…es this expression [cf.
Eq. (19)].

 A.1.      Baseline model without policy
Most of the analysis is provided in the main text. Here, we formally state the agents’problem
that incorporates the log-Normal approximation. We also derive the optimality conditions. We
then complete the characterization of equilibrium and prove Proposition 1.

Approximate portfolio problem and optimality conditions. Without an approximation,
type i agents would solve the following problem,

             ui;exact
              0       ~i0
                      a         =     max log c0 + e                log ui1                                                              (A.2)
                                     c0 ;a0 ;!
                                                  h                             i             i
                                                                                                  i           i=
                                                                                                               (       i   1)
                                     where ui1 = E c1 (z0 ; z1 )(                       1)=


                              s.t.             ~i0
                                     c0 + a0 = a
                              and    c1 (z0 ; z1 ) = a0 ! exp (r (z0 ; z1 )) + (1                                  !) exp rf         .   (A.3)

Here, c1 (z0 ; z1 ) denotes total …nancial wealth, which equals consumption (since the economy
ends at date 1). Note that the agent has Epstein-Zin preferences with EIS coe¢ cient equal to one
and the RRA coe¢ cient equal to 1=               i   > 0. The case with             i   = 1 is equivalent to time-separable
log utility. Agents’initial endowments,               ai0 ,   are given by (3).
      In view of the Epstein-Zin functional form, agents can be thought of as solving the intertem-
poral problem,
                              ui0 a
                                  ~i0 = max log a
                                                ~i0                a0 + e      log RCE;i a0 :                                            (A.4)
                                           a0

Here, RCE;i denotes investors’certainty-equivalent portfolio return per dollar. Absent an approx-
imation, it would correspond to the solution to the following portfolio optimization problem:
                                               h                                        i             i
                                                                                                          i        i=
                                                                                                                       (   i    1)
                            RCE;i;exact = max E (Rp (z0 ; z1 ))(                             1)=
                                                                                                                                         (A.5)
                                                     !

                    and Rp (z0 ; z1 ) = ! exp (r (z0 ; z1 )) + (1                           !) exp rf .


                                                                   29
The variable, Rp (z0 ; z1 ), denotes the realized portfolio return per dollar.
   In our analysis, we assume that agents choose portfolios (and evaluate the resulting certainty-
equivalent return, RCE;i ) by solving the following approximate portfolio problem:

                                                                                      11 2
                               log RCE;i         rf      = max !                          !              2
                                                                                                                                                          (A.6)
                                                                     !                2 i
                                                                                                 2
                                       where             = E [r (z0 ; z1 )] +                                rf .
                                                                                                 2

Here,    denotes the risk premium on the market portfolio and                                                       is its standard deviation
(measured in log returns). The problem says that the agent trades o¤ its portfolio mean (in
excess of the risk-free rate), ! , with its portfolio variance, ! 2                                  2.      This approximation becomes
exact if the portfolio return follows a log-Normal distribution. In general, this is not the case
and it holds only approximately. This approximation works well for calibrations with relatively
short time horizons and it becomes exact in continuous time. The approximation is widely used
in the literature (see Campbell and Viceira (2002)).
   The …rst order condition for problem (A:4) implies Eq. (5) in the main text. That is,
regardless of her certainty-equivalent portfolio return, the investor consumes and saves a constant
fraction of her lifetime wealth.
   The …rst order condition for problem (A:6) implies Eq. (6) in the main text.

Characterization of equilibrium. We characterize the equilibrium and prove Proposition
1. We …rst characterize the equilibrium in terms of an auxiliary function. Consider the function:
                                                              2
                       ~ 0 ; z0
                     F Q                   =                                           ~0
                                                                                 + log Q                      (g + )                                      (A.7)
                                                          0 l0   (   b   h
                                                                             )
                                                 0               ~0
                                                              z0 Q
                                                 h                   b       h
                       where       0       =         +    0                       .

                                                                                                                                  b       h
                                        ~ 0 2 Q ; 1 , where Q =                                                       0 l0    (               )=z0
This function is de…ned over the domain Q      0             0                                                                        0
                                                                                                                                                     . Eq. (15)
                                         ~0 2 Q
implies that every interior equilibrium, Q    ~ h ; 1 , corresponds to a zero of this function.
                                                0
                                                                ~0 2 Q
Conversely, every zero of the function that falls in the range, Q    ~ h ; 1 , corresponds to an
                                                                       0
interior equilibrium. The zeros that fall outside this range do not correspond to an equilibrium.
Finally, there is a corner equilibrium with Q~ 0 = 1 (and rf     0) i¤ F (1; z0 ) 0; and there is a
                          ~      ~ h
corner equilibrium with Q0 = Q (and bankruptcy) i¤ F Q ; z0  ~ h        0.
                                       0                                                     0
   We next establish some properties of the auxiliary function that facilities the proof. Consider
the monotone change of variables:

                                                 b       h                                           b        h
                                       0 l0                         ~0 =              0 l0                          =z0
                       0   =   0                                  , Q                                                     .                               (A.8)
                                                  ~0
                                               z0 Q                                              0            0




                                                                  30
In terms of the new variable, the auxiliary function corresponds to the transformed function:
                                      2
                           f ( 0)            log (    0           0)      + log l0           log z0    (g + ) .                   (A.9)
                                      0

This function has the domain           0   2 (0;     0 ),   and it is strictly convex, that is:

                                                          2   2                    1

The function also satis…es lim         0 !0   f ( 0 ) = lim                    0 !1    f ( 0 ) = 1. These observations imply
that the zeros of the transformed function f ( ) have the same characteristics as an upward-
pointing parabola. The original function F ( ; z0 ) adopts the same characteristics. In particular,
the function either does not have any (interior) zero:

                                       ~ 0 ; z0
                                     F Q                            ~0 2 Q ; 1 ,

                                                                 ~ h > (l0 ) = h . The equal-
Here, the inequality follows since z0 > z h = Q~l0h implies 0 z0 Q 0
ity follows from the de…nition of Q ~ h . This rules out the corner equilibrium with Q
                                                                                     ~0 = Q
                                                                                          ~ h.

Combining this observation with Eq. (A:11) also implies that we must have the case (A:11)
     ~ h falling between the two zeros. This in turn implies there is a unique equilibrium that
with Q 0
depends on the sign of F (1; z0 ). When F (1; z0 ) > 0, there is an interior equilibrium with
~0 2 Q
Q      ~ h ; 1 . When F (1; z0 ) 0, there is a corner equilibrium with Q
                                                                       ~ 0 = 1. Note also that
         0

F (1; z0 ) =     0 (z0 )
                           (g + ) implies that the condition, F (1; z0 ) > 0, is equivalent to z0 < z
from the de…nition of z [cf. (24)]. This proves that there is a unique interior equilibrium when
z0 < z (and z0 > z h ) and there is a unique corner equilibrium when z0                                           z (and z0 > z h ).
   Next consider the comparative statics of the interior equilibrium with respect to z0 . Note
that F Q~ 0 ; z0 is decreasing in z0 . Therefore, greater z0 shifts F Q
                                                                      ~ 0 ; z0 downward, which


                                                                      31
increases the (greater) zero of the function that corresponds to the equilibrium. This establishes
 ~0
dQ
dz0   > 0 and completes the proof of the …rst part.
   Next suppose z0 < z h = Q~l0h . We have the opposite of (A:12), which implies that there is a
                        ~0 = Q
corner equilibrium with Q       ~ h . In this case, there can also be other equilibria. To see this,
                                  0
consider z0 2 z ; z h (assuming the interval is nonempty). Then, we have:

                                              2                             2
                        F (1; z0 ) =                  (g + ) <                      (g + ) = 0.                 (A.13)
                                          0 (z0 )                        0 (z   )

Here, the inequality follows since z0 > z and the equality follows from the de…nition of z . This
                                                ~ 0 = 1. In particular in this case Q
implies that there is a corner equilibrium with Q                                   ~0 = Q~ h and
                                                                                                                0
~ 0 = 1 are both corner equilibria. This completes the proof of the proposition.

A.2.       Model with large-scale asset purchases
We next present the details of the extended analysis with LSAPs. We …rst describe the govern-
ment’s budget constraint and derive Eqs. (26) and (27). We then complete the characterization
of the equilibrium and prove Proposition 2. Finally, we provide a rationale for the government’s
objective function (35).

Government’s budget constraints.                      The government is endowed with some income (tax
receipts) in period 1 given by z1        g.   At the end of period 0, the government decides how much
to borrow,   bg0                                                                            ~ g0
                   0, and what fraction of the borrowed funds to invest in the risky asset, !                       0,
with the residual fraction invested in the safe asset. In period 1, the government collects the
tax receipts and the return on its investments, pays back its debt, and spends the residual. Its
budget constraint in period 1 can be written as:

                         cg1 = z1   g
                                        + bg0 !
                                              ~ g0 exp (r (z0 ; z1 ))           ~ g0 exp rf
                                                                                !                 ,             (A.14)

where cg1 denotes government spending in period 1.
      We next rewrite the budget constraint in (A:14) to make it parallel to the agents’ budget
constraint in (A:3). Eq. (2) implies z1 = z0 Q0 exp (r (z0 ; z1 )). Substituting this into the budget
constraint, we obtain:

                   cg1 = z0 Q0      g
                                        exp (r (z0 ; z1 )) + bg0 !
                                                                 ~ g0 exp (r (z0 ; z1 ))      bg0 !
                                                                                                  ~ g0 exp rf
                                           bg0 !
                                               ~ g0                             bg0 !
                                                                                    ~ g0
                       = ag0        1+                exp (r (z0 ; z1 ))                 exp rf
                                             ag0                                  ag0
                       = ag0 ! g0 exp (r (z0 ; z1 )) + (1                ! g0 ) exp rf
                                                            bg0 !
                                                                ~ g0
            where ag0 = z0 Q0       g
                                        and ! g0 = 1 +               .
                                                              ag0

The second line de…nes and substitutes the e¤ective wealth of the government, ag0 , and the third
line de…nes and substitutes the e¤ective portfolio weight, ! g0 . This establishes Eqs. (26) and
(27) in the main text. The government can be e¤ectively thought of as starting with the present
discounted value of its tax receipts and choosing a weight on the market portfolio that re‡ects
its implicit holding of risky tax receipts as well as its additional investments.

Characterization of equilibrium with LSAPs. Consider the analogue of the function
(A:7) that incorporates LSAPs:

                                                   2 (1                 )
                        ~ 0 ; z0 ;
                      F Q                =                                                ~0
                                                                                    + log Q    (g + )              (A.15)
                                                     l0     0   (   b       h
                                                                                )
                                             0                 ~0
                                                            z0 Q
                                             h                      b           h
                           where     0   =       +      0                            .

                            ~0 2 Q
Every interior equilibrium, Q    ~ h ( ) ; 1 , corresponds to a zero of this function. Conversely,
                                   0
                                                           ~0 2 Q
any zero of the function that falls in the interior range, Q    ~ h ( ) ; 1 , corresponds to an
                                                                  0
equilibrium. The zeros that fall outside this range do not correspond to an equilibrium. There
                             ~ 0 = 1 i¤ F (1; z0 ; ) 0; and there is a corner equilibrium with
is a corner equilibrium with Q
Q~0 = Q~ h i¤ F Q ~ h ; z0 ; 0. Finally, the function F Q  ~ 0 ; z0 ; satis…es the same property
         0            0
that we established for the special case with                   = 0: one of cases (A:10) and (A:11) holds.

Proof of Proposition 2. Suppose z h ( ) < z ( ) and consider a shock z0 2 z h ( ) ; z ( ) .
Following the same steps as in Proposition 1, there exists a unique equilibrium that corresponds
to the (greater) zero of the function, F Q~ 0 ; z0 ; , that falls in the range, Q
                                                                                ~0 2 Q~h ( ) ; 1 .
Consider the comparative statics with respect to the size of the LSAPs, . Eq. (A:15) implies
that increasing shifts the function, F Q~ 0 ; z0 ; , downward. This increases the (greater) zero
                                                 dQ~0
and raises the equilibrium price, that is,        d       > 0.

Government’s objective function. We next provide a rationale for the functional form
assumptions in the government’s objective function (35). For concreteness, suppose there is a
future generation of agents (born in period 1) that are the residual claimant from the govern-
ment’s positions and thus consume cg1 . The future generation’s utility function is similar to
the other agents’(constant relative risk aversion) with risk tolerance                           g.   We also simplify the
setup by merging the other agents (banks and households) into a single agent, which we refer
to as the market, with risk tolerance        m.   Finally, suppose the government assigns the relative
Pareto weights    g   and 1 to the future generation and the market— chosen to match their relative
endowments. We set up a constrained Pareto problem in which the government’s only policy
tool is to choose ! g0      1. We we show that the objective function is the same as (35) with
 m   =   0 (1).




                                                            33
       First consider the characterization of equilibrium for a given ! g0   1. Suppose m <
 2        g  g
     (1 (!0 1))
          +g      , which implies there is a demand recession in period 0 despite the LSAP (the
other case is similar). Following the same steps in Section 3, the equilibrium in period 0 features
rf = 0 and the asset price [cf. (34)]:

As before, the asset price is increasing in ! g0 . The market clearing condition is:

                                                        g g

      We next calculate the market’s equilibrium utility. Using Eqs. (A:4) ; (A:6), and (5), we
have:

                            z0 Q0                                             e z0

                                                                                  2 m 0

terms into u0 .
      Next consider the future generation. They have the same utility function as the other agents
but with risk tolerance    g.   Their exact utility function is given by [cf. (A:4                       A:5)]:

                            ug;exact
                             1       = e          log RCE;g ag0 with ag0 = z0 Q0 g ,
                                                  h                g    g
                                                                          i g =( g 1)
                  where RCE;g;exact =            E (Rp (z0 ; z1 ))( 1)=

                    and Rp (z0 ; z1 ) =          ! g0 exp (r (z0 ; z1 )) + (1          ! g0 ) exp rf         .

Applying the log-Normal approximation (similar to the other agents), we write this as [cf. (A:6)]:



                   ug1 = e         log RCE;g + log (z0              g

This problem is similar to the one we solve in the main text. In particular, the objective function
is the same as in (35) after replacing          m   =   0 (1),   which provides a rationale for the functional
forms.13

    This analysis also clari…es the role of the Pareto weights, 1 and g . These weights are chosen to match the
agents’initial endowments, which ensures that the pecuniary externalities generated by the changes in the price
of the market portfolio “net out” [see (A:18)].
