The Great Depression and the Great Recession: A View from Financial Markets

                                         ABSTRACT

Similarities between the Great Depression and the Great Recession are documented with respect
to the behavior of financial markets. A Great Depression regime is identified by using a Markov-
switching VAR. The probability of this regime has remained close to zero for many decades, but
spiked for a short period during the most recent financial crisis, the Great Recession. The Great
Depression regime implies a collapse of the stock market, with small-growth stocks
outperforming small-value stocks. A model with financial frictions and uncertainty about policy
makers’ intervention suggests that policy intervention during the Great Recession might have
avoided a second Great Depression. A multi-country analysis shows that the Great Depression
and Great Recession were not like any other financial crises.

1    Introduction
The recent …nancial crisis had pervasive consequences, leading the U.S. economy to its longest and
most severe recession since World War II. Arguably, the crisis started with the end of a housing
bubble that, in turn, led to the collapse of the subprime market. From there, in the span of a
few months, it spread to the whole banking sector and then to the real economy. The decline in
real economic activity accelerated in the fall of 2008 as the …nancial crisis unfolded. U.S. gross
domestic product fell by 5% in a year, while the unemployment rate increased from less than 5%
to 10%. The large contraction in real activity came with an equally dramatic decline in stock
prices, with the S&P 500 index dropping by almost 57% from its October 2007 peak of 1 565 to
a mere 6765 in March 2009. The possibility of a complete …nancial meltdown suddenly became a
real concern and commentators and policymakers alike feared that the economy could be heading
toward a second Great Depression (Krugman, 2009).
    This paper is interested in studying to what extent the two events are in fact similar by
focusing on the behavior of …nancial markets. The stock market and real economy are not always
in sync. The stock market presents large ‡uctuations both at low and high frequencies that
are not immediately reconcilable with the behavior of the real economy. However, both the Great
Depression and the Great Recession showed a strong connection between the stock market and the
real economy, as shown in Figure 1. The …rst two panels report the evolution of the price-earnings
ratio and industrial production over the …rst four years of the Great Depression and the Great
Recession. In both cases, the starting points are normalized to 100. The starting dates are August
1928 and April 2008 for the Great Depression and the Great Recession, respectively. As pointed out
by Eichengreen and O’rourke (2010), over the …rst year, the two events looked remarkably similar,
with both the stock market and industrial production experiencing rapid declines. However, after
these initial drops, both real activity and the stock market recovered fairly quickly during the
Great Recession, while the same cannot be said about the Great Depression.
    The strong connection between the two series is even more evident if we focus on ‡uctuations at
business cycle frequencies. These are obtained with a bandpass …lter and are reported in the third
panel of Figure 1. While stock market ‡uctuations are not always in sync with the real economy,
both during the Great Depression and the Great Recession the commovement is remarkably strong.
This is made evident by the last panel of the …gure that reports the correlation between the two
series at business cycle frequencies over a 10-year moving window. Over the sample this correlation
can be quite low or even negative, but during the Great Depression and the Great Recession it
was remarkably close to 1. This suggests that the study of …nancial markets can provide valuable
information about the similarities and di¤erences between the two events.
    In order to formally assess to what extent …nancial markets during the Great Recession mir-
rored their behavior during the Great Depression, I …rst estimate a Markov-switching vector
autoregression (MS-VAR) that allows for both changes in the VAR coe¢ cients and in the covari-

Figure 1: Stock market and real activity during the Great Depression and the Great Recession. The
…rst row reports the evolution of the Price-earnings ratio and industrial production during the Great Depression
and the Great Recession. The starting points are normalized to 100. The starting dates are August 1928 and April
2008 for the Great Depression and the Great Recession, respectively. The left panel in the second row reports
the evolution of the two variables at business cycle frequencies. The right panel in the second row computes the
correlation betweent the two series at business cycle frequencies over a 10-year moving window.



ance matrix that characterizes the contemporaneous relations and volatilities of the disturbances.
I include four key …nancial variables: the excess market return, the Term Yield spread, the Price
Earnings ratio, and the Value spread. The excess market return captures the performance of the
stock market with respect to a risk-free rate. The Term Yield spread measures the slope of the
term structure of interest rates that in turn has predictive power for future real activity. The
Price Earnings ratio can be considered a measure of market imbalance as it tends to be negatively
correlated with future returns. Finally, the Value spread measures the di¤erence between the
log book-to-market ratios of small value and small growth stocks. Given that this last variable
moves up when small growth stocks perform relatively better, it can be considered a proxy for the
behavior of the cross section of asset returns.
    A Great Depression regime emerges from the estimates. A central feature of this regime is that
it implies a large collapse of the stock market with a contemporaneous large increase in the Value
spread, suggesting that growth stocks perform relatively better than value stocks during …nancial
crises. As implied by its name, this regime characterized the behavior of the stock market during
the Great Depression, when the Price Earnings ratio and the Value spread touched the historical
minimum and maximum, respectively. For the remainder of the sample, its probability has been
close to zero until the early months of 2009. Therefore, the Great Recession shows a resurgence of
this regime, even if for only two months. The probability of the Great Depression regime crossed
the threshold of 50% in February 2009 for the …rst time since November 1948. However, it quickly
returned to zero in March, arguably because of government interventions that were e¤ective in


                                                       2
preventing a …nancial meltdown and led to a reversal in the behavior of the stock market and the
Value spread.
    In order to reinforce this point, I use counterfactual simulations to show that since the start-
ing of the Great Recession in mid-2008 until February 2009, …nancial markets were on a path
consistent with the Great Depression regime: a persistent fall in the stock market paired with a
contemporaneous increase in the Value spread. This opposite moving relation between the be-
havior of the stock market as a whole and the relative performance of growth stocks was absent
during another important market decline: The end of the Information Technology (IT) bubble. In
that case, the Value spread and the Price Earnings ratios were moving together. This suggests
that market declines that are associated with …nancial crises might be inherently di¤erent and
that monitoring the relative performance of growth and value portfolios during these events might
be useful in understanding where markets are headed.
    The similarities between the Great Depression and the Great Recession extend beyond the level
dynamics that are implied by the VAR coe¢ cients. Even the innovations present some interesting
features. First, both periods were characterized by high volatility. More interestingly, both during
the stock market crash that opened the Great Depression and the fall in the stock market that
characterized the beginning of the Great Recession, shocks to market returns and the Value spread
were negatively correlated. This has an important implication for asset pricing because it implies
that during crises, innovations to the relative return of growth stocks move in an opposite direction
with respect to stock market returns.
    The second part of the paper is devoted to substantiating the idea that policy intervention
during the Great Recession might have been key to avoid a second Great Depression. I argue
that policy intervention was crucial because it restored the functioning of the …nancial sector. To
make this point, I extend the model by Gertler and Karadi (2011) in two ways. First, I allow for
the possibility of a large shock to the parameter controlling the limits to …nancial intermediaries’
leverage ability. This has the e¤ect of generating a drastic and sudden reduction in bank lending,
a recession, and a fall in asset values. Second, I allow for uncertainty about the way policymakers
will react to this shock. In particular, I allow for uncertainty about whether unconventional
monetary policy, broadly de…ned, will be implemented or not. I show that a policy intervention
helps in mitigating the recession and it has an immediate e¤ect on asset values very similar to
what presented in Figure 1. This result provides an explanation for why the Great Recession
started looking di¤erent from the Great Depression once the Troubled Asset Relief Program was
introduced.
    The importance of the policy response can also be useful to understand the di¤erent experiences
of developed economies during …nancial crises. Section 5 looks at …nancial crises across space and
time. From this analysis, a series of interesting results emerge. First, the Great Depression and the
Great Recession were unique to the extent that were global phenomena. They both originated in
the United States and spread to many developed economies. Thus, their e¤ects on the economies

                                                 3
that were a¤ected were substantially more severe when compared to other …nancial crises. Second,
while the US economy and stock market recovered relatively quickly from the 2008 …nancial crisis,
the same cannot be said of many European economies. Arguably the di¤erence is due to the very
di¤erent policy responses observed in the two economic areas. Third, the pattern of a stock market
decline paired with an increase in the value spread during the Great Recession seems common to
other modern economies.
    Given that the results on the dynamics of the Value Spread point toward the existence of
an interesting link between major …nancial crises and the cross section of asset returns, I devote
the last part of the paper to a detailed analysis of the implications of the Great Depression and
the Great Recession for the cross section of asset returns. I reconsider the Bad Beta, Good Beta
Intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) proposed by Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004). The model is
based on the idea that unexpected excess returns can be decomposed into news about future cash
‡ows and news about future discount rates. The ICAPM predicts that the price of risk for the
discount-rate beta should equal the variance of unexpected market returns, while the price of risk
for the cash-‡ow beta should be times greater, where is the investor’s coe¢ cient of relative
risk aversion.
    As a …rst step, the VAR methodology used to derive the news is extended in order to re‡ect the
possibility of regime changes. The ICAPM is then tested over di¤erent subsamples to highlight the
importance of the two …nancial crises. Speci…cally, I use moving windows of 35 years starting from
the late 1920s until the recent crisis. The results provide support for the idea that severe …nancial
crises play an important role in explaining the cross section of asset returns. During the early
years of the sample, the ICAPM performs well in explaining the 25 Fama-French portfolios sorted
with respect to size and book-to-market ratios. However, as the data window moves away from
the Great Depression, the explanatory power of the ICAPM starts to slowly decline. However,
as the window approaches the most recent …nancial crisis, the explanatory power of the ICAPM
increases steeply, and the 2 touches 60%, a value that was last reached at the end of 1978.
    In order to highlight why the Great Recession plays such an important role in improving the
…t of the ICAPM, I show that the return of medium size growth stocks was visibly lower than the
expected return implied by the ICAPM during the 1980s and 1990s. In other words, the return
on these stocks was too low in light of a general increase in their risk level as captured by their
discount rate and cash-‡ow betas. Symmetrically, returns on value stocks were quite high with
respect to what was predicted by the ICAPM. In both cases, the anomalies were largely corrected
during the Great Recession. This result suggests that the relative performance of these two classes
of stocks during regular times might be compensated by their behavior during …nancial crises.
    Furthermore, …nancial crises are also important in shaping agents’expectations. This conclu-
sion can be inferred by comparing the explanatory power of the ICAPM under the benchmark
case, in which fully rational agents form expectations taking into account the possibility of regime
changes, with an alternative scenario in which agents form expectations disregarding the possibil-

                                                 4
ity of regime changes. This latter case corresponds to the case of anticipated utility: at each point
in time, agents assume that the probabilities of the two regimes will not change in the future.
I show that the benchmark case in which agents consider the existence of the Great Depression
regime delivers substantially better results.
    As a methodological contribution, this paper proposes a simple algorithm to estimate a Markov-
switching VAR in reduced form with Bayesian methods. An MS-VAR allows for an analytical
characterization of the news along the lines of the VAR approach proposed by Campbell (1991)
to implement the present value decomposition of Campbell and Shiller (1988). The formulas
presented in the paper can be easily modi…ed to handle other models that make use of a present
value decomposition to allow for the possibility of structural breaks. This approach, which formally
isolates periods characterized by unusual dynamics, might also prove useful in explaining why the
present value decomposition methodology is often sensitive to the sample choice. Furthermore, the
Markov-switching extension can easily accommodate temporary non-stationary regimes as long as
the system as a whole is stable.
    I argued above that the …nancial crises that coincided with the Great Depression and the
Great Recession are di¤erent from other …nancial crises. From this point of view, they can be
considered rare events. Thus, this paper is also related to the growing rare disasters literature
(Rietz (1988), Barro (2006, 2009), Nakamura et al. (2013), Gabaix (2012), Bollerslev and Todorov
(2011), Wachter (2013), Gourio (2012), Bai et al. (2015), Julliard and Ghosh (2012), among
others).
    The paper is also connected to the vast literature on the cross section of asset returns. Zhang
(2005) shows that the value anomaly arises naturally due to costly reversibility and the counter-
cyclical price of risk. Campbell et al. (2013) highlight that the 2007-2009 market fall was not
o¤set by improving stock return forecasts as in the stock market downturn of 2000-2002, while
Campbell et al. (2014) extend the approximate closed-form intertemporal capital asset pricing
model of Campbell (1993) to allow for stochastic volatility. With respect to their work, I do not
impose the restriction that all volatilities have to move in parallel, I allow the covariance structure
of the disturbances to vary over time, and I model the possibility of regime changes in the VAR
coe¢ cients and, consequently, in the way agents map shocks into the news about future discount
rates and future cash ‡ows. To the best of my knowledge, this feature is new in the literature.
Given that the primary interest of this paper is to assess the role of the Great Recession and the
Great Depression, I do not price volatility when studying the cross section of asset returns. The
possibility of merging the two approaches is an interesting path for future research.
    Markov-switching models are quite popular in …nancial econometrics. See Lettau et al. (2008),
Ang and Bekaert (2002), Pesaran et al. (2006), Gulen et al. (2011), Gulen et al. (2011), and Bianchi
et al. (2016) among others. With respect to these contributions, I use a multivariate model with
two separate processes controlling the VAR coe¢ cients and the volatilities, while the literature
often utilizes univariate processes in which a single chain controls all parameters of the model.

                                                  5
Allowing for two separate chains is important because volatility changes would otherwise tend to
dominate other regime breaks (see Ang and Timmermann (2012) and Sims and Zha (2006)).
   The content of this paper can be summarized as follows. In Section 2, I present the MS-VAR
used to assess the presence of similarities between the Great Depression and the Great Recession.
Section 3 reports the results for the MS-VAR estimates. In Section 4, I present the macro model
with …nancial frictions and policy uncertainty. Section 5 shows that the Great Depression and the
Great Recession were not like any other …nancial crisis. Section 6 presents the implications of the
two events for the cross section of asset returns. In Section 7, I conclude.


2     The Model
In this section, I present the MS-VAR use to study the similarities between the Great Depression
and the Great Recession.


2.1    A Markov-switching VAR
The  is a (    1) vector of data evolves according to a Markov-switching VAR with one lag:

                                                              12
                                   =   +   ¬1 +                                          (1)
                                       h        i       


                                   
                                     =          (0 )                                    (2)

where the unobserved states  and  can take on a …nite number of values,  = 1      and
 = 1       and follow two independent Markov chains. This represents a convenient way to
model heteroskedasticity and to allow for the possibility of changes in the dynamics of the state
variables. The probability of moving from one state to another is given by  [  = j ¬1 = ] = 
and  [  = j ¬1 = ] =  .
      Given  = [ ] and  = [ ] and a prior distribution for the initial state, we can compute
the likelihood of the parameters of the model, conditional on the initial observation 0 . The
likelihood can then be combined with a prior probability for the parameters of the model to obtain
their posterior probability. A by-product of the likelihood calculation are the …ltered probabilities
for Markov-switching states: j and j  where each element of the two vectors is de…ned by
                  
  j =  [  = j    
                                ] and j =  [  = j          ] for all  at each 
where   = f g=1 . Therefore, the …ltered estimates represent the probabilities assigned to the
di¤erent regimes conditional on the model parameters and the data up to time . These can be
converted by a recursive algorithm to smoothed estimates: j and j  where each element of
the two vectors is given by  [  = j          ] and  [  = j          ].
These are probabilities for the di¤erent regimes conditional on the model parameters and the
whole dataset   = f g=1 

                                                  6
2.2    Dataset and Bayesian inference
The vector  contains four state variables: The excess log return on the CRSP value-weighted
index ( ), the Term Yield spread in percentage points (  ), measured as the yield di¤erence
between ten-year constant-maturity taxable bonds and short-term taxable notes, the log price
earning ratio (  ), and the small-stock value-spread (  ), the di¤erence in the log book-to-
market ratios of small-value and small-growth stocks. The sample spans the period from December
1928 to June 2009.
    The construction of the series follows Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004). The excess market
return is computed as the di¤erence between the log return on the Center for Research in Se-
curities Prices (CRSP) value-weighted stock index and the rate on three-month Treasury bills.
The Term Yield spread is computed using data available on Global Financial Data by taking the
yield di¤erence between 10-year constant-maturity taxable bonds and short-term taxable notes,
in percentage points. The Price Earnings ratio (Shiller, 2000) is the log of the ratio between the
price of the S&P 500 index and a 10-year moving average of aggregate earnings of companies in
the S&P 500 index. In line with the literature, earnings are averaged to avoid spikes in the Price
Earnings ratio caused by cyclical ‡uctuations in earnings. The moving average is lagged by one
quarter in order to ensure that all components of the time- Price Earnings ratio are observable
at time .
    The small-stock Value spread is constructed by using the six “elementary”portfolios available
on Professor French’s website. These elementary portfolios, which are constructed at the end of
each June, are the intersections of two portfolios based on size (market equity,  ) and three
portfolios formed on the ratio of book equity to market equity ( ). The size breakpoint
for year  is the median NYSE market equity at the end of June of year . The book-to-market
ratio for June of year  is the book equity for the last …scal year end in  ¬ 1 divided by   for
December of  ¬ 1. The   breakpoints are the 30th and 70th NYSE percentiles.
    At the end of June of year , the small-stock Value spread is given by the di¤erence between
the ln( ) of the small high-book-to-market portfolio and the ln( ) of the small low-
book-to-market portfolio. For months July through May, the small-stock Value spread is updated
by adding the cumulative log return from the previous June on the small low-book-to-market
portfolio minus the cumulative log return on the small high-book-to-market portfolio to the end-
of-June small-stock Value spread. Therefore, an increase in the Value spread re‡ects the fact that
small-growth stocks are outperforming small-value stocks.
    The model is estimated with Bayesian methods. Proper priors are put on all the parameters in
the model. The priors for all parameters are very loose and identical across the di¤erent regimes.
This implies that the features of the regimes are not restricted and that di¤erences will arise
only because of the data. Appendix A describes the priors in detail. I also impose covariance
stationarity by adopting the concept of mean square stability. An MS model is mean square


                                                7
stable if both the …rst and second moments converge.1 The posterior is obtained combining the
likelihood with the priors. Appendix B describes how to compute the likelihood and the regime
probabilities for a given set of parameters. I …rst search for the posterior mode maximizing the
sum of the logarithm of the priors and the log-likelihood. This is an important step because MS
models tend to have multiple peaks. I then employ a Gibbs sampling algorithm to draw from
the posterior distribution. The algorithm is described in detail in Appendix C. I use 1,000,000
Gibbs sampling iterations of which one every 100 are retained. Convergence is checked using the
methods suggested by Geweke (1992) and Raftery and Lewis (1992).


3       The Great Depression and The Great Recession
In what follows I highlight the similarities and di¤erences between the Great Depression and the
Great Recession.


3.1     Parameter estimates and regime probabilities
This subsection reports parameter estimates and regime probabilities for the MS-VAR described
above. The number of regimes for the VAR coe¢ cients is equal to two,  = 2, while the number
of regimes for the covariance matrix is equal to three,  = 3.2 Therefore, we have a total of six
possible regime combinations. Figure 2 shows the smoothed and …ltered probabilities of Regime 1
for the VAR coe¢ cients (  = 1) at the posterior mode, while Figure 3 reports the smoothed and
…ltered probabilities for Regime 1 and Regime 3 for the covariance matrices (  = 1 and  = 3).
Table 1 reports posterior mode and 68% error bands for the parameters of the Markov-switching
VAR.
    I shall start by analyzing the results for the VAR coe¢ cients. The upper panel of Figure 2
contains the …ltered and smoothed probabilities of Regime 1 for the VAR coe¢ cients (  = 1)
together with the evolution of the Price Earnings ratio and the Value spread, where the variables
have been normalized to …t in the graph. I report both the …ltered and smoothed probabilities
because they convey di¤erent information. We can think about the …ltered probability as the
probability that would be attached to a particular regime by an agent that was aware of all
parameters of the model except for the regime in place at time . In other words, this is the
    1
      Mean square stability holds if and only if all the eigenvalues of the matrix   (1 1 ...   )(
2 ) are inside the unit circle where  is a matrix operator that takes a sequence of matrices and construct a
block diagonal matrix. Please refer to Costa et al. (2004) and Bianchi (2016) for more details.
    2
      I also estimated versions of the model with two and four volatilities regimes. When only two volatilities regimes
are considered, I run into the problem that shifts in VAR coe¢ cients are used to compensate for the small number
of volatility regimes. This is a problem that has been noted in the literature: When trying to identify “structural”
changes in a VAR, it is important to control for stochastic volatility (see, for example, Sims and Zha (2006)). Two

probability that an agent would attach to Regime 1 at time  if she knew the VAR coe¢ cients,
the covariance matrices, the transition matrices, and only the data up to time . Instead, the
smoothed probabilities re‡ect all the information contained in the dataset. This is the probability
that an agent would attach to Regime 1 at time  if she knew the VAR coe¢ cients, the covariance
matrices, the transition matrices, and the whole dataset up to time  .
    In order to facilitate the interpretation of the results, the second row of the …gure focuses on
three key events: The Great Depression, the IT bubble, and the Great Recession. Regime 1 clearly
dominates the …rst decade, a period characterized by large market crashes and an unusually high
level for the Value spread. The behavior of the Value spread and the price earning ratio in the
early 1930s is worth noting. The largest stock market crash of U.S. history came with a substantial
increase in the Value spread that reached historic heights. In other words, during the most severe
recession that the U.S. has ever experienced, growth stocks were outperforming value stocks, and
this situation of disequilibrium lasted for more than a decade. The probability of this regime went
down only around 1942, when the U.S. started winning WWII. A rational agent who is trying to
hedge against risk is likely to …nd this pattern extremely informative. From here forward I will
refer to Regime 1 as the Great Depression regime, while I will name Regime 2 the Regular times
regime.
    After the 1930s, the probability of the Great Depression regime has generally been close to
zero. However, a visible increase in the probability occurred in correspondence with the recent
…nancial crisis. The increase is much larger for the …ltered probability than for the smoothed
probability. This implies that an agent that had been observing the market in real time would
have attached a much larger probability to entering a depression-like regime, while ex-post, with


                                                        9
the bene…t of the hindsight, the same agent would have concluded that the probability of having
observed a manifestation of the Great Depression regime was in fact much smaller. However, even
in this latter case, in which the entire dataset is used to infer the smoothed probabilities, we cannot
rule out the possibility that during the …rst two months of 2009, …nancial markets’behavior was
in line with what occurred during the dawn of the Great Depression.
    While there are other periods of time during which we observe an increase in the …ltered
probability of the Great Depression regime, the second month of 2009 was the …rst time that such
a probability crossed 50% since November 1948, a period marked by the rise of the Cold War, the
…rst Israeli-Arab war, and the unexpected presidential election victory of the incumbent President
Truman over the Republican candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. Similarly, in the …rst two months of
2009, the smoothed probability crossed the 5% value for the …rst time since September 1942, i.e.,
since World War II. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that these results are even stronger if we were
to recursively estimate the model. In this case, the probability assigned to the Great Depression
regime would be larger than 80% in February 2009. Appendix F reports results for this alternative
approach.
    Later, I will investigate more in depth what could explain the increase in the probability of
the Great Depression regime at the beginning of 2009. For now, it is enough to point out that the
spike in the probability of the Great Depression regime at the beginning of 2009 coincides with a
deep decline in the Price Earnings ratio combined with a substantial increase in the Value spread.
In other words, the price earning ratio and the Value spread are moving in opposite directions
in a way that is very similar to what occurred during the early years of the Great Depression.
In this respect, it is quite instructive to compare the Great Recession stock market decline with
the end of the IT bubble. In this second case, the Value spread and the Price Earnings ratio
were moving in parallel. Recall that the Value spread tends to rise when growth stocks perform
relatively better than value stocks. Given that the rise and burst of the IT bubble were mostly
driven by IT stocks, it is not surprising that the two variables were moving together. Nevertheless,
this evidence suggests that stock market crashes that are associated with …nancial crises might
have very di¤erent implications for the relative performance of growth and value stocks. This is
why the probability of the Great Depression regime does not increase every time that the Price
Earnings ratio falls, but it is more likely to do so if such a fall is associated with a contemporaneous
increase in the Value spread.
    The two regimes are strongly identi…ed and the parameter estimates present some distinctive
features. First of all, the autoregressive component for excess returns is substantially larger under
the Great Depression regime (  = 1), while the autoregressive components for the Term Yield
spread, the Price Earnings ratio, and the Value spread are substantially smaller. A high price
earning ratio predicts low stock market returns in both regimes, but the e¤ect is signi…cantly
stronger under the Great Depression regime. The Value spread enters the excess return and Price
Earnings ratio equations with a positive sign in both regimes, but the coe¢ cients are substantially

larger under the Great Depression regime. Finally, the coe¢ cients of the Term Yield spread and
of the Price Earnings ratio in the Value spread equation are positive under the Great Depression
regime, while they are smaller and negative in the Regular times regime (  = 2). Before proceed-
ing, it is worth emphasizing that the dynamic properties of the model do not only depend on the
VAR coe¢ cients: Regime changes can also induce strong commovements between the variables of
interest. These aspects will be analyzed in the next subsection.
    Some interesting patterns emerge from the analysis of the covariance matrix estimates and
their corresponding probabilities. Regime 2 (  = 2) can be regarded as the Low volatility regime,
showing the lowest values for the standard deviations of all innovations. Regime 1 (  = 1)
presents an increase of the magnitude for all shocks, but especially for the innovations to Term
Yield spread. Looking at Figure 3, we can see that this regime mostly prevails during the early
years of the Volcker chairmanship when the Federal Reserve was targeting reserves with the result
of generating high volatility in the FFR and, consequently, the yield spread. I will refer to this
regime as the Term Yield volatility regime. Regime 3 (  = 3) is instead characterized by a
more modest increase in the volatility of the Term Yield spread innovations, but a much larger
increase in the volatility of the other shocks. Interestingly, Regime 3 prevails for extended periods
of time during the 1930s, the 2001 IT bubble burst, and the 2008/9 …nancial crisis. So it can
be considered an High Uncertainty regime across several dimensions. The correlation structure
of the innovations is also worth noting. Under the High Uncertainty regime, innovations to the
Value spread are strongly negatively correlated with innovations to the excess return and Price
Earnings equations. This is in sharp contrast with the positive sign that prevails under the other

                                                        12
two regimes and implies that small growth stocks tend, in relative terms, to move against the
market. Similarly, the correlation of Term Yield innovations with Price Earnings ratio and excess
return innovations is strongly negative under the High Uncertainty regime, while under the other
two regimes the correlation is slightly negative (Low volatility regime) or centered on zero (Term
Yield volatility regime).
    Finally, the parameter values for the transition matrix reported at the bottom of Table 1
show that for the VAR coe¢ cients, the Great Depression regime is signi…cantly less persistent and
frequent than the Regular times regime, consistent with the idea that the Great Depression was a
rare event. As for the transition matrix of the innovation covariance matrix, Regime 2, the Low
volatility regime, is the most persistent, followed by the Term Yield volatility regime and the High
volatility regime. Their unconditional probabilities are 77.8%, 11.3%, and 10.9%. These estimates
imply that the low volatility regime prevails most of the time with relatively frequent but short
lasting deviations to the Term Yield volatility regime and the High volatility regime.


3.2    Entering the Great Depression
As mentioned above, regime changes also play a key role in shaping the dynamic properties of
the model. In fact, regime changes can be regarded as shocks themselves and can have fairly
long lasting consequences. In order to understand the role played by regime changes and at the
same time capture the salient features of the Great Depression, Figure 4 reports a simulation in
which all Gaussian shocks are set to zero, and regimes follow their most likely path based on the
smoothed probabilities at the posterior mode. The initial values coincide with the actual data.
The simulated series are reported with a solid blue line, while the red dashed line corresponds
to the actual data. The two horizontal lines mark the regime-speci…c conditional steady states.
These are the values to which the variables would converge if a regime were in place forever.
    The …rst aspect that emerges from this simulation is that a change from the Regular times
regime to the Great Depression regime determines a sharp drop in the stock market and a contem-
poraneous increase in the Value spread and the Term Yield spread. The drop in the stock market
tends to be very large, and it overshoots with respect to the conditional steady state of the Great
Depression regime. Therefore, after a dramatic fall, the stock market partially recovers, while the
Value spread and Term Yield spread keep moving toward their corresponding conditional steady
states. Notice that the short break in the realization of the Great Depression regime that is identi-
…ed in the estimates coincides with a partial recovery in the stock market and a contemporaneous
fall in the Value spread. However, once the model returns to the Great Depression regime the
variables tend to follow a path similar to the one that was prevailing before the break. Overall,
during the 1930s the regime sequence plays an important role in tracking the behavior of the three
variables, implying that the Great Depression regime captures some salient features of the Great
Depression.

zero, and regimes follow their most likely path based on the smoothed probabilities at the posterior mode. The

    Once the economy returns to the Regular times regime, the model predicts a quick fall in
the Value spread and the Term Yield spread. The stock market moves in the opposite direction,
showing a steady increase and converging to the higher Regular times conditional steady state. It
is also important to emphasize that the conditional steady state for the Great Depression regime
is never really reached by the Value spread and the Price Earnings ratio. This is because both in
the estimation and in the simulation, the Great Depression regime is not in place long enough to
allow for convergence to the conditional steady state.3
    Figure 5 focuses on the last months of the sample to better understand the similarities and
the di¤erences between the Great Depression and the Great Recession. The …gure reports two
simulations in which all Gaussian shocks have been set to zero starting from February 2009, the
month in which the …ltered probability of the Great Recession regime spiked. In the …rst simulation
(solid blue line), a counterfactual regime sequence is assumed: starting from February 2009, the
Great Depression regime prevails until the end of the sample. In the second simulation, the actual
regime sequence is assumed to be in place. The red dotted line corresponds to the data. Notice
that until February 2009, the three series coincide. Therefore, the two simulations can be used to
understand why the probability of the Great Depression regime increased in the very beginning of
2009, but then quickly fell in March 2009. Furthermore, the simulations shed light on what agents
were likely to expect in the moment that the probability of the Great Depression regime spiked.
    As already noted above, since the end of 2008 and until February 2009, the stock market
experienced a prolonged fall associated with a contemporaneous increase in the Value spread.
This behavior is remarkably similar to what is observed in the beginning of the Great Depression.
   3
    In Markov-switching models this is a fairly common …nding. If the variables converge or not to their conditional
steady states depends on the interaction between the persistence of the regime and the persistence of the variables
under such a regime.

Figure 5: The Great Recession. The …gure reports two simulations in which all Gaussian shocks have been
set to zero starting from March 2009. In the …rst simulation (solid blue line) a counterfactual regime sequence is
assumed: Starting from March 2009 the Great Depression regime prevails until the end of the sample. In the second
simulation the actual regime sequence is assumed to be in place. The red dotted line corresponds to the data.



The solid blue line shows what would have happened if starting February 2009 the economy had
in fact entered the Great Depression regime: The Price Earnings ratio and the Value spread would
have kept moving in exactly the same fashion, while excess returns would have stayed negative. In
other words, the counterfactual simulation highlights that until February 2009 …nancial markets
were in fact on a path very similar to what implied by the Great Depression regime. However, in
March 2009, these dynamics reverted. Excess stock market returns increased and became positive,
the Price Earnings ratio recovered, and the Value spread started declining. The black dashed line
shows that the return to the Regular times regime captures these changes, even if in the data the
movements were somehow more pronounced. Recall that this is a period of high volatility, so the
discrepancy between the "regime only" simulation and the actual data should not be surprising.
    In light of these …ndings, it is then interesting to review the main events that characterized the
beginning of the Great Recession. An early ‡ag emerged in June 2007, with the collapse of two
hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns. Less than one year later, in March 2008, the Federal Reserve
had to intervene in order to prevent the Bear Stearns bankruptcy by assuming $30 billion in
liabilities and engineering a sale to JPMorgan Chase. From that moment on, the crisis accelerated
with the Treasury Department taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on September 7, Lehman
brothers …ling for the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history one week later (September 15), and
the Federal Reserve bailing out AIG. In December 2008, unemployment reached its highest value
in 15 years and the Federal Reserve cut the FFR to zero. Over the same period of time, the Price
Earnings ratio kept moving down while the Value spread increased.
    President Obama took o¢ ce in January 2009, and Wall Street experienced the worst Inaugu-
ration Day drop ever (I am not claiming a causal relation between the two events). At this point,
fears that the U.S. might be heading toward a second Great Depression became widespread (Krug-
man, 2009). On February 10, the secretary of the Treasury Geithner outlined the plan for the
expansion of the government bank rescue e¤ort. The plan was received with some skepticism by

                                                                                  15
…nancial markets, arguably because it was lacking many important details (Solomon, 2009). As a
result, the market experienced a fall of almost 5%. A few days later, President Obama signed into
law a $787 billion stimulus package that included tax cuts and money for infrastructure, schools,
health care, and green energy. Even in this case, some commentators worried that the government
intervention might not be enough. In the meantime, the stock market experienced two weeks of
declines, reaching its lowest level in 12 years. Notice that it is in February that the probability of
the Great Depression regime crossed 50%. However, in March 2009, more encouraging economic
data were released and details of the rescue plan were disclosed. Arguably, this had a positive
e¤ect of the stock market that turned around. At the same time, the Value spread started moving
down and the probability of the Great Depression regime went back to values close to zero.
    In summary, the estimates and the counterfactual simulations suggest that during the second
half of 2008 and until February 2009, …nancial markets were on a path consistent with a switch to
the Great Depression regime: a falling Price Earnings ratio and an increasing Value spread. This
explains the increase in the probability of the Great Depression regime. These patterns came to
a stop in March 2009 when the government increased its e¤ort to prevent a …nancial meltdown
and to facilitate an economic recovery. This explains why in the estimates the …ltered probability
assigned to the Great Depression regime increased signi…cantly at the beginning of 2009, but it
quickly went back to zero: The economy did not enter a Great Depression, at least in terms of the
behavior of …nancial markets.


4    Policy Intervention and Asset Valuation
The results presented above suggest that during the Great Recession stock markets behaved in a
way consistent with their behavior during the Great Depression until the government outlined a
series of policy interventions. One important dimension of these policy interventions was to restore
the functioning of the banking sector. In this section, I present a simulation exercise based on
the model by Gertler and Karadi (2011) that shows that such policies have the e¤ect of reverting
a fall in asset valuation. With respect to the original model, I introduce two ingredients. First,
I allow for the possibility of a large shock to the parameter controlling the limits to …nancial
intermediaries’leverage ability. This has the e¤ect of generating a drastic and sudden reduction
in bank lending, a recession, and a fall in asset values. Second, I allow for uncertainty about the
way policymakers will react to this shock. In particular, I allow for uncertainty about whether
unconventional monetary policy will be implemented. I show that unconventional monetary policy,
broadly de…ned, helps in mitigating the recession and it has an immediate e¤ects on asset values.

4.1    The model
The model is based on Gertler and Karadi (2011). I focus on the parts of the model that are
di¤erent from the original model, while I only provide a brief descriptions of the parts that are
directly borrowed from Gertler and Karadi (2011).
    Households. The economy is populated by a continuum of households. Within each house-
hold there is a fraction  of bankers and a fraction 1 ¬  of workers. The probability of a banker
to remain a banker is . Bankers and workers engage in perfect consumption sharing within each
household. The representative household maximizes:

where  and  denote consumption and labor, is the discount factor,  is a parameter con-
trolling habits, and   0 is the Frisch elasticity of labor supply Intermediary deposits and
government debt are both assumed to be one-period real bonds that pay the gross real return  
In equilibrium, the instruments are both riskless and can then be considered perfect substitutes.
Thus, this condition is imposed from the beginning. Then the household budget constraint is:

                                     =   +          +  +   ¬ +1 

where +1 is the total amount of short term bonds the household acquires,  is the real wage,
   corresponds to net payouts to the household from ownership of both non-…nancial and …nancial

…rms, and  is a lump sum tax.
    Intermediaries. Financial intermediaries use funds obtained from households and their own
wealth to lend funds to non-…nancial …rms. The intermediary balance sheet is then given by:
  =  + +1  where  is the amount of wealth (net worth) that a banker/intermediary
 has at the end of period , +1 are the deposits obtained from households,  is the quantity
of …nancial claims on non-…nancial …rms, and  the relative price of each claim. Deposits pay
a risk-free rate  , while the return ;+1 of claims on non-…nancial …rms is stochastic return.
Thus, net worth  follows +1 = (;+1 ¬  )   +   New bankers receive funds equal
to a fraction  (1 ¬ ) of the assets of exiting bankers.
    Intermediaries’participation constraint requires a positive expected discounted spread

Thus, the value of being a …nancial intermediary increases with expected future interest rate
spreads, (;++1 ¬ + ), future asset levels + + , and the risk-free return on net worth.
   As long as the discounted risk adjusted premium is positive, intermediaries will want to expand
assets inde…nitely. Thus, the model assumes a monitoring problem. Financial intermediaries can
divert a time-varying fraction  of its assets back to the household every period, which produces
an incentive constraint that requires
                                                                                          (4)

The fraction  is given by  = exp e  , where  follows a two-state Markov-switching process
that jumps between two values:  () and  (). The probability of moving across the two
regimes is controlled by a transition matrix  with diagonal elements equal to  and  . The
values of e and e are such that the unconditional expected value of e  is 0. This implies that
the steady state value of  is (  = ) and in deviations from steady state we have e = e  
This shock captures the ability of the …nancial sector to ful…ll its tasks of conveying …nancial
resources from households to …rms. Most of the time, the economy is in the low state, meaning
that only a small fraction of resources can be diverted and the …nancial sector works properly.
During …nancial crises,  moves to the high state and a large amount of resources can be diverted.
In this case, the …nancial sector ability to transfer resources is jeopardized. As explained below,
when the economy is hit by the adverse …nancial shock, policymakers can react by implementing
unconventional monetary policy and mitigate the e¤ects of the shock.
    This modeling assumption will create contractions in real activity that originate in the …nancial
sector. In other words, the …nancial sector does not simply act as a propagation channel, but as an
independent source of ‡uctuations. In this respect, the model is similar to Jermann and Quadrini
(2012), while it di¤ers from Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Foerster (2015), where the contraction
in real activity is triggered by a shock to the quality of capital. Of course, I could allow for some
correlation between this shock and other disturbances a¤ecting the economy. However, it would
become harder to disentangle the relative contribution of the di¤erent shocks. Importantly, a
shock to the capital quality (temporarily) destroys a portion of the capital stock. Instead, a shock
to the e¢ ciency of intermediation  leaves the amount of capital available unchanged. Thus, this
approach allows me to focus on the functioning of the …nancial sector, an aspect that is likely
to characterize every …nancial crisis. As shown below, the model goes a long way in generating
plausible macro and …nancial dynamics.
    In line with the literature, I assume that the constraint (4) binds at each point in time. Given
that all …nancial intermediaries face this same constraint, total private intermediary assets is given
by   =    where  denotes the leverage ratio. This, in turn, depends negatively on  and
positively on the expected discounted marginal gain to intermediaries of expanding assets by a
unit, holding net constant, and the expected discounted value of having another unit of net worth
holding the amount of claims constant.


                                                   18
    The government can also act as a …nancial intermediary by issuing debt to households and
purchasing claims   The government does not face constraints on its balance sheet. However,
it might be less e¢ cient than the private sector in providing credit. Such ine¢ ciency is captured
by a resource cost of for every unit of assets that the central bank owns. The total value  
of all assets in the economy is then   =   +    The government targets a fraction 
of total intermediated assets, so   =     Thus, total funds depend on intermediary net
worth by   =    where the total leverage ratio for the economy  =   (1 ¬  ) depends
on the amount of intermediation of the government. The policy rule followed by the government
to set  is described below.
    Non-…nancial …rms. The economy presents three types of non-…nancial …rms: intermediate
goods producers, capital producers, and retail …rms. Intermediate goods …rms produce using cap-
ital and labor according to  =  (  ¬1 ) 1¬
                                                        where  denotes total factor productivity,
 the capital utilization rate, and  is capital quality. Firms purchase capital at price  by
issuing claims  and hire labor at wage  . Capital depreciation rate depends on the utilization
rate ( ) with elasticity of . The return on capital is given by

                       ;+1 =  [   ( ¬1 ) +  ¬ ( )] ¬1

which can vary in response to exogenous changes in the capital quality measure  . Large ‡uctua-
tions in the price of claims on capital  generate large swings in the return on capital. These, in
turn, determine ‡uctuations in …nancial intermediaries’net worth, given that …nancial intermedi-
aries own the claims.
    Competitive capital producers buy capital from intermediate good producing …rms, repair
depreciated capital, and build new capital. The capital is then sold at price  to the intermediate
goods …rms. Capital producers face a quadratic adjustment cost on net investment, de…ned as
gross investment less depreciation. The parameter controls the inverse of the elasticity of net
investment to the capital price. Gross investment  equals the total change in capital taking into
account depreciation

                                    =  ¬ (1 ¬ ( ))  ¬1                                (5)

    A continuum of retail …rms indexed with  2 [0 1] repackage intermediate output  into
di¤erentiated products  which they sell at price  . Firms face sticky prices a la Calvo with
partial indexation to lagged in‡ation. The probability of reoptimazing the price is (1 ¬ ). If a
…rm cannot reoptimize, it sets the price to  = ¬1 ¬1 , where 2 [0 1] denotes the degree
of price indexation to lagged in‡ation. Steady state net in‡ation is assumed to be zero. Final
output equals a CES aggregate of retail …rm goods with elasticity of substitution .

                                                 19
steady state output. Furthermore, if the government engages in unconventional monetary policy,
it has to pay a cost equal to a fraction of the value of its assets. These expanses are …nanced
with lump-sum taxes  and the return on previously held assets. Consequently, the government’s
budget constraint requires

                                +             =  + ( ¬ ¬1 ) ¬1

   Conventional monetary policy sets the nominal interest rate  according to a Taylor rule:

                                      =          (  )  exp (   )

where  denotes the steady state nominal rate,     and  control the responses to in‡ation and
to deviations of output from its ‡exible-price counterpart  , and  is a conventional monetary
policy shock. The steady-state and target level of in‡ation is  = 1
    The government can also conduct unconventional monetary policy. Government asset holding
   are controlled by the following rule



                           =   
                                
                                    ((E +1 ¬  ) ¬ ( ¬  )) +           ;   
                                                                                            ¬1


where the response to the expected interest rate spread  and the autoregressive term  
change according to a two-regime Markov process controlled by   During a …nancial crisis spreads
increase since the decline in …nancial intermediaries’net worth limits their ability to take advantage
of the spread in returns by acquiring capital claims. By increasing the amount of asset purchases
in response to the increase in spreads, the government helps in sustaining credit to the private
sector, increasing the price of claims, and, as a result, restoring intermediaries’net worth.
    I assume that there are two policy regimes: Conventional and unconventional. Under the
conventional monetary policy regime, the government only conducts conventional monetary policy.
Thus,  =  = 0 and the government does not react to the spread. Under the unconventional
monetary policy regime, the government also conducts unconventional monetary policy. In this
case,     =   0 and the government does react to the spread. I assume that when the …nancial
        

sector works properly (e  = e ), the government only conducts conventional monetary policy.
When instead a …nancial crisis occurs (e = e ), the government can intervene to help restoring
                                                

intermediation of funds from households to …rms by moving to the unconventional monetary policy
regime. Note that unconventional monetary policy does not need to be exclusively conducted by
the central bank.
    Importantly, government intervention during a …nancial crisis is not automatic. When the
adverse …nancial shock e hits, agents cannot be sure that the government will intervene. I model
this idea by assuming that in case of a crisis, there is a probability  that the government immedi-
ately implements unconventional monetary policy. If this does not occur, government intervention

                                                           20
can still occur with a delay. Speci…cally, conditional on being in the crisis regime, in every period
there is a probability 1 ¬  of moving to the unconventional monetary policy regime, where 
is the persistence of the conventional monetary policy regime conditional on being in the …nancial
crisis regime. Finally, I assume that if the government moves to the unconventional monetary
policy regime, it will keep implementing unconventional monetary policy until the …nancial crisis
is over. This boils down to assuming that the persistence of the unconventional monetary policy
regime conditional on being in the crisis regime is one ( = 1).
    Summarizing, the following transition matrix characterizes the joint evolution of the shock to
the …nancial sector and policymakers’behavior:
                         2                                                           3

4.2    Solution and Parameterization
The model is linearized around the unique deterministic steady state and solved with the solution
method of Farmer et al. (2009). The model solution re‡ects the fact that agents form expecta-
tions taking into account the possibility of a …nancial crisis and the associated uncertainty about
changes in policymakers’behavior. Thus, this modelling framework presents two important fea-
tures. First, it breaks the orthogonality between shocks and policy that is typically assumed in
DSGE models. Here policy can change in response to a particular shock. Second, it captures ra-
tional agents’uncertainty about the response of policymakers to the …nancial crisis. The solution
can be characterized as a MS-VAR:

                         =  (    ) +  (    ) ¬1 +  (    )                      (6)

where  and  are vectors that contain the structural parameters and all the variables of the model,
respectively. The law of motion of the model depends on the structural parameters (), the regime
in place (  ), and the probability of moving across regimes (). This notation highlights that
agents’beliefs about future regime changes matter for the law of motion governing the economy.
   The parameters used for the simulation are taken from Gertler and Karadi (2011) whenever
possible and presented in Table 2. For the transition matrix, I assume that the regular times regime
has larger persistence than the …nancial crisis regime:  = 995 and  = 95, respectively. These
values imply an average duration of 50 and 5 years, respectively. The probability of policymakers
immediately activating unconventional monetary policy in response to a …nancial crisis is set to
10%. Conditional on being in a …nancial crisis, in every period there is a 10% probability of

moving from the conventional monetary policy to the unconventional monetary policy regime
(1 ¬  = 1).
    Overall, the transition matrix implies that, unconditionally, the economy is in a …nancial crises
with probability around 9% and that the probability of unconventional monetary policy during a
crisis is around 50% The implied frequency and duration of …nancial crises is roughly in line with
what observed in the data, once we take into account that in the model the duration of a …nancial
crisis is meant to capture not just the initial stages, but also the subsequent period of slow recovery
and fragile …nancial system. The probability of unconventional monetary policy during a crisis
is in line with the fact that unconventional monetary policy was implemented during the Great
Recession, while it was not during the Great Depression.
    The response of the government to the spread under the unconventional monetary policy regime
   is set to 20, the intermediate value of the ones considered by Gertler and Karadi (2011). As

shown below, this value implies that government intervention largely reduces the spread, without
completely closing it. Finally, the size of the …nancial shock across the two regimes is chosen in a
way to imply an expected value equal to zero in log-deviations from steady state: e = ¬02 and
e = 2.
    Before proceeding, it is worth mentioning that the results presented below are robust to in-
creasing the di¤erence in the persistence of the two regimes, changing the probability of a policy
intervention, allowing for the possibility of reversal in the unconventional monetary policy regime.
The key ingredient that allows the model to mimic the di¤erences between the Great Depression
and the Great Recession is the fact that unconventional monetary policy is not necessarily going
to be implemented during a …nancial crisis.


4.3    Simulation of a …nancial crisis
This section shows how the parsimonious extension of Gertler and Karadi (2011) presented above
can go a long way in understanding the di¤erences between the Great Depression and the Great
Recession. Figure 6 presents the response of the economy to a …nancial crisis with and without
policy intervention. All variables are expressed as percentage deviations from steady state. The

Figure 6: Crisis and Policy Intervention. The …gure presents the response of the economy to a …nancial
crisis with and without policy intervention. The shock hits the economy in the third period. The solid blue line
presents the case in which after two periods the government responds to the crisis by implementing unconventional
monetary policy. The black dashed line presents the case in which the government does not intervene.



economy is hit by a …nancial crisis in period 3. As explained above, this is modelled as an increase
in the parameter controlling the amount of funds that bankers can divert (e = e ). The path for
this variable is reported in the lower right corner as the percentage deviation from the steady state.
Two cases are then considered with respect to the policy response. In the …rst case, solid blue
line, policymakers react to the shock by implementing unconventional monetary policy starting
from period 5. Note that the intervention is delayed with respect to the beginning of the crisis in
a way to capture what arguably happened during the Great Recession. In the second case, black
dashed line, policymakers do not implement unconventional monetary policy. This second case is
meant to capture what happened during the Great Depression, when the Federal Reserve did not
implement unconventional monetary policy (see Bernanke (1983)).
    Let’s consider …rst the case of no policy intervention (dashed line). In what follows, we use
the total capital valuation,    as a proxy for the stock market. The parameter  captures the
e¢ ciency of the credit market. If  increases, it becomes harder to recover funds in case bankers
try to divert them. As a result, the value of the claims on capital falls precipitously and the credit
constraint for …nancial intermediaries becomes tighter. A process of capital decumulation leads
to a progressive reduction in GDP. As the capital stock declines, the overall value of claims that
bankers could divert also declines, leading to a progressive reduction in spreads. However, this
process is slow and comes with a substantial drop in real activity. This also has a depressing e¤ect
on intermediaries’net worth leading to a further reduction in lending. Note that the decline in


                                                       23
capital valuation is immediate, while the response of the economy builds-up over time. Finally,
like in any new-Keynesian model, nominal rigidities amplify the e¤ect of the shock. The …rms that
can adjust, lower the price and in‡ation falls. However, the …rms that cannot reoptimize simply
set the price following the partial indexation scheme. Thus, the fall in real activity is larger than
what it would be under ‡exible prices.
    Government intervention has the e¤ect of reversing these dynamics (blue line). By purchasing
assets, the government increases the amount of credit available to the non-…nancial sector. At
the same time, this policy has the e¤ect of increasing the value on capital claims. This helps
in increasing banks’net worth with an additional bene…cial e¤ect on the amount of credit avail-
able. While the e¤ect on the macroeconomy builds-up over time, the e¤ect on asset valuation is
immediate. Unconventional monetary policy determines a rapid increase in asset valuations that
stabilizes on a higher value, even if the macroeconomy takes some time to recover. Of course, the
policy does not completely resolves the problems of the …nancial sector, as implied by the fact
that the spread is not completely reabsorbed. However, the shift in the paths of the macro and
…nancial variables is quite drastic.
    These dynamics are remarkably similar to what presented in Figure 1. When policy intervention
does not occur, asset valuation experiences a sudden drop and a very slow recovery, while real
activity keeps falling for a long time. This pattern seems to characterize the Great Depression.
When policy intervention occurs, both the real economy and asset valuation recover, but the latter
experiences a substantially faster recovery.


5    Not all Financial Crises are Created Equal
Because of data availability, this paper focuses on the behavior of …nancial markets for the US
economy. However, it is interesting to ask whether the key stylized facts that emerge for the United
States can be recovered for other countries and for other …nancial crises. Figure 7 and Figure 8
present the evolution of industrial production and the stock market for a series of countries during
di¤erent …nancial crises. Financial crises dates are identi…ed based on the dataset constructed by
Jorda et al. (2016). In line with the previous studies, the authors de…ne systemic …nancial crises as
events during which a country’s banking sector experiences bank runs, sharp increases in default
rates accompanied by large losses of capital that result in public intervention, bankruptcy, or the
forced merger of major …nancial institutions. The series for the stock market come from the same
dataset, while the series for industrial production are obtained from the Global Financial Data
website. For each country, the dates for the di¤erent …nancial crises are reported in the legend. In
all …gures, the solid lines are used to denote the Great Depression and the dashed lines are used
to denote the Great Recession. Note that not all countries experienced a …nancial crisis during
these two events and that the dates di¤er across countries.

Figure 9: Fraction of countries in a …nancial crisis. The …gure reports the fraction of countries that are in
a …nancial crisis in a given year (solid line) or that have been in a crisis in the current or past two years (dashed
line) based on the dataset constructed by Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2016).



    The Great Depression and the Great Recession are always associated with a contraction of
industrial production and a decline for the stock market. Instead, other …nancial crises appear to
have less dramatic e¤ects and in many cases we do not observe meaningful declines in industrial
production and the stock market. Furthermore, I argued above that in the United States the
recovery of both the stock market and industrial production in the aftermath of the Great Recession
was quite rapid when compared with the Great Depression. However, the same cannot be said
for other large economies. The contractions in industrial production and the decline in the stock
market for Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, and Italy were large and prolonged and
in some cases even larger than during the Great Depression. Such di¤erence in outcomes can be
understood in light of the fact that the …nancial crisis triggered a sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
Furthermore, the policy responses in the Euro zone were arguably quite di¤erent than in the
United States.
    Figure 9 provides a possible explanation for why the Great Depression and the Great Recession
appear to be much more consequential than other …nancial crises. The solid line reports the fraction
of countries that are in a …nancial crisis in a given year among the ones that populate the dataset
constructed by Jorda et al. (2016). The dashed line computes the fraction of countries that have
experienced a …nancial crisis in the current or previous two years. The vertical lines mark the dates
of …nancial crises that occurred in the United States: 1929 (Great Depression), 1984 (Savings and
Loan crisis), and 2007 (Great Recession). Both the Great Depression and the Great Recession
were global phenomena, while other …nancial crises only involved a few countries. Furthermore,
both of them originated in the United States and then spread to the rest of the world.

the value spread, in a way very similar to what documented for the United States. In Japan, the
negative commovement between the two variables started earlier, following the 1997 …nancial crisis.
Italy presents a negative correlation over the whole sample. With respect to this, it is important
to notice that Italy faced a …nancial crisis in 1990, right before the starting date of the sample.
Nevertheless, for all countries that experienced a …nancial crisis in 2008, the correlation reaches a
minimum in correspondence of such event, providing corroborating evidence that …nancial crises
a¤ect both the stock market as a whole, but also the cross section of asset returns. Finally, it is
interesting to note that for all countries the value spread remains high, while the Price-earnings
ratio did not fully recover, except perhaps for Germany. This result is intriguing because lines up
with what presented above for industrial production and stock values: While the US economy and
stock market recovered quickly, the same is not true for these other countries.


6     The Cross Section of Asset Returns
The results shown so far have highlighted a series of properties that are quite informative regarding
the similarities between the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Two aspects seem partic-
ularly relevant. First, during the Great Depression and at the beginning of the Great Recession,
the Price Earnings ratio and the Value spread were moving in opposite directions. Second, inno-
vations to the Price Earnings ratio and the Value spread were often negatively correlated during
these events. Both results suggest that …nancial crises imply important changes in the behavior of

                                                     27
the cross section of asset returns, with small growth stocks performing relatively better. In order
to further explore this idea, I make use of Campbell and Vuolteenaho’s ICAPM. Consistent with
the Markov-switching model described above, it is important to model the possibility of regime
changes when describing agents’expectations formation mechanism. In order to keep the paper
self-contained, I will brie‡y present the ICAPM proposed by Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004),
and then I will explain how to extend their approach to allow for regime changes.


6.1    ICAPM
Fama and French (1992, 1993) show that the CAPM fails to describe average realized stock
returns since the early 1960s, when a value-weighted equity index is used as a proxy for the
market portfolio. This failure is most apparent for the price of small stocks and value stocks. To
solve the small-value puzzle, Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) start from the premise that an
unexpected change in excess returns can be determined by news about future cash ‡ows or by
a change in the discount rate that investors apply to these cash ‡ows. While a fall in expected
cash ‡ows is simply bad news, an increase in discount rates implies at least an improvement in
future investment opportunities. Therefore, the single CAPM beta can be decomposed into two
sub-betas: one re‡ecting the covariance with news about future cash ‡ows (bad beta), the other
linked to news about discount rates (good beta). The previous argument suggests that given two
assets with the same CAPM beta, the one with the highest cash-‡ow beta should have a larger
return.
    Using the loglinear approximation for returns introduced by Campbell and Shiller (1988),
unexpected excess returns can be approximated by:
                                                     P1                                  P1
 +1 ¬ E +1 = +1 ¬ +1 = (E+1 ¬ E )     =0
                                                             
                                                                 +1+ ¬ (E+1 ¬ E )    =1
                                                                                                
                                                                                                    +1+ (7)

where +1 is a log stock market return, +1 is the log dividend paid by the stock, denotes a one
period change, E denotes a rational expectation formed at time , and is the discount coe¢ cient
that is set to 095 per annum. +1 and +1 represent news about the future market cash
‡ows and news about the future market discount returns, respectively.
    The VAR methodology introduced by Campbell (1991) provides an estimate for the terms
E +1 and +1 . Then +1 is derived from (7) as a residual. Speci…cally, consider a VAR
in companion form:
                                      +1 =  +  + +1                                    (8)

where  is a vector of state variables with the excess return ordered …rst. The two types of news
can be obtained according to the following transformation of the residuals:

              +1 ¬ E +1 = 01 +1  +1 = (01 + 01 ) +1  +1 = 01 u+1                 (9)

where = A ( ¬ A)¬1 and 01 = [1 0  0]0 . Then, the betas can be computed for a set of
portfolios according to the following formulas:

                     b =      c    )
                                 (                           c   ¬ )

                                                   and b =                                                 (10)
                                ( ¬  )
                               d                               ( ¬  )
                                                               d

where  is the return of the i-th portfolio. Notice that the denominator is simply the sample
variance of the unexpected excess returns, i.e., of the residuals of the VAR +1 ¬ E +1 . The
market beta is obtained by summing the two betas.
    Campbell (1993) derives an approximate discrete-time version of Merton’s (1973) ICAPM.
The pricing implications of the model are based on the …rst-order condition of an investor with
Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences who holds a portfolio of tradable assets that contains all of her
wealth. Campbell assumes that this portfolio is observable in order to derive testable asset-pricing
implications from the …rst-order condition. Under appropriate assumptions about the parameters
of the model, it can be shown that the price of risk for the discount-rate beta should equal the
variance of the market return, while the price of risk for the cash-‡ow beta should be times
greater, where is the investor’s coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion.
    Three models are examined: the static CAPM, the ICAPM, and an unrestricted factor model
based on the two betas. Consider the cross-sectional regression

                                          = 0 + 1 b + 2 b

where  is the time-series mean for the excess return of asset . The CAPM model imposes the
coe¢ cient restriction 1 = 2 , given that the single market beta is obtained summing the two
betas: b = b + b . According to the ICAPM, the premia should be: 1 =            2
                                                                                             and
2 = 2 , where 2 is the variance of the unexpected excess returns. Therefore, the ICAPM
restricts the coe¢ cient of the discount-rate beta, and it returns an estimate of the coe¢ cient of
relative risk aversion .4 In the factor model the coe¢ cients are not restricted. The model can
be interpreted as a generalization of the ICAPM that allows the rational investor’s portfolio to
include Treasury bills as well as equities.
   4
    The asset pricing formulas of Campbell (1993) that represent the basis for Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004)
are derived assuming homoskedasticity. However, when modeling parameter instability it is important to allow
for heteroskedasticity to avoid spurious changes in the VAR coe¢ cients. This is why the MS-VAR was estimated
allowing for heteroskedasticity. Given that the focus here is on the changes in dynamics implied by the Great
Depression regime, I regard the idea of extending the analysis to price volatility in the spirit of Campbell et al.
(2014) as an interesting direction for future research, but beyond the scope of this paper. Furthermore, even in
Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) there is not an immediate mapping between the volatility of the VAR innovations
(based on estimates obtained over the entire sample) and the variance of the market returns used to price the assets
(computed over two distinct subsamples).

6.2    News in a Markov-switching framework
Suppose agents’expectations can be modelled based on the MS-VAR described by (1) and (2). In
order to derive the news, we need to be able to model the revision in expectations implied by the
MS-VAR residuals taking into account the possibility of regime changes. De…ne the conditional
expectation E0 ( ) = E ( jI0 ) with I0 being the information set available at time 0. Notice
that the expected value only depends on the realization of the Markov chain controlling
                                                                              h                 the

 = E0  1  = = E  1      = jI0   and 1      =   is an indicator variable that is one when regime  is
in place. Note that:
                                       ¬

                   ¬           ¬
where   = 0  =  =   = jI0 . Therefore we can obtain the conditional expectation

side  -dimensional identity matrices. This is a convenient result because while the law of
motion of  is not Markov, the law of motion of  is. Following Costa et al. (2004), Bianchi
(2016) shows that the law of motion of  is given by:

                                      =        + ¬1 ;                =       ¬1                    (11)

necker product and  is a matrix operator that takes a sequence of matrices and uses them to

    Under the assumption of mean square stability, the process for  converges to …nite values.
Then, given a sequence of probabilities  or a posterior draw for the regime sequence  , the
discount-rate news and cash-‡ow news can be computed as (see Appendix E for a proof):

represented by the standard Gaussian innovation, while the second component derives from the
revision in beliefs about the regime that is in place: +1 = +1j+1 ¬ +1j  When the two regimes
coincide, formulas (12)-(14) collapse to (9). Therefore, the above formulas can be treated as a
generalization of the ones used in Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004).

power as measured by the 2 of three models: The unrestricted two-factor model, the Intertemporal CAPM,
and the traditional CAPM. The betas and average returns are computed over moving windows of 35 years. The
horizontal axis reports the ending date of the rolling window. For example 1965 corresponds to the sample February
1930-January 1965. The dependent variables are the average returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios.



    For the practical implementation of the formulas presented above, the vector of regime prob-
abilities and parameters need to be replaced by their corresponding estimates. In the benchmark
results presented below, I use the parameter estimates obtained using the entire sample and the
corresponding …ltered probabilities. An alternative approach would be to assume that agents in
the economy acts as econometricians and estimate the model recursively. In this second case, the
agents’information set and the econometrician’s information set are aligned (up to revision in the
data). Results for this second approach are very similar and are described in Appendix F.
    It is worth pointing out that the approach described above can model situations in which
not all  regimes are stable. This is because in order to be able to compute the news, we only
need the discounted expectations to be stable. Mean square stability guarantees stability for …rst
and second moments, i.e., covariance stationarity. Notice that this is in fact more than what
is necessary for two reasons. First, the VAR implementation does not require the variance to
be stable, but only that agents’ expectations converge. Second, even if …rst moments are not
stable, discounted …rst moments might be. However, it might be argued that imposing covariance
stationarity is still desirable, given that it implies that agents’ uncertainty converges to a …nite
value no matter the regime that is in place today. For the estimates considered in this paper, both
regimes were determined to be stable.




                                                                        31
6.3     Evolution of the explanatory power of the models
Figure 11 reports the evolution of 2 for the three models over rolling windows of 35 years.5
The dependent variables are the average returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios over the same
time period. I drop the extreme small-growth portfolio that is often found to be an outlier in
asset-pricing models. The explanatory power of all models is very high at the beginning of the
sample, and initially it tends to increase as the window moves to the right. However, past the
1970s the performance of the CAPM starts to quickly deteriorate, with a very visible drop around
1975. On the contrary, the performance of the unrestricted two-factor model remains substantially
high, with values often above 80%. However, this model does not impose economically motivated
restrictions on the premia, so it is not surprising that it delivers a higher 2 . The ICAPM does
very well until the mid-1980s, even if its performance starts following a downward trend. By
the mid-1990s, the 2 starts ‡uctuating around 30%, very far from the 60% attained during the
…rst half of the sample. However, as the window approaches the most recent …nancial crisis, the
explanatory power of the ICAPM increases steeply and the 2 touches 60%. This is a remarkable
improvement in …t given that the last time that the ICAPM explanatory power crossed the 60%
threshold was toward the end of 1978, and it has not been larger than 50% since the …rst half of
1985. Instead, the performance of the CAPM does not show any signi…cant recovery. Appendix
H shows that similar results hold using expanding windows as opposed to recursive windows: As
long as the Great Depression or the Great Recession (or both) are included in the sample, the
ICAPM model is able to explain the cross section of asset returns.
    These results have some suggestive implications. First of all, they highlight the role played by
the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Once these events are included in the analysis,
the ICAPM performance substantially improves. Furthermore, the fact that the performance of
the ICAPM improves, while the explanatory power of the CAPM remains unsatisfactory, implies
that distinguishing between the two sources of risk is crucial and that this distinction becomes
particularly meaningful in the aftermath of exceptional events.
    To understand what drives the improvement in …t of the ICAPM, Figure 12 reports betas and
deviations of portfolio returns from their predicted values for the 25 Fama-French portfolios. The
…rst and second columns report cash-‡ow betas and discount-rate betas. The third column reports
the composition of the market beta. This is computed as the ratio between the cash-‡ow beta and
the sum of cash-‡ow and discount-rate betas. Recall that the market beta is obtained summing
the two betas. Finally, the fourth column contains the deviations of portfolio returns with respect
to the values predicted by the ICAPM. In each row, the solid blue lines refer to the portfolios
indicated on the vertical axis of the …gure.
    A series of interesting patterns emerge. First, as in Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004), over

    The 2 is computed as 1 ¬  where  is the residual sum of squares and  is the residual
sum of squares when only the constant is used as a regressor. Note that in the ICAPM this variable can become
negative because the model imposes a restriction on the premia of the discount-rate beta.

Figure 12: Betas and predicted returns. The …rst and second columns report cash ‡ow betas and discount
rate betas for the 25 Fama-French portfolios. The third column reports the composition of the market beta, and it
is computed as the ratio between the cash-‡ow beta and the sum of cash-‡ow and discount-rate betas. Finally, the
fourth column contains the deviations of portfolio returns from the values predicted by the Intertemporal CAPM.
In each row, the solid blue lines refer to the portfolios indicated on the vertical axis of the …rst column.



time, the value and small stocks experience a pronounced decline in the market beta with respect
to the other portfolios. However, this decline is mostly driven by a fall in their discount rate
betas, while their cash-‡ow betas remain on the upper side of the spectrum. This pattern implies
a change in the composition of the market beta that in turn explains the success of the ICAPM
over the CAPM. The ICAPM separates the di¤erent sources of risk associated with the two betas.
Second, the most notable deviations of stock market returns from what is predicted by the ICAPM
are caused by two medium/growth portfolios.6 When analyzing the period antecedent the current
crisis and excluding the Great Depression, these portfolios have stock market returns that are too
low with respect to what is predicted by the ICAPM. While these stocks show a relatively large
increase in their discount rate beta and a stable composition for the beta, their average returns
do not adequately re‡ect such an increase in risk. Finally, this anomaly is largely reduced toward
the end of the sample, and at the same time, the returns of the small and value portfolios also
move closer to their predicted returns.
    From these results, we can infer that in order to adequately price the cross section of asset
returns it is important to be able to observe the behavior of the assets during exceptional events
such as the Great Recession. The relative performance of the di¤erent portfolios change substan-
tially during these events. It is also important to emphasize that this is not the result of drastic
changes in the betas. Even if we observe a partial increase in the cash-‡ow betas during the late
years, the relative ranking of the portfolios with respect to the betas appears quite stable. It is

    These two portfolios correspond to the ones with the second and third smallest market value among the …ve
growth portfolios.


                                                                                     33
therefore the change in the relative performance of the di¤erent portfolios during a time of distress
that is largely responsible for the improvement in …t. In order to formalize this point, I regressed
the average returns over the last window of time (June 1974-May 2009) on the betas computed
using the window of time right before Bear Stearns received a loan from the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York (April 1975-March 2008). The resulting 2 is still high, 5328% even if lower than
the value obtained aligning betas and average returns.
    There are several possible explanations for why value stocks might perform worse during …nan-
cial crises. Zhang (2005) argues that the value premium arises naturally in a neoclassical model
because of costly reversibility and countercyclical price of risk. During bad times …rms would …nd
it optimal to disinvest, implying that assets in place are riskier than growth options. It seems
reasonable that this distinction becomes particularly relevant during …nancial crises. Furthermore,
almost by de…nition, value stocks include …rms that markets believe might have less prospects of
growth in the future. While this is not necessarily a problem during regular times, it can become
a serious issue when credit availability is limited, real activity is low, and the price of risk is high.
Similarly, Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) suggest that during the Great Depression and in its
aftermath, value stocks might include a signi…cant fraction of fallen angels that accumulated large
amounts of debt during the crisis and were therefore inherently riskier.
    The Great Depression regime also plays another key role: it shapes agents’expectations. In
order to address the importance of this channel, I reconsider the evolution of the explanatory power
of the ICAPM under three di¤erent assumptions about the way agents form expectations. Under
the benchmark model, agents take into account the possibility of regime changes. This corresponds
to the benchmark case. In the second case, agents form expectations according to the anticipated
utility assumption. This implies that the probability assigned to the two regimes are not moving
over time. Under this assumption, the series for the news are computed by replacing the estimated
transition matrix  with the identity matrix in the formulas presented in Subsection 6.2. In the
last scenario, agents form expectations based on a …xed coe¢ cients VAR estimated over the whole
sample. Thus, agents use the information of the Great Depression and the Great Recession, but
without recognizing that these are exceptional events.
    Figure 13 presents the results. The blue solid line corresponds to the benchmark case, the
black dashed line reports the results for the case of anticipated utility, the red dashed-dotted line
corresponds to the …xed coe¢ cients VAR case. It is interesting to note that three cases return
a similar …t over the early subsamples. The benchmark model and the anticipated case start
diverging in the mid-1970s. It is worth recalling that over the very same months the CAPM also
had a drastic decline in the …t (see Figure 11). In other words, exactly when the distinction
between the CAPM and the ICAPM becomes more meaningful, we observe a discrete drop in the
…t of the ICAPM under the assumption of anticipated utility. The anticipated utility assumption
becomes relatively more innocuous toward the end of the sample. This seems sensible given that
this is the period of time during which the dynamics resembling the Great Depression present

Figure 13: The role of agents’beliefs. The …gure reports the explanatory power as measured by the 2 for the
ICAPM under three di¤erent assumptions about the way agents form expectations. The blue solid line corresponds
to the benchmark case in which agents take into account the possibility of regime changes. The black dashed line
corresponds to the case in which agents form expectations according to the anticipated utility assumption. In this
second case, the probability assigned to the two regimes are not moving over time. The third case (red dashed-
dotted line) assumes a …xed coe¢ cients VAR. The betas and average returns are computed over moving windows
of 35 years. The horizontal axis reports the ending date of the rolling window. For example, 1965 corresponds to
the sample February 1930-January 1965. The dependent variables are the average returns of the 25 Fama-French
portfolios.



themselves. However, the gap in the explanatory power is still approximately 15%. Finally, the
2 of the ICAPM under the benchmark case with regime changes is always higher than the case
with …xed coe¢ cients. The di¤erence in 2 is very large, always positive, 2430% in average,
and can be as large as 4484%. Thus, even if in the …xed coe¢ cients VAR case agents use the
information of the Great Depression when forming expectations, the fact that such information is
mixed together with the dynamics during regular times leads to a large decline in the explanatory
power of the ICAPM.
    In summary, the Great Depression regime also plays a key role in accounting for the cross
section of asset returns during regular times because it shapes the way agents form expectations.
In fact, during regular times, it becomes particularly important to take into account the possibility
of regime changes because no exceptional events are present over the sample. This is not enough
to completely compensate for the fact that no …nancial crisis is observed, but it still determines
an improvement in the …t of the ICAPM.


7     Conclusions
Using an MS-VAR, I have identi…ed a Great Depression regime and shown that its probability
has been close to zero until the most recent recession. In February 2009, the probability of
the Great Depression regime spiked to cross 50% and it was larger than 80% when using real
time estimates. During the early months of both the Great Depression and the Great Recession,

                                                       35
the Value spread was increasing while the stock market was falling. However, during the Great
Recession, this pattern eventually reverted, and the probability of the Great Depression regime
experienced a sharp drop, arguably in response to robust government interventions, signaling that
the U.S. was in fact able to avoid a …nancial meltdown. To substantiate this argument, I show
that a parsimonious extension of Gertler and Karadi (2011) can account for the behavior of real
activity and asset valuation observed during the two events.
    I then argue that the Great Recession and the Great Depression were not like any other …nancial
crises. They were both global phenomena that originated in the United States and had severe
consequences for all developed economies that were a¤ected. While the US economy recovered
fairly quickly during the Great Recession, the same it is not true for many European economies.
Finally, the pattern of a stock market decline paired with an increase in the value spread during
the Great Recession seems common to other modern economies, suggesting that severe …nancial
do not a¤ect all stocks symmetrically. I formalize this idea by showing that the existence of the
Great Depression regime is important to understand the cross section of asset returns.

A     Priors
Table 3 describes the priors used for the estimation of the MS-VAR. The priors are very loose and
symmetric across regimes. Below, I describe more in detail how they have been obtained. The
assumption of covariance stationarity implies a truncation of the priors as described in the table.
The truncated prior is implemented by dropping the draws that imply non-stationarity. However,
in the estimates the constraint implied by the truncation of the priors is rarely binding.
    The priors for the VAR coe¢ cients and the covariance matrix are symmetric across regimes
and are obtained running univariate autoregressions for each endogenous variable:

                                                =  ¬1 +    


The prior for the VAR coe¢ cients is:
                                                                ¬

The autoregressive elements of 0 are equal to the AR(1) coe¢ cients, while all the other elements
are set to zero. As in Sims and Zha (1998), the variance of the prior distribution is speci…ed by
a number of hyperparameters that pin down 0 . The choice of hyperparameters implies a fairly
loose prior for the VAR coe¢ cients. Let be a (5 1) vector containing the hyperparameters.
                                                                                                         2
The diagonal elements of 0¬1 corresponding to autoregressive coe¢ cients are given as          0 1
                                                                                                 3

where  denotes the variance of the error from the AR regression for the  variable and  = 1
denotes the lags in the VAR ( = 1 in the models considered in this paper). The intercept terms
in 0¬1 are controlled by the term ( 0 4 )2 . The choice for the hyperparameters are 0 = 1,
                                                                   2

for the covariance matrices are symmetric across regimes and described by an inverse Wishart
distribution with mean 0 = 0  (f 2 g=1 )  with 0 = 9:       (0  0 ).
    Each column of  and  is modeled according to a Dirichlet distribution whose properties
are described in Table 3:   (  )   (   )  =   I choose  = 10  = 2  = 80
 = 2. Note that the priors for the transition matrices are symmetric across regimes. I also
estimated looser priors for the transition matrices and obtained very similar results.

Similarly, the smoothed probabilities are obtained as:

C      Gibbs sampling algorithm
Both the VAR coe¢ cients and the covariance matrix can switch and the regimes are assumed to
be independent. Draws for the parameters of the model can be made following the following Gibbs
sampling algorithm:

    1. Sampling  and  given          
                                               : Following Kim and Nelson (1999) I use a
       Multi-Move Gibbs sampling to draw  from  (  j            ) and  from
        (  j            ).

    2. Sampling  given      : Given  and   we can compute the residuals of the
       MS-VAR at each point in time. Then, given   we can group all the residuals that pertain
       to a particular regime. Therefore,  can be drawn from an inverse Wishart distribution
       for  = 1 .

    3. Sampling  given      : When drawing the VAR coe¢ cients, we need to take into
       account the heteroskedasticity implied by the switches in   This can be done following
       the following steps for each  = 1 :

                             
       (a) Based on                collect all the observation such that                            = 
       (b) Divide the data that refer to  =  based on   We now have a series of subsamples
                                                                            ¬
           for which VAR coe¢ cients and covariance matrices are …xed:  =   = 1  
           ¬
               =   =       Denote these subsamples with i;   i;   where the i;  and
           i;  denote left-hand-side and right-hand-side variables in the MS-VAR. Notice that
           some of these subsamples might be empty.

                                                                        3
        (c) Apply recursively the formulas for the posterior of VAR coe¢ cients conditional on a
            known covariance matrix. Therefore, for  = 1 the following formulas need to be
            applied recursively:

                                      ¬1 = ¬1 +          ¬1
                                                                           (0i; i;  )
                                                                                     
                                                             ¬1
                                        =  + (                         0i; )(i;  )
                                                                                 

                                      ¬1   =   ¬1     = 

            where the algorithm is initialized using the priors for the VAR coe¢ cients  = 0
                                ¬           ¬1
            and ¬1 = 0¬1 = 0 0¬1           Notice that this implies that if there are not any
            observations for a particular regime, then the posterior will coincide with the priors.
            With proper priors, this is not a problem.
       (d) Make a draw for the VAR coe¢ cients                  
                                                                                       (    ) with      = 

    4. Sampling  and  : Given the draws for the state variables  and  , the transition
       probabilities are independent of  and the other parameters of the model and have a Dirichlet
       distribution. For each column of  and   the posterior distribution is given by:

                                  (: )   ( +        
                                                             +        
                                                                             )         = 

       where  and  denote respectively the numbers of transitions from state  to state 
       and from state  to state  .


D      Properties of the regimes
Figure 14 reports the distribution for the di¤erence between the parameter of the VAR coe¢ cients.
Figure 15 reports the distribution for the di¤erence between the elements of the covariance matrix
under the Term Yield volatility regime and the Low volatility regime. Finally, Figure 16 reports
the di¤erence between the elements of the covariance matrix under the Term Yield volatility
regime and the High volatility regime. These are computed taking the di¤erence between the
corresponding parameters for each draw from the Gibbs sampling algorithm.

F     Recursive Estimates
In the benchmark results presented above, I have used …ltered probabilities to pin down agents’
beliefs about entering the Great Depression regime and to compute the news. These probabilities
would represent the real time probabilities for an agent that has knowledge of all parameters of
the model, but not of the regime in place. The choice of endowing the agent with the best possible
estimates for the model parameters is consistent with the idea that in reality, agents have more
information than the econometrician. Therefore, in using the whole sample, the econometrician is
trying to obtain the most accurate estimates of what agents in fact know. It goes without saying
that using the whole sample also improves the precision of the estimates.
    An alternative approach would consist of assuming that the agents act as econometricians
themselves, recursively estimating the MS-VAR as more data become available. I then conduct the
following exercise. First, the MS-VAR is estimated over the sample December 1928-January 1965.
The corresponding …ltered probabilities and parameter estimates are used to compute the news
over this initial subsample. Then a month at a time is added, with the result that the subsample
keeps expanding until the whole sample is covered. For each of the expanded subsamples, the

estimates are saved, and the news for this additional observation are computed and stored to
re‡ect the updated estimates.7
    Figure 17 reports the regime probabilities computed in real time for the Great Depression
regime, the High volatility regime, and the Term Yield volatility regime. Even in this case, to
facilitate the interpretation of the results, the periods corresponding to the Great Depression,
the IT bubble, and the Great Recession are enlarged. Note that the results are similar to what is
obtained when using the whole sample. In fact, the spike in the probability of the Great Depression
regime at the beginning of 2009 is now even larger. In February 2009, the probability of the Great
Depression regime computed in real time was 8103% This result reinforces the case in favor of
the idea that agents might have feared a return to the Great Depression.
    With respect to the …ltered probabilities obtained using the whole sample, the only noticeable
di¤erence consists of an increase in the probability of the Great Depression regime in September
1974. When using the whole sample, the probability of the Great Depression regime during this
month is 1791%, while when using the recursive estimates this probability increases to reach
4673% Even in this case, the results can be rationalized in light of historical events. This is
a period of time characterized by substantial uncertainty, induced by the end of the …rst oil
shock, the resignation of President Nixon in August 1974 following the Watergate scandal, and
the terrorist attack on the TWA Flight 841 from Tel Aviv to New York City after an intermediate

G       Data for other countries
Value Spread: For each country (UK, Italy, German, Spain and Japan), we obtain from Datas-
tream the following information of each …rm, including the delisting ones: Name, Datastream
Code, Major Flag, Stock Type, Geography Group, Bourse MNEMONIC, Bourse Name, Unad-
justed Price, Number of Shares, Price, Market Value, Price to Book Value. The sampling period
is from January 1990 to December 2017 and sampling frequency is monthly.

Below we use UK as an example to illustrate data cleaning steps:
(1) Drop all non-equity constituents, i.e. Stock Type should be “EQ”.
(2) Drop all non-major constituents and keep only major listings, i.e. Major Flag should be “Y”.
(3) Drop all non-domestic stocks and keep only domestic listings, i.e. Geography Group should
be “1”for UK.
(4) Drop all stocks not listed on countries’major exchange(s), i.e. Bourse MNEMONIC should
be “LON”and Bourse Name should be “London”for UK.
(5) Drop all the stocks for which the company name contains any suspicious words indicating that
the listing may not belong to equities
(6) Drop all the observations of the company when at least one month’s unadjusted price is less
the $100. The threshold $100 is arbitrarily chosen and is used to eliminate very small stocks.
(7) Drop all monthly observations of one …rm from the end of the sample period back to the oc-
currence of the …rst non-zero return. This step is used to deal with delisting …rms in Datastream
properly.
(8) When there are no observations of the market value (MV) or the two methods of calculating
MV yield di¤erent results, the MV is replaced with the value calculated by multiplying the unad-

                                                         9
justed price by number of shares.
(9) Drop all monthly negative or in…nite book to market values of any …rm.

We are now ready to explain the calculation of small stock value spread (VS).

Since June 1991, we sort all stocks of a country into two groups according to size at the end of
each June of year  and three groups according to B/M at the end of each December of year t-1.
Small stocks (S) are those in the bottom 50% of the June market value, and big stocks (B) are
those in the top 50% of the June market value. The B/M breakpoints are the 30th and 70th
percentiles based on big stocks (i.e., top 50% of the market value), and are used to divide stocks
into growth (G, bottom 30%), neutral (N, middle 40%), and value (V, top 30%). As a result, the
independent 2x3 sorts on the size and B/M produce the six portfolios, SG, SN, SV, BG, BN, and
BV. We then calculate the monthly value-weighted B/M ratio of SV and SG, which are denoted as
( ) and ( ) . The small stock value spread is a monthly time series which is de…ned
as log( ) -log( ) .
    Term spread: 10-year treasury constant maturity rate and 3-month treasury bill yield of
each country come from Fred. Both are in percent units and have already been annualized.
The starting date is January 1990 and the end date is December 2017. The frequency is monthly.
All calculations are conducted within Excel.
    Log-excess return: Each country’s representative monthly index (FTSE 100 for UK, IBEX
35 for Spain, FTSE MIB for Italy, DAX for Germany and Nikkei 225 for Japan) is used to calculate
log return. The index data of each country come from Global Financial Data and Yahoo Finance.
The priority is given to Yahoo Finance. Global Financial Data is used only when the corresponding
series is not available at Yahoo Finance. The 3-month treasury bill yield of each country comes
from FRED. The log-excess return is de…ned as the di¤erence between log-return and the de-
annualized 3-month treasury bill yield. The starting date of each country’s series depends on
the availability of each country’s data and can be easily found in the Excel …le. The end date is
December 2017. The frequency is monthly. All calculations are conducted within Excel.
    Shiller’s log PE ratio: We rely on Datastream Global equity indices. For each country’s
market, Datastream Global equity indices provide a representative sample of stocks covering a
minimum 75 - 80% of total market capitalization, which enables market indices to be calculated.
We …rst calculate the equity index’s total earning series (E) of each country using equity index’s
market value (MV) divided by equity index’s Price-Earnings ratio (  =  by de…nition in
Datastream). Shiller’s log PE10 ratio is then de…ned as the log of the ratio between the equity
index’s MV and a 10-year moving average of its total earning series (E). The starting date depends
on the availability of each country’s data and can be easily found in the Excel …le. The end date
is December 2017. The frequency is monthly. All calculations are conducted within Excel.

over expanding windows that always include the Great Depression. The horizontal axis reports the ending date of
the expanding window. The dependent variables are the average returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios.

Figure 18 reports the evolution of 2 for the ICAPM, CAPM, and Two-factor model over ex-
panding windows that always include the Great Depression. For example, 1975 corresponds to
the sample January 1929-January 1975. Figure 19 reports the evolution of 2 for the ICAPM,
CAPM, and Two-factor model over expanding windows that always include the Great Recession.
For example, 1975 corresponds to the sample January 1975-June 2009. For each subsample, the
betas are computed according to the formulas reported in (10) in the paper. The dependent vari-
ables are the average returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios over the same time period. I drop
the extreme small-growth portfolio that is often found to be an outlier in asset-pricing models.
The results con…rm what presented in the paper. As long as the Great Depression and the Great
Recession are included in the sample, the ICAPM is able to account for the cross section of asset
returns. Instead, the CAPM works well only over the …rst half of the sample. To see this, note
that in 19 the 2 is extremely up to the point in which the starting date of the sample is the early
1930s.

To understand why modeling the possibility of the Great Depression regime helps in improving
the …t of the ICAPM, it is useful to study the behavior of the cash-‡ow and discount-rate betas in
the two cases.8 The left and right panels of Figure 20 report the cash-‡ow and discount-rate betas

    Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) also allow for a lag in the formulas used to compute the betas to control for
the possibility that not all stocks in the test-asset portfolios were traded frequently and synchronously. See page

computed based on the MS-VAR (solid line) and …xed coe¢ cients VAR (dashed line), respectively.
The vertical bars mark the size (from small to large), whereas in each group the …ve portfolios
are organized from growth (low book-to-market ratio) to value (high book-to-market ratio). The
cash-‡ow betas computed based on the MS-VAR are generally larger and present substantially
more variation across the di¤erent portfolios, especially across the growth-value dimension (i.e.,
controlling for size). In turn, this variation helps in accounting for the cross-sectional variation of
asset returns.
    Summarizing, the analysis of the cross section of asset returns con…rms the presence of similar-
ities between the Great Depression and the Great Recession. The latter turned out to be, at least
to date, a much less dramatic event. Nevertheless, it seems that both events are key to under-
standing the cross section of asset returns. To further corroborate this result, Table 5 breaks the
sample into two parts, pre and post 1964. Notice that the 2 is similar across the two subsamples
and is quite high. Similarly, the 2 computed over the whole sample is also very high. Therefore,
the results suggest that as long as exceptional events are properly taken into account the ICAPM
is able to correctly price the cross section of asset returns. Over the …rst subsample, the Great
Depression plays a key role. Over the second subsample the Great Recession is enough to account
for the behavior of the assets during rare events.
