I. Introduction

       In modern economies and societies, the availability of information is central to better

decision making by citizens and consumers. In political markets, citizens require information

about candidates to make intelligent voting choices. In economic markets, including financial

markets, consumers and investors require information to select products and securities. The

availability of information is a crucial determinant of the efficiency of political and economic

markets (Simons 1948, Stigler 1961, Stiglitz 2000).

       In most countries, citizens and consumers receive the information they need through the

media, including newspapers, television, and radio. The media serve as the intermediaries that

collect information and make it available to citizens and consumers. A crucial question, then, is

how the media should be optimally organized. Should newspapers or television channels be state

or privately owned? Should the media industry be organized as a monopoly, or competitively?

While there is some theoretical discussion of these issues, our empirical knowledge of the possible

forms of organization of the media industry, and their consequences for economic and political

markets, remains extremely limited.

       Consider some theoretical issues first. A Pigouvian economist, who believes that

governments maximize the welfare of consumers, would conclude that information should be

provided by a government-owned monopoly. First, information is a public good ‚Äì once it is

supplied to some consumers, it is costly to keep it away from others, even if they had not paid for

it. Second, the provision as well as dissemination of information is subject to strong increasing

returns: there are significant fixed costs of organizing information gathering and distribution

facilities, but once these costs are incurred, the marginal costs of making the information available

are relatively low. For both of these independent reasons, a strong welfare-theoretic case for


                                                  1
organizing the media as a government owned monopoly can be made. Indeed, these arguments

were adduced by the management of the newly formed British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in

support of maintaining a publicly subsidized monopoly on radio and television in Britain (Coase

1950), and subsequently repeated in many developing countries.

       In the case of the media industry, one additional argument animates the advocates of public

ownership, namely consumer ignorance. In the extreme form, this argument holds that private

owners use the media to serve the governing classes (Lenin 1925). In the more subtle version,

argued for many years by the BBC, state ownership protects the public from exposure to ‚Äúextreme‚Äù

views. In modern versions, state ownership of at least some media is supposed to expose the

public to information, such as culture, which might not be otherwise provided by privately owned

firms. This ‚ÄúSesame Street‚Äù argument, in addition to the standard industrial organization ones,

mediates in favor of state ownership of the media in the minds of many observers.

       In contrast, those who believe in less than fully benevolent government are led to a

different conclusion. In their view, a government monopoly in the media would distort and

manipulate information to entrench the incumbent government, preclude voters and consumers

from making informed decisions, and ultimately undermine both democracy and markets. Because

private and independent media supply alternative views to the public, they enable voters and

consumers to choose among political candidates, commodities, and securities ‚Äì with less fear of

abuse by unscrupulous politicians, producers, and promoters (Sen 1984, 1999, Besley and Burgess

2000). Moreover, competition among media firms assures that voters and consumers obtain, on

average, unbiased and accurate information. The role of such private and competitive media is

held to be so important for the checks-and-balances system of modern democracy, that they have

come to be called ‚Äúthe fourth estate.‚Äù A cynical view of a government‚Äôs motives thus leads to a


                                                 2
very different prescription for the optimal organization of the media than does the benign view.

         Interestingly, even the Pigouvian economists, who adopt the perspective of a benevolent

government when considering other industries and advocate both heavy regulation and

nationalization, avoid this position with respect to the media (Henry Simons 1948, W. Arthur

Lewis 1955, Gunnar Myrdal 1953). Coase (1974) points to this hypocrisy of Pigouvian

economists: in the very industry where the case for state ownership is theoretically attractive, they

shy away from taking this case seriously. Thus, according to Coase: ‚ÄúIt is hard to believe that the

general public is in a better position to evaluate competing views on economic and social policy

than to choose between different kinds of food (p. 389).‚Äù Nonetheless, the assumption of

benevolent government often stops at the doorstep of the media, perhaps because economists want

to protect their own right to supply information without being subject to regulation.2

         These debates notwithstanding, there is precious little evidence on the organization of the

media industries in different countries and its consequences. Our paper aims to fill this gap. We

collect data on ownership patterns of media firms ‚Äì newspapers, television, and radio ‚Äì in 97

countries. Our paper provides a first systematic look at the extent of state and private ownership

of media firms around the world, of the different kinds of private ownership, and of the prevalence

of monopoly across countries and segments of the media industry. Our basic finding is that the

two dominant forms of ownership of media firms around the world is that by the state and by

concentrated private owners, i.e., controlling families.

         Demsetz (1989) and Demsetz and Lehn (1985) hypothesize that the ‚Äúamenity potential‚Äù,

also known as ‚Äúthe private benefits of control‚Äù (Grossman and Hart 1988), arising from owning

media outlets is extremely high. In other words, the non-financial benefits, such as fame and


2 Much of the available discussion deals with the traditional industrial organization aspects of the media industry, such
as product variety and market power, rather than on the broader social consequences of media ownership (Spence and
                                                           3
influence, obtained by controlling a newspaper or a television station must be considerably higher

than those from controlling a firm of comparable size in, say, the bottling industry. Economic

theory then predicts that private control of media firms should be highly concentrated: with no

controllers to enjoy the amenity potential, widely held firms are not a stable institutional form. Put

differently, the control of widely held firms with a high amenity potential is up-for-grabs (Bebchuk

1999). Our findings are broadly consistent with these predictions.

        Having established the importance of state ownership of the media, we ask first: in which

countries is government ownership of the media higher? We find that government ownership of

the media is higher in countries that are poorer, have more autocratic regimes, and higher overall

state ownership in the economy. These results cast doubt on the proposition that state ownership

of the media serves benevolent ends.

        We then consider the consequences of state ownership of the media, as measured by

freedom of the press, development of economic and political markets, and social outcomes. To

this end, we run regressions of a variety of outcomes across countries on state ownership of the

media, holding constant the level of development, the degree of autocracy, and overall state

ownership of the economy.

        We find pervasive evidence of ‚Äúbad‚Äù outcomes associated with state ownership of the

media (especially the press), holding country characteristics constant. The evidence is inconsistent

with the Pigouvian view of state ownership of the media. Still, since we only have a cross-section

of countries, we cannot decisively interpret this evidence as causal, i.e., as showing that state

ownership of the media rather than some omitted country characteristic is responsible for the bad

outcomes. We note, however, that the omitted characteristic must be quite closely related to the

inclination of the government to control information flows, since we are controlling for a number


Owen 1977, Motta and Polo 1997).                   4
of dimensions of ‚Äúbadness‚Äù in the regressions.

       In addition to discussing media ownership patterns and their consequences, we examine the

role of media monopolies. Recall that Lenin and the founders of the BBC insisted on monopoly,

for reasons of technology and benevolent censorship. But even ignoring this particular argument,

one can still wonder whether any government participation in the media is detrimental to freedom

or just the state monopoly. Any government ownership may be bad because the government has

the power to advantage the media firms that it owns. Alternatively, private competition may

assure that alternative views are supplied to voters and consumers, and prevent government firms

from distorting the information they supply too heavily. Only the data can resolve which one of

these theoretically plausible views better describes reality.

       Section II describes our data on ownership of the media. Section III examines the

economic and political determinants of media ownership. Section IV then focuses on the

consequences of state media ownership for freedom of the press, the efficiency of economic and

political markets, and a range of social outcomes across countries. Section V addresses the

question of whether the effects of government ownership stem from the very existence of such

ownership, or from government monopoly. Section VI summarizes the findings and concludes.



II. Ownership Data

       This section focuses on patterns of ownership in the media industry. Because ownership

bestows control (Grossman and Hart 1986), it shapes the information provided to voters and

consumers. Ownership, of course, is not the only determinant of media content. In many

countries, even with private ownership, the government regulates the media industry, provides

direct subsidies and advertising revenues to media outlets, restricts access to newsprint and


                                                   5
information collection, and harasses journalists. We discuss these modes of control as well.



Construction of the Database

       We gather new data on media ownership in 97 countries. We focus on newspapers and

television, since these are the primary sources of news on political, economic and social issues.

        Data on radio ownership are limited. Radio reaches a high proportion of the population,

even in the lowest income and literacy countries, but it largely delivers entertainment. The radio

market is also highly regional, which precludes any single station from achieving a large market

share. As a crude index, we gather ownership data on the top radio station as measured by peak

adult audience, and on an ‚Äúall-news‚Äù radio station when one exists in a country.

       Our selection of sample countries is driven by data availability. First, we identify the

countries for which we have information on control variables. Since we are interested in the

consequences of state ownership of the media, we need to make sure that our results are not driven

by differences in the levels of economic development, the level of political competition, or of

broad state intervention in the economy. To this end, we control for general levels of state

ownership in the economy, a measure of autocracy, and GNP per capita. We use the Fraser

Institute (2000) index of the involvement of state owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy, which

is based upon the number of SOEs, their prevalence in particular sectors of the economy, and their

share of gross domestic output. 3 A total of 133 countries have the SOE index, GNP per capita,

and autocracy data for 1999. Of those, we exclude 5 observations because a) the country is in civil

war (Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone), or b) the entity cannot be classified as a

country (Hong Kong), or c) no daily newspapers exist (Belize, Tajikistan). We also exclude 31

countries lacking sufficient data on media ownership. The final sample of 97 countries includes


                                                 6
21 in Africa, 9 in the Americas, 17 in Asia and the Pacific, 7 in Central Asia and the Caucasus, 16

in Central and Eastern Europe, 11 in Middle East and North Africa and 16 in Western Europe.

         Within countries, we select media outlets on the basis of market share of the audience and

provision of local news content for the year 1999. This approach focuses on who controls the

majority of information flows on domestic issues to citizens. We exclude entertainment and sport

media, as well as foreign media outlets, if they do not provide local news content. We include in

our sample the five largest daily newspapers, as measured by share in the total circulation of all

dailies, and the five largest television stations, as measured by share of viewing.4 We consult three

primary data sources to selecting these outlets. First, we use Zenith Media Market and Media Fact

Book 2000 publications, which are organized by region, including Western Europe, Central and

Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and the Americas. Zenith Media‚Äôs rankings

of newspapers are checked with the World Association of Newspapers (WAN) World Press

Trends 2000 report. WAN data are also used as the source for total newspaper circulation, which

is not reported by Zenith Media. Finally, we use the European Institute for the Media Media in

the CIS report as a primary source for countries in the former Soviet Union. Alternative sources

are sought in two cases: when there is an inconsistency in data reported by primary sources, or

when none of the sources covers the country in question. When this occurs, we use local media

survey firms, World Bank external affairs offices, U.S. Department of State information offices,

and direct contact with the media outlets.


3 For 6 countries, we construct this index using World Bank‚Äôs (2000) data on state enterprises.
4 Following the World Association of Newspapers definition, newspapers are considered dailies if they are published at
least four times per week. In the initial phase of the data gathering (first 12 countries) we focused on the top 10 media
enterprises in the daily newspaper and television markets. We subsequently reduced the sample to five firms per media,
for two reasons. First, the difference in market coverage from increasing the sample of companies from five to 10 was
marginal. In the first 12 countries, the top five newspapers account for an average of 62.4% of total circulation, and the
top 10 for 74.1%. The correlation between the two is 94.2%. For the sample as a whole, the top five newspapers account
for an average of 66.7% of total circulation. Television markets are even more concentrated ‚Äì on average the top five firms
cover 89.5% of total viewing. Second, 20 countries in our sample do not have more than five daily newspapers, and 42

                                                            7
         Where possible, we rely on company annual reports and WorldScope database for

information on ownership of media firms. Many of our sample companies are not covered by

WorldScope, and operate in countries with limited disclosure requirements. Accordingly, we also

use business news reports in Lexis Nexis and the Financial Times databases, country specific

company handbooks, media surveys and internet information services (see Table 1 for a

description of the variables and the main data sources). In all cases, we verify the ownership and

other information externally by contacting World Bank External Affairs offices, Embassies in

Washington DC, and regional or in-country media organizations.

         Ownership data are for December 1999 or the closest date for which reliable data was

available. For the majority of firms in the sample, ownership structures are stable over time.

Timing is a significant issue only in the transition economies, where many media enterprises have

been privatized or have increasing rates of foreign ownership. For these countries, we strictly

enforce the December 1999 date of ownership information, even when we have more recent data.

         We follow La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) in identifying the ultimate

controlling shareholder of each media outlet. We focus explicitly on voting rights as opposed to

cash flow rights ownership of firms. For each firm, we identify the legal entities and families who

own significant voting stakes.5 This provides us with the first level of ownership. For each legal

entity, then, we identify its ownership structure by determining all significant vote holders -- the

second level of ownership. We continue to identify vote holders at each level of ownership until

we reach an entity for which it is not possible to break down the ownership structure any further.

         The entity that ultimately controls the highest number of voting rights, but no less than

20% at every link of the chain, is defined as the ultimate owner. Such control can be gained


countries do not have more than five television stations.
5 The cut-off level of voting stakes depends on the mandatory disclosure levels in the country. In no case, however, is

through direct ownership of more than 20% of voting rights of a media enterprise, or indirectly

through a chain of intermediate owners. For example, an individual X may control newspapers Z

when he holds over 20% of the voting rights in Company Y, which in turn owns over 20% of the

voting rights in Z. With indirect holdings, we define the percentage of ultimate ownership as the

minimum holding along the chain of control.

         After identifying the ultimate owner, we classify each media outlet into one of the four

main categories of owners: the state, families,6 widely held corporations, and ‚Äúother.‚Äù Examples

of other controlling entities are employee organizations, trade unions, political parties, the Church,

not-for-profit foundations, and business associations. We define a corporation as widely held if

there is no owner with 20% or more of the voting rights. We also keep track of whether the

ultimate owner is a foreign family, entity or government.7



Examples of Media Ownership

         The construction of the ownership variables is best illustrated through examples of

ownership structures of individual firms. We start with a simple case of family ownership. In

Argentina, the third largest newspaper, with a daily circulation of 177,000, is La Nacion. The

owner of each share in La Nacion is entitled to one vote. There are two large shareholders in La

Nacion (Figure 1): the Saguier family, with 72% of capital and votes, and Grupo Mitre, with 28%

of capital and votes. Grupo Mitre is in turn 100% owned by the Mitre family. Although the Mitre

family holds an indirect control of 28% in La Nacion, we follow the chain of control of the largest

shareholder at each level of ownership. We therefore record the Saguier family as the ultimate


that threshold higher than 5%.
6 We use families as a unit of analysis and do not look within families.
7 In a few instances, the owner of voting rights in a media firm does not hold the broadcast license. In these cases,
firm and not license ownership determines control. We do this because control of all broadcast licenses ultimately

                                                            9
owner, and classify La Nacion as family owned.

        A more complex example of family ownership is the Norwegian television station TVN

(Figure 2). TVN is the second largest television station with local content in Norway, as

measured by share of viewing. It is 50.7% controlled by Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems

(SBS), and 49.3% by the largest Norwegian television station, TV2. We follow the chain of

control along SBS rather than TV2, since SBS holds the majority of votes in TVN. Although Mr

Sloan (the Chairman and CEO of SBS) holds a 9.8% share of voting rights in SBS, the only voting

interest above 20% is held by the Netherlands United Pan-Europe Communications (UPC), with

23.3% of the vote. The majority shareholder of UPC is UnitedGlobal Com (51%). UnitedGlobal

Com is in turn controlled by the Schneider family, through a combination of 3 direct interests

totaling 21.9%, as well as 50% control of a voting agreement with 69.2% control of votes. We

classify TVN as family owned and the Schneider family as the ultimate owner.

        State ownership takes different forms. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is

classified as state owned. It is funded by government license fees and advertising. The Board of

Governors is appointed by Royal Prerogative, in practice the Prime Minister, and is accountable to

the government. The BBC Charter specifies a number of safeguards to ensure its independence

from government interference. By comparison, the largest television station in Myanmar is

controlled directly by the Ministry of Information and Culture, and the second largest station is

controlled directly by the Myanmar Military. In both cases the state retains full powers to manage

content and appoint and remove staff. Similarly, in Turkmenistan, the state maintains direct

control over the press: President Niyazov is officially declared the founder and owner of all

newspapers in the country.

        In a number of cases, we need to distinguish between state and political party ownership.


                                                        10
belongs to the government, and licenses can be revoked depending on the strength of property rights in a country.
In Kenya, the ruling party Kenyan African National Union (KANU) is the ultimate owner of the

daily newspaper Kenya Times, the country‚Äôs fourth largest daily. Yet we do not classify Kenya

Times as state owned, because if there were a change of government the ownership would remain

with KANU. In contrast, control of the Kenyan Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) would remain

with the state regardless of the political party in power, so we classify KBC as state owned.

Ruling party ownership also occurs in Malaysia and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire. We place these firms in the

‚Äòother‚Äô category, along with more clear-cut cases of media owned by opposition political parties.

        In several cases, family ownership is closely associated with the state. In Kazakhstan,

President Nazarbayev‚Äôs daughter and son-in-law between them control seven of the 12 media

outlets in our country sample. In Saudi Arabia, members of the Royal Family are the ultimate

owners of two of the five most popular dailies. In cases where there is a direct family relationship

between the ultimate owner and the head of state, and the governing system is a single party state,

we classify the media enterprise as state owned.

        Other associations between families and state are prevalent throughout our sample. In

Ukraine, the Deputy Prime Minister holds over 30% of the top television station, while in Malawi

the owner of the Nation newspaper is the Minister of Agriculture and Vice-President of the ruling

UDF party. Neither of these positions are head of state in single party governments and we

therefore classify both media outlets as family owned. Other unofficial links to the state were

documented in country files, but did not influence our classification of ultimate ownership. In

Russia, the close associations between the owner of one of the main TV stations, Mr Berezovsky,

and the then-President Yeltsin are well documented.8 In Indonesia, the daughter of ex-President

Suharto still controls one of the main television stations. In an effort to be conservative in our


8 Mr Berezovsky wrote that ‚Äú‚Ä¶we helped Yeltsin defeat the Communists at the polls, using privately owned TV
stations.‚Äù Washington Post, Oct. 26, 2000, p. A27.
                                                      11
measures of state control, in all these cases we classified the media outlets as family owned, since

a change in government would sever the link between the politician and the media owner.



Media regulations and ownership

       Throughout the world, governments regulate media using measures ranging from content

restrictions in broadcasting licenses to Constitutional freedom of expression provisions. The types

of regulations and their enforcement vary significantly within our sample countries.

       In some cases, ownership is influenced directly by regulation. In Norway, for example,

regulations restrict owners from holding more than one third of shares in media enterprises.

Similar restrictions on ownership apply in Israel. Regulations of foreign ownership and cross

media ownership are also prevalent. Of the 49 countries surveyed by the World Association of

Newspapers, 14 have explicit restrictions on foreign ownership of newspapers. In Brazil, for

example, foreign ownership of voting capital of media enterprises is prohibited, and foreign

participation in non-voting capital is limited to 30%. Not surprisingly, foreign owners are absent

from the Brazilian sample. A further 21 of WAN countries regulate cross media ownership. In

Australia, proprietors of major metropolitan newspapers are not permitted to own controlling

interests in free-to-air television stations in the same market. As a result, the ultimate owner of the

Nine Network television station, the Packer family, is limited to a 14.99% ownership stake in the

one of Australia‚Äôs leading publishers, John Fairfax Holdings.

       Our data do not account for regulations that can substitute for state ownership as a means

to control content. Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) publishes all of the top 5 daily newspapers in

Singapore (Figure 3). Shares of SPH are divided into two categories: ordinary shares, which carry

one share per vote, and management shares, which carry 200 votes per share. The ownership


                                                  12
structure of SPH is characterized by complex cross holdings, with three major groups of

shareholders evident in the data. First, the Lee family controls a total of 47.23% of votes through

4 companies. Second, the state holds a total of 27.23% of votes through various intermediary

institutions. Third, there are a number of minority shareholdings held in nominee accounts at

widely held financial institutions.9 Ownership of nominee accounts is not disclosed. It is possible

that they are owned by families or the state, in which case our estimate of their control is

conservative.     We classify the Lee family as the ultimate owner of SPH. Yet by law, the

government must approve the owners of management shares of SPH, and can require owners to

sell shares. We say that SPH is family owned, and note that this is a conservative measure of the

true influence of the state over SPH.

        We use similar approaches in other cases of structural government influence of media

firms. In Saudi Arabia, the government approves the appointment of editors-in-chief of

newspapers, and also has the right to dismiss them. Although clearly this increases the influence

of the state on press content, we apply a conservative definition of state ownership and classify

these newspapers as family owned. In Malaysia, newspapers are required to renew their licenses

annually. Editors of newspapers that publish critical views of government have been pressured to

resign.10 In this environment, self-censorship becomes the norm. In all these instances, we

nonetheless rely on ownership in constructing our measures, thus underestimating state influence.

        State subsidies and state advertisement revenues enable governments to influence media

content. Such subsidies are common in transition and African countries. In Cameroon, for


9 In particular, Raffles Nominees Pre Ltd holds 7.74% in SPH, 10.11% in Overseas Union Bank Ltd, and 19.44% in
United Overseas Bank Ltd. GSBC Nominees Pte Ltd controls 3.98% of SPH, 5.88% of the Overseas-Chinese Banking
Corporation, 3.42% of Overseas Union Bank, and 4.31% of United Overseas Bank. Finally, Citibank Nominees Ltd
controls 1.63% of SPH, 3.82% of the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation, 4.08% of Overseas Union Bank, and
2.77% of United Overseas Bank.

example, the state refused to advertise in privately owned press after critical coverage of

government. Defamation laws also influence content by repressing investigative journalism.

       Direct regulations of content may interact with ownership. The North Korean Constitution

states that the role of the press is to ‚Äúserve the aims of strengthening the dictatorship of the

proletariat, bolstering the political unity and ideological conformity of the people and rallying

them solidly behind the Party and the Great Leader in the cause of revolution.‚Äù11 In the

Netherlands, the content of public service programming must be at least 25% news, 20% culture,

and 5% education. Italy requires that 50% of broadcasting be of European origin. Because of

these extensive regulations, our ownership classification is a conservative estimate of the true

influence of the state over content.



Variable Construction

       We construct two ownership variables from these data. First, we compute the percentage

of firms in each category ‚Äì state or private. For example, two out of the top five newspaper

enterprises in the Philippines are classified as state owned, as are three out of the top five

television stations. We record Philippine newspaper market ownership as 40% state owned when

measured by count, and television market ownership as 60% when measured by count. Second,

we weight the ownership variable by market share. In the Philippines, the two state owned

newspapers account for 22.2% and 21.3% of circulation for the top 5 newspapers respectively, so

the newspapers are 43.5% state owned when measured by market share. In television, the three

state owned Philippine stations account for only 17.5% of the share of viewing for the top 5

television stations, so the television market is 17.5% state owned as measured by market share.

       The market share variables, while more precise as a metric of state control, have the


                                                   14
disadvantage that, in the countries with regional newspapers, such as the United States, the market

share of any single firm is small. As a consequence, the variables we define are not properly

compared to those in countries with national newspapers. This criticism, of course, is less

compelling for television firms, which are typically national. The regressions presented below use

market share variables, but our results are virtually identical using the counts.

         For the radio market, we create a dummy equal to 1 if the top radio station is state owned,

and 0 otherwise.



III.     Patterns in Media Ownership

Descriptive Statistics

         Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on the ownership of newspaper and television

markets in 97 countries. Countries are organized first by region and then sorted in alphabetical

order. Several patterns emerge from the data.

         Our first significant finding is that families and the state own the media throughout the

world (Figure 4). In the sample of 97 countries, only 4% of media enterprises are widely held.

Less than 2% have other ownership structures, and a mere 2% are employee owned. On average,

family controlled newspapers account for 57% of the total, and family controlled television

stations for 34% of the total. State ownership is also vast. On average, the state controls

approximately 29% of newspapers and 60% of television stations. The state owns a huge share ‚Äì

72% - of the top radio stations. Based on these findings, for the remaining analysis we classify

ownership into 3 categories: state, private (which is the sum of family, widely held and employee

categories), and other.

         The nearly total absence of firms with dispersed ownership in the media industry is


11 1975, Article 53 Chapter 4 of the Constitution.   15
extreme, even by comparison with the La Porta et al. (1999) finding of high levels of ownership

concentration in large firms around the world. This result is consistent with the Demsetz (1989)

and Demsetz and Lehn (1985) insight that the large amenity potential of ownership media outlets

creates competitive pressures toward ownership concentration. In a sense, both the governments

and the controlling private shareholders get the same benefit from controlling media outlets: the

ability to influence public opinion and the political process.

         We say that the state has a monopoly in a media market if the share of state controlled

firms exceeds 75%. As Table 2 shows, a total of 21 countries have government monopolies of

daily newspapers, and 43 countries have state monopolies of television stations with local news.

Table 2 also shows that families and the state control the media regardless of whether ownership is

measured by count or weighted by market share.

         Television has significantly higher levels of state ownership than newspapers. 12 To explain

this finding, a Pigouvian would focus on public goods, and note that television broadcasts are at

least in part non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Television also has higher fixed costs than

publishing, and more significant economies of scale. The private sector might then under-provide

broadcasting services, particularly in smaller markets serving remote areas, ethnic minorities or

students. These theories are central to many of the laws on public broadcasters in Europe.

Alternatively, from the political perspective, privately owned newspapers are easier to censor than

privately owned TV. Because television can be broadcast live, control of content is more likely to

require ownership. In this case, governments that want to censor news would own television.13


12 Only five countries (Ghana, Philippines, Uganda, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) have more state control of the top 5
newspapers than television stations.
13 A further argument is that the extent of required regulation of TV is higher because of difficulties in defining
property rights for broadcasting frequencies. It may be optimal from an efficiency standpoint for the state to control
television stations directly, as opposed to regulating the sector and spending resources in monitoring compliance.
These arguments have been disputed by Coase (1959) and others, who do not see any need for government ownership
and regulation arising from the peculiar technological features of broadcasting frequencies.
                                                          16
       The simple statistics presented so far raise many questions. The evidence suggests that

there are large private benefits of media ownership. Throughout the world, media are controlled

by parties likely to value these private benefits: the families and the state. In particular, the extent

of state ownership of the media (particularly in TV and radio) is striking, suggesting that

governments extract value through control of information flows in the media. We cannot as yet

tell from this evidence whether high government ownership derives from a benign attempt to cure

market failures and protect consumers, or from a less benign attempt to control the flows of

information. In the subsequent analysis, we attempt to distinguish these two hypotheses.



Determinants of Media Ownership

       In this section, we examine how ownership patterns are associated with different

characteristics of countries. We examine very basic determinants of media ownership, such as

geography, the level of development, the government‚Äôs proclivity to intervene in the economy, and

political regime. For all of these characteristics, it is hard to argue that causality runs from media

ownership to these very basic country characteristics rather than the other way around.

       Table 2 shows that the data exhibit distinct regional patterns. State ownership of

newspapers and television is significantly higher in African and Middle East and North African

(MENA) countries. On average, governments in Africa control of 61% of the top 5 daily

newspaper circulation and reach 85% of the audience for the top 5 television stations. Two-thirds

of African countries have state monopolies on television broadcasting. With the exception of

Israel, all MENA countries have a state monopoly over television broadcasting. State ownership

of newspapers ‚Äì which averages 50% share of circulation - is also high in MENA countries.

       By contrast, newspapers in Western Europe and the Americas are held predominately


                                                   17
privately. In Western Europe none of the top five daily newspapers are owned by the state. In the

Americas, the majority of the newspapers have been owned and managed by single families for

many decades. State ownership of television is also overwhelmingly lower in the Americas than in

other regions. None of the top 5 stations in Brazil, Mexico, Peru and the United States are state

owned; this occurs in only one other country (Turkey) in our sample. In Western Europe, in

contrast, a substantial number of public broadcasters push the regional state ownership average to

48% by count and 55% by share.

         Countries in the Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union

have ownership patterns closer to the sample mean. 14

         Poorer countries have higher state ownership of newspapers and television (Table 3a).

State ownership is reported after dividing the sample into quartiles of GNP per capita in 1999.

The average state ownership of newspapers (by share) falls sharply from 49.7% for the lowest

income quartile to 0.0% for the highest income quartile. In television, the lowest income quartile

averages 78.0% state ownership (by share), compared with 52.7% for the highest income quartile.

         Countries with higher state ownership in the economy as a whole also have higher

ownership of the media (Table 3b). Countries in the lowest quartile of SOE index, which reflects

high economy-wide state ownership, average 48.5% state newspaper ownership (by share) and

78.6% television ownership (by share). In contrast, countries in the highest quartile of SOE index

(low economy-wide state ownership) average only 20.3% state ownership of newspapers (by

share) and 60.4% state ownership of television (by share).15


14 Ownership within each of these regions varies dramatically. Indonesia and Thailand have low state ownership of
the media, compared with full state monopolies in North Korea and Myanmar. The predominantly privately owned
media in Estonia and Moldova contrasts with the full state control in Belarus and Turkmenistan.
15 We also considered how state ownership varies according to the origin of commercial law in a country. Legal
origins are classified into 5 categories: English, French, German, Socialist, and Scandinavian. Two countries (Iran and
Saudi Arabia) cannot be classified in any of these groups since they practice traditional Islamic law. Legal origin has
been interpreted as a proxy for the strength of property rights and inclination of the government to intervene in an
                                                          18
         Table 3c shows that autocratic governments are more likely to own media outlets. The

relationship is monotonic over the autocracy quartiles.

         In Table 3d, we consider whether per capita income, autocracy, and the SOE index have

independent influences on state ownership of the media. Generally, all three variables have a

significant effect in a regression. In the analysis of the consequences of state ownership of the

media, we accordingly control for per capital income, the SOE index, and the autocracy measure.

         Table 3e presents data on the incidence of state media monopolies ‚Äì defined as a more than

75% market share ‚Äì around the world (with the exception of Singapore there are no private media

monopolies in our sample). Two interesting findings emerge from the table. First, state monopoly

is considerably more common in the television than in the newspaper market. Second, state

monopoly is largely a feature of poor countries ‚Äì there are almost no incidents of state monopolies

of newspapers, and relatively few of television, in the upper two quartiles of income distribution.

These data themselves do not distinguish among theories - a Pigouvian can easily explain why

television and low income levels call for state monopoly.

         Still, the preliminary evidence presents considerable challenges to the benign (Pigouvian)

view of government ownership of the media. The less developed, more interventionist, and more

autocratic countries are the ones with higher state ownership of the media. The market failure

argument for state ownership suggests the opposite: the richer, more democratic countries should

cure market failures through state ownership. In the following analysis, we pursue the same issue

by examining the consequences of state ownership of the media.




economy (La Porta et al., 1998, 1999). It could, therefore, be argued that legal origin influences the extent to which a
state chooses to control media. We find that, in television, the average state ownership is remarkably similar across
legal origins. State ownership of newspapers in countries of German and Scandinavian is significantly lower than
French and Socialist origin countries. For every other combination, state ownership of television or newspapers does

                                                           19
IV. The Consequences of State Ownership of the Media

         In this section, we consider some of the consequences of state ownership of the media for a

number of social indicators, such as freedom of the press, the functioning of political and

economic markets, and social outcomes such as infant mortality and education attainment.

         In this analysis, it is important to us to be able ‚Äì to the extent possible ‚Äì to link the various

outcomes to the state ownership of the media, rather than other characteristics of the society. We

have shown that poor countries, with interventionist and non-democratic governments exhibit

higher state ownership of the media. Accordingly, we control for GNP per capita, an index of the

involvement of state owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy, and the autocracy score in all

regressions. Such controls do not assure us an unambiguous causal interpretation of the

relationship between state ownership of the media and the various outcomes. It is still possible

that state ownership of the media proxies for some unobserved aspect of ‚Äúbadness.‚Äù However, if

state ownership helps predict bad outcomes holding constant our extensive controls, it must be

closely related to the omitted ‚Äúbadness.‚Äù For example, the omitted characteristic of a country must

reflect the state‚Äôs interest in controlling the information flows, or something close to that.

         For ease of interpretation, we have coded all the outcome variables, as well as the controls,

so that high is good. Thus a high value of the corruption or infant mortality variable corresponds

to low corruption and low infant mortality, respectively.

Freedom of the Press

         Perhaps the clearest way to compare alternative theories of state ownership of the media is

by focusing on freedom of the press. After all, the main implication of the Pigouvian theories is

that greater government ownership should if anything lead to greater press freedom, as media

avoid being captured by individuals with extreme wealth or extreme views.


not vary significantly according to legal origin.   20
        Table 4 presents the results from the regressions of ‚Äúobjective‚Äù measures of media

freedom on state ownership of the media. We measure media freedom by actual cases of

harassment of journalists and media outlets, compiled from Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) 1999

reports on journalists jailed and media outlets closed by governments. Another measure was

constructed from the reports by the Committee to Protect Journalist (CPJ, 1997-1999) on actual

numbers of journalists jailed. We also look at a measure of internet censorship.

        Table 4 shows a negative impact of government ownership of the media on media freedom,

holding per capita income, interventionism, and autocracy constant, with just under half of the

coefficients being statistically significant. Media tend to be more independent, and journalists

arrested and jailed less frequently, when media are privately owned. A closer look at the data

reveals a complex picture. Journalist harassment is high in Turkey, Kenya, and Nigeria, where the

media is predominately privately owned, perhaps because it substitutes for state control through

ownership. But harassment is also high in some countries with high state ownership of the media,

such as Angola, Belarus, Iran and China. Furthermore, some countries with state media

monopolies ‚Äì such as North Korea and Laos - exhibit a ‚ÄòCastro effect‚Äô: state control is so powerful

that there is no need to further restrict freedom through journalist harassment.16

        Table 4 also establishes that countries with higher state media ownership censor the

internet more heavily, as measured by a dummy that equals to one if the government does not

monopolize internet access and content (as measured by CPJ reports). This association can be

interpreted to mean that state ownership distorts information flows.




16 We have also measured freedom of the press using subjective indicators from van Belle (1997) and Freedom House
(2000). The effects of state ownership on these measures of freedom were also negative, but in general insignificant.
                                                         21
Political Markets

         We examine the consequences of media ownership for two aspects of political

development. First, we consider the effect of media ownership on civil, political, and human rights

of a country‚Äôs citizens. If information flows are essential for the exercise of citizens‚Äô rights, and if

government ownership of the media influences information flows, we should see an association

between government ownership and the rights. Second, information flows may facilitate public

oversight of government, and increase the accountability of politicians for bad conduct. In this

case, government ownership of the media would reduce the effectiveness of the government and

increase corruption (Sen 1984, 1999, Besley and Burgess 2000, Stapenhurst 2000). In this

analysis, we again control for per capita income, government ownership of SOEs, and autocracy.

         The results are reported in Table 5. Government ownership of the press typically has a

negative effect on citizens‚Äô rights, government effectiveness, and corruption. The effect of

government ownership of the press is in many instances statistically significant, that of

government ownership of television and radio generally is not. These results are most naturally

consistent with the view government ownership of the press restricts information flows to the

public, diminishing the value of citizens rights and the effectiveness of government.17

         Studies of election coverage illustrate the effect of state ownership of the media on the

supply of political information. In Ukraine, election monitors from the Organization for Security

and Cooperation in Europe recorded significant biases in media coverage related to ownership.

Although all major television stations devoted more time to the incumbent than the opposition

candidate, the state owned television was more unbalanced in coverage and biased in content

(despite legal requirements for the state owned media to provide balanced and neutral coverage).


17 Our results are also unsurprising in a broader historical context. Dictators from Napoleon, to Lenin, to Hitler, to
Marcos nationalized the press. The small independent press, with its ‚Äúxerox and cassette journalism,‚Äù helped
                                                           22
Of its total first round election related coverage, the state owned UT1 devoted 51% to the

incumbent, and 75% of that coverage was positive. Each of the 6 opposition candidates received

substantially less coverage (a maximum of 16.7%), and the vast majority of opposition coverage

was negative. The television channel Inter displayed similar prejudice ‚Äì 48.5% of coverage was

allocated to the incumbent and 73% of that coverage was favorable. Although Inter is classified as

privately owned, it has strong informal links to the state because one of the three shareholders is

the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament.18 The channel 1+1 is 51% privately and foreign owned,

with a 49% non-voting minority stake held by the State Property Company. 1+1 devoted 34% of

coverage to the incumbent, and 50% of that coverage was positive. Finally, STB, which is

privately owned, was the least biased of the four stations. STB dedicated 23% of their coverage to

the incumbent, with 40% of that coverage recorded as favorable.

        Experience in several countries also highlights the importance of media ownership in

pressuring for better governance. In Mexico, privatization of broadcasting led to a dramatic

increase in the coverage of government corruption scandals (Simon, 1998). Introduction of a new

privately owned media in Ghana led to greater coverage of government activities as well as more

criticism of government. In Kenya, privatized press exposed a public corruption case while

government-owned press defended the accused government officials.

        Our results are generally much stronger for the press than for television. For the latter, the

effects of government ownership are generally insignificant. One reason might be that private

press, which is more common, provides a check on state television, ensuring freer flows of

information than would occur if both were in state hands. The data confirm that the outcomes are

worse when the state owns both newspapers and television than when it owns only one of them.

18 The shareholdings are approximately equally distributed - 33%; 33% and 34% - between three individuals, with the
                                                        23
Economic System

        The supply of information by the media can also improve the performance of the economic

system, in two ways. The first is derivative of the improvements in political markets. When

citizens are better informed, they may ‚Äì through political action -- become more effective in

limiting the ability of the government to hurt them economically, by for example confiscating

property or over-regulating businesses. Economic governance indicators, such as the security of

property rights from confiscation and intervention and the quality of regulation should therefore be

higher in countries where media function more effectively. The second way in which media can

contribute to economic performance is by supplying information that improves markets. One area

where this channel is clear is financial markets, which are especially information-sensitive. A

better information flow to these markets can facilitate better pricing of securities, reveal the abuse

of power by corporate insiders, and thereby encourage financial development.19 In this spirit, we

examine the relationship between patterns of media ownership and financial market indicators.

        In Table 6, we find that higher state ownership of the media is associated with weaker

security of property, as measured by Freedom House security of property rights index and the

ICRG measure of confiscation risk. Countries with higher state ownership of the media also

exhibit lower quality of regulation, as measured by the World Bank. The results are statistically

stronger for the press than for television and radio.

        We consider two indicators of financial development. The first is the number of

companies listed on the national stock market, a measure introduced by La Porta et al. (1997). The

results show that countries with higher state ownership of newspapers have fewer firms per capita

                                                         24
listed on their national markets. The second indicator is a measure of banking development from

Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (1999). Countries with higher state ownership of the

newspapers have less developed banking systems. These results are suggestive of the possibility

that state control of information flow might be detrimental to the development of markets.

       The results for both the security of property and measures of financial market development

again suggest that government ownership of the media hurts. Taken together with our earlier

evidence on freedom of the press and political competition, this evidence is broadly supportive of

the view that governments own the media ‚Äì especially the press -- not to improve the performance

of economic and political systems, but to improve their own chances to stay in power.



Social Outcomes

       Lenin asked a fundamental question: whom is the free press for? Our analysis has focused

on political and economic freedom, but a Pigouvian could presumably argue that the true benefits

of state ownership of the press accrue to the disadvantaged members of society. Freed from the

influence of the capitalist owners, state-controlled media can serve the social needs to the poor and

disadvantaged, and thereby improve social outcomes. A skeptic would argue, in contrast, that the

government would use its ownership of the media to muzzle the press, and to prevent the

disadvantaged groups from having a mechanism for voicing their grievances. Government

ownership should then be associated with inferior social outcomes.

       The contrasting predictions of the two views can be evaluated empirically. Table 7 reports

the relationships between state ownership of the media and education and health indicators,

holding constant per capita income, government ownership of firms, and autocracy. In countries

with higher state ownership of the media, we observe inferior school attainment, enrollment and


                                                 25
pupil to teacher ratios. Health outcomes, such as life expectancy, infant mortality and malnutrition

are also worse in countries where the government owns more media outlets. In addition, measures

of access to sanitation and responsiveness of the health system are significantly lower in countries

with more state-owned media. Media ownership structures that are associated with better

economic and political variables are also beneficial for social outcomes ‚Äì in fact the results for

social outcomes are generally stronger and hold for television as well as the press. These findings

undermine Lenin‚Äôs objections to the effectiveness of private media.

       Earlier studies reached a similar conclusion. Schramm (1964) argued that media plays a

crucial role in national development. Thomas et al. (1991) found that maternal access to the media

has a strong and positive effect on child health in Brazil. Sen (1984, 1999) argued that the lack of

democracy, freedom of information, and an independent press contributed to almost 30 million

deaths during China‚Äôs Great Leap Forward between 1958 ‚Äì 1961. He contrasted this with India,

which has not experienced a major famine since independence, and has stronger democratic

processes and press freedom: ‚ÄúThe Government (of India) cannot afford to fail to take prompt

action when large scale starvation threatens. Newspapers play an important part in this, in making

the facts known and forcing the challenge to be faced.‚Äù Besley and Burgess (2000) test Sen‚Äôs

proposition empirically. Using data across Indian states, they demonstrate that higher newspaper

circulation increases government responsiveness to natural shocks. Stromberg (2000) finds strong

support for this hypothesis as well. Rather than focus on media penetration, our study points to a

critical deterrent to the ability of the media to serve these social goals -- government ownership.



Robustness

       We checked the robustness of our results in a number of ways. Although we do not present


                                                  26
these findings, we briefly summarize them. Our results are robust to alternative methods of

controlling for the level of development, to inclusion of measures of media penetration (higher

penetration rates of media indicate more information flows to citizens), and to exclusion of

particular regions and small countries. The results also hold when we divide the sample into rich

and poor countries (using median per capita income) and re-run the regressions for each sub-

sample. Furthermore, alternative definitions of dependent variables yield similar conclusions.

       We have also examined the hypothesis that government ownership of the media has a more

adverse effect on outcomes in autocratic regimes, where other checks on the government are

absent. To test this hypothesis, we included interaction terms of autocracy and media ownership in

the regressions. The results confirm this hypothesis for economic and political development.



V.     Ownership or Monopoly?

       The results of the previous sections raise an important question: are the adverse effects of

state ownership of the media driven solely by the instances of monopoly (or near-monopoly)?

Alternatively, is more state ownership always worse, even at lower market shares? At the time of

the creation of the BBC, the advocates of state ownership insisted on monopoly. In recent years, a

softer argument prevailed, particularly in Western Europe, according to which some state

ownership ‚Äì particularly of television ‚Äì is sufficient to provide the public with exposure to

particular content that might be unavailable through private media. Since there are no countries in

our sample with private monopolies of either newspapers or television, the monopoly question

pertains solely to state ownership.

       To address this argument, we divide our sample of countries into groups (of non-equal

sizes), by the degree of state control of newspaper circulation as well as that of the television


                                                  27
audience. Thus, we create dummies for state control of newspaper circulation being between 0

and 25%, 25% and 50%, 50% and 75%, and above 75%. We create corresponding dummies for

state control of television audiences. We refer to the countries with state control exceeding 75%

as having state monopolies in the relevant market. We then rerun the regressions of Tables 4-7

with the dummies (for newspapers and television separately) rather than with the linear

specification of the effects of state ownership of the media. The omitted dummy is always that

corresponding to the second quartile (i.e., state control between 25% and 50%). We want to know

how the various outcomes compare across quartiles.

       The results for media freedom, political, and economic markets do not indicate that the

adverse consequences of state ownership on the various outcomes are driven solely by state

monopolies. In general, no clear pattern emerges from the data, as both third and fourth quartile

state ownership often has large negative effects. However, most coefficients on quartile ownership

dummies are statistically insignificant. For brevity, we do not present these results.

       The results are clearer for social outcomes, as Table 8 shows. Typically (though not

always), for both newspapers and television, the coefficients on the first quartile dummy are

positive, while those on the third and fourth quartile dummies are negative. This evidence

suggests that social outcomes deteriorate over the whole range of increases in government

ownership of the media. The more competition in the media, the better are the outcomes. If the

adverse outcomes were driven solely by monopoly, we would have seen, in contrast, zero

coefficients on the first and third quartile dummies. This said, we also note that ‚Äì especially in the

case of television, the largest and most statistically significant adverse effects on social outcomes

appear in the cases of state monopolies.




                                                  28
VI.    Conclusion

       In this paper, we have examined ownership patterns of newspapers and television (and to a

lesser extent radio) in 97 countries around the world. We have found that media firms nearly

universally have ownership structures with large controlling shareholders, and that these

shareholders are either families or governments. This evidence is broadly consistent with the

ideas developed by Demsetz (1989) and Demsetz and Lehn (1985) that there is large amenity

potential (control benefits) associated with owning media ‚Äì be it political influence or fame.

       We then asked whether different patterns of media ownership are associated with different

economic, political, and social outcomes. We found that countries with more prevalent state

ownership of the media have less free press, fewer political rights for citizens, inferior governance,

less developed markets, and strikingly inferior outcomes in the areas of education and health. The

adverse effects of government ownership on political and economic freedom are stronger for

newspapers than for television. Government media monopolies are associated with particularly

poor outcomes, especially when we focus on social outcomes, but we also saw some evidence that

various outcomes deteriorate more generally as state ownership increases. Finally, there is no

detectable evidence of any benefits of higher state ownership of the media. Although none of this

evidence can be unambiguously interpreted as causal, it obtains with extensive controls for the

level of economic development, state ownership in the economy, and the degree of autocracy.

       At some broad level, these results will not surprise many readers, since intellectuals since

Milton in the 17th century have advocated free press and independent media. Nonetheless, we

believe this analysis makes two contributions. At the theoretical level, it lends support for

Coase‚Äôs (1974) analysis of the media industry. The theoretical arguments in favor of government

ownership of the media from the conventional perspective on industrial organization are very


                                                 29
strong. Yet the data reject these Pigouvian arguments, and reveal no benefits of state ownership.

In this regard, the paper adds to the growing literature pointing the severe limitations of the

welfarist approach to the analysis of state participation in the economy. More often than not,

market failures pale by comparison with government failures.

       The paper also presents a range of evidence on the adverse consequences of state

ownership of the media, holding constant key country characteristics. Government ownership of

the media is detrimental to economic, political, and ‚Äì most strikingly -- social outcomes. The

latter finding is particularly important in light of a commonly made argument justifying state

ownership in a variety of sectors, including the media, by the appeal to the social needs of the

disadvantaged. If correct, our findings thoroughly debunk this argument. The evidence shows, to

the contrary, that increasing private ownership of the media ‚Äì through privatization or the

encouragement of entry ‚Äì can advance a variety of political and economic goals, and especially the

social needs of the poor.
