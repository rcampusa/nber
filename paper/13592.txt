                                           ABSTRACT

The welfare gain to consumers from the introduction of personal computers is estimated here. A simple
model of consumer demand is formulated that uses a slightly modified version of standard preferences.
The modification permits marginal utility, and hence total utility, to be finite when the consumption
of computers is zero. This implies that the good won't be consumed at a high enough price. It also
bounds the consumer surplus derived from the product. The model is calibrated/estimated using standard
national income and product account data. The welfare gain from the introduction of personal computers
is in the range of 2 to 3 percent of consumption expenditure.

1    Introduction

What is the welfare gain to consumers from the development of and improvements in personal

computers (PC’s)? This is the question addressed here. The answered o¤ered is that welfare in-

creased by somewhere between 2 and 3 percent, measured in terms of total personal consumption

expenditure, due to the introduction of the PC and its subsequent price decline. This …nding

is obtained by employing a model of consumer behavior based upon more-or-less standard pref-

erences, which is …t to aggregate national income and product account data using a direct and

simple calibration/estimation strategy.

    To estimate the welfare gain from the introduction of a new product one must know what

utility is in the absence of the good. A conventional isoelastic utility function has two problems.

First, at zero consumption the utility function returns a value of minus in…nity, whenever the

elasticity of substitution is less than one. In this case the welfare gain from the introduction of

the new good is in…nitely large. Second, marginal utility at zero consumption is in…nite, so long

as the elasticity of substitution is …nite. Therefore, consumers will always purchase some of the

good in question, no matter how high the price is, albeit perhaps in in…nitesimal quantities. To

avoid these problems a form for preferences will be adopted that gives a …nite level for marginal

utility, and hence one for total utility, at zero consumption. With this utility function, high prices

may result in the consumer optimally choosing to buy none of the new good. In addition, the

consumer’s surplus associated with the introduction of a new good is generally …nite.

    This paper contributes to the growing literature on measuring the welfare gains from new

goods. A classic example is the work by Hausman (1999), who studies the introduction of cellular

telephones. He …nds that their tardy inclusion in the CPI, some 15 years after their debut, results

in a bias of up to 2 percent per year in the telecommunications–services price index. To do this,

Hausman (1999) e¤ectively integrates back the estimated demand curve for cellular telephones to

obtain the indirect utility function for consumers. This function can be inverted to obtain the



                                                  1
expenditure function, from which welfare measures can be obtained. The procedure was developed

earlier in Hausman (1981). Analytical solutions for the expenditure function can be obtained when

the demand equation is (ln) linear. When the demand equation is not linear the indirect utility

function may have to be recovered by numerically solving a di¤erential equation. This procedure

is dual to the one presented here, which focuses on the consumer maximization problem. Some

utility functions, such as the one employed in the current work, may not lead to a linear demand

equation of the form that is conventionally estimated.

   Hausman (1999) also suggests an approximate measure of welfare based on a linear demand

curve. While he states explicitly that this measure of welfare is a lower bound this caveat is

often forgotten in applied work. It may work well in the cell phone example that he studies. As

illustrated in the PC example studied here; however, this approximate demand curve method can

lead to a serious underestimate of the welfare gains arising from the introduction of a new product.

   Similarly, the use of conventional price indices, such as the Fisher Ideal and Tornqvist price

indices, may lead to inaccurate estimates of the consumer surplus that arises from the introduction

of a new good and/or the good’s subsequent price decline. The accuracy of such methods will

depend on how fast the marginal utility for a new good rises as the quantity consumed goes to

zero. Figuring this out is part and parcel of the new goods problem. That is, what utility function

or demand equation should be used for estimating the welfare associated with the introduction of

a new good? In fact, it is shown here that in some cases an equivalent variation fails to exist. In

these cases, the theory behind the Fisher Ideal and Tornqvist price indices breaks down. While

this is not true for the case of computers, it is found to be true in the case of another important new

good, electricity. To illustrate this, the technique for measuring the welfare gain from new goods

is also applied to electricity. The welfare gain from the invention and price decline in electricity,

as measured by the compensating variation, is found to be 92 percent of personal consumption

expenditure.

   Another interesting example in the literature is the Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) study of the


                                                  2
bene…t to consumers of the internet. They estimate the demand for the internet by relating the

time spent using the product to the opportunity cost of time. An approach which, they argue,

makes sense since internet access is a good whose marginal cost consists almost solely of the leisure

time spent by the consumer. They …nd very large welfare gains, when taking a literal interpretation

of the model’s structure. This is due to the fact that in their speci…cation the marginal utility

of internet consumption approaches in…nity as consumption goes to zero. To mitigate the impact

of the zero-consumption region of the utility function, they emphasize an alternative measure

based upon a linearized leisure demand curve. Additionally, their setup requires the elasticity of

substitution to be greater than one. This is satis…ed in the data for internet consumption. But,

it isn’t true for all products. A case in point is cellular telephones, which Hausman estimates to

have an elasticity less than one.

    Finally, Petrin (2002) considers, as an example, the introduction of the minivan to demonstrate

a technique for estimating welfare gains in the absence of consumer-level data. He shows how

information describing the purchasing habits of di¤erent demographic groups, in conjunction with

market-level data, can be used as a suitable substitute for consumer-level data. In his discrete-

choice analysis mini-van consumption is a lumpy good, so the speci…cation of the utility function

is not central.1


2     Computers

Computers …rst became available in the United States in the 1950s but at prices so high and sizes so

large that, for the most part, no individual would want to buy one. It wasn’t until the early 1970s,

with the invention of the microprocessor, that the …rst generation of microcomputers–computers

that were small enough to …t on a desk and inexpensive enough to be owned by individuals–was

born. Lasting from 1971 to 1976, this period was characterized by a growing interest in computers

   1 Greenwood and Uysal (2005) model a world with lumpiness in consumption and many consumer goods. An

increase in income, or a fall in price, leads to a shift in consumption along the extensive margin, as the set of
goods consumed changes. The full implications of indivisibilities in consumption have not been fully explored in
the literature yet.

among engineers and hobbyists. The year 1977 marks the birth of the PC. The key di¤erence

between PC’s and their microcomputer predecessors is the limited amount of expertise that the

use of the former requires. In other words, PC’s are computers that are both small in size and

user-friendly to individuals with no technical training.

      The …rst PC to be successfully mass produced was the Apple II. Released in June of 1977

it consisted of a microprocessor running at 1 megahertz, 4 kilobytes of random-access memory

(RAM), no hard disk, and an audio cassette interface for program loading and data storage.

The computer retailed at approximately $1,200. Systems with larger amounts of RAM were

also available up to a maximum of 48 kilobytes and at a price of approximately $2,600. Rapid

technological progress led to consistent improvement in the Apple II following its release. For

example, in 1978 the ‡oppy disk drive peripheral became available. Far superior to cassettes, the

addition of ‡oppy disks greatly improved the quality of Apple II computing.

      Since the introduction of the Apple II rapid technological progress in computer development

has fueled continual quality improvements and declining costs of production. Compared to the

Apple II, today’s computers are often equipped with multi-core processors running at over 3,000

megahertz, gigabytes of RAM, and hard drives capable of storing hundreds of gigabytes of data.

      Quality improvements in computers and computer production have resulted in an enormous fall

in quality-adjusted PC prices. In fact, prices have dropped at an astounding rate of 25 percent per

year. Thus, a PC today is more than 700 times cheaper than one in 1977. Starting from virtually

zero demand for computers in and preceding 1977, the fall in prices throughout the last thirty

years has been synonymous with a rapid rise in demand. Figure 1 presents price and quantity

indices for computers and computer peripherals for the period 1977 to 2004.2 As the demand for

personal computers rose so did their share of total expenditure. Figure 2 shows computer’s share

of total expenditure since 1977. It rose from zero in 1977 to more than 0.6 percent in 2004.

3     Model

Consider an individual with income, y, that can be used to purchase general consumption goods,

c, and computers, n. Computers are measured in some sort of standardized, quality-adjusted units

and sell at a price of p in terms of consumption. Let the person’s tastes be described by


                                   U (c) + (1        )V (n); with 0 <       < 1:                      (1)


Take the utility function for the consumption of general goods to be of the standard constant-

relative-risk-aversion variety, so that U (c) can be written as

                                                    c1
                                       U (c) =             ; with      0.                             (2)
                                                    1

Notice that U (c) satis…es the standard properties U1 (c) > 0, U11 (c) < 0, limc!1 U1 (c) = 0, and

limc!0 U1 (c) = 1. Represent the utility function for personal computers by

                                            (n + )1
                                  V (n) =                 ; with 0 <        < 1:                      (3)
                                               1

The function V (n) is completely standard except that

                                                1
                                  V (0) =           >     1 and V1 (0) =         :
                                            1

Observe that since      0, the magnitude of the elasticity of demand for computers is unrestricted.

The implications of these assumptions on the utility function for personal computers are portrayed

in Figure 3, for the case where       1. The conventional formulation is illustrated by the dashed line.

Note that one could set V (0) = 0 by rede…ning the utility function to be [(n+ )1          1
                                                                                               ]=(1    );

such a normalization has no implication for the analysis. Also, observe that the utility function

for computers is nonhomothetic due to the presence of .

    The individual’s static maximization problem will read


                             w      W (y; p) = max[ U (c) + (1              )V (n)];                  (4)
                                                    c;n


subject to his budget constraint

                                                    c + pn = y;                                       (5)

and the non-negativity conditions

                                                          c; n        0:

Note that W (y; p) represents the person’s indirect utility function, which gives his maximal level

of welfare at the income level y when he faces the price for computers p. The non-negativity

constraint on c will never bind and can be safely disregarded, because limc!1 U1 (c) = 0. Since

the marginal utility of zero computers is …nite, the solution to the individual’s maximization

problem could be at a corner where n = 0.3

    The solution to the above problem can be obtained by using the budget constraint (5) to

substitute out for c in the objective function (4) and then maximizing with respect to n. This

leads to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions

                                                                          h                                            i

The equations in (6), in conjunction with the budget constraint (5), determine the demand func-

tions for c and n:

Observe from (8) that for any given income level, y, there exists a threshold price, Pb(y), such that

the optimal expenditure on computers will be zero whenever p                                        Pb(y). The price Pb(y) coincides

   3 Utility functions of the form U (c) = (c+ )1    =(1   ) have been used in macroeconomics before. For instance,
Chatterjee (1994) and Rebelo (1992) employ such utility functions to model savings behavior. When < 0, so that
there is a subsistence level of consumption, savings will be small at low levels of income. Kongsamut, Rebelo and
Xie (2000) study long-run sectoral reallocations using such a utility function within the context of a multisector
growth model. When < 0 a good will have an income elasticity less than one. Alternatively, if > 0 then the
income elasticity is greater than one. In these analyzes when       > 0 the constraint that c  0 is not imposed; it
isn’t required for the purposes at hand. One could think about > 0 as representing some non-market production
of the good in question that can be sold (implying c < 0) so that only c + needs to be non-negative. Note that
with this interpretation some positive quantity of the good c + > 0 will always consumed. By contrast, the
constraint in the current context is necessary. It is what leads to no computers being purchased when the price is
high enough.


                                                                 8
with Hick’s (1940) virtual price. It is the minimum price that sets the demand for n equal to zero,

or is the price at which the demand curve for n will touch the vertical axis. This threshold price

is increasing in income. This implies that along a falling price path the rich will buy the good

before the poor do. Finally, note that the demand curve given by (8) is not of a form that an

applied economist would typically estimate.

    Last, suppose that computers can be produced from …nal output according to the production

function

                                                      n = zo;

where o is the use of output in computer production and z is the level productivity in the computer

sector. Under this assumption the price of computers is simply given by p = 1=z.4                         Thus, the

decline in the price of computers over time can be identi…ed with exogenous technological progress

in the production of computers. It is hard to comprehend how the observed astonishing 25 percent

annual price decline can be anything else.

3.1     Welfare Gain

What is the welfare gain to consumers in 2004 from the invention of personal computers and the

fall in their relative price since 1977? The welfare gain will be measured in terms of both the

equivalent and compensating variations.

    First, suppose it is the year 2004 and computers have never been invented. As is readily

apparent from (8), this is the same as assuming that computers exist but sell at some prohibitively

expensive price, say p = 1. How much more income would you have to give to the consumer so

that his welfare level without computers is equivalent to the one he obtained with them? This is

the equivalent variation. Let        EV   be the additional income required, measured as a percentage of

actual 2004 income, y2004 . When computers do not exist the person will spend his entire income

  4 Imagine that …nal consumption and computers are both produced using capital and labor in line with Cobb-

Douglas production technologies. If labor’s share is the same in both sectors it then follows that general consumption
and computers can be e¤ectively transformed between each other using a linear technology of the form postulated
above.

                                                                                   1                             1
                                                         [(1 +        EV   )y2004 ]
                      W ((1 +   EV   )y2004 ; 1) =                                            + (1       )           :              (9)
                                                                       1                                     1

In the year 2004 the consumer actually did purchase computers at the price p2004 . Assuming

that he undertook his purchases optimally, his indirect utility function speci…es a welfare level of

W (y2004 ; p2004 ).

    The equivalent variation is determined, when it exists, by solving the following equation for

 EV   :

                            W ((1 +       EV   )y2004 ; 1) = W (y2004 ; p2004 )                 w2004 :                            (10)

That is, the equivalent variation,          EV   , renders the individual indi¤erent between consuming (1 +

 )y2004 of the market good, c, and zero computers, on the one hand, and consuming his actual

2004 consumption bundle when computers exist and are available at 2004 prices, on the other.

Using equation (9) in (10) yields
                                                                                                     1
                                                                                          1      1
                                     (1     ) W (y2004 ; p2004 )              (1      )
                          EV    =                                1                                           1:
                                                             1        y2004

Notice that the equivalent variation can be computed given data on total expenditures and prices,

and estimates of the three preference parameters, , , and .

    The second measure of welfare that will be considered is the compensating variation. The

compensating variation is similar to the equivalent variation. In fact, for quasi-linear preferences

the two are equivalent. The compensating variation is the amount of income that would have to

be taken from the consumer in 2004 to give him the level of welfare that he would have realized if

computers had never been invented. Denote the compensating variation, measured as a percentage

of the agent’s 2004 income level, by             CV   . The compensating variation,                      CV       , solves the equation


                                    W ((1        CV   )y2004 ; p2004 ) = W (y2004 ; 1):                                            (11)


Although      CV   cannot be written explicitly, it is uniquely de…ned by equation (11) and can be

computed numerically, given estimates of the preference parameters in conjunction with the data

                                                                 10

3.2       The Measurement of Welfare Gains Using Price Indices

Approximations of the compensating and equivalent variations can be computed from a Tornqvist

price index as follows. De…ne E(w; p) to be the expenditure function associated with the welfare

level w and the price p Thus

                                                       E(w; p) = min[c + pn];
                                                                      c;n


subject to

                                                     U (c) + (1            )V (n) = w:

Suppose that the expenditure function can be approximated by a translog function. Then, one

can write

                     E(w; p)       exp( +            ln p + ln p2 +           ln w + ln w2 + ln w ln p):                              (12)

       Under this assumption, approximations of the equivalent and compensating variations of a

price decline from p1977 to p2004 can be constructed from the Tornqvist price index, P T , using the

formulae6

                                                                         1977 as representing the price of the new
good in some initial period and p2004 as giving the price in some …nal period, etc.


                                                                      11
p2004 . A magni…cent discussion of the theory underlying this approach is given in Diewert (2008).

Measures of the equivalent and compensating variation can also be constructed from the Fisher

Ideal Price index, at least when the expenditure function can be approximated by a quadratic

function–again, see Diewert (2008). This works best when the utility function is homothetic, which

it is not here.

     Interestingly, there may not exist an equivalent variation large enough to compensate a person

living in today to forgo a new good. That is, there is no value for                            EV    that will solve (10).

Lemma 1 Let tastes be given by (2) and (3) and assume that         1. There are p2004 ; y2004 and
combinations such that there does not exist a EV that can satisfy (9); i.e., such that an equivalent
variation does not exist.


Proof. First, suppose that

                                                                                       1

                                                                                   1

When this transpires an equivalent variation can not exist because the righthand side of (9)

                            1                                                                                             1
approaches (1          )        =(1   ) from below as        ! 1. But, W (y2004 ; p2004 ) > (1                    )               =(1         ),

                                                                                                                                  1
by assumption. Second, there exist a           such that (14) holds. To see this, note that (1                                )         =(1

 )!      1 as        ! 0. Now, with a little e¤ort, it can be shown that when both goods are consumed
                                               "                                           #1

W (y2004 ; p2004 ) =                                     1
                                                                                                        + (1    )(                            )(1   )=
                                                                                                                                                         :
                            1                      1+(       )1=   (p2004 )(   1)=                                                    p2004

By picking p2004 and y2004 appropriately this expression clearly can be made bigger than (1

     1
 )       =(1      ). There are many combinations that can do this. For example, W (y2004 ; p2004 ) !

 (y2004 )1     =(1         ) as p2004 ! 0 So, pick y2004 > [(1          )= ]1=(1           )
                                                                                                   for some small p2004 .

     If the situation described in the Lemma happens, the theory underlying the use of price indices

to measure welfare changes breaks down. This occurs because, when the equivalent variation

does not exist, the expenditure function is not well approximated by either quadratic or translog

functions.

Corollary 1 There are p2004 ; y2004 and combinations such that the the expenditure function,
E(w; p); cannot be adequately approximated by either translog or quadratic functions.

                                                             12
Proof. In line with the lemma, pick combinations for p2004 ; y2004 and        such that an equivalent

variation does not exist. Now, suppose that the expenditure function can be approximated by

a translog function in line with (12). Under this assumption, the equivalent variation of a price

decline from Hick’s (1940) virtual price p      Pb(y2004 ) to p2004 is given by


      EV    = E(w2004 ; p )=y2004      1

                                           2                  2
                  ( +    ln p + ln (p ) +      ln w2004 + ln w2004 + ln w2004 ln p )=y2004       1:


Clearly,   EV   given by the formula above is …nite, a contradiction. The argument for the quadratic

function is the same.

Remark 1 The argument can be extended to the case of a low initial demand at some high price.
Set p1977 at Hick’s (1940) virtual price, Pb(y2004 ), so that p1977 Pb(y2004 ). This is the minimum
price that sets the demand for the new good equal to zero as de…ned in (7). By continuity, when
the equivalent variation does not exist, the expenditure function cannot be well approximated for
any price p < p1977 that is close enough in value to p1977 . But, for these p’s the demand for the
new good, N (y2004 ; p), will be small but positive.


While in some cases the use of the Tornqvist price index to calculate measures of the welfare gains

from new goods may work well, the above discussion is not merely a theoretical curiosity. As will

be seen below, while the Tornqvist price index approach provides a reasonable approximation of

the welfare gain from the introduction of computers, it does not work well for electricity.


4    Quantitative Experiment

The task is to compute the welfare gain to consumers in 2004 due to the invention of the PC

in 1977 and the subsequent decline in its price? In order to compute this, information about

appropriate values for the preference parameters must be obtained. There are three preference

parameters to pin-down: the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion, , the weight on utility from

aggregate market consumption net of computers, , and the parameter                which is important for

specifying the marginal utility of zero computer consumption. These parameters are determined

using the following calibration/estimation procedure.



                                                  13
    To begin with, for each year t between 1977 and 2004 let pt represent the quality-adjusted

price of computers relative to aggregate market consumption net of computers, and yt denote

total expenditure at date t in the data. Similarly, let nt be the aggregate quantity of quality-

adjusted computers purchased. The price and expenditure data is taken from the BEA–see the

data appendix for more detail. The BEA adjusts these series, using hedonic price methods and

other techniques, for the quality improvement in computers, peripherals, and software that occurs

over time. Out of the 16.5 percent annual decline in the quality-adjusted prices for PCs that

occurred between 2001 and 2005, Wasshausen and Mouton (2006) report that 11.5 percent was

due to quality adjustment and 4.9 percent was attributable to changes in unit value. Given the

quality adjustment that the BEA does to the data, think about nt as representing the quantity

of computers denominated in some sort of standardized unit. Figure 1 shows the PC price and

quantity indices.7     Next, note that given values for the preference parameters the model’s pre-

                                                               b t , can by computed by plugging
diction for the quantity of computers consumed at some date t, n

the corresponding price and income levels, pt and yt , into the demand functions speci…ed by (8)

          b t = N(yt ; pt ). These demand functions also depend on the model’s underlying para-
to obtain n

    Finally, the preference parameters are determined by minimizing the sum of the squares of

the di¤erence between the logarithm of the quantity of computers purchased as observed in the

data and the logarithm of the quantity consumed as predicted by the model over the period 1977

to 2004. This estimation is undertaken subject to a constraint that will be discussed now. The

BEA reports that a zero quantity of computers (probably some trivial amount) was consumed in

1977 while they were available at a positive price. Very small amounts are reported in the years

   7 Berndt and Rapport (2001) report quality-adjusted price declines for desktop and mobile PCs. For the period

1976 to 1999, they found that their prices fell somewhere between 25 and 27 percent a year. This is similar to the
25 percent calculated here using the BEA data for the period 1977 to 2004. Pakes (2003) …nds that his hedonic
index yields an average price decline of 16 percent for the 1995 to 1999 sub-period. This compares with 16 percent
obtained using the BLS’s hybrid method for the CPI and 22 percent for the PPI.

in the early years a restriction will be imposed on the estimation that predicted purchases of

computer in 1977 must be zero. In other words, the parameters are chosen by solving

Essentially, one can think of the constraint as identifying .

   The calibration/estimation procedure results in a value for                 of 0:326, a value for   of 0:994,

                           5
and one for    of 4   10       The values are reasonable. The value for               suggests that computers

and general consumption goods are substitutes. This makes sense given that computers and their

accessories have substitued for a variety of other goods such as calcultors, typewriters, stationary,

travel agents, photo albums, etc. At high levels of expenditure, the coe¢ cient 1             is approximately

computer’s share of total expenditure. In 2004 this was exactly 0:006, so that the share of general

goods in spending was 0:994. Last,         is only 0:005 percent of the quantity of computer purchases

in 2004. The model’s prediction for the logarithm of the quantity of computers demanded along

with the logarithm of the quantity consumed from the data are given in Figure ??. As can be

seen, the model …ts the data remarkably well. The R2 is 0:9813.

   Plugging the parameter values and the 2004 data into the formulas for the equivalent and

compensating variations yields an equivalent variation of 2:14 percent and a compensating varia-

tion of 2:19 percent. This compares with Hausman’s (1996) estimate of 0:002 percent due to the

introduction of Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios, which is a minor product innovation. Petrin (2002)

reports a welfare gain of 0:029 percent associated with the advent of the minivan, a more sub-

stantive product. A much smaller fraction of the population owns minivans as compared with

computers, though. Furthermore, this product has not seen the remarkable price decline that

computers have. In a similar vein, Goolsbee and Petrin (2004) …nd a 0:035 percent gain tied

to the genesis of satellite TV. The current estimate is far below Goolsbee and Klenow’s (2006)

one of 26:8 percent resulting from the internet, at least when the model is interpreted literally.

They note that with the isoelastic utility function they choose “the utility from the …rst units

of consumption is so high” that the welfare gains will be large.8               As was mentioned, Goolsbee

and Klenow (2006) present an alternative, smaller, estimate (their preferred one) based upon a

linearized leisure demand curve to reduce the sensitivity of the welfare gain estimate to this region

of the utility function.

    Hausman’s (1999) approximate demand measure of the welfare gain from the introduction of

a new good is 0:5 (share of new good in expenditure)/(price elasticity of demand). The time

series data for computer consumption suggest a price elasticity of 1:83. This implies that a 10

percent increase in the quality-adjusted price of computers will result in a 18 percent decrease in

demand. Taking their 2004 expenditure share of 0:006 (one of the larger values recorded as can

be seen from Figure 2) suggests a welfare gain of only 0:16 percent. As was mentioned, Hausman

(1999) states that his approximate demand measure is best interpreted as a lower bound on the

welfare gain. It is a far cry from the true value that obtains if tastes take the form speci…ed in (1)

with the estimated parameter values. The small number obtained from Hausman’s approximation

procedure results from the fact that computers constitute a small share of expenditure. Yet, they

still are important in generating utility. His linear demand approximation method is likely to

perform better for the introduction of more minor products, such as Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios,

which can be viewed as a small change from the status quo. In fact, Hausman’s measure performs

worse than welfare measures obtained using the Tornqvist price index, as given by (13). The index

performs well yielding estimates of 2:07 and 2:03 percent for the equivalent and compensating

   8 Modelling the consumption of internet services is trickier than other goods, as the paper makes clear. Most

consumers purchase internet services at a …xed monthly price. Therefore, they can use as much of the services
in a month as they desire. The limiting factor is the amount of time that a individual wants to spend on the
internet. This is why Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) estimate the demand for the internet by relating the time spent
using the product to the opportunity cost of time, an innovative idea. Modifying the utility function to bound
the marginal utility of internet services at zero consumption would lower the welfare estimate. It may also help to
explain Goolsbee and Klenow’s (2006) fact that 37 percent of people were not on line. Putting more concavity in
the utility function at high levels of consumption would help lower the welfare estimate as well.

variations respectively. The Fisher Ideal Price index does not work well in this situation, yielding

estimates or 137 and 58 percent.9

4.1     Some Sensitivity Analysis

Given the outstanding …t of the model to the data, room for an improved estimation would appear

to be small. One could try generalizing the utility function over general goods consumption and

computers. Speci…cally, assume that the utility functions for general goods consumption and

computers have di¤erent degrees of curvature:

                                                           1
                               c1                    (n + )
                 U (c; n) =           + (1       )              ; with 0          1 and ;         0:
                               1                        1

Calibrating this modi…ed version of the model using the procedure described above yields                     = 0:97,

                                       5
  = 1:8,    = 0:76 and      = 4 10         . The equivalent and compensating variations under this version

of the model turn out to be 3:3 and 3:2 percent of 2004 consumption, respectively. The upshot of

the above analysis is that it may be best to view that the welfare gain from PC’s as lying in the

range of 2:14 to 3:3 percent.

    The analysis above shows that a simple model of a representative consumer with a slight

modi…cation to the standard isoelastic utility function can lead, using a straightforward calibra-

tion/estimation procedure and aggregate data, to a reasonable measure of the welfare gain realized

from the introduction of PCs. A few words of caution are in order, however. First, since the para-

meter values are not determined through a statistical estimation, the analysis is silent on standard

errors and other tests of the model. Second, the welfare measures are conditional on the paramet-

ric form chosen for utility. This is a problem that many econometric approaches su¤er from as

well. On the latter point, there may be nonseparabilities in utility between computers and other

speci…c goods. For example, Gloosbee and Klenow (2006) assume that internet services and leisure

    9 This price index is the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche prices indices. The Laspeyres price index

is given by (c1977 + p2004 n1977 )=(c1977 + p2004 n1977 ) = 1, because the initial consumpton of computers is zero so
that n1977 = 0. The Paasche index is de…ned as (c2004 + p2004 n2004 )=(c2004 + p1997 n2004 ), which is a small number
given the rapid decline in the price of computers; i.e., p1997 is very high relative to p2004 . Thus, the Fisher Ideal
Price Index shows an extremely steep decline.



                                                         18
are Edgeworth-Pareto complements in the utility function. This could be true of computers more

generally, of course. Think about playing computer games. Internet services could also be an

Edgeworth-Pareto substitute with housework, if they can be used to reduce time spent on chores

such as paying bills, shopping, etc. Gloosbee and Klenow (2006) also mention that there may be

spillover e¤ects across consumers that are important for household computer adoption. Entering a

network externality into tastes may provide another route for modelling the low initial demand for

computers. More sophisticated speci…cations of tastes would probably require more data in order

to estimate the structure well, such as the time-use data used by Gloosbee and Klenow (2006).

4.2    Electricity, another new good

The method outlined above is a reasonable and simple way to estimate the welfare gain from

the invention of, and advancements in, major new goods whose price decreases over time are

primarily driven by technological progress. One of the most important innovations in modern

history is electricity. Following the same approach that was used for computers, the welfare gain

is computed from the invention of electricity and the subsequent technological improvements that

led to a decrease in its price. The model with electricity is calibrated using price and expenditure

data for electricity taken from the BEA–details are provided in the data appendix. Prices are

available for each year from 1929 to 2006. Even though 1929 is the …rst year for which price data

is available, at this time the quantity of electricity consumed was far from zero, unlike in the case

for computers. In fact, electricity was already approximately 0:8 percent of total consumption

expenditure in 1929, more than half of its 2006 level of 1:6 percent. Consequently, the price which

sets electricity demand to zero and identi…es the parameter     is not the 1929 price nor any of the

other prices observed over the 1929 to 2006 period. Thus, the calibration is carried out exactly as

in the computer case but without any constraints on the demand function.

                                                                                 8
   The procedure generates a value for       of 9:26, a value for    of 1   10       and a value for

of 0:062. The high value of     means that general consumption goods and electricity are strong



                                                 19
complements in utility. This makes sense given that, for the most part, people do not derive

utility from electricity alone but by combining electricity with other consumption goods. As with

computers, the model is able to do a good job of matching the demand for electricity observed in

the data. The R2 is 0:9776.

       The compensating variation computed from the model for electricity is 92:0 percent of total

2006 consumption expenditure. How does this compare to Hausman’s (1999) approximate de-

mand measure? Reiss and White (2005) estimate the price elasticity of demand for electricity in

California to be 0:39. Plugging this plus electricity’s share of expenditure in 2006, 1:6 percent,

into Hausman’s formula results in a welfare gain of only 2:0 percent. According to Reiss and

White (2005), a lower bound on the price elasticity based on other studies is 0:15. Electricity’s

share of expenditure over the 1920 to 2006 period was the highest in 1984 when it reached 2:4

percent. Using these extreme values, Hausman’s measure generates a welfare gain of 8:0 percent.

       Measures of the welfare gain arising from the introduction of electricity can also be computed

using the Tornqvist price index. To do this, use the model to compute Hicks (1940) virtual price;

that is, the minimum price that sets the demand for electricity equal to zero. Suppose that this was

the price of electricity in 1881, the year when the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power & Manufacturing

Company opened a small power station that generated a small amount of electricity to light the

village of Niagara Falls. This price can then be plugged into the Tornqvist price index. The

estimates of the compensating and equivalent variations derived from the Tornqvist Price Index

are 22:8 and 29:6 percent, respectively.10 Even though the Tornqvist price index performs much

better than Hausman’s measure, the resulting estimate for the compensating variation is still a

long way from the 92:0 percent welfare gain generated by the model.

       In line with the lemma presented earlier, there does not exist an equivalent variation large

  10   Speci…cally, the welfare gains are given by (13) with

                                            P T = [p2006 =Pb(y2006 )]s2006 =2 ;
where p2006 , y2006 , and s2006 are electricity’s price, income and electricity’s expenditure share in 2006 from the
data and the virtual price Pb( ) is de…ned in (7).



                                                           20
enough to compensate a person living in 2006 to forgo electricity. That is, there is no value for

 EV   that will solve (10). This illustrates that it may not be possible to give people enough income

in 1881 (the equivalent variation) to make them as well o¤ living then without electricity (the new

good) as they do today with it. That is, individuals cannot obtain enough utility from the “old

goods”to compensate them for the loss of the “new good”. This makes intuitive sense. Whereas,

on the other hand, it is always possible to take enough income away from someone today (the

compensating variation) to make him as bad o¤ as an individual living in 1881. For example,

think about taking away all of his income. He would then be worse o¤ than someone living in

1881.

   Last, Figure 5 plots the equivalent variation, based on the estimated values for ,       and , as

the price for electricity rises from some conjectured initial starting value, denoted by p, toward the

virtual price Pb(y2006 ). Observe that the equivalent variation grows without bound. The …gure also

plots the Tornqvist approximation to the equivalent variation. As the initial price for electricity

becomes large the gap between the two measures widens.

   An interesting application of the technique developed here is undertaken in Hersh and Voth

(2009). They estimate the welfare gains from the introduction of new products in the 17th

century, namely co¤ee, sugar, tea and tobacco. While today’s consumer takes these simple goods

for granted, life was Spartan at that time. The consumption basket was weighted heavily toward

food. The European diet was essentially composed of beer, grains, meat, milk and water. Hersh

and Voth (2009) discuss how these new goods dramatically transformed European eating habits.

After their introduction, the price of goods such as sugar and tea declined rapidly [see Hersh and

Voth (2009, Figures 2, 3 and 4)]. They estimate that by 1850 the introduction of tea and sugar

alone was worth about 15 percent of consumption to the average consumer.

5    Conclusion

What is your PC worth to you? About 2 to 3 percent of total consumption expenditure is the

answer obtained here. This …nding is predicated upon a simple model of consumer demand.

A slight modi…cation of the standard isoelastic variety of preferences results in a well-behaved

demand for computers: demand drops to zero as prices rise to some well-de…ned level, and the

consumer’s surplus associated with a new good is generally bounded. The model of consumer

demand is …t to national income and product data, using a straightforward calibration/estimation

procedure, to uncover the taste parameters needed for the welfare analysis. The parameter values

obtained are reasonable and the framework …ts the aggregate data well. In addition, the results

are robust to a modi…cation of preferences. Finally, the method for computing the welfare gain for

computers is found to work well for estimating the welfare gain from electricity. In this case the

theoretical assumptions required for price indices to approximate the gain in welfare break down.




                                                                           22
Here, a compensating variation of 92 percent is found. No equivalent variation exists, implying

that it would be impossible to compensate a person living today to go without electricity.


6    Appendix–Data

All the computer data derives from the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts, Tables

2.4.4 and 2.4.5, and spans the period 1977 to 2004. All the electricity data is from the same

source; however, the electricity data spans the period 1929 to 2006. These tables are available

on the website for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). When mapping the model into the

computer data, the variable n is taken to be real personal consumption expenditure on computers,

peripherals, and software. This series is constructed by de‡ating nominal personal consumption

expenditure on computers, peripherals, and software by the price index for this particular series.

Note that BEA adjusts these series, through using hedonic price methods and other techniques,

for the quality improvement in computers, peripherals, and software that occurs over time. The

variable c represents real personal consumption expenditure on all other goods. This is obtained by

subtracting nominal personal consumption expenditure on computers, peripherals, and software

from total nominal personal consumption expenditure, and then de‡ating by the price series for

personal consumption expenditure. The relative price p is simply taken to be the ratio of the price

index for personal consumption expenditure on computers, peripherals, and software to the price

index for personal consumption expenditure. Last, real income, y, is simply de…ned by y = c + pn,

which is total personal consumption expenditure. The mapping from the model to the data for

the case of electricity is done in exactly the same ways as for computers. The only di¤erence is

that instead of expenditure and prices of computers, peripherals, and software, the variables n

and p are taken to be real personal consumption expenditure and prices of electricity services,

respectively.
