Abstract

The paper reviews the crucial role which globalization forces played Israel’s transformation from
low tech to high tech economy. Special emphasis is placed on foreign direct investment as a
driver for the high-tech transformation.




Israel has had a remarkable development, emerging from a low-income developing economy in

the 1970s, to a medium to high income advanced economy in the 2000s, while increasingly

integrated into the world economy in trade, supply chains, and through financial links. The global

information-technology surge was the unprecedented growth of Israel’s high-tech sector.

Innovation requires scale, and scale require trade. An isolated small economy cannot be a center

of innovation. The incentives of entrepreneurs to invest effort and resources in generating valuable

services are related to the ability to use the resulting knowledge repeatedly, on a large scale, over

time. Foreign direct investment provides critical incentives to be able to use scale economies, to

leap from the precarious innovation stage at the confined of a small economy to the execution

stage, by utilizing the world markets. The globalization of an economy is crucial for its nascent

high-tech industry to develop, and flourish.


The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 surveys the crucial role of foreign direct investment

for Israel's transformation from low tech to high tech economy. Section 2 addresses labor
productivity of Israel in comparison to other OECD countries. Section 3 analyzes the effect of

ICT technological surge on Israel’s high-tech sector. Section 4 elaborates on R&D international

spillovers. Section 5 looks at trends and cycles of the high tech sector, and the economy

productivity at large. Section 6 concludes that concerning innovation and technological advance

globalization matters.


1. Foreign Direct Investment

Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been crucial for the emergence of Israel high tech sector into

occupying an elite position in the world economy. Recall that, FDI refers to investments in

companies and production outside the realm of the stock market. Whenever a foreign company

buys an Israeli start-up, it is counted as FDI. Israel pulled in the fourth highest level of foreign

direct investment in relation to the size of its economy in the 2010s. Israel brought in about 4

percent of GDP in FDI. The OECD average was just 1.4 percent. It fell however short of the

Ireland at 16.1 percent and Chile at 7.4 percent. For Israel, the OECD accounted for the lion’s

share of FDI inflows, more than a quarter, of late. The lion’s shares came from the United States

and the EU. Recently, China became an important source for FDI inflows.


Israel’s inward FDI flows accelerated in the 1990s and the 2000s (see Figure 1). Israel’s venture

capital development (data covers only the 2000s) exhibits a remarkable increase as a proportion of

total inward FDI, demonstrating the sharp increase in funding to high-tech startups.


Generally, a multinational ﬁrm that chooses to keep the production of an intermediate input within

its boundaries can produce it at home or in a foreign country. When it keeps it at home, it engages

in standard vertical integration. When it makes it abroad, it engages in foreign direct investment

(FDI) and intraﬁrm trade. High tech start up firm typically attempts to produce a product with two
distinct characteristics. First, the success of the research and development is highly uncertain,

needing venture capital financing because of the high risk. Second, the product is of ultimately

multiple uses. That is, it is an input into increasing returns to scale technology; hence attractive

to multinational firms. A multinational ﬁrm that chooses to keep the production of an intermediate

input within its boundaries can produce it at home or in a foreign country. When it keeps it at

home, it engages in standard vertical integration. When it makes it abroad, it engages in foreign

direct investment (FDI) and intraﬁrm trade. Deep- pocket international investment enterprises

(such as CalPERS’ pension fund) tend typically to allocate a small fraction of their investment

portfolio to foreign high-tech startups in the form of venture capital.1 The high tech firm receiving

the funds at the start up stage will have diminished transaction costs at a more mature stage. A

multinational


Venture capital picture in Israel goes back to the early 1990s, with capital raising ebbing

and flowing and with trends changing. It is highly correlated with inward FDI.

2. Productivity


The dot-com bubble was a brief period of surging equity prices in the internet sector and related

businesses 1997-2000. Firms discovered that they could increase share prices merely by adding

the prefix e (e-Bay) or suffix com (Amazon.com) to their corporate names. Purchasers of dot-com

equities and derivatively hard assets gulled themselves into believing that normal standards of

valuation could be set aside because dot-com ventures had unbounded profit horizons. The mania

had a direct impact on all countries with significant high-tech sectors, including Israel. The dot-

com bubble not only the present discounted value of their capital stocks, it triggered large volumes

of foreign direct investment (FDI) to other economies, including the emerging high-tech sector in
Israel; which had beneficial effect on national income both during the bubble and after it burst.

This started a steady rise in inward FDI into Israel.


The relatively high R&D spending has not fully manifested itself in productivity. However, as

Figure 2 shows, Israel labor productivity picked up moderately in the 2000s.

Israel recently pulled in the fourth highest level of foreign direct investment in relation to the size

of its economy, (OECD library); figures for in 2013. Foreign direct investment refers to

investments in companies and production outside the realm of the stock market. Whenever a

foreign company buys an Israeli start-up, it is counted as FDI. Israel brought in about 4 percent of
GDP in FDI. The OECD average was just 1.4%. 2The United States was the source of roughly

30% of global FDI outflows, followed by Japan, China and Russia. For Israel, the OECD

accounted for the lion’s share of FDI inflows, primarily the US and the EU, but China‘s share rises

fast. See a brief on FDI literature in Appendix 6A.


3. ICT technological surge and Israel’s high-tech sector


We start with potential long‐term effects of the global surge in ICT innovations, epi‐centered in

the US, on factor productivity in small advanced country. The spillover effects of technological

innovations have strong implications for the issue that has recently been debated: whether per

capita output convergence across developing and developed economies. As observed by

Helpman (1999), research‐and‐development (R&D) expenditures, which have enormous rates of

return, are heavily concentrated within a small number of industrialized countries. If R&D

expenditures do not significantly spill over to developing countries, then R&D expenditures will

tend to widen the cross‐country income gaps. Helpman (1999) raises the question of whether

the benefits of R&D expenditures is as skewed as the expenditures themselves, or whether the

substantial international spillover effects of R&D expenditures cause an international distribution

of the benefits to be more spread out. Such spillover can mitigate the cross‐country income gaps.

He bring evidence that for the conclusion that R&D spillover effects are important and that there

exist significant cross‐country links driven by foreign trade and FDI. Peri (2005) asserts that

knowledge flows within and across countries may have important consequences for both

place, brought in 39.5% of its GDP in FDI, followed by low tax Ireland at 16.1%, and Chile at
7.4%.
productivity and innovation. He uses data on 1.5 million patents and 4.5 million citations to

estimate knowledge flows at the frontier of technology across 147 subnational regions during

1975–1996 within the frame of a gravity‐like equation. He estimates that only 20% of average

knowledge is learned outside the average region of origin, and only 9% is learned outside the

country of origin. However, knowledge in the computer sector flows substantially farther, as does

knowledge generated by technological leaders. In comparison with trade flows, we see that

knowledge flows reach much farther. External accessible R&D gained through these flows has a

strong positive effect on innovative activity for a panel of 113 European and North American

regions over 22 years.


Coe et al (2009) utilize an expanded data set for the purpose of this study. The new estimates

confirm the key results reported in Coe and Helpman (1995) about the impact of domestic and

foreign R&D capital stocks on TFP. In addition, we show that domestic and foreign R&D capital

stocks have measurable impacts on TFP even after controlling for the impact of human capital.

Furthermore, we extend the analysis to include institutional variables. Our results suggest that

institutional differences are important determinants of TFP and that they affect the degree of R&D

spillovers. Countries where the ease of doing business and the quality of tertiary education systems

are relatively high tend to benefit more from their own R&D efforts, from international R&D

spillovers, and from human capital formation. Strong patent protection is associated with higher

levels of total factor productivity, higher returns to domestic R&D, and larger international R&D

spillovers. Finally, countries whose legal systems are based on French and, to a lesser extent,

Scandinavian law benefit less from their own and foreign R&D capital than countries whose legal

origins are based on English or German law.
Insightfully, de la Potterie and Lichtenberg (2006) investigate econometrically whether foreign

direct investment (FDI) transfers technology across borders. (The authors do not study R&D

knowledge transmission mechanism through trade) data indicates that FDI transfers technology,

but only in one direction: a country's productivity is increased if it invests in R&D-intensive

foreign countries—particularly in recent years—but not if foreign R&D-intensive countries invest

in it. Other findings are as follows.3


Helpman (2003) examines the sources of the rise in total factor productivity (TFP) in Israel in the

1970s and 1980s estimates that slightly more than half the rise in TFP can be attributed to R&D

investment, and the rest to a rise in the level of education.


The ratio of foreign-R&D benefits conveyed by outward FDI to foreign R&D benefits conveyed

by imports is higher for large countries than it is for small ones. The failure to account for

international R&D spillovers leads to upwardly biased estimates of the output elasticity of the

domestic R&D capital stock; and that are much larger transfers of technology from the United

States to Japan than there are from Japan to the United States.4

 Bransfetter (2006) introduces a framework for measuring international knowledge spillovers at the firm level. He
uses this framework to directly test the hypothesis that FDI is a channel of knowledge spillovers for Japanese
multinationals undertaking direct investments in the United States. Using an original firm-level panel data set on
Japanese firms' FDI and innovative activity, he finds evidence that FDI increases the flow of knowledge spillovers
both from and to the investing Japanese firms.

Israel R&D spending received a boost after the ICT global surge. Figure 6.3 describes the extent

to which Israel domestic spending on R&D rose sharply to a higher plateau following the global

ICT surge in the 1990s.5 Israel moved up in OECD ranking. Israel’s international ranking in

domestic spending on R&D is truly exeptional.


4. Spillovers

We now turn to the transmission mechanism, via the global capital markets, through which the

technology surge spreads internationally.




5
 Another factor which explain the Israel-OECD gap is the expansion of OECD membership, with some of the new
member countries (e.g. Mexico) having low R&D spending.
International trade, R&D spillovers and TFP interact with each other in many diﬀerent ways. Trade

increases market size, reduces the duplication of R&D, increases knowledge spillovers, and

increases specialization. All of which will increase R&D and hence TFP. On the other hand, trade

increases competition and causes factor prices to change, which leads to a decline in TFP. In

addition, trade does not necessarily imply an international convergence of income levels. If the

R&D spillovers are international in scope, there will be convergence; however, if they are national

in scope, there will be a divergence. (See Helpman (2004)).


Capital flows of all types have increased over the past few decades, and most recently, some of

the biggest increases have occurred in foreign direct investment. This is especially true of rich

countries, but is also increasingly true of developing nations too. Obstfeld and Taylor (2002) make

an historical point: "A century ago, world income and productivity levels were far less divergent

than they are today, so it is all the more remarkable that so much capital was directed to countries

at or below the 20 percent and 40 percent income levels (relative to the United States). Today, a

much larger fraction of the world's output and population is located in such low-productivity

regions, but a smaller share of global foreign investment reaches them."


Foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs when an investor based in one country (the home country)

acquires an asset in another country (the host country) with an intent to manage that asset. The

management dimension is what distinguishes FDI from portfolio investment in foreign stocks,

bonds and other financial Instruments. Inward FDI in the high tech sector is driven by human

capital easy to do business in the host country. However, FDI flows, namely the acquisition of the

high-tech industry equity assets, provide strong incentive to innovate. Thus, FDI flows help to

expand the high tech sector activities. In other words, FDI flows are both driven by fundamentals,

which drive the high tech industry, and re-enforcing its expansion. Israel's high-tech development
in the last two and a half decades is a fascinating event study, flashing out the FDI-Productivity

interactions.6 Capital flows of all types have increased over the past few decades, and most

recently, some of the biggest increases have occurred in foreign direct investment. This is

especially true of rich countries, but is also increasingly true of developing nations too.


Turning to the short-term aspects of FDI, we consider how they are related to the global stock-

market cycle. Capital flows in the form of FDI are important because it is believed that FDI has

special benefits over other forms of capital flows. First, these flows are thought to be more stable,

and do not leave the host country exposed to financial crises. Second, FDI if often supposed to be

associated with technology transfer, which may have spillover benefits for the host country. Third,

FDI is often attributed a special role in disciplining host country governments: the threat of moving

business offshore limits the ability of host countries to extract taxes and introduce inefficient

regulations. Offsetting this, FDI is also often associated with special domestic costs in cases where

foreign ownership has caused domestic political unrest in the host country (this is often especially

true in natural resource industries).7




6
  Not all countries follow the 10% mark for the definition of FDI. Most countries do indeed report long-term intra-
firm loans, but not all countries report short-term loans. Most countries report reinvestment of retained earning only
with a considerable lag. One implication of these measurement problems is that FDI inflows do not
contemporaneously match FDI outflows. UN (2005) annual report on world investment documents how countries
are becoming more receptive to FDI. In the years 1991-2004 vast majority of changes in laws and regulations
pertaining to investment were more favorable to FDI. An exception is developing countries which introduced some
laws and regulations intended to protect some natural resources (especially in the energy field) against "foreign
intruders". The report also indicates that countries are cooperating with each other in designing pro-FDI bilateral
policies: "The number of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and double taxation treaties (DTTs) reached 2,392 and
2,559 respectively, in 2004, with developing countries concluding more such treaties with other developing
countries." Razin and Sadka (2007) provide a comprehensive survey of theory and empirical applications of FDI.


7
    See also Feenstra (1999).
Being equity investments, FDI flows are driven among other factors by credit availability and

stock market performance. A central problem in the credit market is that lenders are reluctant to

make loans because they cannot easily determine whether a prospective borrower has resources to

repay the loan. If the loan is made, the lender is concerned about whether the borrower will engage

in risky behavior that could lower the probability that the loan will be repaid. Collateral reduces

this information asymmetry problem because high-quality collateral (that is, assets that are easily

valued and easy to take control of) signiﬁcantly decreases the losses to the lender if the borrower

defaults on the loan. High-quality collateral also reduces the moral hazard problem because the

borrower is reluctant to engage in excessively risky behavior since now he or she has something

to lose. Creditor protection enhances the ability of the lender to take control of the collateral in

case of default and thereby alleviate credit constraints. Thus, creditor rights regulation helps to

mitigate the problems of information asymmetry and moral hazard between creditors and

borrowers. Hale et al (2014) develop a model predicting two channels through which creditor

protection enhances the performance of stock prices: the probability of a liquidity crisis leading to

a binding investment-finance constraint falls with a strong protection of creditors; the stock prices

under the investment-constrained regime increase with better protection of creditors. They find

strong empirical support for both predictions using data on stock market performance, for 52

countries over the period 1980-2008. In particular, they demonstrate that better creditor protection

is correlated across countries with lower average stock market volatility; crises are more frequent

in countries with poor creditor protection. Using propensity score matching they demonstrate that

during crises stock market returns investment fall by more in countries with poor creditor

protection. 8Israel has had international high ranking in credit protection. It became also an

return and volatility. They find that the stock market average return is only half as high during the crisis; and that in
a matched sample the stock return volatility is substantially and significantly higher during crisis,

  Globalization in the shape of a drop‐off of capital controls typically lead to foreign direct investment in
the form of mergers and acquisition (M&A), but not in the one in the form of greenfield investment. The
latter are typically encouraged in the political‐economy setups, even under a regime of capital‐inflow
restrictions, provided that the profits from the investments are allowed to be repatriated. Greenfield FDI
surges are primarily driven by high return projects such as high‐tech start‐ups.
To interpret Figure 4, FDI flows (in percentage of gross domestic product) as reflecting the intense

interactions of the FDI flows with investment in the high tech investment in Israel. Three features

are noteworthy:


(1) The sharp rise in inward FDI during the dotcom equity bubble;


(2) The effect of the dotcom early 2000s equity that triggered a temporary fall in inward FDI flows.

Inward FDI underwent a sharp rise in the late 1990s. The upturn happened when the nascent high

tech industry in Israel emerged on the global stage, and the upside-down-V-shaped fall when the

early 2000s dotcom equity collapse took place; and,


(3) The effect of the boom and bust of the equity markets around the 2008 crisis when Israel high

tech industry gained strength in global high tech sectors.


Helpman (2003) observes that over the last decades Israel’s economy grew faster than average,

but not exceptionally fast. Compared with countries at a similar level of development, Israel is not

outstanding. Seven-tenths of the rise in its GDP can be explained by the increase in labor input

(measured by hours worked) and investment in machinery, structures, and equipment.

Nonetheless, the investment is made possible by the increase in productivity, which in turn was

fed by improved levels of schooling, investment in R&D, and knowledge spillovers from other

countries. Based on the level of schooling and the stock of R&D.


Israel’s economy is the most tech-dependent in the world, with 13 percent of the country’s GDP

and 31 percent of all exports originating in the high tech sector; thus, the global high tech

slowdown has hit Israel harder than other advanced economies.
Friedmann (2016) analyze the implications for labor productivity of the three groups of external

shocks hit the industry since the early 1990s: Mid 1990s‐‐‐before the “Birth” of the dotcom

bubble:


   1. Early 2000s‐ after the burst of the dotcom bubble;
   2. Before and during the early stages of the 2008 global crisis which triggered the global
       stock market crash and the sharp decline in world trade.
   3. The Great Recession that followed the global crisis.

The Table exhibits the high productivity increase of the private and the ICT sectors around the

global ICT surge in the 1990s; the low productivity increase in the early 2000s in the sectors

following the burst of the dot.com bubble; and the return to a state of medium-to-high productivity

change before the 2008 global stock market crash.

There is an intriguing positive correlation between high tech industry productivity (shown in Table

4) and FDI flow cycles (shown in Figure 6.1). The clustering of high tech industries and start up

primarily in Tel-Aviv, Israel’s commercial center and its economic activities is another

productivity-enhancing development. In general, productivity-boosting mechanisms arising from

the clustering of high-tech and university centers is complimentary to the productivity-enhancing

effects of industrial agglomeration. These have attracted great attention in policy circles Empirical

evidence suggests that region-level productivity rises 3-8% when market size is doubled (World

Bank 2009).In a recent study, we employ plant-product-level data from Japanese manufacturing

to assess the effects of urban agglomeration on product quality (Saito and Matsuura 2016). Their
findings suggest that state and municipal tax breaks and other public efforts to attract enterprises

enhance economic competitiveness by improving product quality along with productivity.

Productivity gains used to project traditionally agglomeration benefits underestimate the benefits

by ignoring the quality incentives accompanying a productivity shock.


6. Globalization Matters


   Globalization is currently facing some challenging political tests, more than in the past

   decades. Brexit may have been the first wave of anti-globalization and rising populism that

   gushes over the most advanced nations. Globalization and new-technology forces trigger a

   steady decline in low-tech manufacturing industries, a rise in global financial centers, and

   increased immigration flows, brought up the 2017 change of guards in the US. Meanwhile,

   European countries like France, Greece, the Netherland, Spain, Demark and others witness the

   anti-EU forces gather strength. The EU refugee crisis, The EMU crisis, the political backlash

   against trade treaties in the US; which threatens the proposed multi-lateral trade agreements

   such as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (US-EU trade deal) and the Trans-

   Pacific Partnership (US-Asia trade deal), and more. The open-border model, which governed

   the global economy for more than 70 years, is unravelling. However, the acceleration of

   finance, technology and telecommunication and supply chains makes the reversal from

   globalization self-defeating. The remarkable transformation of Israel’s economy from low tech

   to high tech through trade and financial integration in the world economy provides a strong

   counter example to the anti-globalization logic.
 Appendix A: A model of foreign venture capital investment10

           Consider a small economy faced by a continuum [0, 1] of foreign investors. Each foreign

investor has an opportunity to invest in one investment project, as in B- to-B transactions (FDI).

Foreign investment can occur in one of two forms: either as a direct venture capital, the direct

investor effectively acts like a manager; or, as a portfolio investment, the investor does not

manage the project.

           There are three periods: 0, 1, and 2. In period 0, each investor decides whether to make a

direct investment or a portfolio investment. In period 2, the project matures. The net cash flow

from the start-up project is given by


                           1
R  K ,    1    K    AK 2 ,                                                        (1)
                           2


where ε is an idiosyncratic random productivity factor, which is independently realized for each

project in period 1, and K is the level of capital input invested in the project in period 1, after the

realization of ε. The parameter A reflects production costs. The productivity shock ε is distributed

between –1 and 1 with mean 0 with the cumulative distribution function,  () , and the density

function is f ()   '() . Investors choose the form of investment that maximizes (ex ante)

expected payoff.

           In period 1, after the realization of the productivity shock, the manager of the project

observes ε. Thus, if the investor owns the project as a direct investment, she observes ε, and

chooses K, so as to maximize the net cash flow: K d ( )  (1   ) / A .




10
     Based on Goldstein and Razin (2006).
        Therefore, the ex ante expected net cash flow from a direct investment, if held until

maturity, is


        E[1    ]
                  2

EVd                   .                                                                    (2)
            2A


In the case of a portfolio investment, the owner has an arm’s-length relationship with the

manager, and thus she cannot observe ε. In this case, the owner maximizes the expected return

absent any information on the realization of ε; and decisions are based on the ex ante zero mean.

Thus, the manager will be instructed to choose K p  K d (0)  (1/ A) . Then, the ex ante expected

payoff from a portfolio investment, if held until maturity, is


EVp  1/(2 A) .                                                                             (3)


Comparing (6A.2) with (6A.3), we see that if the project is held until maturity, it yields a higher

payoff as a direct investment than as a portfolio investment. This reflects the efficiency that

results from a hands-on management style in the case of a direct investment.

        There are also costs for FDI investment, however. First, an FDI investor has to incur a

fixed cost in order to acquire the expertise to manage the project directly. We denote this cost,

which is exogenously given in the model, by C. Second, there is an endogenous cost arising from

the possibility of liquidity shocks occurring in period 1. There is a discount when selling a

project managed as direct investment due to information asymmetries, as demonstrated below.

        In period 1, before the value of ε is observed, the owner of the project might get a

liquidity shock. With the realization of a liquidity shock, the investor is forced to sell the project

in period 1. This feature of the model is similar to the preference-shock assumption made by
Diamond and Dybvig (1983): An investor who is subject to a liquidity shock derives her utility

only from period 1 consumption. If, however, she is not subject to a liquidity shock, she derives

her utility from period 2 consumption. We denote by λ the probability of a liquidity shock. We

assume that there are two types of foreign investors. In particular, half of the investors will need

to sell with probability λH and half with probability λL such that 1 > λH > (1/2) > λL > 0, and λH +

λL = 1.

          Investors know ex ante whether they are of a λH type or a λL type, and this is their private

information. In addition to liquidity-based sales, there is a possibility that an investor will

liquidate a project in period 1 if she observes a low realization of ε. Then the price that buyers

are willing to pay for a direct investment that is being sold in period 1 is

                         D

               (1   D )  (1   ) 2 f ( ) d   D

          2A         (1   D ) ( D )   D


          Here,  D is a threshold level of ε, set by the direct investor; below which the direct

investor is selling the project without being forced to do so by a liquidity shock; λD is the

probability, as perceived by the market, that an FDI investor gets a liquidity shock. In equation

(4), it is assumed that if the project is sold because of a liquidity shock, that is, before the initial

owner observes ε, the value of ε is not recorded in the firms before the sale. Therefore, the buyer

does not know the value of ε. However, if the project is sold for low-profitability reasons, the

owner will know the value of ε after the sale. The threshold  D is determined in equilibrium.

The initial owner sets the threshold level  D , such that given the price PD , when observing  D ,
an investor is indifferent between selling and not selling the project in absence of a liquidity

shock. Thus,


       1   D 
                    2

PD                     .                                                                                (5)
           2A


Equations (4) and (5) together determine PD and  D as functions of the market-perceived

probability of sale due to the liquidity shock (λD). We denote these functions as  D (λD) and PD

(λD).

          When a portfolio investor sells the projects in period 1, everybody knows she does it

because of a liquidity shock. Thus, the price of the project is given by

         1
Pp        .                                                                                             (6)
        2A


Comparing the price of FDI, which is determined by equations (6A.4) and (6A.5), with the price

of FPI, which is determined by equation (6A.6), we see that the resale price of a direct

investment in period 1 is always lower than the resale price of a portfolio investment in that

period. The intuition is that if a direct investor prematurely sells the investment project, the

market price must reflect the possibility that the sale originates from inside information on low

prospects of this investment project. This constitutes the second (liquidity) cost of FDI.

          Based on our analysis, we can write the ex ante expected net cash flow from FDI:

EVp  A       A.                                                                          (8)
              2


Then, the difference between the expected value of FDI and the expected value of FPI is


Diff  i , D , A, C   EVD  i , D , A, C   EVp ( A) .                               (9)


Clearly, investors will choose FDI (FPI) when Diff  i , D , A, C   0 ( 0) and will be indifferent

between the two (i.e., may choose either FDI or FPI) when Diff  i , D , A, C   0 .

         To complete the description of the equilibrium, it remains to be specified how λD, the

market-perceived probability that an FDI investor will get a liquidity shock, is determined.

Assuming that rational expectations hold in equilibrium, λD has to be consistent with the

equilibrium choice of the two types of investors between FDI and FPI, such that


D  (H H,FDI  L L,FDI ) /(H,FDI  L,FDI ) ,                                       (10)


where λH,FDI is the proportion of λH investors (H investors) who choose FDI in equilibrium, and

λL,FDI is the proportion of λL investors (L investors) who choose FDI in equilibrium.

         Five possible cases can potentially be observed in equilibrium. Case 1: All investors

choose FDI. Case 2: L investors choose FDI; H investors split between FDI and FPI. Case 3: L

investors choose FDI; H investors choose FPI. Case 4: λL investors split between FDI and FPI; H

investors choose FPI. Case 5: All investors choose FPI. Equilibrium outcomes depend on

production cost A and liquidity preferences (λL, λH).
       As the production cost A increases, we are more likely to observe FPI and less likely to

observe FDI in equilibrium. As the difference in liquidity needs of the two types of investors

widens, we are more likely to see a separating equilibrium, where different types of investors

choose different forms of investment.
