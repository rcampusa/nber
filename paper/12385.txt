                                           ABSTRACT

We explore the determinants of research specialization across countries and its consequences for
relative wages. Using a dynamic Ricardian model we examine the effects of faster international
technology diffusion and lower trade barriers on the incentive to innovate. In the absence of any
diffusion at all, countries devote the same share of resources toward research regardless of trade
barriers or research productivity. As long as trade barriers are not too high, faster diffusion shifts
research activity toward the country that does it better. This shift in research activity raises the
relative wage there. It can even mean that, with more diffusion, the country better at research ends
up with a larger share of technologies in its exclusive domain.

1        Introduction

Research indicators reveal strong and consistent patterns of specialization in innovation. Table

1 reports the number of business sector research scientists per thousand workers in industry

among OECD and selected non-OECD members, in descending order of research intensity. By

virtue of their size and high research intensity, most research is done in the United States and

Japan. Research-intensive countries tend to be wealthy, but some wealthy countries, such as

Australia and Italy, don’t do much private sector research. Moreover, with the exception of

the recent emergence of Finland as a research center, patterns of research specialization have

remained very stable over time. The countries contributing the most to innovation now are

mostly the same ones as half a century ago.1

        What characteristics of a country determine specialization in research, and how does open-

ness a¤ect the incentive to innovate? This question has been posed in a number of contexts in

which openness has meant di¤erent things. It could refer to the absence of trade barriers, but

also to the absence of barriers to the di¤usion of ideas themselves. While trade allows con-

sumers in another country to bene…t from an innovation by importing a good that embodies

the idea, technology di¤usion allows them to bene…t through local production making use of

that idea. Expanding one conduit or the other may have very di¤erent implications for the

incentive to innovate in either location. A related question is the role of country character-

istics in determining international patterns of specialization in innovative activity. Do large

countries, for example, naturally do more research because their inventors have quicker access

to a large internal market?

        The literature on international technology di¤usion is large. Keller (2004) provides a

comprehensive survey. A number of papers have looked at the e¤ect of one type of openness

taking the degree of openness of the other type as given. Examples are Helpman (1993),

Eaton, Gutierrez, and Kortum (1998), Eaton and Kortum (henceforth EK) (1999), and EK
    1
    Eaton, Gutierrez, and Kortum (1998), Eaton and Kortum (1999), Eaton and Kortum (2001a) provide
further analysis of research indicators across countries and over time.
(2001b). Helpman (1993), for example, …nds that, with no trade costs, faster di¤usion to an

imitating country can spur innovation by reducing the wage, and hence the cost of innovation,

in the innovating country. In a model with no di¤usion, EK (2001b), …nd that the degree of

openness to trade has no e¤ect on innovative activity: While exporting increases the size of

the market that a successful innovator can capture, it also means that an innovator faces a

higher hurdle in terms of competition from abroad through imports. The two forces exactly

o¤set each other. In their model, unlike Helpman’s, all countries engage in innovative activity.

      To explore these issues further we develop a two-region model, like Helpman’s, of innovation

and di¤usion. In contrast to much of the literature, innovation can in principle take place in

either region, although research productivities may di¤er. Ideas can di¤use between locations,

but with a lag. We allow for an arbitrary level of trade barriers, with costless trade a special

case. We then explore the incentives to innovate under di¤erent assumptions about the speed

of di¤usion and about the magnitude of trade barriers.

      While our model could be extended to analyze the implications of imperfect protection of

intellectual property, that is not our purpose here. To isolate the e¤ects of geographical barriers

to the movement of goods and ideas, we make the simplest assumption for our purposes, that

innovators can appropriate the entire returns to their innovation at home and abroad.2

      We proceed as follows:

      Section 2 develops a static two-country model of technology, production, and trade along

the lines of the Ricardian model developed in EK (2002). In their many-country model,

the distribution of technologies is treated as independent from country to country. Such an

outcome is consistent, for example, with a world in which each country relies on its own

innovations for production, or one in which an innovation applying to a particular good in one

country applies to some di¤erent good where it di¤uses. Here we consider the more natural,

but much more complicated, case in which an innovation, when it di¤uses, applies to the same
  2
    The role of intellectual property protection was a main concern of Helpman (1993). The issue has been
revisited recently by Gancia (2003) and by Dinopoulos and Segerstrom (2005).



                                                   2
good. This extension forces us to distinguish between innovations that are in the exclusive

domain of the innovating country, and those that have di¤used to a common pool that both

countries can access. Because of the many di¤erent situations that can arise, we limit ourselves

to a two-country case. Even here we need to distinguish among situations in which: (i) one

country uses only those technologies that are exclusive to it, leaving the common technologies

to the other country, (ii) both countries use common technologies, with one country exporting

goods produced using these technologies to the other country, and (iii) both countries use

common technologies, with no trade in goods produced using them. The …rst case replicates

the situation in EK (2002), since the technologies that each country actually uses are drawn

from independent distributions. Di¤usion has no impact on the extent of trade. In the second

two cases, di¤usion substitutes for trade, as at least a range of the goods produced with the

common technology are nontraded. Nontradedness arises not because transport costs for these

goods are higher, but because similarities in e¢ ciency between countries have eliminated any

scope for exploiting comparative advantage.

   Section 3 introduces simple dynamics into the analysis. Each country innovates at an

exogenous rate, and ideas di¤use from one to another at exogenous rates. The processes of

innovation and di¤usion generate a world steady-state growth rate in which the two countries,

depending on their abilities to innovate and to absorb ideas from abroad, have (except by

coincidence) di¤erent relative income levels. The framework can deliver “product cycles,” as

in Krugman (1979), in which the innovator initially exports the good using the technology it

has developed, but later imports it once the technology has di¤used abroad. In our model

other outcomes are also possible. If the innovation is su¢ ciently small, before di¤usion, the

other country may continue to produce the good on its own using inferior technology rather

than import the good from the innovator. In fact, its own technology could even be superior,

so that the innovation is never useful outside the country of innovation.

   Section 4 endogenizes inventive activity. It …rst calculates the value of ideas in each country,



                                                3
which determine the returns to innovation. The trade-o¤ between the returns to innovation

and to production governs the extent of inventive activity in each country. We consider the

role of openness in the form of (i) lower trade barriers and (ii) faster di¤usion on inventive

activity in each country. A special case is no di¤usion, returning us to EK (2001): Each country

allocates the same share of resources to invention regardless of its size or research productivity.

Turning to the other extreme of immediate di¤usion, we …nd that the same result emerges if

the trade barrier exceeds the ratio of research productivities. But if the trade barrier is lower

than the ratio of research productivities, the more e¢ cient researcher specializes in innovation

along Ricardian lines.

    Section 5 o¤ers some concluding remarks.


2    A Model of Technology, Production, and Trade

Our production structure is Ricardian. Following Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977,

henceforth DFS), we consider a world with a unit continuum of goods, which we label by

j 2 [0; 1]: There are two countries, which we label N (for North) and S (for South). Each

country has a set of available technologies for making each of the goods on the continuum. Some

technologies, denoted N; are available only to the North while another set, S; are available

exclusively to the South. A third set C are commonly available. A technology is the ability to

produce zi (j) units of good j with one worker, where, depending on which type of technology

we are talking about, i = N; S; C. (It is convenient for us to use i to index both the three

types of technologies i = N; S; C and the two countries i = N; S that have exclusive knowledge

of technologies i = N; S respectively.)

    We treat the zi (j)’s as realizations of random variables Zi drawn independently for each j

from the Fréchet distributions:


                               Fi (z) = Pr[Zi    z] = exp[ Ti z   ]                            (1)


which are independent across i = N; S; C: In this static context the Ti ’s re‡ect the average

                                                4
e¢ ciencies across the three sets of technologies. (We consider how these distributions arise

from a dynamic process of innovation and di¤usion in Sections 3 and 4.)

       The best technologies available in country i are realizations of:

                                      Zi = max fZi ; ZC g i = N; S:

Thus the random variable Zi has distribution:

                                   Fi (z) = Pr[Zi        z] = exp[ Ti z      ]

where Ti = Ti + TC : The Ti re‡ect the average e¢ ciencies across the set of technologies

available to country i = N; S:

       EK (2002) consider a case in which there is no common technology, so that TC = 0: An

implication is that the distributions of e¢ ciencies available to each country are independent.

Here there is independence across the exclusive technologies, but the common technologies

induce a positive correlation between ZN and ZS : Because of this correlation we will …nd it

easier to work with the three independent technology distributions of ZN ; ZS ; and ZC .

       As is standard in a Ricardian setting, workers are identical and mobile across activities

within a country, but cannot change countries. The wage is wN in the North and wS in

the South. We take the wage in the South to be the numeraire, although we leave wS in

formulas for clarity. Labor market clearing conditions, introduced below, establish the relative

wage. Without loss of generality we will impose restrictions on exogenous variables so that in

equilibrium wN        wS .3

       As in DFS, demand is Cobb-Douglas, which we further simplify by assuming that expen-

diture shares are the same across goods. Hence expenditure in country i on good j is:

                                                 Xi (j) = Xi ;

where Xi is total expenditure.4
   3
     Below we consider the case in which technologies and the labor forces evolve over time. Since in this section
we solve the static equilibrium given these magnitudes, we omit time subscripts for now.
   4
     A generalization to CES preferences is straightforward. See, for example, Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and
Kortum (2003).


                                                        5
   Also as in DFS, goods can be transported between the countries, but in order to deliver one

unit to the destination d   1 units need to be shipped from the source (the standard “iceberg"

assumption). Unfortunately, even in low-dimensional Ricardian problems, taxonomies are

inevitable. There are three cases to consider: (1) If wN > wS d then the commonly available

technologies are used only in the South; the North uses only those technologies unique to it.

(2) If wN = wS d then the commonly available technologies may be used in both countries, but

goods produced using these technologies are exported only by the South. (3) If wN < wS d

then each country will use the commonly available technologies. Goods produced using these

technologies aren’t traded since it’s more expensive to import the good than to make it oneself.

2.1   Cost Distributions

To mitigate the proliferation of special cases, we introduce the term wni to indicate the e¤ective

wage, inclusive of transport cost, for goods sold in country n produced using technology i: Here

n = N; S and i = N; S; C: Taking the case of the Northern market, wN N = wN and wN S =

wS d; while wN C = min fwS d; wN g is the wage paid to labor producing goods using the common

technologies and sold in the North (including transport cost should the South be the sole user).

Hence wN C =zC (j) is the cost of selling good j in the North if it is produced using a common

technology. In the …rst case above wN C = wS d < wN , in the second wN C = wN = wS d, and

in the third wN C = wN < wS d. For the Southern market wSS = wSC = wS and wSN = dwN .

   The lowest cost for good j in the North is thus:


                     cN (j) = min fwN =zN (j); wN C =zC (j); wS d=zS (j)g

                             =     min fwN i =zi (j)g
                                  i=N;S;C


while in the South it is:


                      cS (j) = min fwN d=zN (j); wS =zC (j); wS =zS (j)g

                              =     min fwSi =zi (j)g:
                                  i=N;S;C




                                                6
Note that, for all goods j, the ratio of costs is bounded above and below by d           cS (j)=cN (j)

1=d; with equality on the left if N exports j to S and equality on the right if S exports j to

N:

     For i = N; S; the lowest cost ci (j) is the realization of a random variable Ci whose dis-

tribution derives from the distribution of the underlying technologies Zi : We denote the cost

distribution in i by Hi (c) = Pr[Ci     c]. The cost distribution in the North is:


               HN (c) = 1       Pr[ZN         wN =c] Pr[ZS        wS d=c] Pr[ZC   wN C =c]

                        = 1     FN (wN =c)FS (wS d=c)FC (wN C =c)
                                    h      i
                        = 1     exp     Nc


where

                                N   = TN wN + TS (wS d)           + TC wN C :

Similarly, for the South:
                                                              h        i
                                      HS (c) = 1        exp       Sc


where

                                S   = TN (wN d)         + TS wS + TC wS :

We can summarize these results on the cost distributions, for n = N; S, as
                                                              h        i
                                      Hn (c) = 1        exp       nc


where
                                                    X
                                          n   =             Ti wni :
                                                  i=N;S;C

     As in EK (2002), the probability that country n will …nd technology of type i the lowest

cost source for some good is:
                                                        Ti wni
                                               ni   =                                                (2)
                                                            n

where n = N; S and i = N; S; C: The di¤erence from EK (2002) is that the sources are not

necessarily countries, but rather sets of technologies.

                                                        7
2.2     Trade Patterns and Wages

We now complete the description of the static equilibrium by describing how labor market

clearing determines wages in each country, and characterize patterns of trade. We posit that

each country i has LPi production workers i = N; S: To keep things simple, here we assume

perfect competition, introducing Bertrand competition in Section 4 where we endogenize in-

novation.

   Under many standard assumptions about market structure (including perfect competition

or Bertrand competition),    ni    de…ned in (2) is the fraction of country n’s expenditure devoted

to goods produced with technology of type i: If Xn is total spending by country n; spending

on labor producing goods using exclusively Northern technologies is:

                                     wN LE
                                         N =    N N XN   +   SN XS :                            (3)

Here LE
      N is the measure of Northern workers using exclusively Northern technologies.

   We now need to distinguish among the three kinds of equilibria:

2.2.1    Case 1: The North uses only its Exclusive Technologies

In this case, LE    P          P
               N = LN ; where LN are all Northern workers engaged in production. Since only

the South uses commonly available technologies, wN C = wS d: The solution needs to satisfy

wN > dwS in order for the North not to use them.

   Under perfect competition, all LPi workers in each country are engaged in production and

labor is the only source of income, so that Xi = wi LPi : In this case expression (3) above,

combined with expression (2) for the trade share ni ; becomes:
                           "                                  #1=(1+ )
                    wN         TN =LPN TN wN + TS (wS d)
                        =                                              :                        (4)
                    wS         TS =LPS TN (wN d) + TS wS

where, as de…ned above, TS = TS +TC : While the equation does not admit an analytic solution,

it is easy to solve numerically.

   Since the North does not use the common technologies, all goods produced are equally

tradeable regardless of which type of technology they employ. The fact that the North has

                                                   8
access to common technologies is irrelevant since it doesn’t use them. The outcome is isomor-

phic to one in which the North knows only the technologies that are exclusive to it, while the

common technologies are exclusive to the South, as in EK (2002).

2.2.2   Case 2: The North and the South both use Common Technologies, with
        Trade in Some Goods Produced using Them

In this case wN C = wN = wS d. Hence the relative wage is pinned down by the transport cost,

since wN =wS = d: The demand for workers using exclusively Northern technologies is:

                                    LEN   TN     TN d 2     LPS
                                        =    +                                              (5)
                                    LPN   TW   TN d 2 + TS dLPN

where TW = TN + TC + TS ; a measure of world technology. For this case to emerge parameter

values must be such that LE   P
                          N =LN not exceed one. Otherwise we are in Case 1 above. We also

need the demand for workers using the South’s exclusive technologies LE
                                                                      S not to exceed the

supply of Southern workers. This condition requires that the ratio

                                    LE
                                     S   TS dLPN         TS
                                     P
                                       =      P
                                                 +       2 +T
                                    LS   T W LS    T N d      S


not exceed one. Otherwise we are in Case 3 below.

   In Case 2 the range of goods produced using common technologies in the North are not

traded. Hence, unlike case 1, technology di¤usion results in less trade than otherwise. Di¤usion

substitutes for trade.

2.2.3   Case 3: Goods Produced with Common Technologies are not Traded

In this case wN C = wN < wS d: Labor market equilibrium requires a wage wN that solves:


                                wN LPN = (    NN   +   N C )XN   +   SN XS ;



which, using (2), becomes:
                                "                                        #1=(1+   )
                         wN         TN =LPN    TN wN + TS (wS d)
                            =                                                         :
                         wS         TS =LPS    TN (wN d)     + TS wS



                                                       9
where, as de…ned above, TN = TN +TC and TS = TS +TC : Again, there is no analytic solution,

but solving for the wage numerically is straightforward.

    Here all goods produced with common technologies are not traded. Technology di¤usion

reduces the scope for trade even further.

2.3   Trade and Prices

What is the relationship between technology, wages, and prices in each of these cases? In

Cases 1 and 2 the wage in the North is higher than that in the South by a factor of at least d

while the prices of goods produced using common technologies are higher by a factor of exactly

d. Hence the real wage in the North is higher.

    In Cases 2 and 3, some or all goods made with the common technologies are produced in

both countries. Since the wage is higher in the North these goods are more expensive there,

delivering the (Balassa-Samuelson) implication that the relative price of untraded goods is

lower in the South.


3     Simple Technology Dynamics

We have so far considered the static equilibrium in which parameters of the technology distri-

bution are given. Over time, however, we can envisage processes of innovation and di¤usion

governing the evolution of the Tit ’s (introducing a time subscript). We …rst follow the spec-

i…cation in Krugman (1979), for example, which allows us to stick with perfect competition:

Each country innovates at an exogenous rate that is proportional to its current knowledge, and

ideas ‡ow from the exclusive to the common pool at rates that are proportional to the stocks of

exclusive ideas. We introduce four parameters,        N;   the rate at which the North innovates,   S;

the rate at which the South innovates,   N;   the rate at which the South learns about exclusively

Northern ideas, and   S;   the rate at which the North learns about exclusively Southern ideas:




                                                 10
Thus TN t ; TSt ; and TCt evolve according to:

                          :
                          T Nt = (           N       N )TN t   +    N TCt   =      N TN t     N TN t

                              :
                          T St = (           S       S )TSt   +    S TCt   =   S TSt        S TSt

                          :
                          T Ct =            N TN t   +   S TSt :


While the analytic solution to this dynamic system is complex, it is straightforward to show

that as long as the innovation and di¤usion parameters are strictly positive and the initial

value of at least one Ti is positive, the system evolves to a steady state in which all three types

of knowledge grow at the same rate.

    In general, the resulting growth rate of technology is the solution to an unpleasant cubic

equation. It can be shown, however, that the steady-state growth rate is increasing in both

the innovation and di¤usion parameters (see, e.g., EK, 1999). In the special case of symmetry,

N   =   S   = ; and   N   =       S   = ; the steady-state growth rate is merely quadratic:
                                                         q
                                                      + (       )2 + 8
                                           gT =                         ;
                                                            2

strictly increasing in            and : A world with more innovation but also more di¤usion grows

faster. Krugman (1979) considers a special case in which only the North innovates, so that

iS = 0 and the growth rate is just               N   while TS = 0:


4       Endogenizing Innovation

We now extend the model to endogenize innovation. We continue to assume that exclusive

ideas ‡ow into common knowledge at a common exogenous rate .

    As in Kortum (1997), we model innovation as the production of ideas. An idea is a way to

produce a good j with output per worker q: We assume that an idea is equally likely to apply

to any good in the unit interval, and that q is the realization of a random variable Q drawn

from the Pareto distribution:

                                           Pr[Q       q] = 1        q          q     1:                (6)

                                                               11
Only an idea that lowers the cost of serving a market will be used.

   This distribution of the e¢ ciency of new ideas is consistent with our distributional assump-

tion in Section 2 about the best technologies culled from past ideas. To see why, consider how

one new idea will interact with the set of existing technologies in i = N; S; C. It adds to that

set if and only if Q > Zi , which occurs with probability:
                                            Z 1
                             Pr[Q > Zi ] =       Pr[Q > z]dFi (z)
                                             0
                                    Z 1
                                                       1
                                          z    Ti z      e Ti z dz
                                    Z0 1
                                  =       (x=Ti ) e x dx = 1=Ti ;
                                                0


where the approximation is arbitrarily close for large Ti . We can use this result to derive the

distribution of Q conditional on Q > Zi :
                                                      Z   q
                      Pr[Q     qjQ > Zi ] =   Ti Pr[q                    Q > z]dFi (z)
                                            0
                               Z q
                                                                          1       Ti z
                             =     Ti z     q     Ti z                        e          dz
                               Z0 1
                             =       xe x dx Ti q e                    Ti q
                                   Ti q
                                          x
                             =        e       (x + 1)j1
                                                      Ti q      Ti q     e    Ti q


                                      Ti q
                             = e                = Fi (q):


Thus, conditional on joining the set of best technologies, the quality of a new idea inherits the

distribution of the quality of existing technologies. The Fréchet distribution is passed along

over time as its parameter Ti increases with innovative e¤ort.

   Initially, ideas from country n are usable only for production there. Hence, for an idea

from country n to lower the cost of producing good j for the home market, q must satisfy:


                              wn =q       cn (j) = min fwni =zi (j)g
                                                      i=N;S;C


where zN (j); zS (j), and zC (j) represent the states of the art in the exclusively Northern,

exclusively Southern, and commonly available technologies, respectively. (Recall that wni is

                                                      12
the transport cost-inclusive wage applying to technology i in market n.) To lower the cost of

of producing good j for the foreign market m 6= n it must satisfy:


                              wn d=q   cm (j) = min fwmi =zi (j)g :
                                                   i=N;S;C


Given the current local cost cn (j) of good j; the probability that a local innovation will lower

cost is:

                      Pr[wn =Q    cn (j)] = Pr[Q        wn =cn (j)] = [wn =cn (j)]

while given the cost in the foreign market m; cm (j); the probability that it lowers cost abroad

is:

                  Pr[wn d=Q      cm (j)] = Pr[Q     wn d=cm (j)] = [wn d=cm (j)]     :

Since, with the possibility of trade, the cost of a good can never di¤er between countries by

a factor greater than d; and can di¤er by less, the criterion for exporting is tougher. Small

innovations may be used to produce only for the home market, while larger ones will be used

for export as well.

4.1     The Distribution of the Markup

We need to introduce an incentive for innovation. We follow the quality-ladders framework

(Grossman and Helpman, 1991, Aghion and Howitt, 1992) and posit that the owner of an

innovation has the ability to use it to produce and sell a product at the highest price that

keeps the competition at bay. With Cobb-Douglas preferences, this price equals the unit cost

using the next best technology. The resulting markup of price over unit cost on a particular

good is the ratio of the cost of producing it using the previous technology to the cost of

producing it using the latest technology.

      Consider some new idea in technology class i = N; S; C which could be used to produce

a particular good for market n = N; S. The idea may or may not be of any economic value.

The latent markup using the idea is Mnit = Cnt =(wni =Q) (where capital letters denote random



                                                   13
variables). The e¢ ciency of the idea, Q, is drawn from the distribution (6) while the cost using

the previous technology, Cnt , is drawn independently from the relevant cost distribution:
                                                             h                  i
                                    Hnt (c) = 1        exp               nt c       :


If the latent markup is less than one, of course, the idea will not be used in market n at all. If

the latent markup exceeds one the idea will be used, the good will sell at price Cnt in market

n, and the actual markup there will equal the latent markup.

   The probability that the latent markup exceeds some value m is:


                      bnit (m) = Pr[Mnit m] = Pr[Cnt wni m=Q]
                                 Z1
                                                            1
                               =    Pr[Cnt mwni =QjQ = q] q   dq
                                      1
                                     Z1         h                                   i
                                                                                            1
                                =         exp          nt (mwni ) q                     q       dq
                                      1
                                       m
                                                   ;
                                          nt wni


where the last approximation becomes exact as                   nt   gets large. (Since we consider a steady

state in which wni is constant, we do not index it by t.) For the good to be sold, of course,

requires M    1; which occurs with probability:

                                                             1
                                           bnit (1) =
                                                            nt wni


which, using (2), we can rewrite:
                                                                ni
                                             bnit (1) =              :
                                                            Tit

   The distribution of the markup is equal to the distribution of the latent markup conditional

on M      1. This conditional distribution is simply

                          bnit (1) bnit (m)
                G(m) =                      =1              m            n = N; S; i = N; S; C;
                                 bnit (1)

the Pareto distribution with parameter , for m               1. Note that the distribution of the markup

is invariant to the technology class i, the market n, or the date t.

                                                       14
    Integrating across the markup distribution G(m); the expected ‡ow of pro…t from an idea

conditional on selling in country n is:
                                   Z1
                                                 1                Xnt
                             Xnt        (1   m       )dG(m) =         ; n = N; S
                                                                  1+
                                   1

which is also the total pro…t generated in country n: The fraction of total pro…t earned by

using technology of type i = N; S; C in market n is                     ni :     Taking into account the probability

that an idea will be useful in that country, the expected pro…t in market n of an idea from

technology i at time t is:
                                                          1       ni Xnt
                                             nit     =                       :
                                                         1+       Tit

As time passes, Xnt and Tit both grow. The …rst causes expected pro…t from an idea to rise

over time as the size of the market grows. The second causes expected pro…t from the idea

to fall over time through the hazard of losing the market to a cheaper source of production.

Conditional on still being of value, one idea is just like any other in terms of the distribution

of its quality Q; regardless of when it was invented.

    We denote the aggregate price level in country n at time t by Pnt . Cobb-Douglas preferences

dictate that the price level be calculated as the geometric mean of individual prices in country

n. The price of each good in country n is the product of the unit cost of producing it and its

markup. Thus,

                  Pnt = expfE[ln(Mnt Cnt )]g = expfE[ln(Mnt )] + E[ln(Cnt )]g
                            Z 1                      Z 1
                                              1
                      = exp     (ln m) m        dm +     (ln c)dHnt (c)
                                        1                                0
                                       1          1=
                        = exp                    nt      ;

where     is Euler’s constant (.5772...).5

    With these expressions in hand we are now armed to calculate the value of ideas.
   5
     Another way to derive this expression for the price level is to note that with Bertrand competition, the
                                                                                (2)
price of a good is the second lowest cost of producing it, which we denote by Cnt . This second lowest cost in
country n has distribution:
                                      (2)
                                   Hnt (c) = 1     1 + nt c exp(      nt c ):

(See equation (8) of Bernard, Eaton Jensen, and Kortum, 2003, setting c1 = c2 :). The price level in country n

4.2     The Value of Ideas

Taking into account possible di¤usion, as well as changes in the price level, the expected real

value of an idea developed in country i over its lifetime is:


                Z     1

made with technologies of type i.

    We assume that both labor forces grow at rate gL ; with LN =                                             LS : We require that

gL = < : In steady state, wages and the                          ni     are constant, while the T ’s grow at rate gT ; so

that prices fall at rate gT = : Pro…t is a constant share of income, which also grows at rate gL :

    Because of royalty payments on technologies used for domestic production that were in-

vented abroad, we need to distinguish country i’s income Xit ; which includes net royalty income

from abroad, from its output, which we denote Yit : We can write the income of country i; Xit ;

in terms of outputs Yit and Ynt ; n 6= i; as:

                                                                ! in         ! ni
                                           Xit = (1                  )Yit +       Ynt
                                                               1+           1+

where ! ni is the share of the technology used in country n owned by inventors from country

i: Since labor income from production in country i is wi LPit ; where LPit denotes production

workers, we can relate output to labor income as follows:

                                                                  Yit   1+
                                          Yit = wi LPit +             =    wi LPit :
                                                                 1+

Hence:
                                              1
                                   Xit =          (1 +           ! in )wi LPit + ! ni wn LPnt :                               (8)

We use these expressions for income in deriving the value of ideas in the various cases we

consider below.

4.3    The Rate of Innovation

As is common in the endogenous growth literature, we introduce a production function for

innovation, with country i having research productivity                        i;    i = N; S: The rate at which ideas

in technology i are created is thus             i rit Lit ;   i = N; S; where ri is the share of country i0 s labor

force doing research and Li is its total labor force. We assume that an idea transits from either

exclusive technology into the common technology with a common hazard :

   We de…ne the ratio of technology exclusive to country i to country i workers at time t as

tit = Tit =Lit : It evolves according to:
                                        :                 :
                                        tit              T it Lit
                                                  =
                                        tit              Tit     Lit
                                                          i rit Lit
                                                  =                  (gL + ):
                                                            Tit

In steady state both ri and ti are constant, so that ti =                           i ri =(gL   + ) and gT = gL : Finally,

de…ning tCt = TCt =(TN t + TSt ); the ratio of common to exclusive technologies, tC evolves

according to:
                                                                     :     :
                                            :                     T N t + T St
                                            tCt =             tCt              :
                                                                  TN t + TSt

Thus in steady state tC is constant and equals =gL :

   Since in steady state gT = gL ; our expression for the value of ideas (7) becomes:

                                    1                 N i XN t+ Si XSt
                  Vit =                                                                                                (9)
                                +       gL =              (1 + )Tit
                                        1                     1                N C XN t   + SC XSt
                            +                                                                      :
                                        gL =               +    gL =                  (1 + )TCt

where the Xit are given by (8) above, where i; n = N; S; i 6= n:

   In an equilibrium in which workers in a country engage simultaneously in production and

in innovation, the return to each activity should be equal. More generally, the conditions for



                                                                17
labor market equilibrium are that:


                                     i Vit   = wit          rit 2 [0; 1]                              (10)

                                     i Vit         wit      rit = 0

                                     i Vit         wit      rit = 1


for i = N; S:

   A steady-state equilibrium is a solution for rN ; rS ; and wN =wS consistent with (10) and

product market clearing as derived in Section 2.

4.4     Steady State Research and Growth

Because of the taxonomy of situations that can arise, we avoid trying to provide a general

analytic solution. But under each of four particular assumptions about di¤usion and trade

barriers the model yields insight into the e¤ects of globalization on research: (i) no di¤usion

( = 0), (ii) instantaneous di¤usion ( ! 1), (iii) no trade. (d ! 1); and (iv) costless trade

(d = 1). As these four cases circumnavigate the full range of possibilities, they provide insight

into the general solution:

4.4.1     No Di¤usion

Setting    = 0 gives us EK (2001b). Each country has to use its own ideas for production.

Hence, spending on goods produced with ideas exclusive to country i corresponds with the

total production of country i; Yit =    N i XN t   +     Si XSt :   Substituting this expression into value

of ideas above and solving for labor market equilibrium in each country gives:

                                                       gL
                                              r=            :


In steady state all countries do the same amount of research relative to their labor forces

regardless of their size or their research productivity. Since there are no common technologies,

we are in Case 1 above.

   We now explore how much international technology di¤usion upsets this stark result.

                                                   18
4.4.2     Instantaneous Di¤usion

Consider the opposite case in which di¤usion is instantaneous ( ! 1): Now all ideas are

common, so that       nC   = 1; n = N; S: Since all ideas di¤use immediately they have the same

value regardless of their origin. We can write the value of an idea from either country as:

                                    1        wN LN (1        rN ) + wS LS (1    rS )
                            V =                                                        :
                                        gL                      TC

Since the South can use all the same technologies as the North, for the North to engage in

production requires that wN         wS d: (Remember that wN               wS throughout our analysis.)

    What happens depends on the relative size of                N= S   and d:


   1. Say that    N= S       d: Then, as long as the North continues to produce, wN = wS d and

        we are in Case 2 above. The North does all the research (rS = 0): The share of workers

        in the North doing research is:

                                                        gL
                                               rN =          (1 + 1=d )                               (11)


        (which cannot exceed one). Note that, compared with the case of no di¤usion, the amount

        of research is higher in the North in proportion to the relative size of the South (1= )

        discounted by the trade barrier (1=d). Because of this discounting, the number of people

        engaged in research in the world is smaller than with no di¤usion. But since           N= S      d;

        e¤ective research is higher since Northern research workers are more productive. This

        condition is what ensures that if the North is both producing and doing research then

        the South does not …nd research worthwhile. In this equilibrium the South runs a trade

        surplus with the North to pay for the ideas it uses in production. The location of

        production of any particular good is indeterminate.6
   6
     If the South is very large compared to the North ( near 0) then the value of rN in expression (11) can
exceed one. In this case the North will specialize completely in research (rN = 1) and wN can exceed wS d:
Depending on parameter values, the South might …nd research worthwhile as well. We leave this case as an
exercise.




                                                      19
   2. Say instead that        N= S       d: We are in Case 3 above. Both countries will do research,

        and the relative wage will re‡ect research productivity, i.e., wN =wS =                     N= S        d:

        Since the trade barrier exceeds the wage di¤erence, each country will produce its own

        goods. Since there is no goods trade, royalty payments must balance, which requires

        that r = rN = rS . For each country to …nd research worthwhile requires that:

                                                              gL
                                                         r=                                                   (12)


        as in the case of no di¤usion.


    Hence our Ricardian assumptions yield starkly Ricardian results. If research productivity

di¤erences exceed trade barriers, countries specialize in research according to comparative

advantage. But if di¤erences in research productivity fall short of trade barriers, countries do

their own research, while making use of each other’s ideas. Knowledge ‡ows rather than good

‡ows are how countries bene…t from each other’s innovation.

    What about the more realistic scenario in which ideas cross borders, but only with delay?

Special situations without trade and with costless trade deliver insight, although the results

are not as clean, demanding numerical simulation.

4.4.3     No Trade

Say that trade barriers are so high that there is no trade (d ! 1): This assumption was

implicit in the model used to estimate innovation and di¤usion among the top …ve research

economies in EK (1999).7

    Without trade in goods, royalty payments need to balance, so that Xn = Yn ; n = N; S:

We can also set:       nn   = Tn =(Tn + TC );     ni   = 0; n 6= i; and TnC = TC =(Tn + TC ); i; n = N; S:
    7
      The model in EK (1999) di¤ers in several respects. For one thing, ideas in that paper are about inputs, which
are not traded. But costless trade in …nal output allows for unbalanced royalty payments. For another, that
paper allows for diminishing returns to research activity at the national level. Diminishing returns are needed
to reconcile observations on the small share of workers doing research and their apparently large contribution
to productivity growth. Since our purpose here is a better understanding of the properties of the basic model
rather than a realistic application to data, we do not introduce this complication here. Finally, that model
allows for imperfect protection of innovations, both at home and abroad.



                                                         20

for i; n = N; S; i 6= n: The …rst term on the right-hand side represents the value of the

idea at home and the second its value abroad. Since goods aren’t traded, di¤usion into the

common pool has no implication for the value at home, while any return from abroad must

await di¤usion.

   In steady state, balanced trade in royalties implies that:

               TN      TC                                   TS      TC

             TN + TS TS + TC                              TN + TS TN + TC

Substituting expression (14) into (13) and solving for steady-state values of TN ; TS ; and TC

gives conditions for research intensity in each country:

                                        ( +2 )           gL gL +
                                 G=                               :
                                         ( + )          gL gL + 2

Note that G is the product of two fractions, the …rst exceeding one and the second less than

one. If G = 1 we are back to r = gL =    : The …rst fraction re‡ects the added opportunities for

earning royalties abroad that di¤usion allows, which increases the incentive to do research. The

second re‡ects the fact that, with di¤usion, foreign ideas compete with domestic ones at home,

reducing research incentives. Which e¤ect dominates depends on particular parameter values.

More di¤usion means more research if gL =          exceeds 1=(1 + ) and vice versa. Simulations

suggest that deviations from r = gL =    are small regardless.

   What about the role of country size, as measured by A? Researchers in a larger country

face less competition from foreign ideas, but have a smaller foreign market in which to earn

royalties. In fact, our simulations reveal that the direction of the e¤ect of country size on

research intensity depends on parameter values.

   We solve numerically for research intensity for the parameter values:

                                              gL         :01
                                                         :02
                                                          8 :
                                                         :02
                                          N    =    S     1

In the symmetric case research intensity in each country is :057 (compared with :063 with no

di¤usion). We …nd that increasing the relative size of the North by a factor of 10 leads research

activity there to increase to a labor share of :062 while the share in the South falls to :051:

Raising gL to :02; however, reverses the e¤ect of size on research activity (although deviations

from symmetry are slight).

4.4.4    Costless trade

Say that trade is frictionless, meaning that d = 1: Case 3, with each country producing its

own goods with the common technology, is, except by coincidence, eliminated as a possibility.

If parameter values leave us in Case 2 above, then the wage in the two economies is identical,

                                                   22
as are the value of ideas. If research productivity in the South is lower, only the North will

undertake research. If the return is the same the location of research is indeterminate. In either

case the world share of world labor engaged in research is the same as the closed economy

value of gL =       :8

    More interesting is a set of parameter values that leave us in Case 1 above, with the North-

ern wage above the South’s. In this case the North uses only its own exclusive technologies, but

earns royalties from technologies that have di¤used into the common technology and are used

in the South. The expression for the value of ideas, (9) above, simpli…es by recognizing that

spending on goods produced using Northern technologies is the same as spending on goods

produced by Northern workers. Hence:

                                                                       1+
                              N N XN t   +   SN XSt       = YN t =          wN LN t (1      rN ):

Only the South uses commonly available technologies, while it also uses its own exclusive

technologies. Total spending on goods produced by Southern workers is thus:

                                                                                 1+
                (    NC   +   N S )XN t   +(     SC   +    SS )XSt     = YSt =           wS LSt (1   rS ):

Southern production using common technologies is

                                                                          TCt
                                         N C XN t   +     SC XSt   =             YSt
                                                                       TSt + TCt

while Southern production using exclusively Southern technologies is

                                                                          TSt
                                         N S XN t   +     SS XSt   =             YSt :
                                                                       TSt + TCt

Finally, the overall technology available to the South relative to their labor force is

                                    TSt             TSt + TCt
                                             =
                                    LSt                LSt
                                                      S rS     ( S r S + N rN )
                                             =             +
                                                    gL +          gL (gL + )
                                                      N rN + (gL + ) S rS
                                             =                               :
                                                           gL (gL + )
  8
    This outcome requires that the share of the world labor force in the North exceed gL = : Otherwise the
North will specialize completely in research, and its wage can be higher. Again, we leave this case as an exercise.


                                                              23
Substituting these expressions into the value of ideas (9) gives:

                         1     wS (1 rS )gL (gL + )
            VS =
                         gL     N rN + (gL + ) S rS
                       gL +        wN (1 rN )                             wS (1 rS )gL
            VN   =                             +                                                :
                     ( + )      gL     rN           gL                 N rN + (gL + )    S rS


Solving for the steady-state levels of rN and rS gives:

                                                gL +
                         rN   =                                                                      (15)
                                       + f1 + [1 ( N =             S )(wS =wN )]g
                                  gL                                         gL
                         rS =                     (   N    =   S )rN   1          :
                                         gL +

To solve for the relative wage we need to refer back to our solution (4) for the static case

above, setting d = 1 and replacing LPi with Li (1           ri ): Solving out for rS we are left with:
                                                                   1=(1+ )
                              wN    rN                N       gL
                                 =                                           :                       (16)
                              wS   1 rN               S   gL +

Case 1 requires, of course, that wN =wS > 1: This solution also requires that rS exceed zero.

For many parameter values, the South will end up doing no research at all. We don’t explore

this situation further, focusing on outcomes in which both countries continue to do research.

   Note that rN and the wage ratio wN =wS can be solved in terms of each other, with rS

determined as a function of rN : Of course with no di¤usion we are back to rN = rS = gL =                :

With di¤usion ( > 0) Northern research rises above this level while Southern research declines.

More generally, greater di¤usion shifts research in the direction of greater research productivity.

Further analysis of equations (15) and (16) establishes that: (i) an increase in the relative

research productivity of the North (     N = S)   raises the relative wage (wN =wS ) there, but by

a smaller percentage amount (so that the relative cost of doing research in the North falls);

(ii) as a consequence, research shifts to the North; (iii) more di¤usion (a higher ) raises the

relative wage of the North. While the …rst two results are predictable, the third contrasts with

the outcome that would occur with exogenous research e¤ort, such as in Krugman (1979). In

that case more di¤usion, by reducing the stock of exclusively Northern technologies, lowers

the Northern wage. Two forces here work in the opposite direction. First, increased di¤usion

                                                  24
raises the demand for Northern workers as researchers. Second, the fact that the North is doing

more research mitigates the e¤ect of di¤usion on the ratio of exclusive Northern technologies

to those available in the South. In fact, as we discuss below, more di¤usion can have the

paradoxical e¤ect of lowering the fraction of technologies available to the South as greater

Northern research increases the pool of exclusively Northern technologies.

        Solving the model numerically, a plausible base case emerges with the values:
                                                    gL        :01
                                                              :02
                                                                8
                                                  N= S          5
                                                               :1
With no di¤usion ( = 0) a fraction .0625 of workers in each country pursue research, and the

relative wage is 1:20 times higher in the North. The ratio of Northern technologies to those

available in the South is :50. Raising di¤usion so that             = :005 raises the share of researchers

in the North to :254 and lowers it in the South to :023: The Northern wage advantage rises to

a factor of 1:37: Taking into account the higher productivity of researchers in the North, along

with the smaller number of workers there, the e¤ective level of research in the world rises by

60 percent. For the reason explained above, the ratio of exclusively Northern to technologies

available in the South rises to 1:30:9


5        Conclusion

What does our analysis suggest about the implications of globalization, either in the form of

greater di¤usion of ideas or of lower trade barriers, for research incentives? And what role does

country size play? In our base case with no di¤usion, countries engage in the same amount of

research regardless of their relative size and research productivity. Openness to trade doesn’t

alter research specialization. More research productive countries are richer, since the same

research e¤ort yields more new technology.
    9
     The direction of the e¤ect of greater di¤usion on this last ratio depends on parameter values. Giving the
North less of a research advantage ( N = S = 1:1) while making it larger ( = 1) means that more di¤usion
raises the share of technologies available in the South, but, as discussed above, lowers the relative wage in the
South.


                                                         25
   Jumping to a world with instantaneous di¤usion can have a major e¤ect on the allocation

of research activity, or none at all, depending on the importance of trade barriers relative

to di¤erences in research productivity. When di¤erences in research productivity are more

pronounced, instantaneous di¤usion leads to Ricardian specialization. But if trade barriers are

more signi…cant, countries continue to do the same amount of research as with no di¤usion.

Given the amount of di¤usion, a lowering of trade barriers can lead to more specialization in

research.

   Intermediate levels of di¤usion deliver less stark results. Under plausible parameter values

we …nd a tendency for greater di¤usion to shift research toward countries with greater research

productivity.

   While more trade and di¤usion may cause research activity to shift across countries, our

analysis provides little to suggest that greater openness of either form will increase research

e¤ort overall. Globalization, either in the form of lower trade barriers or more rapid di¤usion,

provides researchers larger markets, but also exposes them to more competition.

   Even in our relatively simple model, intermediate levels of di¤usion imply complex patterns

of specialization in research. Size can matter, but the direction of the e¤ect is ambiguous. It

is not surprising, then, that we see some of the largest and smallest nations among the most

active researchers. At the same time, there is reason to think that countries that do more

research do so because they are better at it.
