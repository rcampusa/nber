       This paper discusses a possible solution to the double problem that faces European governments
in dealing with the future of Social Security pensions. Like other governments around the world, they
must deal with the rising cost of pensions that will result from the increasing life expectancy of the
population. But the European governments have the extra problem that any solution must be compatible
with a European Union labor market in which individuals from any member country are free to work
anywhere within the European Union. The solution to this double problem that is developed in this paper
combines an investment-based system of individual accounts with a “notional defined contribution”
system financed by pay-as-you-go taxes.

         This paper discusses a possible solution to the problem that faces European governments

in dealing with the future of Social Security pensions. The governments of the European Union

face a double problem. Like other governments around the world, they must deal with the rising

cost of pensions that will result from the increasing life expectancy of the population. But the

European governments have the extra problem that any solution must be compatible with a

European Union labor market in which individuals from any member country are free to work

anywhere within the European Union. The solution to this double problem that is developed in

this paper combines an investment-based system of individual accounts with a “notional defined

contribution” system financed by pay-as-you-go taxes.

         Before discusing that option, I begin by providing a brief description of the current

pension situation in European countries and the prospects for the future if the current system is

left unchanged. I then discuss an obvious way of dealing with the double problem by shifting to a

pure investment based system of individual accounts. Although this has attractive features, it is

likely to involve a politically unacceptable degree of risk for future retirees. This leads to a

discussion of using a mixed system that combines investment-based and pay-as-you-go elements.

Although using a defined-benefit form of the pay-as-you-go system for this purpose would create

problems in the context of the integrated European labor market, a notional defined contribution

system of the type described below would avoid these problems and therefore would provide a

potential solution to the two problems facing European governments in dealing with their pension

systems.



Current and Future Social Security Pensions

        Although the current European Social Security pension systems differ from one another,

there are certain common features in most of the systems of the European Union countries.1

They are financed by taxes (usually payroll taxes) on a pay-as-you-go basis, i.e., with the taxes

paid in each year used to finance concurrent benefits. The benefits are generally based on the

number of years that the individual has worked and on the individual’s average lifetime level of

earnings.

        Because of the pay-as-you-go feature, the taxes needed to finance future benefits will rise

sharply as the number of retirees rises relative to the number of workers. This is not a temporary

or transition problem but a permanent problem caused by the aging of the population. With no

change in benefit rules or in the pay-as-you-go financing system, the tax rate required to finance

the benefits would have to rise by about 50 percent in most countries2 with even greater increases

in some countries. This high pension cost would be in addition to the cost of public sector health

services and to the other existing high income and value added tax rates.

        The Netherlands and Britain, with their funded systems, are largely immune to this
problem but not to the changes that will be needed. to operate in this labor market environment.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                           -2-
        Even if the European governments were not facing this cost-increasing demographic

change, the current defined-benefit pay-as-you-go systems would not be a satisfactory long-term

structure for the EU countries as the EU labor market becomes more integrated. To see why,

consider a Portugese citizen who works part of his life in Germany, part in France, and part in

Italy, and eventually retires in Spain. He (or his employers in the three countries where he works)

pays taxes to the three different governments as part of their pay-as-you-go pension systems.

When he retires in Spain, who will pay his benfits? And under which country’s defined benefit

rules will his benefits be calculated?

        One possibility is that, as a Portugese citizen, he will receive benefits from Portugal even

though he never worked there and never paid any taxes to Portugal. That would obviously place

an unfair and unacceptable burden on Portugal. The same would be true of the possibility that the

benefits would be paid by Spain, the country where he retires. A more plausible idea would be to

share the burden of retirement benefits among France, Germany, and Italy.

        But on what basis would the cost be divided? What rules would determine his benefits?

And what would make the separate contributions from the three governments add up to the

appropriate defined benefit total? It would certainly not be appropriate to simply treat the three

employment experiences separately and allow the individual to collect the sum of the three, an

amount that might bear little or no resemblence to what he would receive with the same lifetime

earnings record if he had stayed in a single country.



Investment Based Individual Accounts

        A simple solution would be to replace the existing pay-as-you-go defined-benefit plan


SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                           -3-
with a system of individual investment-based accounts to which individuals and/or their

employers are required to contribute. At retirement age, the accumulated balance in these

accounts could be used to finance an annuity.

        Such an investment based account would be completely portable, going with the

individual as he goes from country to country. The benefits could be paid wherever he retires.

Governments or the EU might be involved in specifying the minimum amount (or percent of

earnings) that must be contributed and in regulating the form of investment and the rules

governing the payouts after normal retirement age. But governments would not collect taxes or

pay benefits.

        The higher rate of return available in such an investment-based system of individual

accounts would dramatically reduce the long-run cost of providing retirement benefits.3 Under the

typical pay-as-you-go system, the individual earns a real rate of return on the contributions that he

and his employer make of about 2 percent per year.4 In contrast, an investment based system




         3
         There would of course be a transition cost in the form of a higher saving rate in order to
make possible the lower long-term costs. But calculations based on U.S. data suggest that such a
transition can be financed with a relatively small increase in total payments in the near term and
medium term, an increase that is substantially less than the permanent increase in the cost that
would be required if the current system were unchanged. See, e.g., Martin Feldstein and Andrew
Samwick, “The Economics of Prefunding Social Security and Medicare,” in NBER
Macroeconomics Annual, 1997 (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997) available also as NBER Working
Paper W6055 at www.nber.org/papers/w6055.
         4
         The return in a pay-as-you-go system results from the increasing tax base used to finance
benefits. Because the number of employees and the average real earnings of each empoyee rises
through time, a pay-as-you-go system can give retirees more in benefits than the taxes they paid
while they were working.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                           -4-
would provide an expected real return of about 6 percent.5 To see the impact of this difference in

rates of return on the cost of providing pension benefits, consider an individual who works from

age 25 to 65 and then retires from age 65 until his death at age 85. The individual contributes to

the pension during his working years and receives benefits each year during retirement.

        The calculations can be simplified and made transparent if we assume that all of the

pension saving is done at the midpoint of the working years (i.e., at age 45) and that all of the

retirement benefits are paid at the midpoint of the retirement years (age 75).6 With a 2 percent

pay-as-you-go saving rate, $1000 contributed at age 45 grows to $1811 at age 75. With a 6

percent rate of return, the same $1811can be achieved at age 75 by saving only $315 at age 45.

Thus the investment based system can produce the same retirement benefit with less than one-

third of the contribution of the pay-as-you-go system. This in turn implies that benefits that would

require a 30 percent payroll tax rate could be financed with an investment based saving rate of

9.45 percent. Such a reduction in the mandatory contribution rate during working years would

substantially raise the spendable income of the typical employee and would also substantiually

reduce the distortions to incentives caused by the low-return pay-as-you-go tax.




         5
        The six percent figures is based on U.S. data but is not likely to be very different for
investments in European securities. More specifically, a portfolio of 60 percent stocks (the
Standard and Poors Index) and 40 percent corporate bonds had a mean real annual return of 6.7
percent for the period from 1945 to 1995. If we subtract 0.4 percent for administrative costs, we
have a usable return of 6.3 percent. (These values reflect the historic experience of a mean
logarithmic rate of return of 5.9 percent with a standard deviation of 12.5 percent; these
logarithmic rates of return imply a mean level rate of return of 6.7 percent.)
         6
       Detailed calculations with annual saving and benefit payouts show that this is a quite
good approximation.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                           -5-
Market Risks in Investment-Based Systems

        These rate of return calculations are based on the average return that has been achieved

historically and that might be expected to prevail on average in the future. There is, however,

significant uncertainty about the future rates of return and substantial variability from year to year

in the return on a portfolio of stocks and bonds. To assess the extent of the risks that an

individual would face in such an investment-based system, Elena Ranguelova and I7 calculated the

probability distribution of the pension annuties that an individual would receive if he (or his

employer) saved 6 percent of his earnings in each year, invested those savings in a portfolio of 60

percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, and then used the accumulated proceeds at age 66 to

purchase a variable annuity invested in the same stock-bond mix.8 We compared the resulting

annuity payments to the benefits that would be payable under current U.S. benefit rules, which we

refer to as the “benchmark” level of benefits.9

        The simulation results for retirees at age 67, 77, and 87 are shown in Table 1. The median

investment-based annuity at age 67 would be equal to more than twice the benchmark benefit (i.e.,

2.12 times the benchmark) even though the six percent saving rate is only about one-third of the

Security System,” American Economic Review, September 2001, available also as NBER
Working Paper number 8074 (see www.nber.org/papers/w8074.)
         8
         The simulations reflect the uncertainty about the mean return in the future as well as the
year to year fluctuations around that mean.
         9
         The benefit rules specified in current law relate benefits to past earnings. Benefits
replace approximately 40 percent of immediate preretirement wages for a retiree with average
lifetime earnings and without dependents and about 60 percent of earnings for such a retiree with
a dependent spouse. The benefits are adjusted each year after retirement to maintain a constant
real value. Maintaining the current benefit rules would require raising the payroll tax rate from
the current 12.4 percent to about 19 percent as the ratio of retirees to workers increases.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                            -6-
long-run tax rate that would be required with a pure pay-as-you-go system. There is only one

chance in about 5 that the 67 year old retiree would receive less in the investment-based system

than in the pay-as-you-go system and an equal probability of receiving at least 4.3 times the

benchmark benefit.

        There is, however, a small chance that the retiree would receive substantially less in the

investment based system than the benchmark level of benefits. Table 1 shows that a 67 year old

has one chance in 50 of receiving only 47 percent of the benchmark benefit and one chance in 100

of receiving less than 40 percent of the benchmark benefit.

        The risk of a relatively low benefit increases as the individual ages, reflecting the

increasing variance as more years of uncertain returns are accumulated. At age 77, there is one

chance in 10 that the investment based retirement benefit would be less than 56 percent of the

benchmark benefit and one chance in 100 that it would be less than 21 percent of the benchmark.

At age 87, there is one chance in 10 that it would be less than 40 percent of the benchmark and

one chance in 100 that it would be less than 12 percent of the benchmark.

        Some individuals might be willing to accept the risk implied by these figures in order to

have the higher expected level of benefits than in the pay-as-you-go system as well as the

possibility of the substantially higher benefits associated with the cumulative probabilities of 70,

80 and 90 percent. This would be particularly true among those who have private pensions and

other sources of retirement income. Others who do not have additional sources of retirement

income might still favor the investment-based system but would invest in a more conservative

portfolio that provided less opportunity for both low and high annuity values. But for many

individuals, this pure investment based system might entail too much risk for it to be a politically


SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                            -7-
viable alternative to the pay-as-you-go system.



Guarantees to Reduce Risk

        Several Latin American governments, including Chile, Argentina, and Mexico, have

introduced pure investment based systems but have combined that with a government guarantee

that the each retiree will receive at least as much as he would have under the rules of the previous

pay-as-you-go system. This does of course put future taxpayers at risk of having to pay retirees to

fill the shortfall between their investment-based annuities and the guarantee level. However , the

figures in Table 1 imply that the probability that taxpayers will be called upon in this way is quite

low, e.g., less than a 20 percent probability that retirees aged 67 would need a supplementary

payout and about a 33 percent probability for those aged 87. Calculations indicate that there is

about a 60 percent probability that taxpayers will not have to make any payment in a year.10 The

sum of the expected guarantee payments and the 6 percent saving rate is almost always less than

the tax that would be required to support the same level of retirement benefits in a pure pay-as-

you-go system.

        It is not necessary to have government guarantees to reduce the risk of the pure

investment-based system. Private financial markets could in principle provide a guarantee for

those individuals who want one and are willing to pay for it by accepting a lower expected rate of

return. One possibility is to give up some of the potential for the very high annuity levels shown

in Table 1 in order to eliminate the risk of very low annuities. Financial markets could deliver this


         10
        See Martin Feldstein and Elena Ranguelova, “Individual Risk and Intergenerational
Risk Sharing in an Investment-Based Social Security System,” National Bureau of Economic
Research Working Paper 6839, 1998, available at www.nber.org/papers/w6839.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                            -8-
by selling a “collar,” i.e., a “put option” that reduces the risk of low annuities financed by

foregoing some or all of the annuity payments above some level. The individual in effect sells a

“call option” on his annuity in order to finance the purchase of a put option.

        An alternative way to reduce the risk of the pension system to both retirees and taxpayers

is to use a mixed system that combines an investment based component with some pay-as-you-go

benefit.11 This raises the expected cost of providing the benefits but reduces the risk of very low

benefits or of a very large tax financed guarantee payment. For example, cutting the full future

pay-as-you-go tax in half (i.e., from 19 percent to 9.5 percent in the US context) would finance

half of the benchmark benefit, guaranteeing that no matter how poorly financial markets perform

the retiree would have at least 50 percent of the benchmark benefit level. Combining this with a

three percent rate of saving and portfolio investment (instead of the six percent assumed in Table

1) would cut the probability that a 67 year old would receive less than 80 percent of the

benchmark from 10 percent to less than 5 percent.12 The probability of receiving less than 50

percent of the benchmark would be cut from about 2 percent to zero.

        Such a mixed system thus eliminates the risk of very low levels of retirement income but



         11
         For an example of such a mixed system, see Martin Feldstein and Andrew Samwick,
“Potential Effects of Two Percent Personal Retirement Accounts,” Tax Notes, vol.79, No. 5, May
4, 1998, available in an updated version in National Bureau of Economic Research Working
Paper 6540 (see www.nber.org/papers/w6540).
         12
         To see this, note that if the pay-as-you-go benefits are half of the benchmark, the
individual receives 80 percent of the benchmark if the investment-based component is equal to
30 percent of the benchmark. For a 77 year old, Table 1 shows that with a 6 percent saving rate
the investment-based component has only a 5 percent chance of being less than 62 percent of the
benchmark. With half of that saving rate, the investment-based component has a 5 percent
chance of being less than 31 percent of the benchmark. Combining the two implies that there
would be only a five percent chance of being less than 81 percent of the benchmark.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                            -9-
does so only by accepting a higher combined cost of the two components. Alternatively, one can

think of a mixed system as reducing the cost of a pure pay-as-you-go system by accepting some

investment risk.



A Notional Defined Contribution System

        But even if European governments were willing to accept the combination of cost and risk

involved in the mixed system, it would not be possible to use a defined benefit form of the pay-as-

you-go system because of the problems that I discussed earlier in this paper, i.e., setting the

benefit level and allocating the cost for individuals who work in more than one country. There is

however an attractive alternative for the pay-as-you-go component: a “notional” defined

contribution system of the type that has recently been introduced on a purely national basis in

Sweden and Italy.13 In a notional defined contribution system, each individual has a personal

account to which he (or his employer) pays a prescribed annual amount or share of earnings.

These funds are not invested in stocks and bonds but go to the government and are used to finance

concurrent pay-as-you-go benefits. But unlike the defined benefit system, each individual’s

account is directly credited with the amount that the individual (or his employer) pays into the

pay-as-you-go system. In addition, the account receives a rate of return on the accumulated

balance at a notional rate of “interest” equal to the rate of growth of the aggregate payroll tax base.

This notional rate of return is the rate that the government can afford to pay in a pure pay-as-you-

go system and makes the expected benefits equal on average to the benefits that would be paid in


         13
         For a description of these systems, see the papers on Sweden and Italy in Martin
Feldstein and Horst Siebert, Social Security Pension Reform in Europe. (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, forthcoming 2002), available at www.nber.org under Books-in-Progress.

SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                           -10-
a defined benefit pay-as-you-go system.

        The advantage of the notional defined contribution system is that it makes it easy to

operate a pay-as-you-go system in which the individual works in a variety of countries during his

lifetime and may retire in yet a different one. With a notional defined contribution system, there

is no difficulty in defining the available benefits. At retirement age, the individual has an

accumulated amount in his personal account that he can take in cash, convert to a private

investment-based annuity, or shift to a pay-as-you-go annuity with a rate of return equal to the rate

of growth of the tax base in the country to which he transfers those funds.

        The amount of the accumulated funds at retirement age (or indeed at any age before that)

in the individual’s account is the sum of what he and his employer paid in taxes during his

working years augmented by the notional rate of return. If the individual starts by working in

Germany, he or his German employer pays a payroll tax to the German government which credits

the account with a rate of return equal to the estimated long-term rate of growth of the payroll tax

base in Germany (i.e., the sum of the growth rates of average wages and the number of people in

the labor force). If at the end of (say) 15 years the individual moves his employment to France, the

German government transfers the individual’s accumulated funds to the French government.

Additional tax payments and notional interest then accumulate in the individual’s account, using

the French tax rate and the French notional rate of return.

        When the individual retires, all of the funds in his account is owed to him by the

government where he was working when he retired. There is no unfair burden on any country

since each country transfers to a successor government or to the individual only the amount that

that individual has paid into the local system (including the amount carried over from a previous


SSPensEur.09052001.wpd                           -11-
government ) plus a rate of return that can be attributed on the basis of the growing tax revenue

without having to raise the tax rate.

         There would of course be both administrative and economic problems in shifting from the

existing national pay-as-you-go systems to a mixed system that combines individual investment

based defined contribution accounts with individual pay-as-you-go notional defined contribution

accounts. But the examples of Sweden and Italy show how the shift from traditional defined

benefits to notional defined contributions can be introduced and several countries have shown

how to shift from a pure pay-as-you-go system to one that combines that system with individual

investment based accounts. 14 Unless the countries of the European Union move in this direction,

they will face substantially higher payroll tax rates and a Social Security pension system that is not

compatible with the notion of the free mobility of labor among the countries of the European

Union.
