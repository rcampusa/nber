                                        ABSTRACT

We exploit data from middle schools in Seoul, South Korea, where students and teachers are
randomly assigned to classrooms, and find that female students taught by a female versus a male
teacher score higher on standardized tests compared to male students even five years later. We
also find that having a female math teacher in 7th grade increases the likelihood that female
students take higher-level math courses, aspire to a STEM degree, and attend a STEM-focused
high school. These effects are driven by changes in students' attitudes and choices.

          We exploit data from middle schools in Seoul, South Korea, where
      students and teachers are randomly assigned to classrooms, and find that
      female students taught by a female versus a male teacher score higher on
      standardized tests compared to male students even five years later. We
      also find that having a female math teacher in 7th grade increases the

      are driven by changes in students’ attitudes and choices.


1     Introduction
While women have made great strides in fields previously dominated by men,
some gender gaps – especially in STEM fields – remain. Lack of female rep-
resentation can have compounding effects, in which a dearth of role models
or general attitudes and expectations discourage female students from entering
these fields, making it difficult to increase participation (Leslie et al., 2015; Elbe
and Hu, 2017).
    One possible source of these discrepancies may be the interaction of student
and teacher gender, in which female students are treated differently by or re-
act differently to female and male teachers. For example, Spencer, Steele and
Quinn (1999) show that negative stereotypes of girls’ math ability undermine
girls’ performance on math exams. Most research has focused on contempora-
neous effects, namely, how students’ current-year outcomes are affected by their
current teacher(s).
    The results are mixed: many studies find positive and sizable impacts of
female teachers on female students (see, for example, Muralidharan and Sheth

(2016), Dee (2007), and Lim and Meer (forthcoming)), though others do not
(Antecol, Eren and Ozbeklik (2015), Holmlund and Sund (2008), and Cho
(2012)). Yet the impact on current outcomes is of limited relevance if the
effects fade over time. Evidence on longer-run impacts is limited, though in-
dicative that effects can be substantial; Lavy and Sand (2015) find that primary
school teachers’ bias towards boys can have impacts through high school.1 At
the higher education level, Carrell, Page and West (2010) find that female cadets
at the United States Air Force Academy who are randomly assigned to female
instructors for introductory science and math courses are more likely to persist
in those fields.2
     The main issue plaguing identification of the impact of student-teacher gen-
der matches is that, in most contexts, students are not randomly assigned to
teachers. This leads to potential confounds in which, for example, female teach-
ers may be systematically assigned to lower-achieving students, or female stu-
dents who are more likely to succeed with female teachers are assigned to those
classrooms. In these cases, any teacher-student gender match effects may reflect
sorting rather than, for example, role-model effects. While several of the stud-
ies listed above used environments featuring random assignment, there remains
little evidence on whether the teacher-student gender match has a long-run im-
pact when taking place at more formative ages – after all, it may be too late
to substantially affect field of study by the time a student arrives in college.
Further, there is little evidence on the mechanisms through which these effects
are operating.
     In this paper, we study the longer term effects of teacher-student gender
matches at the secondary level. We avoid the problem of nonrandom sorting
using a unique Korean middle school practice: the random assignment of stu-
dents into a classroom each year. Our data track students from 7th to 12th
grades and enable us to investigate how these effects change over time, as well
as how they affect important outcomes like preparation for postsecondary study
and choice of major.
     We find that the presence of a female teacher substantially increases female
students’ test scores compared to male students, and this effect persists at least
through 12th grade. Our long-lasting gender gap effects are somewhat sur-
prising, since the effects of educational interventions generally fade out fairly
quickly (Jacob, Lefgren and Sims, 2010). We show that the mechanism behind
these persistent effects appear to be greater focus and participation by female
students, as well as selection into higher-quality high schools.
   1A  related strand of literature shows positive impacts of same-race teachers, particularly
for African-American boys (Gershenson et al., 2017; Gershenson, Holt and Papageorge, 2016).
   2 Recent work by Kofoed and McGovney (2017) shows that same-gender and -race role

models can influence occupation choice at the United States Military Academy.

2     Data
2.1     Institutional Background
Several features of the South Korean educational system make it ideally suited
to study the impact of teacher-student gender matches. First, elementary school
graduates are assigned to a local middle school (spanning 7th to 9th grades) by
lottery.3 Second, middle school students are randomly assigned to a physical
homeroom classroom, through which subject teachers rotate to give lessons.
Due to strong social norms and government polices, the goal is to produce
homogeneous homeroom classrooms in terms of academic ability (Kang, 2007).
The most common approach is to order students by the previous year’s academic
performance, with the leading student to the first classroom, the second-ranked
student to the second classroom, and so on, and schools report adhering to these
expectations (Lim and Meer, forthcoming).
    Subject teachers are assigned to classrooms in a manner unrelated to the
characteristics of either the teachers or the classroom’s students. In general, the
physical classrooms are split between the subject teachers by, for example, di-
viding odd- and even-numbered rooms; teacher characteristics are not correlated
with student characteristics (Lim and Meer, forthcoming). This quasi-random
classroom and teacher assignments produce the random variation in teacher
student matching within a school.
    Over the past decade, there has been increasing use of ability tracking in
South Korea (Byun and Kim, 2010). In our data, ability grouping is common
for math and English, but infrequent for Korean. In the presence of ability
grouping, the students move to the classroom with their ability group for that
subject before returning to their original homeroom classroom. Figure 1 gives
an example, with high ability students in Classroom 2 moving to Classroom 1
and low ability students in Classroom 1 moving to Classroom 2 for this subject.
This might threaten our identification strategy, which rests on the random as-
signment of students to teachers. Including school-by-subject fixed effects might
be insufficient to account for this potential source of bias. We therefore estimate
specifications with school-by-subject-by-ability-group fixed effects, enabling us
to compare similar sets of students. In practice, our results are unaffected by
the inclusion of finer fixed effects, suggesting that ability grouping does not lead
to sorting correlated with teacher-student gender matches and does not bias
our results. Our identification thus remains driven by the random assignment
of students and teachers to classrooms.
    While compulsory education ends in ninth grade, nearly all students in South
Korea go on to high school. There are two rounds of admissions to high school in
Seoul. Admission is determined through an application process in the first round
(Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, 2012). Students can apply to one of 35
magnet and private autonomous high schools, six art high schools, one athletic
   3 While students in some districts can submit a list of schools among which they will be

randomly assigned, students in Seoul are not permitted to do so (Korea Legislation Research
Institute, 2011).

high school, and 74 vocational high schools. Schools select students based on
their academic performance and recommendations from principals and teachers.
If selected, students must attend the school to which they were admitted.
    The second round consists of a lottery for 19 autonomous public high schools,
19 science-focused high schools, 4 art-focused high schools, and 183 general
academic high schools. Students can list preferences for one autonomous school,
one science- or art-focused school, and up to four general schools. Students
receive some preference for schools within their administrative district. The
lottery clears entry into the autonomous public and specialized schools first,
and then into the general academic high schools. Students are guaranteed entry
into a school. Conditional on entering 10th grade, 95.2% of students in 2011
graduate; only 0.32% repeat a grade.
    One year after high school entry, students choose among academic tracks,
irrespective of the type of school. Most schools provide a math-science track
and humanities-social science track, excepting specialized science and foreign-
language schools. Students focus on advanced courses within a given track.
Students are free to choose their academic track; past test scores, student char-
acteristics, and so on are not taken into account by the school in restricing
a student’s choice. Changing tracks is rare; students apply to postsecondary
institutions the following year, in twelth grade, and it is difficult to catch up
on the requisite coursework. Notably, applying to a STEM department at a
postsecondary institution requires scores in advanced math and science courses.
Therefore, if teacher-student gender matches in middle school – a particularly
formative time period (Berenbaum, Martin and Ruble, 2008) – have persistent
effects into high school, they are likely to have lifelong impacts on academic and
career choices.

2.2      Data Set
Our data set is the Seoul Education Longitudinal Study of 2010 (SELS2010),
which surveyed 7th grade students and their teachers in 2010; data are available
through 12th grade, with a follow-up survey shortly after high school graduation
on postsecondary outcomes. Subject teachers in math, English language, and


                                                   4
Korean language are linked to the students in 7th through 10th grades and 12th
grade.4
    Students in the seventh grade panel were sampled by stratified two-stage
cluster sample design; first, 74 middle schools were randomly chosen from the
population of 370 public or private middle schools in Seoul, excluding two middle
schools that are operated by the central government and one athletic middle
school. Sixty-two of the sampled schools are coeducational, seven are all-boys,
and five are all-girls schools. Two classrooms were then drawn randomly within
the sample school. 4,544 of the 5,065 targeted students responded to the survey
in 2010. Attrition reduced the sample to 4,347, 4,162, 3,541, 3,394, and 3,305
from 2011 through 2015, respectively; we show later that this attrition does
not drive our results. Students in the sample advanced to high school in 2013,
with 3,017 going to academic and 524 to vocational high schools. 2,809 and
496 students in academic and vocational high schools remained in the sample
through 2015. In May 2016, two months after high school graduation, students
were surveyed about their postsecondary outcomes at that point; 2,195 students
responded.
    Our primary unit of observation is a student-teacher pairing, with multiple
observations per student, allowing us to use within-student variation in teacher
gender in a given year. Of 13,632 possible student-teacher matches in seventh
grade, 3,364 observations cannot be linked due to teacher non-response. An
additional 72 observations have missing values in test scores, student gender, and
teacher gender. We compare remaining 10,196 observations, representing 4,163
students and 497 teachers, with those that are dropped and find no significant
differences between them in students’ predetermined characteristics. 1,892 (45.4
percent) students and 408 (82.1 percent) teachers are female. 11 percent of these
teacher-student pairs are male-male, 8 percent are male-female, 44 percent are
female-male, and 37 percent are female-female.
    Student data include standardized test scores for each subject (taking place
after the first semester of the school year); we normalize these to have mean of
zero and standard deviation of one for ease of interpretation. We also have data
on student background characteristics, course-taking in high schools, and track
choice, as well as on teacher characteristics including experience and education.


3     Empirical Approach
3.1     Tests of the Identifying Assumptions
While the institutional characteristics of our setting provide the random varia-
tion in teacher-student gender matches necessary for unbiased estimation, it is
instructive to examine empirical evidence to validate the identification strategy.
    First, we test differences in the characteristics of student-teacher pairings
when the teacher is female or male. Panel A of Table 1 presents these results
   4 Errors in data collection in eleventh grade mean that those links are not available in that

year.



                                               5
and show no meaningful differences. Panel B compares teacher characteristics
by student gender; the only statistically significant difference between the sets
of observations is that male students are slightly more likely to have an ad-
ministrative teacher. As another way to examine whether there are systematic
differences in how teachers are assigned to students, we regress teacher gender on
students’ observable characteristics, controlling for school-by-subject-by-ability-
group fixed effects. The results are shown in Table 2. Teacher gender is not
correlated with students’ predetermined characteristics, consistent with random
assignment of students to teachers.

graders in order to use test scores from previous years as a proxy for ability,
thus demonstrating that students are not systematically assigned to classrooms

    We use resampling techniques to examine whether actual classroom assign-
ments appear unusual relative to artificially-constructed classrooms (for more
details, see Lehmann and Romano (2005), Good (2006), and Carrell and West
(2010)). We randomly draw, without replacement, 10,000 synthetic classrooms
from the sample of all students within the school. For each of these synthetic
classrooms, we compute total test score of its students. We calculate an em-
pirical p-value measuring the proportion of artificial classrooms with a value
greater than the actual classroom in the data. We conduct this exercise using
test scores from all three subjects. Under random assignment, the empirical
p-values will be uniformly distributed, since any p-value will be observed with
equal probability. We test whether the distribution of the empirical p-values is
uniform with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and χ2 goodness of fit tests. The results, in
Table 3A, show that none of 222 school-by-subject p-value distributions devi-
ate significantly from the uniform distribution at the 5 percent level using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; 8 (3.6 percent) do so using the χ2 goodness of fit test.
We do not find evidence of nonrandom assignment of students into classrooms
by academic ability.
    We also check the random assignment of teachers into classrooms with re-
spect to student’s academic ability; for each of three test scores, we regress
    5 Data on the assignment to physical homeroom classrooms was not available for 7th and

8th grades, but subject teacher-student linkages are present. Given the nature of random
assignment in South Korea, physical classroom assignments are not necessary for our identi-
fication strategy.

the empirical p-values on average characteristics of teachers visiting the class-
room, controlling for school fixed effects to accommodate the random assignment
within a school. As is shown in Table 3B, none of 24 coefficients is statistically
significant at the 10 percent level. Therefore, there is little evidence of non-
random assignment of teachers into classrooms in terms of student’s academic
ability.

3.2     Specification
Our estimation strategy is straightforward. First, we examine contemporaneous
effects of teacher-student gender matches by estimating a series of specifications
with the following general form:


   yijbgs = β0 + β1 f si + β2 f tj + β3 f si f tj + Xi δ10 + Tj δ20 + γbgs + εijbgs ,                   (1)

    where yijbgs is a test score of student i taught by teacher j for subject b in
ability group level g, if any, in 7th grade at school s. f si and f tj are indicator


                                                    8
variables equaling one if student i and subject teacher j are female, respectively.
Our simplest specification includes only these variables. We add, in turn, an
increasingly rich set of controls. These include Xi , a vector of students’ prede-
termined characteristics including income, the number of siblings, andindicators
for living with both parents, having at least one parent with bachelor’s degree
or higher, having both parents being employed, and Tj , a vector of teacher char-
acteristics, including teacher’s age and indicators for teacher graduating from
teacher’s school, teacher with master’s degree, homeroom teacher, the teacher
holding an administrative position, and the teaching having less than 5 years of
experience. We include school by subject by ability group level fixed effects γbgs
to compare students of the same ability in a subject within a school, to ensure
that ordinary least squares (OLS) produces unbiased estimates. Standard er-
rors are clustered at the school level to account for correlations among students
within the same schools. If the random assignment suggested by the institu-
tional features truly holds, these specifications should not differ substantially
when the additional controls are included.
    β1 is the difference in average academic achievement between female and
male students when taught by a male teacher. β2 represents the average differ-
ence in performance for male students between being taught by a female teacher
and being taught by a male teacher. β3 indicates the change in the gender gap
between female and male students when switching from a male to a female
teacher.
    We modify Equation 1 slightly to examine the effects of teacher-student
gender matches in 7th grade on standardized test scores over time:

            yijbgts = β0 + β1 f si + β2 f tj + β3 f si f tj + γbgs + εijbgts ,   (2)

    where yijbgts is test score in year t = 2 through 6 (namely, 8th through
12th grades), which is normalized within a subject and the year. We focus on
the effects of 7th grade teachers over time because we are most confident that
random assignment holds for that grade. Students are entering a randomly-
assigned middle school and their academic performance cannot yet have been
affected by teachers at the middle school when assigned to 7th-grade classrooms.
This also provides the longest time span to examine the persistence of these
effects.
    Our primary interest is the coefficient β3 when t = 2 through 6, representing
gender gap effects one through five years after exposure to the 7th grade teacher.
When we examine outcomes that do not differ across subject, such as choice of
academic track, we collapse this specification to a single observation per student.


4     Results
4.1    Contemporaneous Effects
We begin by examining the effect of teacher-student gender matches in 7th grade
on students’ standardized test scores in that year. Table 4 begins with the most


                                            9
parsimonious specification that includes no additional controls. The coefficient
on the female student × female teacher indicator in Column (1) indicates that
the performance gap between female and male students increases by 13.9% of a
standard deviation (s.e. = 6.1%) when the teacher is female rather than male.
This effect consists of a statistically insignificant decrease in boys’ performance
of 0.06 standard deviations and an increase in girls’ performance of 0.07. In
other words, the gender gap effect is composed of an opposite-gender teacher
effect for switching from a male teacher to a female one for male students (−β2 )
and a same-gender teacher effect for the switch to a female teacher for female
students (β2 + β3 ). This effect is substantial, considering the evidence that 10
additional days of schooling increases academic performance by 0.01 standard
deviation (Carlsson et al., 2015). Adding controls across specifications does not
meaningfully affect the estimate of this gender gap effect, providing additional
evidence that random assignment holds in our data. Note, though, that the
share of the gender gap effect attributable to changes in boys’ performance does
change. Boys no longer see a negative impact of switching to a female teacher
by Column (3), but the estimates of β2 are noisy throughout.
    Even the inclusion of student and teacher fixed effects in Columns (6) and
(7), thus identifying from within-student and within-teacher variation in the
gender match, leaves the gender gap effect intact. Taken together, these results
indicate that the teacher-student gender match is uncorrelated with observable
and unobservable student and teacher characteristics. These findings replicate
those using other South Korean data to examine same-year effects (Lim and
Meer, forthcoming).6

4.2     Longer Term Effects
Table 5 presents the impacts of the 7th grade teacher-student gender match
for later years. Panel A presents results including school-by-subject-by-ability-
group fixed effects and Panel B also includes student and teacher fixed effects
(corresponding to Columns (3) and (7), respectively, of Table 4). For brevity,
we limit ourselves to the most parsiminious specification that we believe clearly
satisfies the identifying assumptions (Panel A), but also present the most re-
strictive (Panel B).
    Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the gender gap effects persist even five
years after the initial teacher-student gender match. The effects vary slightly
over time, but there are no significant differences between the contemporaneous
effect and the effects in the following years.7 While education interventions
are generally characterized by large fade-out effects (Jacob, Lefgren and Sims,
2010), previous studies on longer-run impacts of teacher gender suggest that the
   6 That paper uses data on ninth graders throughout South Korea in 2004 and finds a

contemporaneous interaction effect of female students with female teachers of about 0.10.
   7 In Panel A, the p-values are p = 0.98, p = 0.91, p = 0.75, p = 0.59, and p = 0.68 for

the differences between the interaction coefficients in Columns (1)-(5) and that in Column
(3) of Table 4, respectively. In Panel B, p-values are p = 0.82, p = 0.79, p = 0.55, p = 0.99,
and p = 0.48 for the differences between the interaction coefficients in Columns (1)-(5) and
Column (7) of Table 4

impacts of this particular phenomenon may be long-lasting (Carrell, Page and
West, 2010; Lavy and Sand, 2015).
    STEM outcomes are of particular interest, since although the gender gap
in math achievement in secondary education is small, women are substantially
underrepresented in both STEM majors and careers. Column (1) of Table 6
presents the results for the effects of 7th grade subject teachers on student’s
math-science track choice in 11th grade. These specifications include fixed ef-
fects for school by subject and 7th grade ability group, which should adequately
control for any possible nonrandom assignment to ability group in 7th grade.
There are no significant gender gap effects for any subjects; however, there is
a statistically significant same-gender teacher effect for female students. Girls
who had a 7th grade math teacher are 15.1 percentage points (s.e. = 7.5) more
likely to choose the math-science track in high school when taught by female
versus male math teacher (the combination of having a female math teacher
and the additional effect of female math teachers on girls). Substantial gender
gap effects emerge in advanced math coursetaking in 11th grade (Column 2),
with having a female 7th grade math teacher reducing the gender gap between
female and male students by 9.7 percentage points (s.e. = 5.5). The same gen-
der teacher effect for female student is even bigger; female students are 15.7
percentage points (s.e. = 6.6) more likely to take at least one advanced math

course when they were taught by female math teacher in 7th grade versus a male
teacher. Column (3) shows the impacts on self-reported interest in majoring in
a STEM field; once again, having a female 7th grade math teacher substan-
tially reduces the male-female gap in these aspirations. Similarly, Column (4)
shows that the male-female gap in attending a STEM-focused high school is
substantially reduced when a female student has a female math teacher in 7th
grade. Especially given the baseline means, listed in the bottom of line of the
table, these effects are quite meaningful. Finally, Column (5) reports the im-
pact on the likelihood that a student reports that they have no set plans for
postsecondary education; female students are significantly less likely to report
that they have no such plans if they had female teachers in any subject in 7th
grade. This provides further evidence of an overall positive influence of female
teachers on female students, which we turn to in the next section.

4.3        Evidence on Mechanisms
Altogether, these results show dramatic impacts of having female teachers on
female students in the long run, with substantial increases in preparation for

 of the math-science track in 11th grade, taking at least one advanced math course required for admission
 to a STEM postsecondary degree program, self-reporting the desire to seek a STEM postsecondary degree

    We begin by examining whether female students taught by a female teacher
are more likely to be taught by a female teacher in later years. In that case, the
persistent effects of 7th grade teachers could, in fact, be driven by cumulative
effects of later teachers. As seen in Table 7, our results are not driven by
cumulative exposure to female teachers set in motion by better performance in
7th grade.
    We next examine whether teacher-student gender matches in 7th grade af-
fects ability group assignment in later years. Table 8 shows results for the
likelihood of being in a high ability group in 8th through 10th and 12th grades
in a given subject. While this potential mechanism has a reasonable basis –
better performance in 7th grade leads to higher ability grouping in later years,
with better performance in those years – we find no evidence that this is driving
our results.
    Finally, we examine whether attrition from the sample is likely to bias our
results. If attrition is systematically related to the teacher-student gender inter-
action – if low-performing female students with female teachers are more likely

to exit the sample – our results would be the product of a selected sample. In
Table 9, we test whether the proportion of female teachers in 7th grade impacts
the likelihood of attriting from the sample. No meaningful patterns emerge that
indicate that selective attrition drives our results. Further, recreating our pri-
mary results in Tables 1 and 2 using only students who remained in the sample
all five years yields similar results.
    Having addressed these possibilities, we turn to student attitudes and choices.

Indeed, our results appear to be driven by changes in student attitudes, which
result in female students who had female teachers in 7th grade being more likely
to select higher-quality high schools. Column (5) of Table 6 shows that hav-
ing female teachers in 7th grade increases the likelihood that female students
declare that they have postsecondary plans. In Table 10, we show the impact
of the female student-female teacher match on an index of self-reported stu-
dent engagement constructed using principal component analysis. While female
students have a lower engagement score than male students, having a female
teacher in a particular subject in 7th grade eliminates this gap, and the effects
persist into high school. The point estimates lose statistical significance by 11th
grade, but remain relatively large.
    Given the nature of the high school application process in Seoul, any increase
in high school quality necessarily reflects student preferences to a great degree.
In Table 12, we show the impact of the 7th grade teacher-student gender match
on the quality of the student’s classroom peers, as estimated by previous-year
standardized test scores, and on teacher value-added.8 Given the random as-
signment in middle schools, it is reassuring that there are no effects in 8th and
9th grades. However, in 10th grade – high school – female students who had a
female teacher in 7th grade have both peers and teachers who are significantly
higher quality as measured by test scores, and this effect is also present in 12th
grade.9
   8 We calculate value added by estimating teacher fixed effects from a regression of leave-out

mean scores in grade g on leave-out mean scores in grade g − 1 and school-by-subject-by-
ability-group fixed effects.
   9 Due to the data limitations discussed in Section 2.2, we are unable to estimate these

results for 11th grade.

 Notes: Each column represents a separate regression, controlling for school by subject by ability group in 7th
 grade fixed effects. Dependent variables are student behavior indices for 7th through 12th grades, constructed in a
 following way: first, we extract common variation, using principal component analysis, for each subject and each
 year, from the students response to 4 questions: whether he or she is focused in class, whether they participate in
 class, whether they do not skip homework assignment, and whether they review what they learned in class. The
 first component for each subject is regressed on student fixed effects; the residual is the student engagement index.
 Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at school level.

    To complement the results on peer and teacher quality, we examine other
measures of high school quality in Table 11. Column 1 shows the likelihood that
the student attends a prestigious first-round high school, namely, an application-
only high school, excluding non-elite vocational schools. The impact on the gen-
der gap of having more female teachers is statistically insignificant. In Column
2, there is a substantial but statistically insignificant effect on the likelihood of
attending a high school in a different administrative district, which would re-
flect a willingness to incur greater costs to attend a preferred school. This effect
is not entirely driven by students who attend first-round schools. Examining
only those who attend second-round (lottery) high schools, the female student
interaction with percent of 7th grade female teachers is 0.138 (s.e. = 0.101);
once again, statistically insignificant but fairly sizable. This suggests even those
female students with more female teachers who do not attend an application
school are requesting higher-quality schools in the second-round lottery.
    Column 3 shows the impacts on the percent of 11th grade students in a
high school who achieved “Above Basic” performance in a particular subject
on the National Assessment of Educational Achievement (NAEA) test; this
indicates achievement above the median grade-level expectation. Importantly,
these scores are for students one cohort above those in our sample. Column
4 shows results for students performing at the “Below Basic” level, below 20
percent of grade-level expectations. Finally, Column 5 shows the effects on
the percent of students who are reported to the School Violence Committee,
to which infractions against students both on and off school premises must be

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. Columns 3 and 4 are pooled data for all three subjects and
control for school by subject by ability group fixed effects. In Columns 1, 2, and 5, we collapse the outcomes and
control for for school by math ability group by English ability group by Korean ability group in 7th grade fixed
effects. The dependent variables in Columns 1 and 2 are indicators for attending a prestigious first round high school
(i.e. one of the first round high schools excluding non-elite vocational high schools) and a high school located in the
different administrative district from the student’s residential district. The dependent variable in Column 3 is the
percent of 11th grade students with Above Basic Performance in National Assessment of Educational Achievement
(NAEA) test; in Column 4, the percent of 11th grade students with Below Basic Performance in NAEA test. The
NAEA exam scores are for the cohort one year ahead of the students in our sample. The dependent variable in
Column 5 is the percent of students who are reported to School Violence Committee while our students in sample
are in 10th grade. Students are reported for actions committed against other students inside or outside of school
premises resulting in a physical or mental injury, or damage to property through a battery, assault, confinement,
threat, kidnapping, abduction, defamation, insult, extortion, coercion, forced errand, sexual violence, bullying, or
cyber-bullying, or spreading obscene or violent information via a communications network. Standard errors in
parentheses are clustered at school level.

 Notes: Each column represents a separate regression, controlling for school by subject by ability group fixed effects. The
 dependent variables in Columns 1 to 4 are peer quality measures and those in Columns 5 through 8 are teacher quality
 measures. Peer quality is defined as the mean standardized test score in previous year, excluding a student’s own score, for
 each subject teacher. Teacher quality is the teacher fixed effect in 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th grades, obtained as follows: for
 each teacher j in gth grade (where g = 8, 9 and 10), take all the students whom teacher j teaches. Then, for each gth grade
 student i under teacher j, calculate the leave-out means (excluding student i) for (g − 1)th and gth grade test scores. Next,
 regress the leave-out mean for gth grade on that for (g − 1)th grade and gth grade teacher fixed effects, controlling for 7th
 grade school × subject × 7th grade ability group fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at school level.

reported; these include violent acts but also bullying and cyber-bullying. Female
students with a greater proportion of female teachers in 7th grade attend safer
schools, though we note, at least based on official reports, schools in South
Korea are extremely safe.
    Taken together, these results indicate that the student-teacher gender inter-
action in middle school leads to greater engagement for female students with
female teachers. Since the impact on attending application-only schools is fairly
small, the primary channel for these results must be the choice set submitted
by students for the second-round lottery. That is, exposure to female teachers
in 7th grade leads female students to express a preference for higher-quality
schools, even at a cost of greater travel time.
    Finally, we turn to postsecondary outcomes. Our sample size is smaller due
to the nature of this wave of the survey, which was conducted two months after
these students left high school. Columns 1 through 3 show the results of the
7th grade teacher interaction variables on the probability of attending a uni-
versity, a community college, or being employed, respectively. No meaningful
patterns emerge; the coefficients are, for the most part, statistically insignifi-
cant. In Column 4, we examine the likelihood that students applied to a science,
technology, engineering, or medical-sciences major conditional on attending a
college or university; Column 5 narrows that definition by removing the tradi-
tional science fields. In both cases, female students with female math teachers
in 7th grade were more likely to apply to those fields, though the effect is only
statistically significant in Column 5, and is not distinguishable from a similarly
positive interaction effect for having a female English teacher. For female stu-
dents, the interaction effect with a female Korean teacher is large, negative,



                                                            18
and statistically significant; having a female Korean teacher in 7th grade signifi-
cantly reduces the likelihood that a female student will apply to a STEM major.
Columns 6 and 7 condition on applying to a STEM or TEM field and examine
the likelihood of being accepted; there are no significant impacts. The increase
in applications coupled with little difference in acceptance rates suggests some
uptick in female participation in these majors when they had a female 7th grade
math teacher, though sample sizes are small and the estimates are fairly noisy.
    Finally, Columns 7 and 8 use data from the 2014 Graduate Occupational
Mobility Survey, which surveys recent college graduates 18 months after grad-
uation. We match wage and employment information to major and examine
whether majors chosen by students in our sample are more likely to lead to
positive labor market outcomes. That is, these are not the actual outcomes for
those in our data, who are just beginning their postsecondary education, but
rather the projected outcomes. There are no impacts on the average wage, but
female students with female math teachers in 7th grade choose majors that have
a statistically significant 3.8 percentage point higher employment rate shortly
after graduation.
    Taken together, our results suggest that there are substantial impacts on
the secondary-school performance for female students with female teachers, par-
ticularly in STEM subjects. These are driven by changes in attitudes, aspira-
tions, and choices, particularly in terms of course-taking and high school quality.
Given the nature of the South Korean education system, the large improvements
in academic performance, increase in positive attitudes towards STEM fields,
and increases in propensity to take STEM courses are necessary to see a greater
likelihood of majoring in STEM fields in college by female students. However,
our results are much more mixed for realized postsecondary outcomes, suggest-
ing that these improvements are not sufficient to yield meaningful changes in
actual outcomes.


5    Conclusions
Our study shows that female students’ pairing with female teachers at a for-
mative age – middle school – increases standardized test scores well into high
school, the likelihood of advanced course-taking and making plans for postsec-
ondary attendance, and, specifically for those with female math teachers, both
studying STEM and aspirations to do so in college. We show that persistent
student engagement and increased ambition in choosing high schools of higher
quality explain why there is little fade-out of these impacts. It is important to
note that there are, at times, partially offsetting negative effects on academic
outcomes for boys from a shift to female teachers. Overall, these findings shed
light on the importance of teacher-student gender matches in future policies
to close the gender gap, especially in STEM fields. However, results on post-
secondary outcomes suggest that interventions in secondary school may not be
sufficient to substantially increase participation at that level.

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. We control for school by math group by English language group by Korean language
group in 7th grade by college type FEs for Columns 4 through 7 and school by math group by English language group by Korean language
group in 7th grade FEs for the rest of the columns. Dependent variables in Columns 1 through 7 are, respectively, indicator variables for
(1) being accepted by a university, (2) being accepted by a community college, (3) being employed, (4) applying for a STEM major, (5)
applying for a TEM major, (6) being accepted in a STEM major, and (7) being accepted in a TEM major. Dependent variables in Column
8 and 9 are the log of average wage and the employment rate for the student’s major. In Columns 4 and 5, we exclude the students who
report that their major was not their top choice. In Columns 6 and 7, the regression is conditional on applying for a STEM and a TEM
major, respectively. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at school level.
