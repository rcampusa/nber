State vs Consumer Regulation: An Evaluation of Two Road Safety Interventions in Kenya
James Habyarimana and William Jack
NBER Working Paper No. 18378
September 2012
JEL No. D13,I12,O12

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper compares the relative impact of two road safety interventions in the Kenyan minibus or
matatu sector: a top down set of regulatory requirements known as the Michuki Rules and a consumer
empowerment intervention. We use very detailed insurance claims data on three classes of vehicles
to implement a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to measure the impact of the Michuki
Rules. Despite strong political leadership and dedicated resources, we find no statistically significant
effect of the Michuki Rules on accident rates. In contrast, the consumer empowerment intervention
that didn’t rely on third party enforcement has very large and significant effects on accident rates.
Our intent-to-treat estimates suggest reductions in accident rates of at least 50%. Our analysis suggests
that in institutionally weak environments, innovative consumer-driven solutions might provide an
alternative solution to low quality service provision.

1. Introduction
Traffic fatalities constitute a large share of both deaths and the burden of disease in the developing
world, and continue to rise. Traffic accidents were ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in 2001,
and were projected to be the third or fourth most important contributor to the global disease burden
in 2030 (Lopez et. al. 2006). By that date, road accidents are expected to account for 3.7 percent of
deaths worldwide ‐ twice the number due to malaria (Mathers and Loncar, 2006).4
Absent market failures, traffic accidents can be viewed simply as a cost of driving, and one that road
users rationally incur in their consumption of transport services.5 On the other hand, dangerous
driving imposes obvious external costs on other road users – both those traveling in other vehicles, and,
especially in the developing world, pedestrians. Standard approaches to such market failures include
either direct government regulations, the use of the price mechanism through the imposition of taxes
and/or penalties levied on dangerous driving, or both.
Social marketing and advertising campaigns provide an alternative means by which behavior change
might be induced, and have been used extensively in areas of public health in general, and road safety
in particular. Which of the two approaches – that is social pressure through marketing or government
enforcement of explicit regulations – is more (cost‐) effective in inducing prudent behavior is of general
interest. But it is especially important in the context of developing countries with at best limited, and
at worst dysfunctional, institutions that compromise the effective enforcement of well‐intentioned
rules.6
This paper makes such an assessment by comparing two interventions in the Kenyan minibus or
matatu sector that broadly fall into the two categories. In particular, the safety of matatu travel as
measured by insurance claims is compared in two settings: first, in the wake of the draconian
imperatives of the so‐called Michuki Rules, regulatory requirements implemented in 2004 governing
the operation of matatus; and second, in the context of a consumer empowerment campaign that
circumvented all forms of public intervention and enforcement but instead appealed directly to
passengers to monitor their drivers. This comparison should be interpreted as a case study, as the
regulatory reforms reflected a broad‐based policy intervention in 2004, and the consumer empower
project was a relatively small‐scale randomized‐control trial (RCT) implemented three years later.
Nonetheless, the comparison provides useful information on the comparative effectiveness of
alternative interventions in contexts with limited institutional capacity.
The Michuki rules, which required retrofitting of vehicles with certain safety devices and other reforms
as outlined in the next section, were widely believed to have led to an immediate and sustained
improvement in the safety of Kenya’s roads. However despite this view, we find that most of the
perceived effects were driven by the short‐run compliance costs imposed on vehicle owners and

4
  Country level data are generally less reliable. Odero et al. (2003) suggest that fatality rates in Kenya are extremely high with
7 deaths from 35 road crashes every day, and that the impact of prevailing interventions is dismal. According to a Ministry of
Health Report, in 1996 traffic accidents were the third leading cause of death after malaria and HIV/AIDS (Government of
Kenya, 1996).
5
  Of course, the uncertainty surrounding road accidents rationalizes insurance against such events and the costs they impose,
but this does not imply that the number of accidents is too high.
6
  The two approaches could also exhibit important complementarities, although we cannot assess this possibility here.

                                                                                                                                 2
drivers, as opposed to their behavior, and that a month after the rules were introduced there was no
discernible effect on insurance claims. In contrast, the consumer empowerment campaign we examine,
which encouraged passengers to actively complain directly to their drivers when they felt unsafe, led
to a remarkably large reduction in insurance claims of between a half and two‐thirds.
2. Two approaches to driver behavior change
Although official data are incomplete, 14 seater minibuses, or matatus, are believed to be involved in,
and indeed to cause, a large share of the over‐3,000 road deaths in Kenya each year. Traditionally
over‐crowded and under‐capitalized, matatus were notorious for careening along Kenya’s roads, from
the highways joining the Indian Ocean coast with Lake Victoria deep in the interior, to the crowded
streets of the capital Nairobi and the country’s larger cities of Mombasa and Kisumu. In this section we
review two approaches to improving the safety of matatu travel.
The Michuki Rules
In February 2004, new government regulations initiated by and subsequently named after then‐
Minister of Transport John Michuki became effective. The objectives of the regulations were to
“reduce accidents caused by overspeeding; enhance safety of commuters; ensure responsibility,
accountability and competence of drivers and conductors; eliminate illegal drivers, conductors and
criminals that had infiltrated the industry; and facilitate identification of vehicles and restrict their
operation to authorized routes” (Chitera and Kibua, 2004). Under the reform, all matatus were
required to comply with a series of rules aimed at reducing reckless driving, including:

   The installation of speed governors, devices that would cause the engine to shut down
    automatically if the vehicle’s speed surpassed the national speed limit of 80km/h;7
   The installation of passenger safety belts, which had until then been rare in public service vehicles
    (i.e.,minibuses and buses), and infrequently used even when available;
   The painting of a yellow stripe on all matatus;
   The restriction of matatus to clearly specified and documented routes;
   The limitation on the number of passengers to 13, plus the driver;8
   The licensing and vetting of drivers and conductors.9
The resource costs of adopting the vehicle modifications were high, amounting to about $750 for seat
belts, speed governors, and inspections (Chitere and Kibua, 2004).
Although we do not have data on enforcement of the Michuki rules, anecdotal accounts suggest that
compliance with the new requirements, such as the installation of speed governors and seat belts, was
initially relatively high. However the impact of the regulations on actual driving behavior was not clear.
For example, the development of second‐generation devices known as “speed governor governors,”


7
  Speed limits in the cities are 50km/hr.
8
  Previously the official passenger limit had been 18 (five standing), although vehicles with as many as 30 passengers could be
observed plying the streets of Nairobi. The seat belt rule was as much a means of enforcing penalties for over‐crowding
(passengers without a seat belt were fined) as a direct safety intervention.
9
  Upon implementation of the rules, drivers and conductors had to receive a “Certificate of Good Conduct” before being able
to resume work. They had to dress in prescribed uniforms, and post their pictures in the vehicle.

                                                                                                                              3
which would allow a driver to manually engage or disable the speed governor while in motion, made it
harder for police patrols to apprehend cheating operators. As noted by other authors (Gachiki, 2004,
and Chitere and Kibua, 2004), corruption also likely limited the impact of the rules on actual driving
practices, as matatus would be randomly stopped with high probability at ubiquitous police road‐
blocks, independent of their speed or safety, and their drivers shaken down for bribes. These shake‐
downs were made easier and more remunerative by the new regulations, as they provided the police
with a variety of additional dimensions on which drivers and conductors might be found in non‐
compliance, and the high fixed costs associated with appearing in court to contest a citation generated
sizeable rents. Such arbitrary taxation would have reduced the return to driving safely in general, and
to adhering to the speed limit in particular.
The initial impact of these rules was a sudden reduction in the number of matatus and larger buses on
the roads, as they were removed from service to be fitted with the necessary control devices and seat
belts. In the days and weeks following the adoption of the regulations, thousands of Kenyans walked
miles to work and to school, and there was a popular belief that the roads were safer. Accordingly, bus
fares increased dramatically in this period, as demand far outstripped supply.
Government statistics showed an immediate and dramatic reduction in road accidents following the
adoption of the new rules (Ministry of Transport and Communication, 2004). For example, Mutugi and
Maingi (2011) report a fall in all road accidents from 2003 and 2004 of about 20 percent.10 Similarly,
Chitere and Kibua (2004) report “fatal, serious, and slight” accidents all falling by about 40 percent
each in February‐July, 2004 compared with the same six‐month period a year earlier. However they
also reported instances of tampering with speed governors, under‐use of low‐quality seat belts,
continued over‐crowding, and laxity of law enforcement.
Consumer empowerment
Institutional weakness and corruption may compromise the effectiveness of a variety of reform efforts,
especially those that rely on third‐party enforcement. In the case of public transportation, an
alternative to top‐down campaigns like the Michuki rules is to empower passengers to demand higher
quality services directly, not by threatening to report a bad driver, but simply by openly complaining to
him.11 To motivate the potential impact of such a strategy, we argue that complaints to the driver
represent contributions to a local public good, and that a collective action problem among passengers
could arise accordingly. Multiple equilibria can exist in such environments, characterized by different
aggregate levels of public good provision. This suggests that lowering the resource or psychic costs of
complaints, for example by making them appear more legitimate and thereby giving passengers a voice,
could lead to discrete changes in the intensity of consumer monitoring and enforcement, and perhaps
meaningful changes in safety and outcomes.
To test these ideas, we conducted a randomized control trial of an intervention aimed at empowering
matatu passengers to exert pressure on drivers to drive more safely.12 The intervention was simple

10
   Mutugi and Maingi report accidents falling from 133,378 in 2003 to 10,717 in 2004, but we suspect a typographical error in
the first figure, which was more likely 13,378.
11
   Neither author of this paper has observed a female matatu driver in Kenya.
12
   A full description of the intervention and results can be found in Habyarimana and Jack (2011).

                                                                                                                            4
and cheap: stickers with evocative messages intended to motivate passengers to take demonstrative
action ‐ to “heckle and chide” a dangerous driver ‐ were placed in about half of roughly 2,300 recruited
matatus. The stickers included graphic images of injuries, and text in English and Kiswahili encouraging
passengers to “Don’t just sit there! Stand up! Speak up!”
An initial small pilot in fall 2007 was compromised when we discovered that stickers were quickly being
removed from treated vehicles. In response to this, we reissued stickers and scaled up to the full
sample in early 2008, but in an attempt to ensure higher rates of compliance we ran a weekly lottery
amongst drivers of participating treatment matatus. Each week three prizes of 5,000, 3,000 and 2,000
Kenyan Shillings were awarded to drivers (about $60 – roughly a week’s wages, $35, and $25) if their
vehicle was found to have all stickers intact upon inspection by our field staff.
3. Data and empirical strategy
We were given access to vehicle‐level insurance data by four large insurance companies in Kenya.13
These data sources spanned different time periods, as illustrated in Figure 1, and provided different
levels of detail. All four companies provided data on a claim‐by‐claim basis including the date of the
accident, the class of vehicle (private cars, commercial vehicles (e.g., trucks), buses, matatus,
motorcycles), deaths, injuries, and claim amounts. In addition, Standard Assurance and Direct Line
Assurance provided data on insurance policies, not just claims, on a month‐by‐month basis.




Given the timing of events, as illustrated in Figure 1, and the comprehensive nature of the information
provided, the data from Standard Assurance are best suited to evaluating the impact of the Michuki
reforms. On the other hand, we use data from all four insurers to assess the impact of the consumer
empowerment campaign.



13
  The companies were Standard Assurance, Blue Shield Insurance, Africa Merchant Assurance Company Ltd. (Amaco), and
Direct Line Assurance. Since mid‐2009, Standard ceased to operate while Blue Shield was placed under receivership in
September 2011.

Michuki Rules: summary statistics and empirical strategy
Table 1 below shows a summary of the underlying policy‐level data that is used to estimate the impact
of the Michuki rules. While the duration of the typical policy sold varies from one month for matatus to
a year for private vehicles, we expand all annual policies into 12 month‐level policies. As the table
below shows, there is considerable variation from year to year driven primarily by the presence of
close substitutes offered by competing insurance companies.

Figures 1 through 3 expand the policy and claims data shown in Table 1 above, for matatus, private
vehicles, and other buses respectively. The number of Matatu policies sold fell somewhat in the
month before and of the reform, while policies for the other two classes of vehicle did not respond.
Claims rates for private vehicles and other buses are noisy, but exhibit no obvious change around the
time of the reforms, while matatu claims appear to drop in the month preceding the intervention.
Data (not shown here) from the other insurance company that was in business at the time of this
reform confirms this dip in operational vehicles.

In evaluating the impact of the Michuki reforms we employ a difference in differences estimation
strategy, using private vehicles as a control group. Private vehicles, while not directly affected by the
reforms, do not constitute an ideal control group however, because safer operation of matatus could
result in fewer accidents involving other vehicles, and hence lower claims. To the extent that not all
matatu claims events involve private vehicles, this estimation strategy has a chance of at least
identifying the effect of the reform on non‐private vehicle related accidents. Unfortunately, the claims
data used here does not identify the type of vehicle involved in the claims event.
The simplest approach is to collapse all the vehicle‐month level data into two periods representing the
time before and after February 2004, and to use the following specification:
                                                                                                                                         (1)
                                              yijt   0  M j  M j Post  Post   ijt

where      is an indicator variable equal to 1 if vehicle i in category j has had an accident ,      is a
dummy variable equal to one if category is a matatu, and                  1 if   0 (i.e., after the reform
date of February 2004) and zero otherwise. This simple specification assumes that the trend in matatu
accident rates would have been the same as the evolution of private vehicle accidents but for the
adoption of the Michuki reforms. A negative and significant value of would indicate a reduction in
claims associated with the new rules.
Specification (1) above can be extended to a multi‐period estimation simply by specifying Post as a set
of indicators corresponding to each month of the 4 year window around the reforms. Estimating
specification (2) below allows one to examine temporal effects of reforms as well as adjust for
differential trends.

where we represent each month as an indicator variable Dt equal to 1 in that particular month t, and 0
otherwise. The set of coefficients now define the time profile of the impact of the reforms for all
time periods after the reform date. This specification allows us to examine the evolution of reform’s
impact over time, including any persistence or waning of its effects. As with specification 1, the implicit
counterfactual is that accident rates of matatus have the same trend as the private vehicles (defined by
the family of parameters  ) in the absence of the reform. With multiple periods, we can relax this
assumption by including vehicle category specific trends as in specification (3) below.

Heckle and Chide: summary statistics and empirical strategy
We recruited a total of 2,276 long distance matatus in Nairobi and a number of regional centers,
adopting field‐based randomization to treatment and control status using the last digit of the vehicle’s
license plate.15 Claims data were provided by insurance companies that at the time together covered
about 90 percent of matatus in the country. Measurement error could arise due to selective reporting
of accidents, although we do not believe this would have been associated with treatment status.

Notes: Standard errors in ( ); Medians in [ ]. The table presents mean/median of vehicle characteristics by treatment assignment. The
sample is restricted to matatus for which information on random assignment is available. 115 matatus that could not be matched to the
initial assignment list are dropped. a Statistics reported in these rows are based on the sample of all recruited matatus. The statistics
reported in panel B of the table are based on a random sample of 284 matatu drivers who were surveyed 6 months after recruitment.



In assessing the impact of the passenger empowerment intervention, we adopt a similar statistical
methodology to that employed in evaluating the Michuki Rules, this time comparing matatus assigned
to treatment and control groups before and after the assignment of stickers. As discussed in
Habyarimana and Jack (2011), compliance with the random assignment was high, but not perfect, so
we report intent‐to‐treat estimates and instrumental variable estimates using assignment status as an
exogenous instrument. We also allow for different trends in accident rates for treatment and control
vehicles before the intervention.
Our first specification is the analog of equation (1) above:

                                         yit    Ti   Postt  Ti  Postt   Xi  i  it                                              (4)
where is a dummy equal to one if vehicle was assigned to the treatment group, and                1 for
                                               16
observations that occur after the intervention. Because we collected survey data on individual
matatus and their drivers, we include additional controls, , and a matatu credit cooperative fixed
effect .
To allow for differences in trends between treatment and control groups and potential seasonality, we
augment equation (4) to the following form:

                             yit    Ti  Postt  Ti  Postt  X i      (                 Ti )  Qt    t  i   it

     Thus in this specification we collapse all the data into just two periods.

4. Results
Michuki Rules
The simple difference in differences estimate of the impact of the Michuki Rules is shown in Table 3,
where the data are aggregated over a period of 24 months before the reforms and 24 months after.
These results suggest that there was no sustained reduction in accidents involving matatus relative to
private vehicles over the long‐term.

This analysis shows there was no discernible impact of the reforms over the long term. While the point
estimate (‐.003) is negative and economically large, it is statistically indistinguishable from the reform
having had no effect on accident rates.
To assess the temporal impacts of the reforms, we estimate equation (3) and illustrate the results in
Figure 4. The horizontal axis measures months before or after the introduction of the reforms, with
     0 representing February 2004. The solid line represents the values of the month‐level coefficients
  , which can be interpreted as measuring the differential likelihood of an insurance claim by a matatu
compared with that of private vehicles, assuming a common trend for          0. The dashed lines show
the 95 percent confidence interval around the estimated effects. There is a significant negative impact
of about two percentage points on the likelihood of a matatu claim at       0. For     0 the estimates
are mostly negative, but they are statistically insignificant.




                                                                                                        11
Note: The figure above plots the monthXminibus_indicator coefficients from a regression of claims rates on a set of month dummies, a
vehicle class indicator (the baseline category is private vehicles) and their interaction. The dashed lines show the upper and lower
limits of the 95% confidence interval.

    Figure 4: Differential likelihood of claim for matatus vis‐a‐vis other private vehicles, common time trends

Figure 5 illustrates the same information but allows for differential trends in matatu and private
vehicle claims rates before the reform. If anything, these results indicate an more emphatically that
there was no discernible effect of the reforms. Apart from the impact at        0, the only significant
coefficient occurs more than a year after their implementation, and is positive.




Note: The figure above plots the monthXminibus_indicator coefficients from a regression of claims rates on a set of month dummies, a
vehicle class indicator (the baseline is private vehicles) and their interaction. The dashed lines show the upper and lower limits of the
95% confidence interval.

 Figure 5: Differential likelihood of claim for matatus vis‐a‐vis other private vehicles, class‐specific time trends

We interpret the sharp fall in claims likelihood during the first month the reforms as deriving from
matatus being pulled off the road in order to be fitted with the required equipment. Since we do not
have data on miles traveled, or days of active operation, we cannot say for sure if this is the case. But


                                                                                                                                       12
the anecdotal evidence reported above is consistent with a large reduction in the volume of matatu
traffic in that period.
We also report the differential likelihood of matatus, compared with private vehicles, making claims
that involve an injury or death, as shown in Figure 6 (again, allowing for differential trends). Although
there is a negative coefficient at     0 once again, and while it is sustained until four months after the
reform, there appears to have been an (imprecise) negative differential for some months leading up to
February 2004 as well. This suggests that other factors could have been at work to reduce serious
matatu accidents leading up to the reforms, although we have no specific evidence of such. From
    5 onwards, the differential likelihood of a claim is either zero or positive.




Note: The figure above plots the monthXminibus_indicator coefficients from a regression of injury or death related claims rates on a
set of month dummies, a vehicle class indicator (the baseline is private vehicles) and their interaction. The dashed lines show the upper
and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval.

Figure 6: Differential likelihood of claim involving an injury or death for matatus vis‐a‐vis other private vehicles,
                                              class‐specific time trends

Our results suggest that the Michuki Rules had little if any effect on the safety of matatu travel in
Kenya. Compliance with the new regulations disrupted transportation services in the early days of
implementation considerably, but appears not to have reduced the likelihood that any operational
vehicle would have an accident leading to the submission of an insurance claim.
Heckle and chide
The effects of the consumer empowerment intervention are both more reliably estimated, due to the
randomized assignment of treatment, and demonstrably larger, than the impact of the regulatory
reform. Figure 7 (from Habyarimana and Jack, 2011) reports quarterly data by random assignment
from the first quarter of 2006 to the second quarter of 2009 (the intervention was implemented in Q1,
2008). Each point in the graph represents the number of claims per 1,000 insured matatus, and the
two lines are trend lines (estimated using pre‐intervention data for the treatment group, and data
through 2008 for the control). The data were collected in 2009, but the figures reported for that year
are incomplete, given the considerable lag between a claims related event and the digital recording of
the associated claim.
                                                                                                                                      13
Note: The figure presents the number of insurance claims by quarter between January 1 2006 and May 25 2009. All insurance claims
are used to construct this figure. Solid and dashed lines represent fitted linear trends for the treatment and control group. We fit a
linear trend to all claims for the pre‐treatment period for the treatment group (all claims from 2006‐2007). The dotted line traces out
counterfactual claims for the treatment group. For the control group, we fit a linear trend to all claims from 2006‐2008, excluding
claims from quarters 1 and 2 of 2009 due to incompleteness. We make the simplifying assumptions that matatus continue to operate
after a claim event and were operating throughout this period.
                              Figure 7: Quarterly claims data, treatment and control matatus

Prior to the intervention, claims rates exhibited an upward trend, and showed no discernible
differences between vehicles assigned to the control and treatment groups.17 However after the
intervention, claims rates were consistently lower for vehicles assigned to the treatment group.
Panel A of Table 4 reports ITT estimates for equation (3), collapsing all the data into two periods –
before and after the intervention.18 In the first two columns, the probability of any claim falls by
between 50 and 63 percent (from projected annual rates of 10 and 8.1 percent respectively). Similar
reductions are observed for claims in which the matatu driver was at fault (columns 3 and 4), and for
claims involving an injury or death (columns 5 and 6).
Panel B report instrumental variable results, where we use assignment as an instrument for treatment
status. The estimates of the impact of the treatment on the treated, or local average treatment effect,
are effectively scaled by the inverse of the compliance rate, and are correspondingly larger than the ITT
estimates. According to these estimates, amongst those vehicles that were induced to accept stickers
by being assigned to the treatment group, claims were close to eliminated, falling by between 73 and
93 percent.
Similar results are obtained using the specification with more temporal structure in equation (5), and
can be found in Habyarimana and Jack (2011).

   A similar upward trend was under way for larger 30‐41 seater buses (see Habyarimana and Jack, 2011), suggesting a secular
trend.

   Columns 2, 4, and 6 include SACCO fixed effects. Most long distance matatus are organized in SACCOs, Savings and Credit
Cooperatives, of which there were 21 in our study.

5. Evidence on mechanisms of change underlying heckle and chide
Although the consumer empowerment intervention appears to have sizeable impacts on accidents and
insurance claims, exactly what mechanisms underlie these large effects is unclear. One concern is that
drivers of treated matatus, misunderstood the lottery as being a prize for safe driving, and that they
responded to the perceived financial incentive. Since the design did not include a placebo intervention,
it is impossible to know whether this is the case. And even if we are confident that the lottery did not
drive our results, we do not know if the stickers worked by inducing passenger complaints, or if they
affected the driver directly (he was aware of them, even if they weren’t in view as he drove).
In this section we present some suggestive evidence for potential mechanisms that underlie the
reduction in accident rates estimated above. Although we do not have the data to definitively

number of other mechanisms including direct effects on drivers, ex post sorting of drivers, and the
effects of the lottery.
Survey evidence
The obvious mechanism by which the intervention leads to improved safety is that the stickers
empower passengers to voice their concerns over bad driving and that the resulting social pressure
changes the behavior of the driver. To investigate this we analyze data from a survey fielded in
November 2008 of drivers, plus up to three passengers per vehicle. A total of 284 vehicles were
sampled for this survey.19
We face two difficulties in detecting evidence for this mechanism. First, even if the stickers are
effective in empowering passengers, we might observe little or no difference in heckling if drivers of
treatment vehicles quickly learn to adapt their behavior to minimize passenger complaints. On the
other hand, whether heckling is observed in equilibrium or not, we might expect passengers to report
their trips as being safer in treatment matatus. Secondly, given the rarity of traffic accidents, events
that generate heckling will also be rare. Compounding this power problem is the fact that, despite the
weekly lottery, after 8 months a considerable number of the treatment vehicles had lost some or all of
their stickers. Table 5 shows that among our sample of 284 matatus the share with all five stickers had
fallen from 44% at recruitment to 18% eight months later, and the share with at least one sticker had
fallen from 53% to 37%.

Notes: Robust standard errors in (). * Significant at 5%, ** significant at 1% level. Panel A reports the results of a linear probability
model on the likelihood of drivers reporting heckling in the past week and on the most recent trip. Panel B reports the results of an
OLS regression of the likelihood of passengers reporting expressions of concern to driver/conductor on treatment assignment status,
safety rating and the interaction of the two variables. A sample of up to 3 passengers exiting each matatu surveyed 8 months after
recruitment is used to construct these estimates. Passengers from 22 matatus that could not be matched to the assignment lists are
dropped leaving a total of 788 passengers. (see below on the coding of unsafe). Panel C reports the results of an ordered probit
model on passenger perceptions of safety. Passengers were asked to rate the safety of the just completed trip on a scale from 1 to
10, where 1 implies no danger, 10 implies high likelihood of serious injury/death and 55 corresponds to “cannot say”. A trip is
considered safe unsafe if at least one respondent reports a safety rating of 6 or higher. We recode this variable as follows: 1=Safe ( a
rating 1‐5), 2=Cannot Say (55) and 3=Dangerous (a rating 6‐10).



The results are suggestive of passenger heckling as one of several potential contributors to the
reduction in accident rates. In rows (1) and (2) of Panel A, we estimate the effect of assignment
on the likelihood that the driver reports passenger heckling in the past week and most recent
trip. The point estimate in row (1) has the right sign but is imprecisely estimated. The sign of
the coefficient in row (2) is wrong but again imprecise. However, in OLS results not reported
here, we find substantial and marginally significant effects of having a sticker eight months into




                                                                                                                                      17
the study. In particular, drivers of vehicles with stickers at the time of the survey were about
three times more likely to report passenger heckling.20
We next turn to self‐reported evidence of passenger action in panel B of Table 6. Sampled
passengers were asked to report if they or any other passengers had said something to the
driver/conductor about reckless driving behavior on the just concluded trip. In order to avoid
conflating potentially frivolous actions with legitimate heckling, we control for the reported
safety of the trip. In particular, passengers were asked to rank the safety of the trip on a scale of
1 to 10, with 1 denoting no danger and 10 denoting life‐threatening. While nearly 45% of the
respondents reported that they "could not say", we define a trip to be reported as safe if the
passenger reports a rating equal to or less than 5. For our current purposes we create an
indicator for whether at least one passenger had rated the safety of the trip as dangerous (a
rating of 6 or higher). Evidence for the passenger heckling mechanism is then captured by the
extent to which there is a greater likelihood of heckling on trips deemed dangerous by at least
one passenger. We present ITT estimates for four different outcomes that correspond to the
rows in Panel B of Table 6: likelihood of heckling by (1) the respondent (2) any passenger (3) at
least two respondents (4) all respondents. The latter two outcomes represent a crude measure
of the extent to which the intervention facilitates collective passenger action and the unit of
observation is the vehicle.21 The coefficient of interest is the interaction of the indicator for
stickers and whether at least one passenger rated the trip as unsafe.
Our estimates for this parameter are of the wrong sign in rows (1) ‐ (3), but in all cases are very
imprecise. In row (4) that estimates the likelihood that all correspondents heckle the driver, we
obtain the right sign but once again the coefficient is statistically insignificant.
One way in which this mechanism could operate is by making passenger heckling a credible
threat to reckless driving. In the absence of more objective measures of driving behavior, we
rely on passenger ratings of safety of the just concluded trip. Our results in Panel C report the
results of an ordered probit estimation across three safety ratings categories (safe trip, cannot
say, unsafe). About two thirds of all passengers in the control matatus rated the most recent
trip as safe according to this definition. The ordered probit estimate in Panel C has the right sign
but is very imprecisely estimated.
While the evidence above suggests that passenger action may well lie at the heart of the
observed effects, we cannot definitively rule out a number of other potential mechanisms. For

20
   In a simple OLS estimation of the effect of stickers on heckling, non‐random removal or depreciation of stickers
could bias our results. On the one hand, dangerous drivers might have removed them, either in advance or in
response to unwelcome heckling as they learned about their effectiveness over time. This would work against finding
evidence of passenger action in treated vehicles. On the other hand, if the stickers provided drivers who otherwise
lacked self‐control with an effective enforcement technology, removal could be concentrated in the pool of relatively
safe drivers, who simply find them distasteful and perhaps bad for business. This would bias our results in favor of
finding an effect. Although we cannot distinguish econometrically between these two directions of bias, we believe
the former is more plausible and highly likely to dominate the latter.
21
     For two or more respondent reports of heckling we are unable to condition on the same dangerous event.

                                                                                                                  18
instance while passenger ratings of safety do not confirm this (see Panel C of Table 3), it is
possible that a driver's beliefs regarding the preferences of the vehicle's owner, over either
passenger safety or the life of the vehicle, could be affected by this intervention. More direct
observations of driver behavior might shed more light on the plausibility of this mechanism.
Driver sorting
Alternatively, although the ex ante assignment of stickers to drivers was random, the ex post
assignment may have exhibited sorting. That is, it is possible that rather than stickers having
altered the behind‐the‐wheel behavior of drivers, either directly or via passenger action, they
induced sorting of drivers across treatment and control matatus. For example, suppose reckless
drivers in treated vehicles tended to switch to control vehicles, or to exit this labor market
entirely, while safe drivers in control vehicles on average moved to treated matatus. Such
sorting behavior could have led to the observed changes in claims rates, but would not have
been associated with any change in driving practices per se. We present three pieces of
evidence suggesting that this kind of ex post sorting does not constitute a likely explanation of
the results.
First, the share of treatment vehicles within each matatu cooperative (SACCO) is about half, so
sorting within SACCOs is definitely feasible. However, the authority to hire and fire drivers rests
not with the SACCO, but with the owners of the vehicles. But since matatu ownership is very
diffuse, sorting within an individual owner's fleet (which can be as small as one or two vehicles)
is unlikely to generate our measured effects. And given the costs of sorting out of treatment
vehicles, it would be much easier for the drivers to remove the stickers than to find an eligible
and willing partner with whom to switch.
Second, it is possible that this sorting operates more on the participation margin, if reckless
drivers tend to quit the treatment group. Data on driver tenure suggests that the median
tenure is about 10 months and that while overall turnover since recruitment has been high (an
average of 39%), there is no statistically significant difference in turnover rates across treatment
and control vehicles (41 vs 37%). This holds true amongst the drivers assigned to a single vehicle.
And third, selective sorting could take place within just those SACCOs that have a policy of
regularly rotating drivers across vehicles, as long as such rotation was non‐random. However,
our results could be driven by selective sorting among the relatively small group of drivers in
such SACCOs only if there was a high concentration of claims among "reckless" drivers. The
insurance claims data from the period before our intervention do not support this pattern.
Although the identity of the driver is not recorded in the data, we do know that before our
intervention, fewer than 8% of all claims were associated with multiple‐claim vehicles (and
possibly drivers). Overall, these three pieces of evidence suggest that while we cannot rule out
driver sorting as a response to the intervention, the scale at which such sorting could be
occurring cannot explain the results obtained above.




                                                                                                   19
Direct effects of the lottery
Finally, we discuss the possibility that the presence of the lottery, designed to improve sticker
retention, could itself lead to our empirical results. Recall that drivers who accepted all five
stickers at recruitment were divided into 5 groups of roughly 200 vehicles, and that each week
on a five‐week rotating basis, members of one of the groups were eligible to win one of three
prizes if, when randomly drawn, upon inspection they were found to have retained all five
stickers. The total prize money each week of 10,000 shillings (about 2 weeks' wages) was
awarded in three amounts (5,000, 3,000 and 2,000) to three different winners.
The lottery itself could have changed the beliefs of drivers of treatment vehicles about the
likelihood and consequences of an accident. Alternatively, while the rules of the lottery were
very explicit, and drivers were told that eligibility was based on sticker retention and not an
accident‐free record, it is still conceivable that drivers with stickers might have misconstrued the
lottery as as reward for safe driving. The policy implications of such findings would, of course,
be radically different to those that would otherwise be drawn.
On the first point, knowledge of the lottery and its association with the road safety project were
not confined to treatment vehicles alone or lottery nominees. Inspection of stickers was done at
parking lots where control and treatment drivers interacted quite frequently, and where
awareness of the role of the sticker inspector was clear to both. As a result, we believe that any
small differences in road safety salience attributable to the lottery across the two groups is
unlikely to explain the large effect measured above.
On the second point, which is potentially of greater concern, the payment is likely to have been
too small to alter driving behavior. Expected winnings were very low (equal to wages equivalent
to about 20 minutes work), and even if drivers had unreasonable priors of winning, the first
prize was considerably less than what a driver could make by squeezing in one extra trip
(unreported to owner) per month.
Nonetheless, to address this second issue more quantitatively, we investigate the beliefs that
drivers would have had to maintain in order that the observed reduction in claims rates could be
rationalized in terms of a response to the misguided belief that safe driving would increase the
chance of winning the lottery. This kind of exercise is of course laden with assumptions and can
only inform the analysis if the results suggest wildly counterfactual driver beliefs. In fact, we
find that such extreme beliefs, plus an impossibly high response of accidents to speed
reductions, are indeed necessary to support the claim that the lottery was the driving force
behind the impact we observe.
The key parameter in this exercise is the elasticity of accidents with respect to speed, estimates
of which are not available in Kenya or other developing countries to our knowledge. Ashenfelter




                                                                                                    20
and Greenstone (2009) report data for the US suggesting an elasticity of fatalities of about 4,
which provides a benchmark against which to compare our data.22
 As we illustrate below,23even if a driver (i) thought he would win the lottery with certainty
(instead of with average weekly probability 0.003), (ii) was sure of reducing his chance of an
accident to zero, and (iii) thought that there was a single prize of 10,000 shillings every week,
the elasticity of accidents with respect to speed would still need to be more than 30 times larger
that the US estimate for the expected financial benefit of slowing down to outweigh the
expected costs. In light of the evidence, recently reviewed by Delavande et al. (2009), that
people in developing countries generally understand the concept of probability, we believe this
calculation, while clearly subject to wide margins of error, nonetheless strongly suggests the
lottery itself did not affect driver behavior enough to account for any meaningful share of the
estimated effects of the intervention.




22
  The approximately equal estimated proportional impacts of the intervention on all claims, claims in which the
driver was at fault, and claims involving an injury or death suggest that this fatality elasticity is a good proxy for the
elasticity of all accidents.
23
   Each week three prizes totaling 10,000 shillings were awarded. We assume driver risk neutrality and denote the
size of the average weekly prize by x 10,000/3. The probability the driver assesses to winning a prize, conditional
on not having had an accident, is denoted , and the expected winning each week are . Let be the driver's
weekly wage, and denote          / as the ratio of the average prize to the wage. In order to reduce the chance of
being involved in an accident, thereby increasing his chance of winning, the (misinformed) driver slows down. We
want to compare the expected increase in winnings to the cost this would impose on him.

Let    be the weekly probability of having an accident under the assumption of no behavior change. (The projected
counterfactual annual accident rate among treated matatus during the year following the intervention was
approximately 10 percent, so        0.1/52.) Drivers in the treatment group experienced a claims rate about half the
projected rate. Assuming for the sake or simplicity a constant proportional reduction over the year, their actual
weekly probability of having an accident was          /2 , which is also the change in the probability, Δ . Engaging in
this behavior change increases expected weekly winnings by         Δ         Δ     .

The expected cost per week of slowing down is the wage times the extra time taken, Δ , which is approximately
equal to       Δ / , where is the average speed of the vehicle. Define the elasticity of accidents, , with respect
to speed, , by              /       . Although the relationship between speed and accident rates in Kenya is not
known, Ashenfelter and Greenstone (2009) present fatality and speed data from the US that suggests an elasticity of
fatalities with respect to speed of about 4. (In their data, a 4.55% reduction in speed is associated with a 15.46%
reduction in fatalities.) Thus the cost incurred by the driver in reducing accidents by this much is approximately
        /      where       Δ /      1/2. This cost is less than the expected benefit 1      Δ     .

Using our data the right hand side of this expression is approximately 2 4           0.05 / 52          3/ 1,000
  2/3       1/65,000. That is, for a driver to respond only to the incentive of a lottery whose eligibility criteria he
misinterpreted, and not to the stickers or the response they evoked on the part of passengers, he would need to
over‐estimate the right hand side of the inequality condition above by a factor of 65,000. Even if he thought he
would win the lottery with certainty (     1), was sure of reducing his chance of an accident to zero (Δ        0.1/52),
and thought that there was a single prize of 10,000 shillings (    2), the elasticity of accidents with respect to speed
would still need to be 32.5 times larger that the US estimate for the condition above to be satisfied.

                                                                                                                             21
In on‐going work we attempt to explicitly address the concerns about mechanisms voiced above.
In particular, in a new study of more than 10,000 matatus we include a placebo arm in which
vehicles are assigned stickers that say simply “Travel well”, while remaining eligible for the
lottery. In addition, we send enumerators on up to 7,000 trips, during which they monitor
driving behavior and passenger responses directly.
5. Conclusions
We present evidence that tough government regulations were unsuccessful in inducing
sustained changes in accident rates of minibuses in Kenya, despite strong political leadership
and dedicated resources. On the other hand, an intervention that relied on no third party
enforcement, and whose implementation was in fact unknown to and unsupported by the
government or the police, appears to have been remarkably successful in bringing down
accidents rates, by at least a half.
We don’t have enough information to explain why the Michuki reforms were not successful.
Although there was an initial dip in the number of insurance claims involving vehicles subject to
the regulations, we argue that most of this was due to the need to comply with new hardware
requirements, which took a large number of minibuses off the road. Once the necessary vehicle
modifications had been made, it appears that claims rates returned quickly to their pre‐reform
levels.
It would be unhelpful to claim that all regulation is doomed to failure. Instead, our analysis
suggests that in institutionally weak environments, innovative consumer‐driven solutions might
provide an alternative solution to low quality service provision.
