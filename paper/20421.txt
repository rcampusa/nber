                                             ABSTRACT

Founded in 1441, King’s College was one of Cambridge University’s wealthiest Colleges, endowed
with a vast agricultural portfolio. John Maynard Keynes was appointed bursar just after WWI and
initiated a major reallocation to equities, an innovation at least as radical as the late 20th century
commitment to illiquid assets by Harvard and Yale. Keynes initially pursued a market-timing approach
to investment with mixed success and failed to anticipate the 1929 market crash. Thereafter, his switch
to a patient buy-and-hold strategy allowed him to maintain his commitment to equities in the subsequent
market slump, reflecting the natural advantages that accrue to long horizon investors. Keynes’ innovations
in endowment asset management, implemented over a dynamic period of capital market development
and economic turbulence remain of great relevance to modern investors emerging from the Great Recession.

1.   Introduction


       John Maynard Keynes’ experiences managing his Cambridge College

endowment illustrate several lessons still relevant to endowments and foundations

today. Keynes himself, when looking back over his investment career in the late

1930s, spoke of the need to understand the illiquidity risk attaching to an alternative

asset such as real estate and of the benefits to recognizing the extent of an

organization’s investment skills and resources in tailoring investment policy.


       Most pertinent to the subject of this volume, Keynes’ investment experiences

during the Great Depression of the 1930s are relevant to modern-day investors

during the Great Recession. He had to discover for himself the difficulty of making

profits from market timing when the stock market crashed in 1929. Thereafter, his

self-proclaimed switch to a more careful buy-and-hold stock-picking approach in the

early 1930s allowed him to maintain his commitment to equities when the market fell

sharply once more in 1937-38. In so doing, he provides an excellent example of the

natural advantages that accrue to such long-horizon investors as university

endowments in being able to behave in a contrarian manner during economic and

financial market downturns.


       King's, one of the thirty-one Cambridge Colleges, was founded in 1441 by King

Henry VI and lavishly endowed with agricultural real estate which stretched the

length and breadth of England. Famous Kingsmen other than John Maynard Keynes

include Sir Francis Walsingham, secretary of state and organiser of Queen Elizabeth

I's spy service; Sir Robert Walpole, prime minister, Alan Turing, the father of modern

computing; and the novelists E. M. Forster and Salman Rushdie.




                                         -2-
       For centuries, their agricultural estates formed the bulk of the endowment

assets of the oldest Colleges and King’s was no exception. When Keynes became

involved in the management of King’s endowment just after World War I, he

immediately undertook a substantial reallocation of the portfolio away from real

estate into the new asset class, equities. At the time, other institutional investors

remained reluctant to follow suit and it was not until after Keynes’ death that they

began to follow his example. Oxford and Cambridge (“Oxbridge”) Colleges have a

natural concern for preserving their wealth for future generations (Tobin, 1974) and

are the ultimate long-horizon investors. Keynes spotted an opportunity for such

patient, long-term investors in making a substantial allocation to equities, an innovation

at least as radical as the commitment to alternative assets in the late twentieth century

by Yale and Harvard. He selected an asset mix for King’s consistent with the

implications of standard models of consumption and portfolio choice that were to

appear many decades later, as described, for example, by Campbell and Viceira

(2002). Keynes can justly be regarded as among the first institutional equity investors.


       This paper describes why Keynes held strong views about equities and how

he changed his investment approach to the benefit of lower transaction costs. We

also highlight how King’s benefitted from earning an emerging risk premium on UK

equities despite the economic turbulence of the 1930s as well as from additional risk

premia obtained through tilting the portfolio toward both value and smaller-

capitalization stocks.


       His investment strategy benefitted the endowment considerably to the extent

that upon his death King’s had at least drawn level with Trinity, the richest of the

Cambridge Colleges. In the post-Keynes era, the endowment has had a more



                                          -3-
chequered history, illustrating the challenges in trying to emulate Keynes’

unconventional investment approach.


         The paper begins with a summary of Keynes’ various investing roles in

Section 2. Section 3 describes our data, followed by a discussion of endowment

asset management before Keynes in Section 4. We then review Keynes’

management of the endowment in Section 5 and how investment policy evolved after

Keynes in section 6. Finally, we discuss Keynes’ legacy in Section 7 and Section 8

concludes.


2.      Keynes’ Investing Life


         While still a Cambridge student, Keynes had written in 1905 to his friend,

Lytton Strachey, saying that:


              “I want to manage a railway or organise a Trust, or at least swindle

         the investing public; it is so easy and fascinating to master the principles

         of these things” (Moggridge, 1992: 95).


Here was a young man supremely confident in his abilities. It was therefore no

surprise that he remained extremely active throughout his life investing in stocks,

bonds, currencies and commodities 1. He was, in effect, similar to a modern global

macro hedge fund manager.


         Just after World War I, Keynes began trading currencies both for himself and

on behalf of the Syndicate, an investment pool he formed with the City financier


1
    See, for example Moggridge (1983), Pierce (1993) and Kent (2012) for a commentary on Keynes’
investing activities




                                               -4-
Oswald Toynbee (O.T.) Falk, whom he had met at the British Treasury. Keynes was

one of the first traders to exploit the development of the forward currency markets

and pursued a fundamentals based trading strategy (Accominotti and Chambers,

2014).


         Keynes also traded, largely on his own account, a wide variety of commodities

- cotton (Cristiano and Naldi, 2012), tin (Cavalli and Cristiano, 2012) and wheat

(Fantacci, Marcuzzo, and Sanfilippo, 2010; Foresti and Sanfilippo, 2012). Overall, his

record trading in commodities was rather mixed and marked by periods of large

gains and losses.


         In addition to his considerable personal investment activity, Keynes was

involved with a number of investment institutions. He was appointed Director of the

National Mutual Life Insurance Company, one of the City’s oldest institutions, in

1919, becoming its Chairman in 1921. Following persistent disagreements over

investment policy, he resigned in 1938. Keynes’ experience at a smaller family-run

insurer, the Provincial Insurance Company, was altogether more fruitful. As a

Director from 1923 until his death in 1946, Keynes successfully persuaded Francis

Scott, the managing director, of the advantages of investing in equities and

frequently recommended shares that were also held in his personal account

(Moggridge, 1983, p.51).


         Three other funds, the A.D. Investment Trust, the P.R. Finance Company and

the Independent Investment Company, were co-founded with O.T. Falk in the early

1920s. The latter two had chequered histories. The P.R. Finance Company was

eventually liquidated in 1935. Similarly, the Independent Investment Company lost




                                          -5-
nearly all its capital by the early 1930s and management subsequently passed into

other hands (Davenport, 1975, p.227).


          Above all, however, Keynes had his longest association with the King’s

College endowment - the primary focus of our study. This was the institution which

was closest to his heart and where he enjoyed full investment discretion.


3.      Data


          Annual investment reports of the King’s endowment are kept in the King’s

College Archives for each financial year ended August from 1921 up to the present,

with only occasional years missing. College income, including spending from the

endowment are taken from the annual Abstract of Receipts printed in the Cambridge

University Reporter from 1882 to 2000 and thereafter from the College Accounts

published on the King’s College website. All data applying to the period of Keynes’

management of the endowment 1921-46 is described in detail in Chambers, Dimson

and Foo (forthcoming).


          There is no published valuation of King’s real estate holdings until 1966, the

only disclosures regarding real estate investment being the rents received. For the

preceding period, we draw on Wilkinson’s (1980: 85) £1.0 million estimate of the 1919

value of real estate holdings, and then track the major disposals over the following

years to 1927. Subsequent to this date, we assume the College real estate portfolio

fluctuated in line with the real estate price appreciation index of Scott (1996)2 such that

the valuation converges on the figure of £1.2 million for 1966 as stated in the Report of

the Inspectors of Accounts (KCGB/4/1/1/23/19).

       For benchmark purposes we employ the 100 Share UK equity index series

estimated by Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (DMS, 2002, 2014), which is

representative of the sectoral composition of the broad market and includes natural

resource stocks as well as commercial and industrial companies. We use both the

main version of the 100 Share index, which is market capitalization weighted, and the

equally weighted index estimated in DMS (2002). Our UK government bond and cash

indexes are respectively the total return on UK Consols and UK Treasury Bill returns

(DMS, 2002, 2014). For real estate returns from 1973 onward, we utilise the

Investment Property Databank (IPD) UK Annual Index.


4.   King’s before Keynes


       Henry VI lavished the College with an endowment of thirty-six manorial

estates and eight appropriated rectories by 1453 (Saltmarsh, 1958: 3, 7). Despite the

expropriation of a substantial part of the original endowment during the reign of

Edward IV, which halved its annual income, King’s benefitted from the support of

Henry VII and VIII and remained the richest College in Cambridge for a century until

the foundation of Trinity in 1546.


       Its agricultural land holdings stretched right across England, embracing real

estate in more than twenty counties (Figure 1). The bursar’s job was to manage these

estates by approving new leases, renewing old ones, selling its timber and appointing

stewards and gamekeepers among other things. Although added to through gifts,

bequests and purchases, there were few major changes to King’s real estate

portfolio over the next four centuries (Saltmarsh, 1958: 12). Until the late 1850s the

Colleges were prohibited by their statutes from selling land (Dunbabin, 1975: 631).




                                         -7-
Even after that, there were no significant disposals of real estate until the

intervention of Keynes in 1920.


       King’s investment policy focused exclusively on real estate for four centuries up

to the mid-nineteenth century. On the whole this investment policy was rewarding. The

English Agricultural Revolution led to an eightfold rise in agricultural rents between

1700 and 1850 (Turner, Beckett and Afton, 1997: 207, Table 10.1) compared to a

fivefold increase in agricultural output. Whilst we lack reliable agricultural returns data

for this long span of history, the rise in rents is indicative of the success of this

investment policy.


       However, King’s, along with other Colleges, did suffer a considerable setback in

the last quarter of the nineteenth century with the onset of the Agricultural Depression

in Britain. The revolution in land and sea transportation opened up of new agricultural

lands in North America, Australia and Argentina, and brought sharp falls in agricultural

prices. As a result, English agricultural rents fell 30% from the mid-1870s to the mid-

1890s and back to the levels of sixty years earlier (Turner et al., 1997: 150). During the

same two decades, King’s real estate income declined by 20%. This slightly better

performance was most probably due to its ability to switch from long-standing

“beneficial leases” charging considerably below-market rents to so-called “rack-rents”

which now reflected the market (Dunbabin, 1975: 633). Although King’s real estate

income subsequently recovered, by 1913 it had still not returned to the level on the

eve of the Agricultural Depression.


       Prior to the College first disclosing a market valuation of its real estate holdings

in 1966, we can gauge the almost complete reliance on real estate from analyzing the

sources of College income (Table 1). In 1882, the first year that the College published


                                           -8-
its accounts, its real estate holdings yielded an income of £36,400 compared to an

income of only £1,600 from its security portfolio. A combination of inertia in investment

policy and College statutes that constrained disposal of originally endowed real estate

explains the very small allocation to financial securities, principally British government

bonds.


         Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Oxbridge Colleges found

themselves free to reinvest some of the proceeds from the sale of estates into

financial securities (Neild, 2008: 87). As a result, King’s small security portfolio grew to

include Indian government bonds (guaranteed by the British government) and British

railway bonds in the 1880s, and then British municipal government bonds and Colonial

government bonds in the 1890s. These bonds were deemed “first-class” and

representative of those “safe” securities drawn from a list of approved “Trustee

Securities”. This list comprises securities in which trustees, in the absence of a trust

deed conferring more liberal powers of investment, were authorised first by the courts

and then by the Trustee Acts of 1893 and 1900 to invest trust money. The list of

permitted securities was a very narrow one and most notably precluded any

investment in equities.


         In summary, King’s endowment remained undiversified with its almost total

reliance on real estate up to WWI. The interest income produced by its security

portfolio, despite having doubled over the previous forty years, was still only one-tenth

of its real estate income, leaving King’s unable to avoid the substantial negative shock

to its income from the Agricultural Depression.




                                           -9-
5.   King’s During Keynes’ Time


       Keynes was elected to a fellowship and appointed an Inspector of the Accounts

in 1909, followed by his election in 1912 to the Council, the governing body of King’s

College. He took an immediate interest in reforming the investment practices of King’s

with the Inspectors unprecedentedly recommending a change in the policy of placing

cash surpluses on deposit. However, the then bursars were unmoved and this policy

remained in place until just after World War I when he was appointed Second Bursar

and had primary responsibility for investments. From 1924, he was appointed First

Bursar and was entrusted with full discretion over investment policy until his death in

1946. His College fellows gave him a free hand in managing the endowment and there

seems little doubt that within the College his investment policy went unchallenged.

Indeed, his annual “Chancellor of the Exchequer” speech became a not-to-be-missed

fixture in the College calendar.


       Chambers, Dimson and Foo (forthcoming) document in considerable detail

Keynes’ investment approach and his trading record on behalf of King’s. While

Keynes’ investment performance was not as stellar as previously thought, nonetheless

the authors estimate that the King’s Discretionary Portfolio generated over the quarter

century to 1946 an annualised return of 16.0% compared to 10.4%, 6.8% and 7.1% for

the UK equity market, the Restricted Portfolio and UK government bonds respectively.

Notwithstanding the higher volatility from allocating to equities, the Sharpe ratio of the

Discretionary Portfolio at 0.73 exceeded that of the Restricted Portfolio at 0.57. Finally,

the Discretionary Portfolio generated a Jensen’s alpha of 7.7% with a very high

tracking error relative to the UK equity index of 13.9%. The time series tracking error

for contemporary US university endowment funds averaged 3.4% over the period

2002–07, according to Brown, Dimmock, Kang, and Weisbenner (2014). Indeed, the

                                          - 10 -
tracking error of the 95th percentile fund in the latter study still only reached 6.3%3. The

high tracking error of Keynes’ fund was in part attributable to his idiosyncratic stock

selection which we discuss further below.


          In the rest of this section, we draw on the main findings of Chambers, Dimson

and Foo (forthcoming) that are most relevant to a consideration of the long-run

management of the King’s endowment and of endowments in general.


5.1       The Shift into Equities


          Keynes exerted his influence on investment policy as soon as he had been

elected to College office by pushing for the disposal of one-third of the real estate

portfolio between 1920 and 1927 (Wilkinson, 1980: 85). At the same time, he

persuaded King’s to segregate a part of the real estate disposal proceeds into a

Discretionary Portfolio, free to invest in equities and unaffected by the Trustee Act

restrictions. Over the 1920s, the equity weighting of the Discretionary Portfolio

averaged 75%, over the 1930s 57% including an allocation to US common stocks, and

over 1940–46 73% (Panel A, Table 3). In contrast, the equity weighting of the

remaining Restricted Portfolio, which was subject to the Trustee Acts, averaged only

1% across the period 1921–46 and from 1933 onward there were no ordinary share

holdings.


          Other Oxbridge Colleges did not follow King’s into equities during Keynes’ time

in office. The largest Cambridge Colleges, Trinity and St. Johns, only amended their

statutes to permit equity investment after World War II (Moggridge, 1992: 352, Neild,

2008: 122). To the best of our knowledge and in contrast to Oxford and Cambridge,

    We are grateful to Stephen Dimmock for providing this estimate.


                                                  - 11 -
the ability of US universities to invest in common stocks was not restricted by

government legislation or university statute during this period. Panel A of Table 2

provides a comparison between King’s and three leading US endowments, Harvard,

Princeton and Yale. According to Foo (2014), Harvard’s total exposure to equities was

only 16% in the 1920s, doubling to 32% in the 1930s and averaged at 47% from 1940-

46. Princeton’s allocation to equities was even lower at 9% over the 1920s but

increased significantly to an average of 31% and 52% in the following two periods

respectively. Yale’s exposure to equities was 24%, 57% and 52%, respectively4.

Although the largest US university endowments had committed more to common

stocks relative to their smaller counterparts, this allocation on a historical cost-

weighted basis remained below 10% in the 1920s and only rose above 20% in the late

1930s (Goetzmann, Griswold, and Tseng, 2010). Their average total allocation to

equities as a proportion of total assets excluding real estate is shown in Panel B of

Table 2.


          In a similar fashion, major UK institutional investors such as pension funds,

investment trusts, and insurance companies largely eschewed equities in favour of

fixed income securities in this period (Burton and Corner, 1968; Hannah, 1986; Baker

and Collins, 2003).


          The impact of this switch from real estate into equities on King’s asset

allocation can be seen in Figure 2. By 1946, the year of Keynes’ death, the real estate

weighting had declined from above 80% just before Keynes became bursar to below

50% compared to common stocks now representing over 30% and preferred stocks

4
     Asset allocation stated at book value, except for Harvard at market value from 1941 onwards and
    Princeton from 1931 onwards. Figures exclude Real Estate investments to provide a comparable
    basis against the King’s endowment. The weightings are qualitatively similar if Real Estate
    investments are included.


                                                - 12 -
another 10% of the portfolio. Keynes moved his College from a centuries-long almost

total reliance on UK real estate into a more diversified position with a substantial

allocation to both UK and non-UK equities. We discuss the latter non-UK exposure in

Section 5.5.


       What led Keynes to undertake such a dramatic shift in asset allocation? First,

he believed the attractions of real estate were overstated. Hence, in 1938 he wrote a

memorandum to the Estates Committee and reflected on his period in charge of

managing the endowment. He stressed that the appearance of stability from

investments that are not marked to market – in King’s case, real estate – masked

volatility in the underlying investment. However, equally importantly Keynes wanted to

put money into equities. He explained this enthusiasm for equities a few years later

when reviewing Smith (1924), a US study of the attractions of investing in common

stocks.


5.2    The Attractions of Equity Investing


       In summarizing Smith (1924)’s findings, Keynes championed the virtues of US

common stocks as residual claims on industrial growth and foresaw the same potential

in UK ordinary shares as in US common stocks (Keynes, 1925). He went on to list the

attractions of equities as offering “an investment in real values” (ibid.) and an income

premium over bonds.


       During 1900–20, when the annualised inflation rate was 5.6%, UK equities

generated a negative annualized real return (–1.6%) and failed to substantiate

Keynes’ belief that they offered an investment in real values. However, they

subsequently provided an annualised real return of +8.3% over the period 1921–46

during which he moved King’s into equities and Britain experienced deflation (-1.1%).

                                         - 13 -
UK equities continued to generate strong real returns (+7.9%) over the remainder of

the century when annualised inflation ran at 6.1%.


          Further, Keynes was proved correct in his belief that his investment policy

would not have an adverse impact on endowment income (Chambers and Dimson,

2013). In making such a large allocation to equities, the King’s endowment did not give

up anything in terms of income compared to the yields available on bonds (Figure 3).5

According to Chambers, Dimson, and Foo (forthcoming), the College’s UK equity

portfolio provided an average dividend yield of 6.0 percent during 1921-29, which was

above the UK equity market dividend yield of 5.2% and income return on government

bonds of 4.6%. In the 1930s, the dividend yield of the College’s UK equity holdings

averaged 5.9%, higher than the 4.4% dividend yield on the UK equity market and the

3.4% income return on government bonds. During 1940–46, the College’s UK equity

holdings produced a dividend yield of 5.8%, again exceeding the UK equity market’s

4.0% dividend yield and the 3.0% income return on government bonds.


5.3       Change in Investment Approach


          In the period up to the early 1930s, Keynes’ approach is best characterised as

top-down or market timing as he believed that he had the ability to time moves into

and out of equities, bonds and cash. In the 1938 memorandum to his investment

committee, he reflected on this approach and confessed that:


              “We have not proved able to take much advantage of a general

          systematic movement out of and into ordinary shares …at different phases

          of the trade cycle”. (Moggridge, 1983, p.106)
5
     Data on property yields in this period are imperfectly documented. It is unclear as to whether
    appropriate maintenance costs have been deducted from income, and this obstructs making
    comparisons with dividend and bond yields.


                                                - 14 -
       Further, he also lamented the failure of this “credit-cycling” approach in an

accompanying note to Richard Kahn who was his student and subsequent colleague at

King’s, writing that:


            “…I have seen it tried by five different parties…over a period of nearly

       twenty years…I have not seen a single case of success…” (Moggridge,

       1983, p.100)


       The archival evidence suggests that he had changed his investment approach

by 1934. He appears to have abandoned the previous top-down approach in favour of

a bottom-up, stock-picking approach as he explained in a 1934 letter to the chairman

of Provincial Insurance:


            “As time goes on, I get more and more convinced that the right

       method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one

       thinks one knows something about ... there are seldom more than two or

       three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself

       entitled to put full confidence.”


       Woods (2013) argues that Keynes’ approach changed from being based on

‘speculation’ to one founded on ‘enterprise’, terms that Keynes himself used in

Chapter 12 of the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (Keynes,

1936). Evidence of this shift in investment approach can be seen in the fact that he

traded less in UK stocks, both ordinary and preference shares, in the Discretionary

Portfolio (Figure 4). Annual turnover dropped progressively through each decade and

approached levels characteristic of a patient buy-and-hold investor.


       To examine the impact of the change in investment approach, we undertake a

Sharpe (1992) returns-based style analysis of the UK discretionary portfolios. Keynes
                                           - 15 -
invested in bonds and cash in addition to equities and therefore the time-varying

exposure weights estimated by this method is preferable to a fixed benchmark return.

We estimate the style of the fund by regressing each month’s portfolio return against

five benchmark returns: UK equity index, UK government bond index, UK Treasury bill

returns, oil price returns and a tin-rubber price index. Oil and tin-rubber is included as

Keynes invested in commodity-linked stocks but gold is excluded as the price of gold

was fixed for most of this period. The estimation period uses a rolling forty-eight month

window centred on the estimation month, and we also impose a non-negative weight

restriction on all benchmarks as the portfolio did not have any short positions. We then

calculate the monthly selection return as the portfolio return minus the style return

estimated from the resulting weights above.


       We follow Chambers, Dimson and Foo (forthcoming) and partition the sample

into two periods before and after the financial year ending August 1932. In the period

up to August 1932, the average monthly selection return was 0.2% and not

significantly different from zero. However, the monthly selection return increased to

0.7% in the period post-August 1932 (significant at the 1% level). For robustness, we

also move the break-point to August 1931 and August 1933. In both cases, the pre-

break average return is not significantly different from zero whereas the post-break

average return is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. This break in

performance is consistent with other evidence documenting the improvement in his

stock trading, particularly the improved timing of his purchases in the 1930s and 1940s

compared to the 1920s (Chambers, Dimson and Foo, forthcoming).

5.4    Tilting to Value and Size


       King’s income did not suffer by moving into stocks. As documented in section

5.2, the margin of the dividend yield on King’s UK equity portfolio over the market yield

increased to 1.5% in the 1930s and 1.8% in the 1940s versus 0.8% in the 1920s. This

pattern reflects Keynes’ shift to picking value stocks with above average dividend

yields. Note that in all periods the average dividend yield for King’s includes non-

dividend paying security holdings, a reflection of Keynes’ investing in so-called

“recovery plays”.


       Since book values are unavailable on any consistent and reliable basis pre-

1946, we use dividend yield as our fundamental measure of firm value. Dimson, Nagel

and Quigley (2003) show that classifying UK equities by dividend yield produces very

similar value and growth portfolios to those based on classifying stocks by their

market-to-book ratio. On this basis, by tilting his equity portfolio towards higher yielding

stocks, we credit Keynes with exploiting the existence of a value premium in stocks

long before financial economists were to identify any such premium. In all three

periods in the UK, 1900-20, 1921-46 and 1947-2013 high yielding stocks have

outperformed low yielding stocks by 3.8%, 1.8% and 3.1% respectively.


       In a similar way, although Keynes held some large stocks such as Union

Corporation and Austin Motors, he generally tilted the King’s equity portfolio toward

small- and medium-sized stocks (Chambers and Dimson, 2013). In so doing, he again

identified in his investment actions the size premium available to patient long-term

investors long before Banz (1981) and Fama and French (1992) ever uncovered its

existence.




                                           - 17 -
5.5       International Diversification


          Keynes invested heavily in non-UK equities with substantial allocations to Asian

tin mining stocks in the 1920s and to South African gold stocks6 and US stocks in the

following decade (Figure 5). The non-UK allocation reached 75% of the portfolio in the

mid-1930s, a degree of international diversification that suggests Keynes exhibited a

weaker level of home-bias than that displayed by modern investors (see e.g. French

and Poterba, 1991, Lewis, 1999). Ahearne, Griever and Warnock (2004) estimate that

in the year 2000, foreign equities accounted for only 12% of US investors’ equities

portfolios and only 1% two decades earlier. Again, Kings and Keynes were not typical.

Leading US endowments such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton were almost

completely invested in their domestic market during Keynes’ time (Foo, 2014).


6.      King’s Investment Policy After Keynes


6.1       Asset Allocation


          The policy of switching the endowment into equities initiated by Keynes was

continued after his death, and through a combination of performance and additional,

modest property disposals the equity weight doubled, reaching a high point in 1968

of two-thirds of the endowment (Figure 2). The real estate and fixed income

weightings correspondingly declined to 21% and 12% respectively. By the late 1960s,

King’s endowment had surpassed St John’s and quite probably overtaken the richest

College, Trinity (Barter, 1995). No doubt buoyed by their continued good fortune,

disclosure in the investment reports regarding the composition and performance of

the security portfolio during this period remained clear and informative.

6
    These stocks were listed in London but their business operations were solely concentrated in Asia
    and South Africa respectively


                                                 - 18 -
      In the late 1960s investment policy underwent a major reversal as the College

reinvested in real estate, both commercial and industrial. The most significant

decision taken in the early 1970s was that to develop a piece of land, forming part of

its original endowment, in Blackfriars on the edge of the City of London in

partnership with British Rail. The impact on the endowment’s asset allocation was as

dramatic as the decision taken by Keynes half a century earlier. The real estate

weighting rose sharply from 23 per cent in 1971 to exceed 70 per cent in the early

1980s, forty percentage points of which was accounted for by the Blackfriars project

(Figure 2). The rationale behind this change in investment strategy is not disclosed

in the archival papers and remains unclear.


      The higher real estate allocation initially benefitted endowment performance

during the UK stock market crash of 1974. Indeed, King’s was able to sell this project

in 1986 for £10.5 million having invested a total of £4.5 million. However, over the

whole period from 1973-1986 UK equities still outperformed real estate by a

substantial margin of 4.1% annually.


      Following the disposal of their interest, King’s continued to invest in real

estate until, in 1995, the first formal investment policy was introduced and it was

decided to dispose of all real estate other than that around Cambridge (see Barter,

1995). The policy marked the return to a core reliance on equities with properties

limited to those which form the infrastructure of the College’s hostels in Cambridge

and a small amount of farmland on the outskirts.


6.2   Comparison with Other Cambridge Colleges


      Keynes’ revolutionary allocation to equities was in general not emulated by

other Cambridge Colleges until long after his death. Traditionally, their assets were

                                        - 19 -
largely invested in real estate (Acharya and Dimson, 2007). For example, Trinity, the

wealthiest College, had 83 per cent of its capital invested in real estate and only 8

per cent in equities in 1957 (Neild, 2008: 125). Today, King’s allocation to equities is

still substantially larger than the average Cambridge College allocation. In 2012, the

ten largest Cambridge College endowments,7 excluding King’s, allocated 35% to

equities and 38% to property, compared with King’s 64% in equities and 26% in

property.


          How should we view the relative impact of Keynes’ stewardship of the King’s

endowment in a long-run context? In the absence of reliable total return figures, we

draw on the findings of Neild (2008) and compare the endowment income of the

other two of the three largest Colleges of the late nineteenth century, namely, Trinity

and St. John’s. Combining the income of the three Colleges in 1871, Trinity’s income

was approximately 41% of the total with the rest split evenly between St John’s and

King’s. At the start of Keynes’ tenure as Bursar, Trinity’s share had increased to 48%

with St John’s maintaining its 30% share compared to the remaining 22% share of

King’s. However, King’s income, benefitting from the substantial allocation to

equities, had nearly drawn level with Trinity in the years immediately after Keynes’

death (Trinity and King’s commanded shares of 40% and 38% respectively). Since

the mid-twentieth century, Trinity has surged ahead thanks largely to two successful

real estate investments (Neild, 2008). In 2012, its investment income was

approximately three times that of St John’s and eleven times that of King’s.

7.      Keynes’ Legacy


          Under Keynes’ stewardship - a period which encompassed the Great

Depression and the Second World War - the Discretionary Portfolio of the King’s

endowment grew, including cash inflows, from just over £20,000 at the start of his

tenure to £820,000 upon his death twenty five years later in 1946. His investment

record at his College was all the more remarkable considering his many

achievements both as an academic and in public service. In contrast, Sir John

Bradfield, who also achieved remarkable success as senior bursar of Trinity College

between 1956 and 1992, was fully engaged with the responsibilities of managing his

College’s finances (Neild, 2008: 131).


          On his death, Keynes left his personal fortune amounting to £440,0008,

approximately £15 million at 2012 prices, to King’s. The bequest included financial

investments, art and valuable books and manuscripts. The art collection was valued

at £30,000 in 1946 upon his death (Keynes Picture Bequest, p.273), increasing to an

estimated £17 million in 1988 (ibid. p.387) and worth far more today (see Chambers,

Dimson, and Spaenjers, 2014).


          Keynes himself reflected on his period in charge of the King’s endowment in a

memorandum to the Estates Committee in 1938 and in other writings (see Holder

and Kent, 2011). Keynes’ revealing document provides four salutatory and lasting

lessons for modern-day investors with a long-term horizon on how to think about

managing their portfolios.



8
    According to Skidelsky (2005), Keynes was worth just under £480,000 and bequeathed £40,000 to
friends and relatives. The balance of this capital sum reverted to King’s upon the death of his widow.




                                                - 21 -
7.1    The Dangers of Market Timing


       As discussed above, Keynes radically moved away from a top-down market-

timing approach in the early 1930s. Later on in 1938, Keynes reflected on the

reasons for this shift:


           “[Earlier] I believed that profits could be made by… holding shares in

        slumps and disposing of them in booms. [But] there have been two

        occasions when the whole body of our holding of such investments has

        depreciated by 20 to 25 per cent within a few months and we have not

        been able to escape the movement…


           “As a result of these experiences I am clear that the idea of

        wholesale shifts is for various reasons impractical and indeed

        undesirable. Most of those who attempt it sell too late and buy too late,

        and do both too often, incurring heavy expenses and developing too

        unsettled and speculative a state of mind.” (Moggridge, 1983, p.166)


       Keynes had appreciated that market timing involves taking big bets on asset

class exposure. In contrast, bets on individual securities can to a greater extent

benefit from diversification. While researchers such as Bollerslev, Tauchen and Zhou

(2009) provide some justification for market timing based on variance risk, this is

short-term and would have been expensive to implement. The Shiller (2005) view

that markets over-react and are subject to persistent mispricing is closer to Keynes’

approach, but could not have been verified empirically during the period of Keynes’

bursarship, since long-term stock market data was unavailable to him. Keynes’

judgment on the dangers of market timing anticipated a consensus that was to

emerge decades later among academicians and investment professionals.

                                        - 22 -
7.2   The Need for a Long View


      Having decided to change his investment method, in 1938 Keynes explained

that he considered a patient buy-and-hold approach to be the best way to invest but

that this approach was challenging for most investment organizations to follow:


           “I believe now that successful investment depends on… a steadfast

      holding of these in fairly large units through thick and thin, perhaps for

      several years, until either they have fulfilled their promise or it is evident

      that they were purchased on a mistake; [and] a balanced investment

      position…


          “But it is true, unfortunately, that the modern organization of the

      capital market requires for the holder of quoted equities much more

      nerve, patience and fortitude than from the holder of wealth in other

      forms.” (Moggridge, 1983, p.166-107, 109)


      As Chambers, Dimson, and Ilmanen (2012) emphasize, a large, perpetual

endowment has a comparative advantage in buying for the long term, and in

providing liquidity to the market by avoiding pro-cyclical behavior. Such investors

should be able to exploit their comparative advantage in sticking to a well-considered

investment strategy around which a prior consensus in the investment committee

and within the investment organization has emerged.


      As such, they can avoid the need to react precipitously during market crises

by taking decisions “on the hoof”, which run counter to their long-term strategy.

Keynes eventually recognized the sense of this approach but not until he had had

time to reflect upon the events of 1929 and its aftermath. Along with most other

investors, he had failed to see the sharp falls in stocks in October 1929. For the next
                                         - 23 -
two years he rotated in and out of UK equities and bonds in an attempt to protect the

King’s portfolio during the ensuing economic downturn. This experience caused him to

reflect as follows:


            “I do not think it is the business, far less the duty, of an institutional

       or other serious investor to be constantly considering whether he should

       cut and run on a falling market, or to feel himself open to blame if shares

       depreciate on his hands. I would go much further than that. I should say

       that it is the duty of a serious investor to accept the depreciation of his

       holdings with equanimity and without reproaching himself. Any other

       policy is anti-social, destructive of confidence, and incompatible with the

       workings of the economic system.” (Keynes, 1938, p.38)


       Hence, when the UK and US markets again fell sharply in 1937-38, he stuck

with King’s equity positions. In the financial year ended August 1938, King’s

Discretionary Portfolio had underperformed the UK market by 13.9%. Keynes reduced

the turnover of the King’s equity portfolio from 26% to 9%. Similarly, having introduced

US common stocks into King’s portfolio in the early 1930s, he maintained his

commitment to US stocks through the market sell-off in 1937-38. Keynes was unable

to pursue the same course at the insurer National Mutual where he resigned as

chairman in 1938 following considerable disagreement over his investment policy.


       Unfortunately, these were lessons which King’s subsequently failed to heed.

Having invested the proceeds from the disposal of their stake in the Blackfriars real

estate development into US equities just during before the Wall Street crash of

October 1987, they sold them again immediately after the market fell sharply and

missed the subsequent recovery.


                                          - 24 -
7.3   The Importance of Liquidity


      Keynes expressed a clear view about the need to understand the true illiquid

nature of some assets. In his day, real estate was the main illiquid asset class and

he warned that:


          “Some Bursars will buy without a tremor unquoted and unmarketable

      investments in real estate which, if they had a selling quotation for

      immediate cash available at each Audit, would turn their hair grey. The

      fact that you do not [know] how much its ready money quotation

      fluctuates does not, as is commonly supposed, make an investment a

      safe one.” (Keynes, 1938, p.108)


      Keynes was warning his peers that the apparent low volatility of real estate

returns was not a true reflection of underlying returns when a genuine attempt is

made to mark these investments to market. Today private equity is somewhat

analogous to real estate in that investors need to be wary of receiving adequate

compensation for the illiquidity risk they take on. Hence, even investors with long

horizons need to be wary of an over-allocation to such illiquid assets, which can

compromise any shorter-term liquidity requirements (Ang, Papanikolaou and

Westerfield, forthcoming).


7.4   Active-Passive Asset Management


      Finally, Keynes was an extremely active investor who constructed equity

portfolios that exhibited high double-digit tracking error compared to the UK market.

Hence, he wrote:




                                         - 25 -
           “[My] theory of risk is that it is better to take a substantial holding of

       what one believes in than scatter holdings in fields where he has not the

       same assurance. But perhaps that is based on the delusion of

       possessing a worthwhile opinion on the matter.”


       However, he also acknowledged that a fully diversified approach may be more

suitable for investors who did not possess skill in equity investing, saying that:


            “The theory of scattering one’s investments over as many fields as

       possible might be the wisest plan on the assumption of comprehensive

       ignorance. Very likely that would be the safer assumption to make.”

       (Keynes, 1945)


       Hence, the alternative for many endowments and foundations with limited

time and resources to devote to asset management is to think hard about minimizing

management costs and to move towards a passive approach. As we saw when he

explained the reasons for his abandoning his top-down investment approach, even

Keynes had accepted that excessive transaction costs can eat into investment

returns.


8.   Conclusion


       Keynes was an innovative investor with an unconventional investment

approach. He had a substantial beneficial impact on King’s endowment. He shifted

King’s asset allocation away from an undiversified reliance upon UK real estate to a

diversified portfolio in which equities played a substantial role, despite the restrictions

of the Trustee Acts. In so doing, he enabled King’s to earn the risk premium on

equities available to investors with a long term horizon and pointed the way forward



                                          - 26 -
for subsequent bursars to follow. His stock selection also tilted the portfolio toward

value and small-capitalization firms, which gave further opportunity for King’s to earn

the risk premia associated with these two systematic risk factors.


      Furthermore, his experiences managing the King’s endowment during the

economic turbulence of the 1930s illustrate lessons still relevant to endowments and

foundations today. Keynes’ observations on investment spoke of the need to

understand illiquid assets and the need to tailor investment policy to reflect the

organization’s investment skills and resources. He pursued unconventional

strategies such as investments in commodities and currencies, again foreshadowing

his 21st-century counterparts. Most relevant to the subject of this volume, he had to

learn how to invest during financial crises. In 1929-30, he confronted the challenges

in pursuing a market-timing approach to investment. Thereafter, his switch to an

investment approach reflective of the natural advantages accruing to investors with a

long horizon allowed him to maintain his commitment to equities in 1937-38 when

prices fell sharply once more.

                                 Table 2: Allocation to Equities
Panel A provides the allocation to equities of the King’s College Discretionary
Portfolio, and Harvard University, Princeton University and Yale University
endowments (Source: Foo, 2013) spanning the period when Keynes managed the
King’s College endowment. The Harvard, Princeton and Yale allocations exclude
Real Estate investments to provide a comparable basis against King’s (see text for
full description). Panel B provides equivalent figures for US educational endowments
using data from Cain (1942) as quoted by Goetzmann, Griswold and Tseng (2010).



Panel A                              1920-29          1930-39        1940-46

               Figure 1: King’s Real Estate Portfolio at its Foundation

This map indicates the approximate location of the King’s estates endowed by Henry
VI as described in Saltmarsh (1958: 9, 10). Cambridgeshire is shown in light
gray and Oxfordshire is shown in dark gray.

             Figure 2: King’s Endowment Asset Allocation 1919-2013

Figure shows the proportion of the endowment held in real estate, fixed income,
preferred stock, common stock, alternative investments and cash. The value of real
estate holdings is estimated at £1 million in 1919 according to Wilkinson (1980: 85)
and major disposals are tracked over the following years to 1927. From 1928, the
College real estate portfolio is assumed to have fluctuated in line with the real estate
price appreciation index of Scott (1996) such that the valuation converges on the
College valuation of £1.2 million in 1966. Cash is only consistently disclosed from
1988 onwards. For the period 1973-78, the initial cash position was disclosed at
approximately £2 million and we assume it was drawn down to fund the Blackfriars
development over the following five years. (Source: King’s College, Cambridge)

The Discretionary Fund dividend yield is the total dividend income for the financial
year ended August divided by the market valuation of UK equities held in the
Discretionary Fund (Source: Chambers and Dimson, 2013). The UK market dividend
yield is the dividend yield on the DMS 100 index. The UK Consol yield is the running
yield on UK government perpetual bonds.

The regional allocation of the equity portfolio at market values is taken from King’s
investment reports and grouped into the United Kingdom, United States, Europe,
Asia and Other regions. In the 1930s and 1940s, Other is represented by Africa, and
in the late 20th and early 21st centuries by emerging markets and global equities.
