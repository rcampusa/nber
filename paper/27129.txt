International Equity and Debt Flows: Composition, Crisis, and Controls

                                         ABSTRACT

Standard models of capital flows to emerging market economies focus on debt flows and a
pecuniary externality. However, by offering better risk sharing, international equity flows can
render such externality unimportant, yet many economies fail to attract equity investment in a
large quantity. We propose a theory of endogenous composition of capital flows that highlights
two asymmetries. In our model, poor institutional quality leads to an inefficiently low share of
equity financing as well as an inefficiently high volume of total inflows. Somewhat surprisingly,
a social planner would often impose taxes on both equity and debt inflows. Our story differs in
important ways from an alternative narrative focusing on collateral constraint.

1      Introduction
Volatile international capital flows are recognized as a contributor to financial crises and
consumption volatility in emerging market economies. The literature has highlighted two
types of externalities in this context. First, when the economy faces an aggregate borrowing
constraint, private agents do not take into account a pecuniary externality that their indi-
vidual borrowing action creates for the value of the total collateral in the economy. This
causes them to over-borrow relative to what a social planner would prefer. When a nega-
tive shock is realized, the economy can contract unnecessarily, in the sense that an ex ante
tax on borrowing could correct the problem and raise the welfare (Lorenzoni (2008), Men-
doza (2010), Bianchi (2011), Benigno, Chen, Otrok, Rebucci, and Young (2013), Jeanne
and Korinek (2018) and Korinek (2018)). With the same pecuniary externality in the debt
market, a sunspot equilibrium can also feature swings between under-borrowing and over-
borrowing that can also produce sudden stops in capital flows (Schmitt-Groh´        e and Uribe
(forthcoming)). Second, in the presence of sticky wages or prices and a fixed exchange rate
regime, private agents' borrowing may not take into account an externality on the demand
side that can also trigger an inefficiently low level of output and employment. Again, a tax
on private sector borrowing may raise welfare (Farhi and Werning (2014, 2016), Korinek
and Simsek (2016) and Schmitt-Groh´      e and Uribe (2016)). In all such theories, the focus is
on international debt flows.
    International equity flows, however, are qualitatively different due to their intrinsically
better risk-sharing property. In particular, if equity financing is available, and international
investors are risk neutral (which is a common assumption in this literature), then the emerg-
ing market economies can in principle offload all of their risk to international investors.
The pecuniary externality would not matter since the emerging market economy that is fi-
nanced entirely by foreign equity investment would not run into the aggregate borrowing
constraint. The demand externality would not matter either since the effect of a negative
domestic shock would be fully borne by foreign equity investors.1 In both scenarios, the
optimal tax on capital flows is zero.
    Of course, a country's ability to obtain international equity financing varies greatly,
    1 Asdemonstrated in Appendix D, when the institutional quality is sufficiently good, the economy is
financed by equity flows only and offloads all the risks to international investors. As a result, shocks to
tradable output do not generate aggregate demand externality or inefficiency.


                                                    1
and many emerging market economies can be observed to take on a large quantity of debt
from the international capital market. The first objective of this paper is to understand
the cross-country variations in the composition of capital flows. We will propose a theory
in which a country's institutional quality will play a central role in the determination of
the composition. We will show that the share of equity financing in a country's external
liabilities tends to rise with the quality of the country's institutions. (Correspondingly, the
probability of a debt crisis declines with the institutional quality.)
     The second objective of the paper is to investigate the optimal structure of capital con-
trols in such an economy. One result that may be counter-intuitive at the first sight is that
the optimal regime typically features a positive tax on both equity and debt if the coun-
try's institutional quality is below some threshold. This is somewhat surprising because
we have just said that international equity financing has a desirable risk-sharing property,
and an economy that is financed entirely by equity investment achieves the first best. But
it is consistent with the common pattern in the data that many countries with restrictions
on cross-border debt flows also tend to have restrictions on cross-border equity flows. Our
theory will clarify the logic behind this seeming paradox.
     The attention to external capital structure is motivated in part by a recent literature
suggesting that the composition of capital inflows matters for the experience of countries
during global financial crises (see Forbes and Warnock (2012)). For example, countries
with a relatively high share of debt (as opposed to FDI or equity investment) fare worse
during financial crises (see Tong and Wei (2010)). In our model, the quality of domestic
institutions determines the share of equity in the country's total external liability, which
in turn determines the total volatility of capital flows. Countries with good institutional
quality (e.g., typical developed countries) can issue more equity-like securities and are
therefore less likely to run into sudden stop episodes. As a result, they have less need
to use capital controls to manage their capital flows. On the other hand, countries with
weaker public institutions (i.e., typical developing countries) need to rely more heavily on
debt instruments for financing and are more exposed to the risk of sudden stops. As a result,
capital controls are more necessary for them.
     If some external capital structure is riskier than others, why do so many countries live
with the unfavorable structure? One conjecture is that the quality of domestic institution
is an important determinant of the external capital structure (see Wei (2000) and Wei and

N OTE. This is a bin scatter plot of the average equity share (in % of total external liability) against the average
institutional quality during 1996-2015 across countries. The slope of the fitted line is 3.56 with a t-statistic at

Section 2 for additional regression results.


Zhou (2018)). Because equity investment does not have a pre-specified fixed payoff, the
payoff to equity investors is more dependent on legal and other institutions than debt con-
tract. In the language of Holmstrom (2015), debt is a lot less "information intensive," and
is much less demanding on the ability of international investors to collect, analyze, and un-
derstand information about the nature of the investment projects and the full payoff of the
underlying projects. When a country has an inadequate legal protection of investor rights,
foreign equity investors are more concerned than foreign debt investors. As a result, there
will be relatively less demand for equity-like securities from that country. This intuition
is reflected in a bin scatter plot in Figure 1, which shows a strongly positive relationship
across countries between the quality of a country's public institutions and the share of eq-
uity in its total external liability during 1996-2015. In a similar vein, Modigliani and Perotti
(2000) show that, in countries with weak investor protection, investment is more likely to
be financed by bank loans than by the equity market.
     As countries with poor domestic institutions are more likely to issue debt-like secu-
rities, they in turn are also more susceptible to sudden stop episodes. In other words, a
country's experience with sudden stops is not random. Instead, it is related to the external


                                                                                           3
capital structure and domestic institutional quality.2 The theory that we propose suggests
that a country's external capital structure would naturally vary by the stage of economic
development (as captured by the quality of public institution). As a country becomes more
developed (or sees improvement in its institutions), a greater share of its external liabili-
ties would feature risk sharing between the capital recipient country and the international
investors. Moreover, the optimal level of capital controls also declines.
    The parameter denoting the degree of collateral constraint is often thought of as rep-
resenting the level of financial development in the existing literature. It is natural to ask
whether cross-country variations in that parameter can generate the same patterns as our
institutional quality story. The short answer is no. While either a relaxed borrowing con-
straint or improved institutions result in fewer crises, the two are different in important
ways. First, while an improvement in institutions leads to a higher share of equity financ-
ing in a country's external liabilities, a relaxation of the collateral constraint leads to an
opposite change (i.e., a lower equity share). Second, while a higher institutional quality re-
duces the required level of capital controls needed to remove economic inefficiency, a more
relaxed collateral constraint leads to the opposite result. For example, Bianchi (2011), in
the simulation part of his model (Panel C of Figure 6), reports that the optimal average tax
on capital flows would increase as the collateral constraint on borrowing relaxes.
    Comparing middle-income with poor countries, or comparing developed with devel-
oping countries, there are differences in both the quality of public institutions that limit
expropriation risks and financial development that affects the extent of collateral constraint
in borrowing from the international debt market. Our evidence will suggest that, to under-
stand cross-country differences in the patterns of capital flows, differences in institutions
are more important than differences in collateral constraint.
    As a general implication, the optimal strategy for financial stability should depend on
a country's institutional quality. A higher quality of domestic institutions leads to a safer
external capital structure and therefore a higher level of financial stability. In this case,
there is no need for restrictions on cross-border capital flows. On the other hand, a poor
domestic institutional quality reduces the country's ability to issue equity-like securities
   2 Our theory also provides a partial explanation for a home bias in the equity market in emerging market

economies (see Coeurdacier and Rey (2013) for a survey). As the poor institutional quality repels foreign
investors from providing equity financing, the domestic agents have to hold more home equities in their
portfolio than a full risk-sharing model without expropriation risk would have predicted.


                                                    4
and this leads to more financial vulnerability. In this scenario, capital control policies are
needed to correct this inefficiency. These results suggest that if there is a way to improve a
country's domestic institutional quality, it is worth pursuing, because it allows the country
to fully utilize the benefits from financial globalization (see Kose, Prasad, Rogoff, and Wei
(2010)). If a country is unable to improve its institutional quality, capital controls can then
be used to correct this inefficiency and externality. The need for capital controls declines
as an economy matures in the form of improved institutions.
    Throughout the paper, we assume that a country's institutional quality is a deep pa-
rameter. The justification is that relative to policies on interest rate, tax rate, and capital
controls, a country's institutional quality is a much slower moving object and much harder
to change. In future work, one may also consider endogenous determination of institutional
quality, perhaps along the line of Jiao and Wei (2017).
    We discuss a number of extensions in Section 5. First, while there is only one type of
equity financing in the baseline model, we will consider foreign direct investment (with
control rights) and passive equity investment jointly. One new insight is that the ratio of
FDI to passive equity investment tends to decline as a country's institutional quality rises.
Second, while the baseline model assumes that a typical emerging market economy can
only borrow in a foreign currency (e.g., the US dollar), we will allow for endogenous
local-currency borrowing as well. One new insight is that the local-currency debt emerges
in equilibrium only when the capital recipient country has sufficiently good institutions.
Third, while the baseline model only features short-term debt (as in the existing literature on
the debt problems in emerging market economies), we will also consider debt of different
maturities. A key insight is that a long-term debt provides better risk-sharing but a country's
debt maturity structure depends on its institutional quality as well.
    We make two main contributions to the literature. First, we provide a theory of external
capital structure across countries (e.g., the relative importance of equity versus debt financ-
ing). Compared to the existing literature on capital flows to emerging market economies
(Bianchi (2011) and Korinek (2018)) which features only debt flows, we augment the menu
of capital flows by adding equity financing.3 The existing literature on over-borrowing can
be regarded as a special case of our theory where equity financing is ruled out by assump-
   3 Arce,Bengui, and Bianchi (2019) study the patterns of private debt flows and foreign exchange reserve
accumulation in a model similar to Bianchi (2011).



                                                    5
tion and debt is the only available funding source. Alternatively, this case can emerge
endogenously in our model when the domestic institutional quality is below some thresh-
old value. In general, however, both equity and debt financing co-exist in equilibrium.
Their relative importance across countries affects the relative financial stability.
    Second, we enrich the discussion on the design of capital controls. In the existing lit-
erature, the source of market inefficiency is either a pecuniary externality (see Lorenzoni
(2008), Jeanne and Korinek (2010), and D´     avila and Korinek (2018)) or an aggregate de-
mand externality (see Farhi and Werning (2016) and Korinek and Simsek (2016)), but these
papers do not investigate how the source of inefficiency may vary as a function of country
conditions. In our model, the quality of institutions plays the role of a deep parameter that
determines the external capital structure and correspondingly the optimal capital controls.
Because most of the literature has featured only debt, a capital control is simply a tax on
debt flows. For example, using a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equi-
librium (DSGE) framework, Bianchi (2011), Benigno et al. (2013), Jeanne and Korinek
(2018), Bianchi and Mendoza (2018), and Ma (2020) have computed such a tax. In com-
parison, by allowing for multiple forms of capital flows simultaneously, we have to specify
a structure of capital controls.4 As stated earlier, one somewhat surprising result is that
the social planner would often impose taxes on both equity and debt flows even though the
equity flows are supposed to have a better risk-sharing property. This is explained in our
model by a spillover of externality from the debt market to equity financing. We will show
that this prediction is borne out in the data as well: countries with controls on debt flows
often also have controls on equity flows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
model that rationalizes this pattern. In any case, the optimal capital controls should change
as a function of the institutional quality. Our theory also explains why capital controls are
more commonly observed for developing countries than for developed countries.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents three empirical patterns that mo-
tivate our research; Section 3 presents our benchmark model; Section 4 contrasts financial
development with institutional improvement; Section 5 presents several extensions; and
Section 6 concludes. Additional information is provided in online Appendices.
   4 Korinek (2018) provides a general framework to analyze the issuance of state-contingent security. He

points out that equity has less externality than debt. However, the two cases are analyzed separately. In this
paper, the composition of debt and equity is jointly determined in equilibrium.

2     Some Data Patterns
In this section, we distill some data patterns on international capital flows that will motivate
and guide our theory in the next section. We document three patterns in particular:

Fact 1. The share of equity financing in total external liability tends to rise with the strength
of a country's institutional quality. This is consistent with Figure 1. This relationship still
holds after we control from income, trade openness, and (domestic) financial development.

Fact 2. Financial crises are less frequent in countries with more equity financing in share
of their total external liability.

Fact 3. Countries with a lower quality of institutions tend to have more restrictions on both
cross-border equity flows and debt flows.
    To establish these facts, we combine data sets from five sources for 159 economies
during 1996-2015: the External Wealth of Nations (EWN) data set from Lane and Milesi-
Ferretti (2007), the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World Bank Insti-
tute, and data on sudden stop episodes from Korinek and Mendoza (2014), banking crises
from Laeven and Valencia (2013), and capital controls from Fern´      andez, Klein, Rebucci,
Schindler, and Uribe (2016). The details on the country lists and construction of variables
are given in Appendices A and B, respectively.
    Note that, in this section, equity financing refers to the sum of inward foreign direct
investment and inward portfolio equity investment. The difference between equity and
debt financing is what we wish to focus on in our baseline model in the next section.
However, we will consider various differentiation within the broad equity category (FDI
versus passive portfolio equity investment) and within the broad debt category (e.g., short-
term versus long-term debt) in Section 5.
    In Table 1, we examine the relationship between the equity share in a country's exter-
nal liability and its institutional quality in both panel regressions and a long-differencing
setting. In Panel A, we present panel regressions with random effects in column (1) and
country and year fixed effects in columns (2) and (3), respectively. On average, countries
with better institutions do exhibit a higher share of equity financing. Using the point esti-
mate in Column (2) as an illustration, an improvement in the institutional quality by one

N OTE. Dependent variable in Panel A is the equity share (portfolio equity and FDI) in total liability while the
independent variables are lagged by one year. Dependent in Panel B is the change of equity share (portfolio
equity and FDI) in total liability between 1997 and 2015 while the independent variable is the change between
1996 and 2014. All standard errors in reported in parentheses.  p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.


standard deviation is associated with a higher share of equity by 6.3 percentage points, or
around 31% of one standard deviation of the equity share in the sample.5 The coefficients
on the control variables are also consistent with the existing literature (see Wei and Zhou
(2018)). This positive relationship continues to be true when we include per capita GDP,
domestic credit to private sector as a share of GDP (a common measure of domestic finan-
cial development), and trade/GDP ratio (a common measure of trade openness). In fact, the
coefficient on institutional quality becomes larger by 33 percent.
    In Panel B, we examine the same relationship in a long-difference. That is, the depen-
dent variable is the change in a country's equity financing in total external liability from
1997 to 2015. The regressors are the changes in institutional quality, log GDP per capita,
domestic financial development, and trade openness, respectively, from 1996 to 2014. The

(by 0.92) is associated with an increase in the equity share by 6.90  0.92 = 6.3%, or 31% = 6.3/20.55 of
one standard deviation of the equity share across countries.

N OTE. All columns are based on panel Logit model. Dependent variable is the dummy for crises. Column
(1)-(4) use crises identified by Korinek and Mendoza (2014) while column (5)-(8) use crises identified by
Laeven and Valencia (2013). Standard errors are in parentheses.  p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.


long-differencing not only removes all time-invariant variables that may affect the equity
share but also allows the cumulative effect on equity share to reveal itself. With this spec-
ification, we continue to find a positive and statistically significant relationship between a
country's institutional quality and the equity financing in percent of its external liability.
The size of the point estimate on institutional quality becomes larger still than the corre-
sponding coefficient in the panel regressions.
    In Table 2, we examine the relationship between financial instability and the share of
equity financing in a country's external liabilities. We use two indicators of financial crises:
one for the presence of a banking crisis in a country-year as identified by Laeven and Va-
lencia (2013) and the other for the presence of a sudden stop episode in a country-year
as identified by Korinek and Mendoza (2014). The banking crisis indicator is constructed
to capture financial distress in the banking system while the sudden stop indicator is con-
structed to capture sharp reversals in current account balances.
    We use a panel Logit model to connect the probability of a crisis to the structure of
external liability, controlling for economic development, private credit as a share of GDP,
and time fixed effects. We also allow for either country fixed effects (in columns (2), (4),


                                                             9
(6), and (8)) or random effects (in columns (1), (3), (5), and (7)). Our results suggest that
a higher share of equity is associated with a reduced probability of both a banking crisis
and a sharp current account reversal and the effects are statistically significant. This result
is consistent with the existing literature such as Tong and Wei (2010). Using Column (4)
as an example, an increase in the equity share in total liability by 20 percentage points, or
roughly 1 standard deviation in the sample, is associated with a reduction in the incidence
of sudden stop crises by 1 percentage point. The negative association between the equity
share and the probability of a crisis holds for a variety of model specifications. This result
is also consistent with the literature that emphasizes a higher leverage as a predictor of
future crises (see Frankel and Rose (1996) and Adrian and Shin (2014) for example).
    In Table 3, we report the relationship between capital controls and institutional qual-
ity across countries. We focus on the restrictions imposed by country authorities on for-
eign purchases of domestic debt and equities, respectively (see Fern´     andez et al. (2016)).
Specifically, the restrictions on equity (EQ), collective investment securities (CI), deriva-
tives (DE) and direct investment (DI) are grouped into controls on equity financing, while
the restrictions on bonds with an original maturity of more than one year (BO), money
market instruments (MM), commercial credits (CC) and financial credits (FC) are grouped
into capital controls on debt financing. As the underlying measures are dummy indicators
for the absence or presence of restrictions, they do not measure the intensity of controls.
    We use a probit and logit model to conduct our analysis with country controls and time
fixed effects. We allow for either random or country fixed effects. As a robustness check,
we also present results with linear probability (OLS) regressions. In addition, we estimate
ordered Probit and Logit models. Across all these specifications, we see a clear negative
relationship between a country's quality of institutions and the presence of capital controls.
That is, a country is more likely to impose capital account restrictions when it has a poorer
institutional quality. This continues to be true after we control for economic development.
    It is noteworthy that the relationship holds for restrictions on both equity flows and debt
flows. That is, in countries with low-quality institutions, capital account restrictions tend to
be placed on both equity and debt flows. As we will note later, this might appear surprising
at the first look given the better risk sharing property of equity flows. We will provide a
way to understand this data pattern in our model.
    In sum, a country's institutional quality appears to be a robust predictor for its external

N OTE. Panels A and B present fixed effects and random effects models, respectively. The dependent variable
for Columns (1), (3), (5), (11), (13) and (15) is a dummy for the presence of restrictions on equity inflows,
and takes the value of one if a restriction is placed on any of the following: "shares or other securities
of a participating nature", "collective investment securities", "derivatives and other instruments" or "direct
investment". The dependent variable for Columns (2), (4), (6), (12), (14) and (16) is a dummy for restrictions
on debt inflows and takes the value of one if a restriction is placed on any of the following: "bonds or other
debt securities", "money market instruments", "commercial credits", or "financial credits", based on on the
information in Fern´andez et al. (2016). The dependent variable in both the ordered Probit and Logit models
(Columns (7)-(10) and (17)-(20)) is a count of the number of relevant asset categories that face restrictions.
The ordered probit (logit) in Panel A is estimated using STATA command probit (logit) and includes country
dummies. The ordered probit (logit) in Panel B uses STATA command xtprobit (xtlogit) without country
dummies. Standard errors clustered at country level are in parentheses.  p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.




                                                                 11
capital structure and for the presence of capital controls. These data patterns suggest that a
good institutional quality may enable a country to obtain more equity-like financing which
reduces the probability of crises. With more risk sharing and more financial stability, there
is less need for the country to impose capital controls.



3     Benchmark Model
We now develop a model of composition of capital flows that will match the salient em-
pirical patterns documented in the previous section. We start with a discussion on how
international equity and debt investors may have different degrees of vulnerability to insti-
tutional weakness of a capital-recipient country. Such difference can be represented by a
parameter in a three-period model that generalizes Bianchi (2011) and Korinek (2018). We
then characterize the optimal capital controls in such an economy.


3.1    Institutional Quality and Expropriation
Both equity and debt investors worry about expropriation risks in a capital recipient country.
If a domestic agent (firm) on the receiving side of international capital flows misrepresents
its true revenue or profit and gets away from it, it damages the interest of international
investors. In order to cheat a foreign debt holder out of its rightful payoff, the CEO of the
domestic firm needs to falsely declare a bankruptcy, which is likely to be very costly to the
borrower. In comparison, in order to cheat a foreign equity shareholder a part of his rightful
payoff, the domestic CEO only needs to overstate some of its cost items or understate some
of its revenue items, which are less costly to implement and harder to detect than a fake
bankruptcy. This suggests an important asymmetry between the two forms of capital flows:
equity investment is more vulnerable to expropriation risks than debt investment.
     To formalize this argument, let us consider a simple three-period endowment economy.
The time periods are denoted by t = 1, 2 and 3, respectively. There are two types of goods,
tradable and non-tradable goods. To simplify the analysis, the non-tradable consumption




                                             12
only appears in the second period.6 The preference of domestic agents is given by

                    T log CT 1 + E1 [T log CT 2 + N log CN 2 + T log CT 3 ]                                (1)

where  is the discount factor, T (N = 1 - T ) equals the share of tradable (non-tradable)
consumption in the total spending on consumption, and CT t (CN 2 ) is the tradable (non-
tradable) consumption at time t = 1, 2, 3 (time 2).

Income Stream There is no income in the first period, and the income streams in the last
two periods are given by {y2 , yN 2 , y3 }, respectively, where yt is the tradable income in pe-
riod t = 2, 3 and yN 2 is the non-tradable income in period 2. By construction, the first period
consumption has to be financed externally, by either selling an equity claim on the tradable
goods in the second and the third periods, selling a bond, or a combination of the two. (The
domestic agent does not buy foreign equity, but it is possible that she buy foreign bonds but
sells a domestic equity claim simultaneously.) We assume that only y2 is stochastic and is
uniformly distributed in U [y, y ¯] with y > 0.

Debt and Equity Contracts To facilitate analysis on expropriation risk, we assume that
there are two types of domestic agents with a unit measure: a representative household and
many CEOs. Each CEO manages one firm which generates an exogenous income stream
{y2 , yN 2 , y3 }. A CEO can issue either equity or debt contracts (or both) in the first period at
unit price of pe and pd respectively, and then distribute the money back to the household.
We assume that while the CEOs might cheat foreign investors, they cannot cheat domestic
households. Moreover, the CEOs are risk neutral even though the representative household
is risk averse. Letting the CEOs solve the same problem as the household will not alter the
qualitative results, but will add some expositional complications.
     Foreign investors purchase s shares of equity from the country at price pe s in t = 1 in
exchange for a future tradable income stream {sy2 , sy3 } in t = 2 and t = 3 respectively.7
By doing so, the equity contract provides risk-sharing between the home country and inter-
    6 The role of the non-tradable good is to provide a relative price between the two goods, which enters into

the collateral borrowing constraint. Since the borrowing constraint is assumed to only appear in period 2, it
is innocuous for the non-tradable good consumption to occur only in period 2.
    7 The equity contract is a claim only on the tradable income.




                                                     13
national investors. The international investors, however, can also purchase d units of debt
from the country with a price pd d at time t = 1 in exchange for a promised fixed payment
d at period 2. The prices of both equity and debt are in units of the tradable good. In the
intermediate period (t = 2), the country can also roll over its debt that will be repaid in
period t = 3. As will be explained below, this external financing at time 2 is subject to a
collateral borrowing constraint as in the literature (e.g. Korinek (2018)).

Financial Frictions Following Bianchi (2011) and Korinek (2018), There are frictions to
roll over the short-term debt in period 2. In particular, the domestic agent can only pledge
a fraction   [0, 1] of its period-2 income stream to international investors. Therefore, the
maximum amount of debt issued in period 2 cannot exceed the collateral value as follows.8

                                        d
                                            [ pyN 2 + (1 - s)y2 ]                                            (2)
                                       1+r

where d is the quantity of roll-over debt in period 2, r is a world risk-free rate, p is the
price of non-tradable good, and s  [0, 1] is the share issued in period 1.9
     The existence of a collateral borrowing constraint (2) has both positive and normative
implications. As suggested by the literature, it is a good way to capture financial crises (see
Mendoza (2010) and Bianchi (2011)). In this economy, a binding constraint is character-
ized as an occurrence of a crisis. It also provides a rationale for policy intervention since
it involves a pecuniary externality, which will be explained later (see Korinek (2018) and
D´ avila and Korinek (2018)).

Institutional Quality and Payoff Manipulation To capture the effect of institutional qual-
ity, we highlight possible manipulation of the security payoffs by domestic agents (the
CEOs) after issuance.10 For example, a CEO can pretend that his firm's income stream is
   8 Here  the domestic CEO can only pledge pyN 2 + (1 - s)y2 period-2 income stream after selling s share
of tradable income. Alternatively, if the CEOs can pledge all period-2 income pyN 2 + y2 , the results are
quantitatively similar.
    9 Following Korinek (2018), we use the actuarially fair price 1 for the roll-over debt in period 2. As will
                                                                    1+r
be shown later, this is consistent with the price of debt pd in period 1 when the bankruptcy cost is sufficiently
large. We do not differentiate between passive equity and FDI here and do not allow the agents to issue equity
in period 2. These assumptions will be relaxed in Section 5 and Online Appendix E, respectively.

only {(1 - )y2 , (1 - )y3 } with   [0, 1] when the true income stream is {y2 , y3 }. Such
a behavior is costly to the CEO as there is a chance that the international investors may
discover the true payoff and convince the local court to punish the CEO. In this case, the
CEO has to pay a fine of {y2 , y3 } to the investor with   (, 1]. We denote the prob-
ability that the international investors fail to recoup what they are due by q  [0, 1]. The
probability q reflects the inverse of the quality of domestic institution. With a higher value
of q, international investors will have greater difficulty not only to discover the misdeed of
the CEO, but also to find an impartial local court to win the case. A higher value of q can
also mean poorer corporate accounting standard or more corruptible local judges.
    The domestic CEO can also manipulate the payoff to international debt holders by
falsely claiming an inability to pay back the debt and declaring bankruptcy. We denote the
bankruptcy cost by B for each unit of debt contract. In bankruptcy, the CEO can reduce
each unit of debt contract's payment from 1 to 1 -  with   [0, 1]. Without loss of gen-
erality, we assume that the probability for the international debt holders to suffer a loss in
an event of bankruptcy is also given by 1 - q. Once they win in the court, the penalty on
the domestic CEO is given by  with   ( , 1].

International Investors There is a continuum of risk neutral international investors who
have access to a storage technology with a return r > 0. They will price the equity con-
tract and debt contract by taking into account the possibility of payoff manipulation in the
capital-recipient country. In particular, there will be a discount in the actuarially fair price
reflecting the degree of manipulation. For example, denote the actuarially fair prices for
                                         y+y

the decisions by the domestic agents to manipulate the equity or debt payoff, i.e. me = 1

Incentive to Manipulate Security Payoffs The domestic agent (CEO) chooses whether to
manipulate the securities' payoffs at the beginning of period 2. Intuitively, the net benefit
of manipulating equity payoff is the expected fraction of the present value of promised
cash flows, q - (1 - q). As long as the net benefit is non-negative, domestic agents find
it profitable to manipulate the equity payoff. However, the net benefit for manipulating
debt payoff, q - (1 - q) has to be higher than a bankruptcy cost B. Otherwise, it is not
worthwhile to manipulate debt payoffs. The decision is given by Proposition 1.

Proposition 1. The incentive for domestic agents to manipulate payoffs depends on pa-
rameter values. Specifically,

   · CEO's payoff from cheating equity investors are given by [q - (1 - q)]y1 . She
                                                                                     
      does not manipulate equity payoffs when q <       +   but does so when q       + .


   · CEO's payoff from cheating debt investors are given by q - (1 - q) - B. She does
                                                 +B                            +B
      not manipulate debt payoffs when q <       +    but does so when q       + .

    When the domestic institutional quality is high, the probability for investors to lose
(unfairly) in the court will be low, i.e. q is likely to be low. When it is sufficiently low such
                        
as below a threshold +    , domestic agents never manipulate equity payoff in equilibrium.
The equity is thus priced at its actuarially fair price. However, when the institutional quality
is not high enough, i.e. q is above the threshold, domestic agents will always manipulate
the equity payoffs. As a result, the equity is priced at a discount which reflects the degree
of domestic institutional quality. We can introduce a parameter   max{0, q - (1 - q)}


                                               16
to capture such a discount. In this case, equity price can be written as

                                           pe = (1 - )y1

    The difference in the incentives to manipulate equity and debt payoffs lies in the bankruptcy
cost B. For the domestic agents to manipulate debt payoffs, the probability q has to be a
                                                  +B
higher threshold than that for equity, i.e. q     + . Therefore, the debt price also reflects
the degree of domestic institutional quality. In our analysis, we focus on the case where
B >  , i.e. the bankruptcy cost is sufficiently high. In this case, domestic agents never find
it optimal to manipulate debt payoffs. In equilibrium, the price of debt is at its actuarially
                       1
fair level, i.e. pd = 1+ r.


Interpretation of Institutional Quality In our model,  captures the expected loss for
the equity payoffs in the perspective of international investors. Such a loss is generated
by the mis-behavior of domestic agents, such as firms (CEOs) or corruptible judges. This
sub-section can be viewed as a micro-foundation for  as an expropriation risk.
    If we think broadly,  as an expropriation risk can also result from actions by gov-
ernment officials. Good institutions can be thought of as strong restraint on expropriation
(the risk of having private property taken by the government or a well-connected private
party without compensation or a just clause). In either case, the level of expropriation risk
matters for the willingness of foreign investors to provide financing.
    In the following analysis, we use  as a measure for institutional quality and push the
manipulation of the security payoff into the background. This expropriation risk will be
reflected in the households' budget constraints as well. In each period, the CEOs make
the financing decision and then deliver the money receipts to domestic households. But if
a CEO decides to cheat on foreign investors, he would keep the stolen payoff rather than
delivering it to the household.11
    In this case, domestic agents sell equity s  [0, 1] and debt d to finance their period-
1 consumption CT 1 . At period 2, they decide their tradable consumption CT 2 and non-
tradable consumption CN 2 at the market price of non-tradable good p. Their income stream
  11 We make this assumption for simplicity. Alternatively, we can let the stolen payoff to be distributed to
the household in a lump-sum fashion. The results are similar.

is {y2 , yN 2 } in net of promised equity and debt repayment. They can also issue a roll-over
debt d to finance the difference subject to the collateral borrowing constraint. At time
3, private agents choose consumption CT 3 after repaying debt d and equity sy3 . All the
budget constraints for private agents are thus given by

                                                          d
                             CT 1 = sy1 (1 - ) +             ,                                  (3)

3.2    Competitive Equilibrium
The competitive equilibrium is defined as an allocation {s, d , d , CT 1 , CT 2 , CT 3 , CN 2 }, the
                                                                                          1
price of non-tradables p and the prices of equity and debt pe = (1 - )y1 , pd = 1+          r that
maximize the utility function (1) subject to the budget constraints, financial constraint (2)
and a market clearing condition for non-tradable good, i.e. CN 2 = yN 2 .


Period-2 Equilibrium

It is convenient to define a liquid net worth at the beginning of period 2 as m = (1 - s)y2 - d .
The competitive equilibrium can be solved using backward induction. The maximization
problem can be written as

           V (m, s, y2 ) =           max             T log CT 2 + N log CN 2 + T log CT 3 ,
                               CN 2 ,CT 2 ,CT 3 ,d
                               s.t. (2), (4), (5).

    Consistent with the existing literature, at the beginning of period 2, two states are pos-
sible, depending on the state variables {m, s, y2 }, where m = (1 - s)y2 - d is the net worth.
In the good state, the financial constraint is slack and the economy can borrow to smooth
consumption between periods 2 and 3. In the bad state, the financial constraint binds and
the economy cannot borrow enough to smooth consumption. The realization of a bad state
depends on the external financing decision in period 1.

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.1

    The intuition for Proposition 2 is consistent with the literature. When the country issues
too much debt d relative to its income stream share 1 - s, it has a lower net worth at the
beginning of the period. Compared to the previous literature, issuing too much equity s
can also lead to a lower net worth m. Yet, as will be shown later, equity issuance provides
better risk-sharing opportunities.


Period-1 Equilibrium: the Capital Structure

At time 1, the representative private agent chooses the capital structure {s, d } of its external
financing to solve the following problem.

                        W1 = max T log CT 1 + E1 [V (m, s, y2 )],
                               s[0,1],d
                                                     d
                        s.t. CT 1 = sy1 (1 - ) +        , m = (1 - s)y2 - d .
                                                    1+r

The first-order conditions for debt and equity are

                                  T
                                        = (1 + r)E1 [Vm ]

                                               19
where Vm = V (m  m
                  ,s,y2 )
                          and Vs = V (m
                                      s

                                               .
     The economic interpretation is straightforward. Private agents equate the marginal ben-
efit of debt (equity) with its marginal cost. To better understand the trade-off, we start
from an extreme case where there is no expropriation risk, i.e.  = 0. As we show below,
the country will choose to sell all of its future tradable income since equity allows full
risk-sharing between the country and international investors.
     Given that an equity contract allows the country to sell off all its (risky) income in
exchange for a certain income stream without any efficiency loss, the economy prefers to do
so. International investors are indifferent since they are risk-neutral. Therefore, the equity
contract can achieve full risk-sharing between the country and international investors. The
following proposition summarizes the intuition.

Proposition 3. When there is no expropriation risk, i.e.  = 0, the agent chooses (and
obtains) s = 1 in order to achieve full insurance, i.e. the first best allocation.

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.2.

    Proposition 3 suggests that the advantage of equity over debt financing is to provide bet-
ter risk-sharing. When there is no additional cost for equity issuance, the private agent in
the country prefers to issue equity over debt. However, in general, a positive expropriation
risk  > 0 raises the equity issuance cost. This presents a trade-off between equity and debt
financing. On the one hand, equity financing provides better risk-sharing; On the other
hand, the expropriation risk reduces the present value of future income stream, causing
investors to apply a discount to the equity price. The equilibrium structure of capital fi-
nancing reflects a balance between these two forces. The following proposition establishes
an equilibrium capital structure in this economy.

Proposition 4. The equilibrium capital structure reflects the degree of expropriation risk .
  12 The   optimality condition for equity is for the interior solution. For the corner solutions, we have
                                     T
                                          y1 (1 - ) - E1 [y2Vm - Vs ] > 0, if s = 1.

   1. When the quality is sufficiently good, i.e.  < , there will be only equity issuance.

   2. When the quality is sufficiently poor, i.e.  > ¯ , there will be only debt issuance.

   3. When   (, ¯ ), there will be a combination of equity and debt. As the cost of

      issuing equity  increases, the country chooses a higher level of debt d , a lower
                                                      d /(1+r)
      share of equity s, and a higher leverage,   s(1-)y1 +d /(1+r) . This will result with a more
      binding collateral constraint in the second period, i.e. a higher probability of crises.

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.3.


3.3    Optimal Capital Controls
In general, an economy with incomplete markets and pecuniary externalities may have
sub-optimal allocations (see Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986) and Greenwald and
Stiglitz (1986)). This opens up a role for policy intervention. The existence of pecuniary
externality in our context is due to the collateral borrowing constraint, resulting in a vicious
cycle of "lower price ­ more binding constraint ­ asset sale ­ lower price". Intuitively,
when the collateral constraint binds, the private agent cuts spending. With a decline in the
aggregate spending, the price of non-tradable goods falls, which leads to even lower income
of other agents, precipitating further deleveraging in the economy. In deciding how much
financing in Period 1 to obtain from international investors, private agents do not take into
account the effect of their actions on other agents' income and on this vicious cycle. In this
sense, they borrow too much (relative to a socially efficient level).
    What would a social planner do to correct this externality if she cannot remove collateral
constraint directly? She can internalize the general equilibrium effect through the price of
non-tradable good in the aggregate borrowing constraint. Below, we compare the allocation
chosen by the social planner with the one that arises from competitive equilibrium.

    It is straightforward to see that the competitive equilibrium displays constrained ineffi-
ciency as it differs from the allocation chosen by the social planner.

Proposition 5. The social planner values the net worth m = (1 - s)y2 - d more than private
               V SP (m,s,y2 )       V (m,s,y2 )
agents, i.e.        m           >      m        .

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.4.

    While the social planner cannot change the allocation in Period 2, she values the net
worth at the end of the first period more than the private agents, and would therefore choose
a lower level of external financing in Period 1. She would discourage the private agents
from issuing too much debt or equity since both create a pecuniary externality.

Proposition 6. There exists three thresholds for institutional quality as shown in Figure 2,
SP <  < ¯ SP

    · When the institutional quality is sufficiently good, i.e.  < SP , there will be only
      equity issuance and the economy is constrained efficient.

Proof. The proof of Proposition 6 is given in Appendix F.5.

    The optimal capital structure chosen by the social planner strikes a balance between
debt and equity financing. The key determinant is the expropriation risk, . The difference
between the private agents and the social planner depends on the size of the pecuniary
externality. To internalize the externality, the social planner does two things. First, she
chooses less external financing, resulting in a higher level of net worth in the second period.
Second, she chooses a less risky capital structure featuring a lower debt-to-equity ratio.


                                                        23
    Proposition 6 points to the importance of institutional quality. By reducing  below a
threshold  , the economy converges to a constrained efficient world. Even if the first-best
allocation cannot be achieved due to the distortions in equity issuance cost, the economy is
free of financial crises. On the other hand, if institutional reforms cannot be obtained in the
short run, optimal capital controls have to be deployed to reduce financial vulnerability.
    Implementation To implement the social planner's allocation, a Pigovian taxation ap-
proach can be deployed. In particular, the social planner would use a vector of capital
control taxes {s , d } on equity and debt, together with a lump-sum transfer T . The budget
constraint of the private agents changes into

                                                                 d
                       CT 1 = (1 - s ) s(1 - )y1 + 1 - d            +T
                                                                1+r

                           d
where T = s s(1 - )y1 + d 1+ r.


Proposition 7. To implement the social planner's allocation, a pair of capital control taxes
{s , d } on external equity and debt is needed:

                                         (1 + r)E µ T
                                                     N

                                   d =            T            >0

                                          CT 1 (1 - )y1


   Furthermore, d > s .

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.5.

    It may appear surprising that the optimal tax on equity is positive when institutional
quality is low even though equity financing provides better risk-sharing than debt. To see
the intuition, note that selling equity shares in Period 1 also lowers the net worth in period 2
(as m = (1 - s)y2 - d ). If there is a tax on debt but no tax on equity financing, the agents will
issue more equity than desired by the social planner. In other words, when the institutional
quality is low, the externality in the debt market financing spills over to equity financing.


                                               24
As the social planner values the end-of-period-1 net worth more than the private agents,
she corrects this spillover problem by imposing positive taxes on both equity and debt.
    We also note that the debt embeds more externality than equity financing. As a result,
the optimal policy features a higher tax rate on debt than on equity financing. This theoreti-
cal prediction is consistent with the practice of capital controls by the Brazilian government
during 2008-2013, when a higher tax on portfolio debt relative to that on equity was im-
posed. It is consistent with the "pecking order" theory of capital controls proposed by Ostry
et al. (2010), where controls are first imposed on foreign debt and then on portfolio equity
(see Forbes et al. (2016) and Chamon and Garcia (2016)).
    The capital control decision made by a bureaucrat can in principle differ from a social
planner's choice, but they would still be related. In the theory of tariff determination by
Grossman and Helpman (1994), the politician is assumed to maximize a convex combi-
nation of private benefits and social welfare. In a celebrated empirical estimation of the
Grossman and Helpman (1994) model, Goldberg and Maggi (1999) find that the empirical
weight on the social welfare is in excess of 90 per cent. Similar results are found for other
countries as well. If one were to write down a political economy model on capital control
taxes, the comparative statics with respect to institutional quality is likely to be similar to
the social planner's choice, even though the levels of the taxes would be different.



4     Versus : A Comparison by Examples
In our theory, the parameter for institutional quality, , plays a crucial role. It is natural
to wonder whether variations in another parameter, the degree of collateral constraint, ,
can generate the same predictions. Indeed, in the existing literature on sudden stops, one
is tempted to think that the main difference between developing and developed countries is
in the degree of collateral constraint.
     We now compare the two parameters by a series of simulations. We will show that
either an improvement in the institutional quality or a relaxation of the collateral constraint
will result in a lower probability of crises. However, there are two key differences. First,
while an improvement in institutions leads to a higher share of equity financing in a coun-
try's external liabilities, an opposite pattern is associated with a more relaxed collateral


                                              25
constraint. Second, while countries with better institutions need less capital control, coun-
tries with a more relaxed collateral constraint need more capital control. Bianchi (2011)
also reports that the optimal tax on capital flows becomes higher, in his simulation (Panel
C of Figure 6 in his paper), when a country's collateral constraint is relaxed.
    We conduct our simulations in two steps. First, we hold the degree of collateral con-
straint  constant (at the same benchmark value as in Bianchi (2011)) and vary the values
of . This is equivalent to numerically simulate the theoretical predictions from the previ-
ous section, with the aim of providing further intuition. Second, we re-do the exercise by
picking different values of . This can be understood as a numerical comparative statistics
exercise over changes in the degree of collateral constraint.


4.1    Variations in 
The parameter values chosen for the simulation exercises are reported in Table C.3. For
the share of tradable expenditure in total consumption spending, we choose 30% following
Bianchi (2011). The risk-free interest rate is chosen to be 5%, a common value used in
the literature. We assume that the discount rate, , is the inverse of 1 + r. The collateral
constraint value  is chosen to be 0.3 in the baseline case, meaning that the country can only
pledge 30% of its current income to international investors (see Ma (2020)). For period-
2 income y2 , we use a uniform distribution in U [y     ¯2 - , y¯2 + ], with a mean of y   ¯2 and 
governing its income risk. We vary the parameter denoting the expropriation risk, , to see
how it affects of the composition of capital flows and the gap in the allocations between the
competitive equilibrium and the social planner's choice.
    Figure 3 shows the optimal capital structure for different values of . A lower level
of  implies a better institutional quality. Consistent with our theoretical prediction, when
expropriation risk  increases, the debt d increases while the equity s decreases. When 
rises up to a certain level, i.e. ¯ CE in the competitive equilibrium (¯ SP in the social planner's
allocation), the cost of equity issuance is sufficiently high such that the share of equity goes
to zero. The level of total external financing CT 1 is also reduced with a higher  because
a higher equity issuance cost at the margin also increases the cost of debt financing and
thus the overall marginal cost of external financing. As a result, the economy takes on
more leverage with a higher . Such a riskier external capital structure leads to a higher

probability of crises as shown in Panel A of Figure 4.
    Relative to the private agents, the social planner chooses a lower level of external fi-
nancing (CT 1 ) and a safer capital structure, i.e. lower leverage. In particular, she chooses
a lower level of debt and a higher level of equity. Because the social planner prefers eq-
uity over debt, the threshold of the institutional quality above which the equity issuance
converges to zero is higher for the social planner than for the private agents, i.e. ¯ SP > ¯ CE .

N OTE. This figure shows the comparative statistics by varying institutional quality parameter , while keeping
the values of all other parameters the same as in Table C.3. For a given value of , we solve the model both
in competitive equilibrium and with the social planner. We plot the probability of crises (defined as the
frequency of binding constraint states in period 2) in Panel A and the welfare gains in Panel B (%, defined as
         SP   CE
100 eW -W - 1 , where W SP and W CE are the welfare functions under the social planner and competitive
equilibrium allocations, respectively).


    Due to a less leveraged capital structure, the economy chosen by the social planner is
safer than the one in the competitive equilibrium in terms of a lower probability of crises.
This means that a policy intervention can raise the welfare. The greater the expropria-
tion risk, , the greater the welfare gains from the intervention. This is because the over-
leveraging problem becomes more severe when the expropriation risk rises. Indeed, when
the expropriation risk exceeds some threshold i.e.   [     ¯ CE , ¯ SP ], the private agents would
find it too costly to issue equity and thus only issue debt in the competitive equilibrium.
For comparison, the social planner prefers equity over debt and would continue to choose
equity even with a higher equity issuance cost, . In this region, an increase in  narrows
the welfare gain because the cost of intervention increases with . To summarize, the wel-
fare gain from capital controls first increases with the extent of expropriation risk and then
declines after a turning point at ¯ CE .
    Figure 5 shows the effects of the taxes on external equity and debt. Consistent with the
theoretical prediction, both taxes increase with the expropriation risk  due to increased
inefficiency associated with the competitive-equilibrium capital structure. Furthermore,

N OTE. This figure shows the comparative statistics by varying institutional quality parameter  (while keep-
ing all other parameter values the same as in Table C.3). For a given value of , we solve the model in
competitive equilibrium and with the social planner, respectively. We plot the capital controls taxes defined
in Proposition 7 as a function of .


the optimal capital control tax on debt is larger in magnitude than that on equity. The
total capital control tax on external debt varies from 0 to 12%, which is comparable to the
numbers in Bianchi (2011). The optimal tax on external equity is between 0 to 4%, which
is consistent with the policy rates on portfolio equity observed empirically (see Forbes et al.
(2016) and Chamon and Garcia (2016)).


4.2     Variations in 
We now simulate comparative statics with respect to  by picking two different values of
 to describe two different degrees of collateral constraint. In Panels A, B and C of Figure
6, we present debt financing, equity financing and probability of crises as a function of 
under the two values of collateral constraint. The blue lines correspond to a looser collateral
constraint ( = 0.3) while the red lines correspond to a tighter borrowing constraint ( =
0.2). The solid lines describe the competitive equilibrium while the dashed lines correspond
to the social planner's choice. In panel D, the capital control taxes on debt (the solid
lines) and equity (the dashed lines) are presented for the case of a tight collateral constraint

N OTE. This figure shows the comparative statistics with respect to institutional quality parameter  under two
values  of collateral constraint.  = 0.2 (all the red lines) is a case of a relatively tight collateral constraint,
whereas  = 0.3 (all the blue lines) is a case of a less tight collateral constraint. For each value of  and , we
solve the model both in competitive equilibrium and with the social planner. We plot d , s, the probability of
crises (defined as the frequency of binding constraint states in period 2), and the optimal capital control taxes
(defined in Proposition 7) in Panels A, B, C, and D, respectively.


(marked in red when  = 0.2) and the case of a less tight collateral constraint (marked in
blue when  = 0.3), respectively.
    From the comparative analyses, one can observe an interesting pattern. With suffi-
ciently good institutions (i.e., a low value of ), the two different degrees of collateral con-
straint do not make a difference. Intuitively, when the institutional quality is high enough,

                                                         30
equity financing will be sufficiently high, and the collateral constraint does not bind. As a
result, there is no inefficiency for either value of , and there is no need for capital controls.
     When the institutional quality is below a threshold (i.e., when  is above a threshold),
the competitive equilibrium not only produces too much debt relative to the social optimum,
but the over-borrowing is more severe under a less tight collateral constraint (solid blue in
Panel A) than under a tighter collateral constraint (solid red in Panel A). This can be seen
most clearly in Panel D where the optimal tax on debt inflow is higher when the collateral
constraint is less tight (i.e., the solid blue line is above the solid red line).
     Unsurprisingly, a looser collateral constraint generates a lower equity share (i.e., the
solid blue line lies below the solid red line in Panel B) and a lower probability of crisis
(i.e., the solid blue is below the solid red line in Panel C). However, by reducing the cost of
debt financing, this at the margin increases debt and reduces equity in the first period.
     From Panel D, an interesting pattern is that the social planner would impose higher
taxes on both equity and debt when the collateral constraint is less tight. In other words, at
a given level of institutional quality  (when it is worse than a threshold), the competitive
equilibrium produces both more excess equity issuance and more excess borrowing when
the collateral constraint becomes looser, and the increases on these two margins call for an
increase in the capital control tax on both capital flows. Not only is there a spillover of the
externality from debt financing to equity financing, but the spillover could become worse
as the collateral constraint relaxes.
     Intuitively, the wedge between the social and private values of the end-of-period-one
wealth is related to the expected social cost of a financial crisis, which can be decomposed
into the probability of a crisis and the severity of a crisis. While a relaxation of the collateral
constraint (a higher ) lowers the probability of a crisis, it raises the leverage ex-ante and
raises the severity of a crisis. The net effect depends on the relative strength of the two
forces. In our simulations, for most values of , the second effect dominates.
     To summarize, financial development and institutional improvement are not equivalent
in terms of their effects on the composition of capital flows and on the wedge between the
social planner's choice and the competitive equilibrium. In Bianchi (2011)'s simulation
reported in Panel C of his Figure 6, the optimal tax on debt needs to go up rather than
down when the collateral constraint is relaxed. We find the same pattern in our simulation.
In addition, we find that the social planner would generally imposes a tax on both equity


                                                31
and debt flows, and the optimal levels of the two taxes tend to go up when the collateral
constraint is relaxed.
    Economic development may be associated with both a higher institutional quality and
a more relaxed collateral constraint. Since more developed countries tend to have both
a higher equity share in their external liabilities and fewer capital controls, such patterns
can be easily reconciled in our model with better institutional quality, but not with a more
relaxed collateral constraint. In other words, to understand cross-country differences in
capital flow composition and capital controls, institutional quality may be more important
than the degree of collateral constraint.



5     Model Extensions
We discuss three extensions to the baseline model. In the first one, we allow for both
passive equity and FDI. In the second one, we introduce long-term debt. In the third one,
we introduce local-currency debt. Both long-term debt and local-currency debt carry more
risk-sharing than short-term foreign-currency debt, and therefore share some similarities
with equity financing. But each is also different from equity financing in some ways.


5.1   Passive Equity Versus FDI
In our baseline model, we do not differentiate between passive equity and foreign direct
investment. The key difference between them lies in the control right. Presumably, if
foreign investors possess control right, it would reduce informational asymmetry between
the foreign investors and the domestic CEO and consequently make it more difficult for
the domestic CEO to cheat foreign investors. However, foreign investors would need to
set aside additional resources in order to conduct FDI and not all investors wish to do that.
For example, it may be expensive for an international hedge fund or mutual fund to hire
competent managers to be stationed in the host country. This might create a trade-off for
FDI investment versus passive equity investment as in Goldstein and Razin (2006). In this
section, we aim to incorporate such a tradeoff into our model.
    To guide our model development, we look at the relationship between FDI investment
and institutional quality in the data. Figure 7 reports the average relationship during 1996-

N OTE. This first figure shows the relationship between FDI share (% in total equity liability) and domestic
institutional quality during 1996-2015. Each dot represents a country's average FDI share and average quality
measure during this period. The second figure is a bin scatter plot version of the first figure.


2015. Clearly, one can see that FDI shares in total equity liability falls with institutional
quality. This can be interpreted as evidence that asymmetric information and moral hazard
by domestic agents are relieved by improvement in institutional quality. Therefore, the
benefit from obtaining a control right through FDI becomes relatively less important.
     To capture this idea, we assume that foreign direct investment requires a fixed cost
ci y1 with ci  [0, 1] for an investor i. Depending on the cost parameter ci , investors will
decide on either passive equity investment or FDI so as to maximize the expected payoff.
Denote the total units of equity (passive equity and FDI) as s  [0, 1], of which the share
of passive equity is denoted as   [0, 1]. The domestic household decides to sell passive
equity at price pe and FDI at price p f . The bond can be sold at price pd as before. In this
environment, the period-1 budget constraint is given by

                                                                                           CT 1 = pd d + s[ pe  + p f (1 - )]                                                                                                     (6)

    We need to work out { pd , pe , p f } in equilibrium. Similar to our benchmark model, we
will assume that the bankruptcy cost is high enough such that domestic CEO never cheats
                                             1
on debt investors, which implies pd = 1+       r . For the prices of FDI and passive equity, we
will impose equilibrium conditions. Define the marginal international investor with c   ¯ as the



                                                                                                                                   33
one who is indifferent between FDI and passive equity investment. By definition,

                                   (1 - )y1 - pe = y1 - ( p f + cy
                                                                ¯ 1)

Therefore,
                                                    pe - p f
                                           ¯ = +
                                           c                                               (7)
                                                       y1
    From this condition, one can see that investors with ci > c
                                                              ¯ choose passive equity over
FDI while the rest chooses FDI over equity. Therefore, the share of FDI investors is given
by c¯. In equilibrium,  = 1 - c   ¯. Moreover, the prices of FDI and equity should make
investors to earn zero profit ex ante. That is

                              1                               ¯
                                                              c
                    0=            [(1 - )y1 - pe ]dci +           (y1 - ci y1 - p f )dci   (8)
                          ¯
                          c                               0

     Given this equilibrium condition, one can show that pe = p f . We can prove this by
contradiction. If pe > p f , the domestic agents will prefer passive equity (see equation (6)),
i.e.  = 1 and c  ¯ = 0. However, when pe > p f and c   ¯ >   0. By the same argument, one
can show that pe < p f cannot hold in equilibrium. With the zero-profit condition, one can
                                                     -)2
solve the price of equity given by pe = p f = 1+(1  2    y1 .
     With this simple modification, this new model preserves the key insight from the base-
line model while matching data pattern on the FDI share in total equity liability. To see
this, the share of FDI in total equity financing is given by c¯ = . Therefore, the FDI share
in total equity falls with a lower value of , i.e. a better institutional quality. Moreover,
there is a linear transformation between this new model and our baseline model. One can
                   -)
redefine   (22         and then pe = (1 -  )y1 . In such a scenario, all the analysis in the
baseline model carries over to the new framework.


5.2    Long-term Debt
Long-term debt could also provide better risk-sharing than short-term debt. For example,
one can introduce a long-term debt D with a promised return (1 + r)2 at period 3 in addi-
tion to the short-term debt d at period 1. If there were no additional cost associated with


                                                  34
the long-term debt, the economy would strictly prefer long-term debt to short-term debt
because long-term debt avoids the binding constraint in the second period. To be more
realistic, we assume that institutional quality also affects the issuance of long-term debt
as in Wei and Zhou (2018). Specifically, long-term debt investors face a "dilution risk" in
countries with a weak institutional environment -- the CEO in the capital recipient country
may issue additional short term debt in period 2 before the long-term debt matures in pe-
riod 3. As the additional short-term debt dilutes the expected payoff to long-term debt, the
long-term debt investors may ask the firm not to issue additional short-term debt or make
the long-term debt senior to any new short-term debt. However, the ability to enforce such
covenant depends on the capital recipient country's institutional quality.
    The budget constraints in an economy with long-term debt can be written as

                                        d              D
                              CT 1 =       + (1 - )
                                       1+r          (1 + r)2
                                                                 d
                              pCN 2 + CT 2 = y2 - d + pyN 2 +
                                                                1+r
                              CT 3 = y3 - d - D

The long-term bond provides better risk-sharing than the short-term bond since it avoids
the costly binding financial constraint in the second period. However, the long-term bond
holder is vulnerable to an expropriation (dilution) risk. The equilibrium strikes a balance
between these two. Due to the same pecuniary externality as in the baseline model, the
economy displays an over-borrowing problem that applies only to the short-term bond.
The social planner uses capital controls to correct the problem. The following proposition
summarizes the key results.

Proposition 8. When the economy can issue both long-term and short-term debt, the com-
petitive equilibrium features a combination of both whose ratio depends on the institutional
quality . Specifically, there exists two thresholds {, ¯ } such that a combination of short-

term and long-term debt exists when   (, ¯ ). When the institutional quality is high

enough, i.e.  < , the economy uses only long-term debt. On the other extreme, when the
institutional quality is sufficiently low, i.e.  > ¯ , there is only short-term debt in equilib-


                                              35
rium. In this economy, pecuniary externality only affects the short-term debt. The social
planner would impose a tax on short-term borrowing to correct the overborrowing problem.

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.6.

    As in our benchmark model with equity and short-term debt, the combination of long-
term and short-term debt depends ultimately on the degree of institutional quality. In fact,
in our setup, the long-term debt is better than equity since its issuance is not affected by the
pecuniary externality associated with short-term debt. However, this is due to the assump-
tion that the collateral constraint only shows up in the second period and the long-term debt
matures in the last period.
    In general, the long-term debt can also be affected by a pecuniary externality if a col-
lateral constraint exists in the period when the long-term debt matures. In that case, equity
financing likely still dominates the long-term debt other things equal since it provides more
risk-sharing. In other words, in a model with long-term debt, short-term debt, and eq-
uity, the equilibrium proportions of the three securities depend on how institutional quality
affects their respective prices.


5.3     Local-Currency Debt

debt l in period 1.13 As in the benchmark economy, the dollar-denominated debt has a

promised return of world interest rate r and is thus priced at 1+     r . The return on local-
currency debt is expressed in terms of units of tradable good and denoted by . Since
international investors are risk-neutral, a no-arbitrage condition requires the following

                                              E [] = 1 + r
  13 While  we could introduce local-currency debt in period 2, it would add no new insight. Without uncer-
tainty in period 3, the local-currency debt and dollar-denominated debt would have been perfect substitutes
(see Korinek (2009)).

Since return  depends on the realized real exchange rate p in period 2, it implies that

                                             p
                                       =          (1 + r)

    If the local-currency debt l could be issued without additional cost, the country would
prefer this due to its better risk-sharing property. It has been observed that developing
countries are usually not able to issue local-currency debt to international investors -- a
phenomenon labeled as the "original sin" by Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999). A possi-
ble explanation is an inability of these countries to credibly commit not to use inflation to
expropriate the holders of local-currency debt in economic downturns (see a formulation
of the idea by Engel and Park (2018)). It is reasonable to assume that those countries with
poorer institutional quality are less able to commit to price stability in their monetary pol-
icy. A hallmark for poor public institutions is excessive discretionary power by government
officials and relatively few constraints on their power. These same features also likely to
prevent their central banks from making credible commitments in the conduct of monetary
policy. As a consequence, their local-currency debt will be discounted more by interna-
tional investors. With a slight abuse of notations, we capture the extent of the discount by
. Given this structure, the budget constraints in periods 1 and 2 become

   The equilibrium configuration of debt can be summarized by the following proposition.

Proposition 9. When the economy can issue both dollar-denominated and local-currency
debt, their equilibrium combination depends on the value of institutional quality  relative
to two threshold levels, {, ¯ }. When the institutional quality is good enough, i.e.  < ,

there is only local-currency debt. When the institutional quality is poor enough, i.e.  > ¯,

there is only dollar debt. When   (, ¯ ), there is a mixture of both types of debt.

Proof. The proof is given in Appendix F.7.

Social Planner with Commitment

A pecuniary externality in this economy calls for policy intervention. In particular, the
social planner internalizes the general equilibrium effect through real exchange rate p. Note
that the policy intervention itself also faces a commitment issue. Since the payoff for the
                                       p
local-currency debt  is given by E [    p] (1 + r ), if the planner could commit in Period-1 to
a consumption profile CT 2 , it can change the payoff structure across states in period 2,
which ultimately affects period-1 consumption. However, in period 2, the planner has an
incentive to deviate from her original plan when a particular state is actually materialized.
We assume that the social planner can commit. Her problem is given below.

Proposition 10. A social planner with commitment chooses a different allocation from the
private agents. To correct the inefficiency, three capital control taxes are needed on period-1
dollar debt and local-currency debt {d , l } and on period-2 dollar debt d .

Proof. Proof is given in Appendix F.7

    Since there are two types of inefficiencies in the competitive equilibrium, it can produce
either over-borrowing or under-borrowing relative to the social planner's solution. The ex-
act parameter values matter. Nevertheless, capital controls can be put in place to implement
the optimal allocation under commitment.


A Government's Solution

A government that sees the market failure in the decentralized equilibrium may wish to
intervene. However, a government's ability to commit and hence its ability to replicate the
social planner's solution cannot be taken for granted. We consider the case of a government
whose ability to commit depends on the institutional quality. Poorer institutional quality is
assumed to imply a weaker commitment ability. To capture such a distortion, we introduce
a welfare loss related to , (), and define a government's problem as follows.

                                   V B () = V C () - ()

    The desirability of the capital controls can be ascertained by comparing the welfare
from the bureaucratic solution V B () with the welfare in the competitive equilibrium. Only
when the former is larger than the latter would it be desirable to impose capital controls.
Otherwise, the welfare loss from weak commitment () could overwhelm the gains from
capital controls. In short, the institutional quality matters for the type of capital controls
-- not only through its impact on the price of local-currency debt (as in our benchmark
economy) but also through its impact on the commitment ability of the government.
    To summarize, local-currency debt provides better risk-sharing than dollar debt. Similar
to equity issuance, its cost depends on the quality of institutions. Therefore, the equilibrium
composition of the securities depends on the effect of institutional quality on their costs.
A difference between local-currency debt and equity is that the former involves a commit-
ment problem, which depends on the institutional quality. In general, local-currency debt
does not dominate equity financing since correcting the inefficiency in local-currency debt
requires the government to have a strong commitment power.

6    Conclusion
This paper provides a tractable framework to study the role of institutional quality in de-
termining both a country's external capital structure and its optimal capital controls. We
articulate two forms of asymmetries between equity and debt, and between international
investors and emerging market economies. The first asymmetry is that, from the viewpoint
of a capital recipient country, equity financing provides more sharing of the real-side risks
than debt financing. This means that the capital recipient country prefers equity financing
to debt financing, other things equal. The second asymmetry is that, from the viewpoint
of international investors, equity financing is more vulnerable to expropriation risks in a
capital recipient country than debt financing. This means that international investors are
more willing to offer debt financing than equity financing to a country with a high level
of expropriation risk. The equilibrium composition of capital inflows and the equilibrium
likelihood of an economic crisis are both determined by the capital recipient country's in-
stitutional quality (among other factors). As a consequence, a country's need to impose
capital controls to correct the inefficiency depends on the quality of its institutions.
    Our story can be compared with an alternative narrative that focuses on cross-country
differences in financial development. While either a relaxation of collateral constraint or
an improvement in the institutional quality can reduce the probability of a crisis, there are
important differences. First, while a more relaxed borrowing constraint tends to reduce
the ratio of equity to debt financing, better institutions would produce an opposite change.
Second, while a more relaxed borrowing constraint tends to lead to a higher capital control
tax, better institutions would reduce capital controls.
    Our paper has implications for corrective measures. The best action to correct pecu-
niary externality is reforms that raise institutional quality. Better quality increases both
financial stability and economic efficiency simultaneously. The optimal capital controls
are a second-best policy to be used when institutional reform is not attainable. The case for
capital controls weakens endogenously with an improvement in the quality of institutions.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze optimal capital controls
in a framework with an endogenous capital structure. Besides equity financing, we have
considered several extensions by allowing for other securities that also have (partial) risk-
sharing properties, such as local-currency debt and long-maturity debt. But more can be

it could be interesting to embed our setup in a DSGE framework as in Bianchi (2011) and
Jeanne and Korinek (2018). In addition, our formulation may be used to study pro-cyclical
leverage ratios and the corresponding optimal policies.

B      Data Source (online only)
We combine five data sources: the External Wealth of Nations (EWN) data set from Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti (2007), the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World
Bank Institute, sudden stop episodes from Korinek and Mendoza (2014), banking crises
from Laeven and Valencia (2013), and capital controls from Fern´
                                                               andez et al. (2016).

External Capital Structure The EWN data set provides detailed information on the ex-
ternal liability structure for most countries during 1970­2015. To construct the share of
equity in total liability, we use the sum of portfolio equity liabilities (stock) and FDI liabil-
ity (stock) divided by total liabilities.

Institutional Quality The WGI database provides six measures of government institu-
tional quality for most World Bank member countries from 1996­2017.14 They are: Con-
trol of Corruption (CC), Government Effectiveness (GE), Political Stability and Absence
of Violence/Terrorism (PS), Rule of Law (PL), Regulatory Quality (RQ) and Voice and
Accountability (VA). Each index is constructed in units of a standard normal distribution,
i.e. ranging from -2.5 to 2.5, where a higher value means a higher quality institution. All
six measures are highly correlated with each other as shown in Table C.2. Furthermore,
the cross country ranking is stable over time. Following Wei and Zhou (2018), we use the
simple average of the six measures as our proxy for institutional quality.

Probability of Crises We use two measures. The first is an indicator of banking crises
proposed by Laeven and Valencia (2013). The second is an indicator of the sudden stop
episodes identified by Korinek and Mendoza (2014), who have extended Calvo et al. (2006)
by examining episodes with a capital flow reversal and a sharp increase in the aggregate
EMBI spread for emerging economies or VIX for advanced economies.

Capital Controls Measure We use capital controls data constructed by Fern´        andez et al.
(2016) that is based on the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions (AREAER). The AREAER contains descriptions and summaries of de jure
restrictions in each of the IMF member countries.15 Fern´    andez et al. (2016) translate the
narrative in the AREAER database into a 0/1 qualitative indicator denoting the absence (0)
or presence (1) of controls. To proxy for restrictions on foreign purchases by non-residents,
we use the measure for "purchase locally by non-residents."
  14 For three years with missing data, i.e. 1997, 1999 and 2001, we linearly interpolate the missing data.
  15 There  are 10 asset categories in the data set, including equity (EQ), bonds with an original maturity of
more than one year (BO), money market instruments (MM), collective investment securities such as mutual
funds and investment trusts (CI), derivatives (DE), commercial credits (CC), financial credits (FC), guaran-
tees, sureties and financial back-up facilities (GS), direct investment (DI), and real estate transactions (RE).


                                                     A.2
    Our sample consists of 159 economies (Appendix A) during 1996-2015. The summary
statistics are in Appendix Table C.1. The variable construction is given below:

Equity (% of total liabilities) is constructed as the ratio of the sum of portfolio equity
liabilities and FDI liabilities over total liabilities, based on Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007).

Institutional Quality is the average of the six Worldwide Governance Indicators from the
World Bank Institute.

Sudden Stop Indicator is from Korinek and Mendoza (2014).

Systemic Banking Crises Indicator is from Laeven and Valencia (2013).

GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$), Domestic Private Credit (in % of GDP), and
Trade/GDP are from the World Development Indicators (WDI).

Capital Control measures are from Fern´
                                      andez et al. (2016).

D     Aggregate Demand Externality (online only)
This appendix uses a three-period model to discuss how the insight on an endogenous com-
position of capital flows affects the aggregate demand externality emphasized by Schmitt-
Groh´  e and Uribe (2016). The aggregate demand externality emerges from a combination
of a fixed exchange rate regime and a downward rigidity with nominal wage.

   The economy features two types of goods, tradable and non-tradable. For simplicity,
non-tradable consumption appears only in the first two periods. The preference of a repre-
sentative agent is given by

              E log C1 +  log C2 + 2 T log CT 3 , with Ct = CT
                                                             T N
                                                               t CNt , for t = 1, 2

where  is the discount rate, T (N = 1 - T ) equals to the share of tradable (non-tradable)
consumption in the total spending, and CT t (CNt ) is the tradable consumption.

Income Stream As in the benchmark model, the tradable income stream is assumed to be
exogenous and given by {yT 1 = 0, yT 2 , yT 3 }. The only source of risk is from yT 2 which is
uniformly distributed from U [y, y
                                 ¯].

Non-tradable sector The non-tradable income is endogenous, given by yNt = zt ht , where
zt is the level of TFP in the non-tradable sector, ht is the labor demand and   (0, 1) is
a parameter in the production. A non-tradable sector firm chooses labor ht for a given
(nominal) wage Wt and (nominal) non-tradable price PNt to maximize its profit.
     Following Schmitt-Groh´ e and Uribe (2016), we assume that Wt  Wt -1 , with   0
denoting the degree of nominal rigidity. As the past wage puts a floor on feasible wage
adjustment, a representative firm's optimization problem in periods 1 and 2 is given by

                              t = max PNt yNt - Wt ht , s.t. Wt  Wt -1
                                      ht




                                                     A.4
   The optimality condition implies that

                                           PNt zt ht-1 = Wt

   The representative household is assumed to supply labor inelastically. The total labor
supply is bounded by the labor endowment h ¯ , i.e. ht  h
                                                        ¯ . As long as Wt  Wt -1 does
not bind, the economy features full employment in the non-tradable sector and ht = h   ¯.
Otherwise, there is involuntary unemployment. This implies
                                                               1

                                       (Wt - Wt -1 )(ht - h

    The representative domestic agent can issue one-period debt d with a promised return
of 1 + r, or sell s shares of equity claim on tradable income at price pe at period 1, with
                          y+y
                            ¯ yT 3

pe = (1 - )y1 and y1        1+r        . In period 2, he can issue debt d to smooth consumption.

   The budget constraints for the domestic agent in the three periods are given by

                                                               d

                                                                                 d
              PN 2CN 2 + PT 2CT 2 = W2 h2 + 2 + PT 2 (1 - s)yT 2 - E2 d + E2        ,
                                                                                1+r
              PT 3CT 3 = PT 3 (1 - s)yT 3 - E3 d


where Et denotes the nominal exchange rate and PT t is the nominal price of tradable good.
For tradable goods, we assume that the law of one price holds:
                                                        
                                             PT t = Et PT t

              = 1, we obtain the following
Normalizing PT t

                                               PT t = Et

   Assume that W0 is low enough such that the wage constraint does not bind in period 1.
The constraint may bind in period 2 if there is an unfavorable realization of the tradable
income in that period. We focus on the case of a fixed exchange rate as in Schmitt-Groh´ e

agents do not take into account the general equilibrium effect through w1 whereas the so-
cial planner does. In that case, the allocations under a competitive equilibrium differs from
that chosen by a social planner.

Competitive Equilibrium
We solve for the competitive equilibrium backwards from period 2. There are two states
of world at period 2, one with a binding wage constraint and the other with a slack wage

smoothing requires that CT 2 =         1+            . The amount of tradable consumption (ag-
gregate demand) also implies that the maximum labor demand given the binding wage
constraint is h ^ 2 = N CT 2 . Clearly, when h     ^2 > h¯ , the higher aggregate demand needs
                      w1 T
more labor that exceeds the maximum amount of labor in the economy. In equilibrium, the
nominal wage will be higher than the lower bound w1 and there is full employment. When
^2 < h
h     ¯ , the aggregate demand in the economy is insufficient to absorb full employment and
there will be involuntary unemployed labor. The key friction is the wage constraint that
prevents a fall in nominal wage as to stimulate aggregate demand.

    When  = 0 and pe = y1 , the equilibrium features equity flow only, i.e. s = 1. To see
this, we note the following:

    Therefore, the domestic agents issue only equity when  = 0. By doing so, the risk
in the tradable sector has been shifted completely to the (risk-neutral) international in-
vestors. There is only one state of the world in period 2. Under a mild condition such that
(1 + r) > , the period-2 equilibrium features full employment regards of the value of the
tradable income. This means no aggregate demand externality in the economy. In general,
however, when  is within the region of [0, 1], the economy features both equity and debt
issuance. By the same argument as in Section F.3, both the capital structure in the economy
and the severity of externality depend on .



The Social Planner's Problem
The social planner internalizes the aggregate demand externality and chooses the allocation
differently. Her problem can be written as follows.

where V SP (CT 1 , s, d ) is defined as

                V SP (CT 1 , s, d ) =      max T log CT 2 + N log z2 h2 + T log CT 3 ,
                                        CT 2 ,CT 3 ,d
                                                         d
                s.t. CT 2 = (1 - s)yT 2 - d +               ,
                                                        1+r
                h2 = h¯ min 1, CT 2
                                CT 1
                CT 3 = (1 - s)yT 3 - d .

Period-2 Equilibrium Similar to the competitive equilibrium, there are two states of the
world. The first is with full employment, i.e. CT 2 > CT 1 . The allocation of the social plan-
ner coincides with the competitive equilibrium. However, in the second state of the world
when there is involuntary unemployment, i.e. CT 2 < CT 1 , the social planner's optimality
condition implies that

                  1                      yT 3       1                yT 3
CT 2 =                    (1 - s) yT 2 +      -d >    (1 - s) yT 2 +      -d
         1 + /(1 + N /T )                1+r       1+                1+r

In other words, the social planner chooses a higher level of consumption so as to stimulate
the aggregate demand during the involuntary unemployment state.

where SP and SP  2 are the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the budget constraints in
periods 1 and 2, respectively.
    To understand the source of inefficiency, we assume that the social planner's alloca-
tion can be implemented by a capital control tax with a lump sum transfer. The budget

where µ = 1 in the involuntary unemployment state and µ = 0 in the full employment state.
Moreover, d > e . Therefore, the optimal policy includes a macroprudential capital tax on
both debt and equity in period 1 and a negative capital control tax on debt in the involuntary
unemployment state in period 2.


E     Equity Issuance During Crises (online only)
In this extension, we allow for equity issuance in the intermediate period. A key insight is
a possible role for ex post intervention because pecuniary externality affects two decision
margins in the second period.
    Suppose that in the second period, the economy can issue an additional share of equity
s  [0, 1 - s] to foreign investors. Since the equity issuance is subject to expropriation risk
, the share of equity is priced at (1 - ) 1y  3
                                             +r . The budget constraints in periods 2 and 3
become
                                                            d              y3
                  pCN 2 + CT 2 = (1 - s)y2 - d + pyN 2 +       + s (1 - )                 (9)

                                       m
                 CT 3 = y3 - d - (s + s )y3




                                              A.9
The financial constraint in period 2 is unchanged, i.e.

                                  d
                                      ((1 - s)y2 + pyN 2 )                                 (10)
                                 1+r
    The economy can choose equity and debt financing to smooth consumption in the sec-
ond period. However, the use of equity financing depends on the quality of domestic insti-
tutions. Consider the case where  = 0, i.e. very good domestic institution. In the second
period, the economy always uses equity financing as opposed to debt financing since equity
financing does not lead to a binding financial constraint. Therefore, there will be no case
for debt financing, the same insight as in the benchmark model. However, equity financing
is never used in equilibrium when the institution quality is poor (for example,  = 1). By
continuity, there will be an optimal capital structure in the second period depending on .

Proposition 11. When the economy is allowed to issue equity in the second period, it
chooses to do so when the constraint binds in the second period. However, the economy
chooses too little equity financing due to the pecuniary externality, which justifies an ex-
post intervention. There will still be an over-borrowing in the first period as in the bench-
mark economy. To correct the externality, the social planner needs to use both ex-ante and
ex-post interventions.

Proof. Proof is given in Appendix F.8.
     The possibility of equity issuance in the second period allows a role for ex-post inter-
vention since the pecuniary externality affects two decision margins in the second period
when the constraint binds. Unlike the previous literature which allows for only debt financ-
ing (Bianchi (2011) and Jeanne and Korinek (2018)), introducing equity financing allows
the social planner to use ex-post intervention to change the composition of external financ-
ing when the constraint binds. In particular, the social planner favors equity financing as
it provides better risk-sharing and suffers less pecuniary externality than debt financing.
Nevertheless, the use of ex-post intervention cannot completely eliminate the pecuniary
externality, which calls for a use of ex-ante policy intervention in equilibrium.
     It is also worth pointing out that the feature of an ex-post intervention is different from
the existing form of ex-post intervention in the literature such as Benigno et al. (2013),
Ma (2020) and Jeanne and Korinek (2020). Our ex-post intervention is used to change the
composition of external financing in order to reduce the cost of a binding constraint, while
it is used in Benigno et al. (2016) to change the composition of labor supplies between
the tradable and non-tradable sectors or in Ma (2020) the composition of consumption
versus investment. The ex-post intervention takes the form of a fiscal transfer in Jeanne
and Korinek (2020) but a tax on capital flows in our case.

Realize that        s         > 0,      d         > 0 and                > 0, where the first two relationships

                        s  (0, 1), if there exist s  [0, 1] such that F (s, d  , ) = 0

     Since F (s, d  , 0) < 0 as shown in F.2 and F (s, d  , 1) > 0 for s  [0, 1], by continuity,
there exists a   ¯ such that F (s, d  , ¯ ) = 0 for s = 0. When  >     ¯ , F (s, d  , ) > F (0, d  , ) >
        
F (0, d ,  ¯ ) = 0 for all s  [0, 1]. In this case, the optimal level of s is 0. The equilibrium

     Similarly, since there exists a  such that F (s, d  , ) = 0 for s = 1. When  < ,
F (s, d  , ) < F (1, d  , ) < F (1, d  , ) = 0 for all s  [0, 1]. In this case, the optimal level of

     One can show that a higher  leads to a higher 1-           s . To see this, one recognizes that

fore, following a higher value of , a higher 1 - s raises the value of the LHS while reducing
that of the RHS of equation (18), leading to a higher d /(1 - s).
    Therefore, in equilibrium a higher  leads to a lower s, a higher d and d /(1 - s), which
implies a higher leverage ratio s(1-d)/ (1+r)

    Since expressions (11) and (21) are identical, there is no difference between the pri-
vate agents and the social planner in the condition for the constraints to be binding. The
allocation is given by

                                      m + (1 - s) 1y

    This is the same as that in the competitive equilibrium, which is characterized in V (m, s, y1 ).

    By the envelope theorem, we have

                                 V SP (m, s, y2 )   T       N
                                                  =      + µ ,

                            V SP (m,s,y2 )       V (m,s,y2 )
    As µ > 0, we see that        m           >      m        .

      Using the same proof as in Appendix F.3, one can show the following: (1) There exists
   ¯ SP
a  such that there will be only debt issuance when  >           ¯ SP ; (2) There exists a SP such
that there will be only equity issuance when  <  ; (3) When   (SP , 
                                                      SP                          ¯ SP ), there will
be a mixture of equity and debt. Furthermore, a higher  leads to a lower s, a higher d and
d /(1 - s), which implies a higher leverage ratio s(1-d)/ (1+r)
                                                        y1 +d /(1+r) . Notice that the probability
of the constraints becoming binding depends on the level of d /(1 - s): The higher the value
of d /(1 - s), the greater the probability of binding constraints due to equation (21).
      Suppose we impose capital control taxes on debt and equity, d and s , respectively, the

   To close the gap between the social planner's allocation and that of the private agents,
we have to have

It can be shown that d > s since

        =     E [µ]E    (1 - )y1 -            + cov µ, (1 - )y1 -                > 0.
                                   1+r                                  1+r

    E [ (1 - )y1 - 1y  2
                      +r ] has to be positive for an positive amount of equity to be issued
in equilibrium. cov(µ, (1 - )y1 - 1y   2
                                       +r ) > 0 since a lower level of y2 is associated with a
tighter borrowing constraint, i.e. a higher value of µ.
    Given that d > s , the wedge in the debt financing is higher than that in the equity
financing. As a result, the social planner chooses a lower overall level of external financing
CT 1 , and a smaller component of debt than equity financing. Therefore, the debt to income
ratio of d /(1 - s) should be lower in the social planner's allocation, resulting in a lower
probability of crises.
    For  < SP , the decentralized equilibrium features only equity financing. In this case,
there is no difference between the social planner's choice and the decentralized equilibrium,
and the collateral constraint does not bind. In comparison, for        ¯ SP , the decentralized
equilibrium features only debt financing. There is a wedge between the private agents' and
the social planner's allocations. By continuity, there exists a  such that the allocation


                                            A.16
under the competitive equilibrium is constrained efficient when  <  , and constrained
inefficient when  >  . Moreover, one can see that  > SP . Notice that only when
 > SP , there will be debt issuance. The inefficiency arises only when d /(1 - s) is high
enough. Consider  is only marginally higher than SP such that the equilibrium d is lower
enough. In that case, there is no binding constraint in the economy and also inefficiency.
Therefore, one get  > SP and  <        ¯ SP .

   Similar to the benchmark economy, there will be an equilibrium capital structure in
which the ratio of d and D depends on . Define the marginal benefit function of long-term
debt as follows
                                      T                           T

                                          T
                                    = -        + (1 + r)E1 [µ]
                                         CT 1
where the last relationship combines two optimality conditions.
    From the marginal benefit function, it is easy to see that MB(d , D, 0) > 0 > MB(d , D, 1)
for any d , D  0. Furthermore, we have MBd > 0, MBD > 0 and MB < 0. Using these rela-
tionships, we find that the optimal level of short-term debt d is 0 when  = 0 while the long-
term debt D is 0 when  = 1. By continuity, there will exists a  such that MB(0, D, ) = 0.
In this case, for any  < , MB(d , D, ) > MB(d , D, ) > MB(0, D, ) = 0, which implies
that d  = 0. In this region, only long-term debt will be issued. Similarly, one can define   ¯
such that MB(d , D,  ¯ ) = 0. In this case, for any  >  ¯ , D = 0 as MB(d , D, ) < 0. There-
fore, an interior solution exists in the region of (,  ¯ ). Using the same logic in Appendix
F.3, one can show that a higher  in this region leads to a higher d and a lower D.
    The case for policy intervention is similar to the benchmark economy since the pecu-
niary externality only applies to the short term debt. Specifically, the social planner values
d differently from private agents. By the same logic as in Appendix F.5, there is overbor-
rowing in the decentralized economy and the social planner uses capital controls to correct
the inefficiency. To see this, define a social planner as follows.


           V SP (d , D, y2 ) =       max           T log CT 2 + N log yN 2 + T log CT 3 ,

The optimality conditions of d and D for the social planner are given by

     Because the pecuniary externality only affects the decision margin for short-term debt
d , one only need one capital controls to correct the inefficiency. Specifically, we introduce
a tax d on short term debt and a lump-sum transfer T as follows.

where  and µ are the Lagrangian multipliers associated with equations (32) and (33).

   In the first period, the optimality conditions for d and l are given by

                                    T                      T

Simplifying the last optimality condition, the following relationship holds.

    We can also define the marginal benefit function for issuing local-currency debt as
follows
                                            T                T
                        MB(d  , l , )            (1 - ) - E1      
                                            CT 1             CT 2

    We can see that MB(d  , l , 0) > 0 and MB(d  , l , 1) < 0. Furthermore, MBd  < 0, MBl < 0
and MB < 0. Therefore, there exists  such that MB(d  , l , ) = 0. For  < , MB(d  , l , ) >
MB(d  , l , ) = 0. The equilibrium condition features a corner solution with only local
currency issuance. Similarly, define    ¯ satisfying MB(d  , 0,  ¯ ) = 0. In this case, for  > ¯,
MB(d  , l , ) < MB(d  , 0, ¯ ) = 0 and the equilibrium features zero local-currency debt. In
the case of   (,  ¯ ), there is a combination of local-currency and dollar debt. Furthermore,
one can also show that as  increases l decreases. Similarly, one can show that an increase
in  increases d .

or binding. When the constraint is slack, i.e. µ = 0, we have s = 0 since the bond financing
is cheaper than the equity financing. In this case, the desired level of bond financing is
given by

                                         (1 - s)y3 - (1 + r)m
                                   d =
                                                 1+
The constraint is slack iff
                                                                                 
 d   N                     N                          d               N m + (1 - s)y2
       CT 2 + (1 - s)y2 =                         m+     + (1 - s)y2  T

    When this condition is violated, µ > 0, the interior solution of {CT 2 , CT 3 , s } is given by

                                              y3                  N

                       CT 3 = (1 - s - s )y3 - (1 + r) (1 - s)y2 +   CT 2 ,
                                                                   T

The solution s is given by
                                                            /(1-)+N /T )
                           (1 - s)[y3 - (1 + r)y2 ] - (1+r)(1 -N /T      [(1 - )(1 - s)y2 - d ]

When s (y2 , y3 , s, d ) > 1 - s, the allocation is given by the following conditions

                     CT 3 = y3 (1 - s - s )y3 - (1 + r) (1 - s)y2 +     CT 2 ,

                                                                   CT 3
                                                                    T

equilibrium. However, the allocation when the constraint binds is different and given by

                                              y3                    N
                      CT 2 = m + s (1 - )         +  (1 - s)y2 +      CT 2
                                            1+r                     T
                      CT 3 = y3 (1 - s - s )y3 - d ,
                              1 - N /T           T             T
                       1-                            = (1 + r)
                             1 - N /T CT 2                     CT 3

Therefore, one needs to put an ex-post tax on equity issuance. Suppose we introduce a tax
s on equity issuance and a lump-sum transfer as follows.

                                             d                      y3
               pCN 2 + CT 2 = m + pyN 2 +       + (1 - s )s (1 - )     +T                   (42)
                                            1+r                    1+r
where T = s s (1 - ) 1y 3
                      +r .

   In this case, the optimality condition for s becomes
                                              T              T
                             (1 - )(1 - s )        = (1 + r)
                                              CT 2           CT 3
                    N /T
We need s = - 1-     N /T < 0 to close the gap between the social planner's and the private
agents' allocations. Given that the wedge is negative, the private agents' choice features
too little equity financing relative to relative to that of the social planner.

   The inefficiency also shows up in the different valuations of wealth SP and . For the
social planner, the envelope theorem implies that

                        V SP        T      N     T     V
                             = SP =      +  µSP      =
                        m           CT 2   T     CT 2 m
Therefore, capital controls in the first period are needed to correct this inefficiency. Further-
more, there will be overborrowing due to the positive wedge above. The proof is similar to
that in Appendix F.5. To fully correct the externality, the social planner has to use both an
ex-ante tax on capital flows in the first period and an ex-post policy intervention s .
