                                           ABSTRACT

Most of the economic analyses of the overseas-Chinese network focus on trade and investment flows
at the country level. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the ethnic Chinese network at the firm
level. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that ethnic-Chinese FDI firms in China in fact
underperform non-ethnic-Chinese FDI firms. We also find that the performance of ethnic-Chinese
firms deteriorates over time. We present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that ethnic-Chinese
firms under-invest in those firm attributes that may enhance long-term performance, such as human
capital and technology. Our findings raise both empirical and normative implications of ethnic ties.

            1. Introduction

            One of the most important—and most studied—ethnic networks in the world is that of the

    overseas Chinese. In this paper, we add to the large and important collection of literature on the

    subject by studying the performance of overseas-Chinese firms that have invested and maintained

    operations in China. The existing literature on the economics of overseas-Chinese networks focuses

    on the aggregate volume of trade or foreign direct investment (FDI) at the country level. These

    studies, although revealing important insights, may miss important dynamics at the firm level.

            Our paper studies the economic effects of ethnic-Chinese networks at the firm level. We

    take advantage of a large dataset—between 20,000 and 50,000 firms per year, depending on the year,

    over a period of eight years—broken down by two types of FDI in China: that by ethnic-Chinese

    foreign investors and that by non-ethnic-Chinese foreign investors. Our paper contributes to the

    literature by presenting a far more disaggregated treatment of the topic and by explicitly comparing

    performance across ethnic- and non-ethnic-Chinese networks.           Compared with country-level

    studies, this disaggregated approach has the additional advantage of eliminating the effects of

    country-level dynamics, such as the macroeconomic environment, economic policies, legal

    institutions, and international relations, that may confound some of the findings generated on the

    basis of cross-country datasets.

            Another contribution of our paper is that its findings help to resolve some of the ongoing

    debates in the literature. The majority of economists who have studied this topic have a positive

    view of the economic effects of ethnicity. Ethnic ties help to bridge the information gap and they

    contribute to contract enforcement in environments where legal institutions are underdeveloped.




                                                                                                      3

    However, there is also an emerging view that argues that ethnic ties—by privileging insiders at the

    expense of outsiders—may reduce economic efficiency, at least under certain conditions. Our

    findings are largely supportive of this second—and less positive—view of the economic effects of

    ethnicity.

            For the purposes of this paper, and following the classification in our dataset, we define

    overseas-Chinese investors as those originating in three ethnically Chinese economies (ECEs)—

    Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (HMT). Even though this definition does not cover the entire

    universe of overseas-Chinese investors, it is sufficiently encompassing because these three ECEs

    account for the absolute lion’s share of overseas-Chinese investments in China. In 1997, for example,

    firms based in HMT invested US$24.3 billion in China, compared with investments totaling only

    US$3.4 billion from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, five Southeast

    Asian countries with large overseas-Chinese populations. These three ECEs have also been the

    single largest source of FDI in China. Between 1978 and 1999, the ECEs supplied 59 percent of

    China’s entire stock of FDI. Not only is the absolute volume of ECE FDI large, ECE investments

    are present across a wide range of industries and geographic regions. According to one detailed

    study of FDI patterns in China, ECE investments are present in more Chinese industries and are

    more important to China’s export production than similar ECE past investments in Taiwan (Huang

    2003). Thus, in addition to the theoretical objective of demonstrating ethnic effects on firm

    performance, it is empirically important to explore the sources and variances in firm performance

    based on ethnic ties.




                                                                                                       4

           Conventional wisdom holds that ECE firms possess superior cultural knowledge about

    China and this cultural advantage confers on ECE firms an enduring competitive advantage over

    their non-ECE rivals. This claim, often assumed than explicitly demonstrated, posits that ECE

    firms on average should outperform non-ECE firms in China, all else being equal. We do not find

    much empirical evidence in support of this ethnic-advantage hypothesis. In fact, in our baseline

    regressions we sometimes find that ECE firms on average in China weakly underperform non-ECE

    firms after controlling for a large number of firm characteristics. Such performance differences, it

    should be noted, are not always robust or statistically significant. We also find evidence that in those

    situations in which the initial performance is similar between ECE and non-ECE firms, the

    performance of ECE firms deteriorates relative to non-ECE firms over time. .

           There are a number of potential explanations for our findings. One possibility is that ECE

    firms exhibit a “hometown bias”—favoring ancestral locations rather than locations with

    commercial promise. This points to a potential selection bias—ECE firms that enter China are not

    necessarily as profit-driven as non-ECE firms. We do not find that this drives our results. There is

    no difference in terms of the ECE effect between the two most likely ancestral provinces for

    overseas-Chinese investors—Fujian and Guangdong—and the other Chinese provinces.

           Another possibility is a related selection bias—that ECE firms face a lower investment

    threshold as compared with non-ECE firms. This might be because the superior cultural knowledge

    in ECE firms attracts entry of firms with greater heterogeneous capabilities, whereas only the

    strongest non-ECE firms choose to enter China (possibly to compensate for their lack of cultural

    knowledge). In this scenario, ECE firms on average might underperform precisely because of ethnicity,




                                                                                                          5

    but the effect of ethnicity is due to systematic differences in the entry propensity of ECE and non-

    ECE firms, not due to any post-entry detrimental effect of ethnicity on operating performance. We

    cannot completely rule out the effect of this selection bias because we do not have data on the pre-

    entry distribution of performance of parent ECE and non-ECE firms. However, we are able to

    show that our findings are at least partially robust to this selection bias. From another source, we

    obtained data on Korean and Taiwanese firms in the electronics and related industries. Our findings

    on the lack of an ECE operating advantage hold in a comparison between ECE firms (i.e., from

    Taiwan) and non-ECE firms (i.e., from Korea). We chose the electronics and related industries

    because Taiwan is home to several world-class electronics firms. The likes of Acer and Foxconn are

    on a par with the best Korean electronics firms (such as Samsung and LG). Thus, it would be

    difficult to attribute the underperformance of Taiwanese electronics firms entirely to this pre-entry

    selection bias.1

             A third possibility is that ECE firms may not value those attributes that enhance long-term

    performance. For example, they may recruit employees on the basis of family and kinship ties rather

    than on the basis of technical and managerial skills. We find evidence consistent with this possibility.

    After controlling for a variety of firm characteristics, we find that ECE firms lag behind non-ECE

    firms in our measures of technology and human capital.

             We hypothesize that this under-investment in technology and human capital may explain yet

    another pattern revealed in our analysis: ECE firms, to the extent that they start with performance

    that is equivalent to that of non-ECE firms, tend to underperform against non-ECE firms over time.
             1
                 We additionally consider other ways to mitigate the selection bias problem. W will elaborate on these later in
    the paper.




                                                                                                                                  6

    Additionally, once ECE and non-ECE firms are matched in terms of their technology and human

    capital, ECE firms no longer exhibit a dynamic disadvantage vis-à-vis non-ECE firms. These

    findings are significant both statistically and economically, and they are robust to various

    specification checks.

            To the extent possible with our data, we also test other potential sources of performance

    variances between ECE and non-ECE firms, such as transfer pricing and earnings management.

    Our findings are also robust to these tests.

            The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the existing literature

    and the theoretical framework that guides our empirical exploration. Section 3 introduces our unique

    and detailed dataset, the China Industry Census (CIC). Section 4 presents the models, empirical

    results, and a variety of robustness checks. Section 5 concludes the paper.



    2. Literature and Theoretical Framework

            Does ethnicity pay? Specifically, do overseas-Chinese FDI firms in China outperform non-

    ethnic-Chinese FDI firms based on conventional measures of performance? In this section, we first

    discuss the theoretical frameworks that guide our empirical exploration. Our paper is related to two

    strands in the academic literature. The first strand focuses on the specific economic and business

    effects and the functions of what are known as “pre-existing relationships,” including, although not

    limited to, ethnic ties. These effects or functions refer to trust enhancement, provision of

    information, matching of buyers and sellers, and acquisition or diffusion of new knowledge. The




                                                                                                        7

    outcome of interest in this strand of the literature is very similar to our interest—performance by

    firms or individuals.

            The second strand in the literature deals with what might be called “institutional” functions

    of ethnic ties. These functions, such as contract enforcement or dispute resolution, proximate those

    performed by a political or economic system. These institutional functions of ethnic ties arise

    particularly in those environments that normally lack well-developed legal institutions. Although our

    paper is close to this strand of the literature in terms of our empirical interest, this strand focuses on

    economic phenomena of a fairly aggregate nature (country-level FDI and trade flows). Our paper is

    thus a synthesis of these two strands of the literature.

            Common ethnic ties have been found to facilitate trade credit extensions in developing

    countries (Fisman and Love 2003 ) as well as the more productive forms of financial transactions,

    such as the use of longer-term contracts over arm’s-length contracts—checks rather than cash

    (Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2004). Ethnic networks are also found to facilitate flows and

    transaction-specific information but also diffusions of “complex knowledge” (such as science).

    Ethnic scientific communities play an important role in international technology diffusion (Kerr

    2008) and in the global activities of U.S. firms (Foley and Kerr 2011). Kalnins and Chung (2006)

    provide evidence from the U.S. lodging industry that Gujarati immigrant entrepreneurs benefit from

    their ethnic group’s social capital when already-successful members are co-located in the same

    industry.

            Informational asymmetries are particularly acute when it comes to transactions across

    different geographic and political boundaries. For this reason, international trade economists have




                                                                                                            8

    studied how ethnic ties may affect international trade and capital flows.2 Ethnic networks consisting

    of immigrants and overseas residents serve to match foreign/domestic buyers with

    domestic/foreign sellers. Ethnicity pays in the sense that ethnic members better understand the

    characteristics of both the home and the foreign markets than non-ethnic members and they are

    more capable of spotting profit opportunities. The matching function of co-ethnic ties is at the heart

    of the theoretical model developed by Casella and Rauch (2002). Rauch and Trindade (2002)

    developed a test for this informational function of co-ethnic networks. They found that an ethnic-

    Chinese network exerts a particularly strong effect on trade in differentiated product space. Because

    differentiated products do not have a ready reference price point, information requirements are

    particularly acute in this product segment. And the fact that the ethnic effects are large in this

    product space is evidence of the informational advantage of ethnic ties. Tong (2005) extends this

    framework to FDI and shows that ethnic effects are still present in developed countries with well-

    developed institutions. She thus concludes that the information functions of ethnic ties are more

    important than the contract enforcement functions.

              The institutional functions of ethnic ties encompass contract enforcement and dispute

    resolution. In essence, they proximate those functions performed by government. The institutional

    functions of a relationship arise in environments that lack well-developed legal institutions, and it

    has been argued that relationships can serve as a substitute for formal legal institutions. 3 (This

             3
                 There is also a vast literature on how legal origins and legal institutions in general affect economic activities
    and growth. See, for example, the survey paper by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008). The literatures on the
    impacts of formal and informal institutional arrangements are complementary.




                                                                                                                                     9

    feature of the literature may be particularly relevant to our paper as it is well known that China lacks

    well-developed legal institutions.) Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) exploit social capital

    differences in Italy. They find that in high-social-capital areas, households are more likely to use

    checks, to invest in stocks over cash, to have greater access to institutional credit, and to make less

    use of informal credit. The effect of social capital is stronger among less-educated people and in

    places where legal enforcement is weak. Allen, et al. (2005) observe that financing channels and

    corporate governance mechanisms based on reputation and relationships are an important

    alternative to a formal legal and financial system in supporting the growth of the private sector in

    China.

             Works by Greif (1989, 1993) represent the most explicit efforts to model the institutional

    functions of ethnic ties. He finds that ethnic ties sustain trade agency relationships—among

    Maghribi traders—through a collective punishment mechanism. In his model, although information

    shortages plagued long-distance trade during the medieval era, they did not cripple the agency

    arrangement. This is because Maghribi traders relied on a collective punishment mechanism that

    excluded an opportunistic agent from future dealings with all members of the trading network. The

    crucial ingredient in this story is the ethnic homogeneity of the Maghribi traders. Greif provides

    documentary evidence to show that Maghribi traders, who had the most developed form of a

    collective punishment mechanism, thrived more than other traders.

             Although many studies stress the positive effects of ethnic ties to facilitate trade and

    investment flows, a number of studies have sounded a more cautionary note—that under certain

    circumstances ethnic ties may actually be inefficient. We will briefly summarize this literature and




                                                                                                         10

    suggest that these somewhat ambiguous predictions about the economic effects of ethnicity call for

    an empirical investigation into the balance between both the positive and the negative effects of

    ethnicity. This is the main purpose of our paper.

            A key feature of a co-ethnic network is the idea of privilege—insider knowledge and

    preferential information enjoyed by the members of the network to the exclusion of the non-

    members (Casella and Rauch 2002). To draw the empirical implications of ethnic ties we need to

    explicitly consider both the inclusive and exclusive nature of co-ethnic ties.

            There are two ways to think about this issue. One is the possibility that the gains accruing to

    members of the network are achieved at the expense of non-members. In their model, Casella and

    Rauch (2002) theorize that transacting through ethnic networks entails distributional implications.

    Anonymous and formal markets remain underdeveloped when a large share of economic

    transactions occurs among related agents in a network. The specific mechanism in their model is

    human capital allocation. Casella and Rauch call this “a lemon effect.” Ethnic groups tie up a

    disproportionate share of productive human capital, leaving the rest of society with less productive

    human capital.4

            The above reasoning raises questions about the economy-wide implications of ethnic ties,

    however there are also firm-level and efficiency implications. It is theoretically possible that ethnic

    ties can lead to less optimal outcomes for members of the network as well. Casella and Rauch hint at

    this imperfection, even though their model does not explicitly explore this possibility. A quote from

    their paper is highly suggestive: “Li Ka-shing calls the boys before he calls the brokers.” (Li Ka-


            4
                They also use this reasoning to explain why mainstream society may bear grudges against ethnic minorities.




                                                                                                                             11

    shing is a well-known Hong Kong tycoon.) One interpretation is that Li Ka-shing may be ill-advised

    by “the boys”—his friends and relatives rather than those brokers who possess true business

    expertise. This exclusive effect of a network—based on ethnic or family ties— has also been

    noted—mostly unfavorably—by other economists in the context of family firms (Bertrand, Mehta,

    and Mullainathan 2002, Bae, Kang, and Kim 2002, Chang 2003, Coff 1999, and Baek, Kang, and Lee

    2006), and especially family firms in the emerging economies (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer,

    and Vishny 2000).

            Some economists, although noting the positive information effects, argue that ethnic

    networks can lead to dynamic inefficiencies. Greif (1994) argues that there is an efficiency loss due

    to the mechanism adopted by the Maghribi traders to curb opportunism. The ethnic networks have

    an inward bias in that it is cheaper for insiders to trade among themselves than it is to trade with

    outsiders. So theoretically there is a potential that ethnic networks will divert trade rather than

    creating trade. The efficiency loss due to a tightly-knit network has long been recognized by non-

    economists. In his famous paper, sociologist Granovetter (1973) shows that loose networks, as

    compared with tight networks, are more efficient in generating useful information on job searches.

    The reason is that tight networks are less likely to produce truly new and useful information. By

    definition, ethnic networks are tight and thus may be plagued by this problem.



    3. Dataset and Variables

            In this section we introduce our unique dataset, explain the construction of the variables we

    will use in our statistical analysis, and present the summary statistics.




                                                                                                      12

    3.1. Data Description

            To test the null hypothesis that ECE firms do not outperform non-ECE firms in China

    ideally one would conduct a randomized experiment for these two types of FDI in China. In such

    an experiment, the treatment would consist of FDI by ethnic-Chinese investors that is randomly

    assigned to companies in China. The remaining companies would adopt FDI by other foreign

    investors (i.e., non-ethnic Chinese). The experiment would then follow up on these two groups of

    companies over time, and several years post-FDI entry it would compare their mean performance.

            Similar to most economic research questions, we can at best approach this subject matter

    with observational studies instead of randomized experiments. We will use a very comprehensive

    dataset known as the China Industry Census (CIC), covering 1998 to 2005, to carry out our analysis.

    The CIC was compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in China and it includes the entire

    population of Chinese industrial firms that have sales in excess of five million yuan (roughly

    US$600,000) for each of the census years. Because FDI firms typically are among the largest firms in

    China, the CIC is likely to include all industrial FDI firms. (There is no similar dataset comparable to

    the CIC for service firms.) To our knowledge, the CIC is the most detailed database on Chinese

    industrial firms.

            The CIC contains detailed information about each company’s identity, address, industry

    classification, year of incorporation, employment, hierarchical level to which the company reports

    (regional, provincial, or town, etc.), registration type (ECE, non-ECE, domestic, foreign, joint

    venture, or joint cooperative), three main products in order of relative importance, and production

    capacities for each of these three products. The dataset also includes information on assets, both the




                                                                                                         13

    year-end level and the change within the year, ownership rights, contractual and actual investments,

    sales, profits, and exports. In addition, there are detailed records of the breakdown of contractual

    and actual equity capital among the investment sources, such as investments from domestic firms

    and investments from foreign investors. Each company’s intangible assets, total capital, and capital

    depreciation are also recorded.

           The detailed company information and panel structure allow us to properly handle a number

    of empirical complications. For example, ECE investments may be endogenous to a firm’s own

    productivity. The best we can do then is to control for crucial company characteristics (such as the

    number of years since incorporation, firm size, leverage, and capital-intensiveness) in the regression

    models. In particular, these variables help capture the observed and correlated latent company

    experience and productivity advantages or disadvantages. The detailed information provided in the

    CIC allows for some extensive controls of firm characteristics.

           Another endogeneity issue has to do with industry characteristics. Certain industries are

    more productive and may disproportionally attract more ECE investors than non-ECE investors

    because the former possess more innate knowledge about these industries. This correlation between

    the productivity of the industry and whether or not the company accepts ECE FDI might cause an

    upward bias in the coefficient estimate of the ECE-FDI treatment variable.

           The CIC has disaggregated industry codes at the four-digit level. At this level, we are able to

    distinguish, for example, a firm producing leather shoes from a firm producing sneakers. Such a

    level of disaggregation goes far beyond many studies of the Chinese economy that typically use

    databases with industrial classifications at a two-digit level. In all our regressions, we mitigate the




                                                                                                        14

    industry-endogeneity bias by controlling for these detailed industry characteristics. Our empirical

    implementation minimizes the inter-industry and intra-industry differences in technology and other

    characteristics, as well as the correlations between these characteristics and the ethnic characteristics

    of the investors.

            Another substantial advantage of this dataset is that each firm is assigned a unique firm

    identifier—known as the “legal person code.” Using this firm identifier we are able to link the

    majority of FDI firms across different years. The panel structure helps eliminate any time-invariant

    firm-specific effects. However, because not all FDI firms are present for each year, our panel

    structure is unbalanced (but our empirical strategy takes this into account). Although the CIC was

    carefully conducted, the dataset does contain errors. For instance, some industry codes contain less

    than four digits, oftentimes because the first digit—frequently zero—is omitted. Apparently, there

    are also reporting errors; to correct this, we manually matched these companies’ main products, as

    reported in the dataset, with the industry codes. Similarly, some of the province codes are mistyped

    or missing, but, to the extent possible, we corrected them manually. That said, there may still be

    remaining errors and omissions in the dataset, the impact of which we hope to minimize through

    our extensive robustness analyses.

    3.2. Definition of ECEs

            The CIC divides FDI into two geographic categories: that originating from three ethnic-

    Chinese economies—Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (HMT hereafter) as a single category—and

    that originating from all other foreign countries and regions. In this paper, we define ECE firms as

    those firms funded by FDI originating in HMT. Under Chinese law, a firm is classified as an FDI




                                                                                                          15







    firm if a single foreign investor holds a minimum of 25% equity. The firm is classified as an HMT

    firm if the foreign investor—or the dominant foreign investor in the case of multiple foreign

    investors—is from HMT.5

             There are two issues related to this definition. First, to what extent should investments from

    Hong Kong and Macau be properly classified as “FDI?” Second, how accurate is this definition in

    terms of matching with the “overseas-Chineseness” of foreign investors?

             China reclaimed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and over Macau in 1999. However,

    both in international and Chinese statistical classifications, investments in China from Hong Kong

    and Macau are still classified as FDI. This is consistent with international norms of classifying FDI

    according to economic criteria—such as a separate currency and separate monetary and customs

    policies—rather than according to political sovereignty. As an illustration, investments by Hong

    Kong firms in Britain before 1997 were classified as FDI in British statistics. Thus there is nothing

    unusual about our approach of treating investments from Hong Kong and Macau as FDI.

             However, there are potential downward biases in our definition of ECE. Other than HMT,

    the CIC does not have further breakdowns of the country origins of the FDI. For this reason,

    investments from Southeast Asian countries, which also have large Chinese populations, are treated

    as non-ECE FDI. An ideal definition would classify the ECE-ness of a firm according to the


             5
                 One can argue that in the case of joint ECE and non-ECE investments in an FDI firm our measure
    overstates the “ECE-ness” of the firm since a portion of its investment comes from a non-ECE source. But this is
    unlikely to affect our analysis in part because it is unlikely that there are many joint ECE and non-ECE investments in
    our dataset. Also, we can assume that ECE investors, because of their majority equity stakes, would have more operating
    control and this should be reflected in the resulting FDI firm and should exhibit ECE characteristics similar to firms
    with a single ECE investor.




                                                                                                                             16

    Chinese population share in the firm’s home country. This is not feasible given our data limitations.

    However, as noted above, the amount of FDI from Southeast Asia is dwarfed by the amount from

    HMT, thus hopefully this is not a crippling bias.

           There is also a potential upward bias due to our ECE definition. It is possible that

    investments from Hong Kong contain investments with non-ECE origins. This is because Hong

    Kong is sometimes used as a conduit for investment activities in China by American and European

    firms. Our ECE definition thus includes some non-ECE investments of unknown magnitude; the

    extent of this bias depends on the size of these non-ECE investments.

           There are two reasons why this bias is unlikely to undermine our findings. One is that only

    Hong Kong is a known conduit for Western investments in China. Investments from Macau and

    Taiwan unquestionably come from overseas Chinese. Second, it is widely believed that Taiwan,

    rather than any Western country, is the largest investor in China through Hong Kong. The reason is

    that there are political sensitivities, more so earlier than presently, with respect to investments

    coming directly from Taiwan. Thus the conduit function of Hong Kong is unlikely to introduce a

    sizable bias in our ECE definition.

           We are able to construct a more precise definition of ECE for firms from the electronic and

    related industries in Taiwan and Korea. We obtained a dataset that contains Taiwanese and Korean

    firm identifiers. We matched the Taiwanese and Korean firm identifiers with the firm identifiers

    provided in the CIC and repeated all the regression runs. The results are qualitatively consistent with

    the results generated from the HMT-based definition of ECEs. This gives us confidence in our

    findings. (We also used the Taiwanese and Korean sub-sample to conduct sensitivity checks of our




                                                                                                        17

    main results that are robust to a potential selection bias—that the technologically weaker ECE firms

    have a higher propensity to enter China than the typical non-ECE firms, and that the prevalence of

    such “marginal firms” in ECE FDI might explain our finding that there is no ECE performance

    advantage.)

           To test our null hypothesis as sharply as we can, in our empirical analysis we stress findings

    for a particular type of ECE firms—ECE firms that are joint ventures with Chinese investors. The

    matching function posited by Rauch and Trindade (2002) should be especially pronounced in joint

    ventures (JVs) where foreign and domestic partners co-manage the enterprise and coordinate actions

    on a frequent basis, as compared with FDI firms operated solely by foreign investors. If the ethnic

    ties lead to a better matching of capabilities and knowledge between ethnic-Chinese investors and

    non-Chinese investors, ECE firms should outperform non-ECE firms, especially in coordination-

    intensive JVs as compared with non-JVs. Again, the CIC contains valuable and relevant information.

    It provides detailed information on the registration type of the FDI firms along JV and non-JV lines.

    The JV sample consists of 153,588 observations, more than half of the entire FDI sample.

    3.3. Variable Definitions

           The key in our empirical analysis is to select appropriate performance measures and to

    control the covariates. Since the majority of the observations in our dataset are non-listed firms, we

    do not have information about the market value of their equity or assets and we cannot rely on stock

    market-based performance measures. We focus instead on conventional operating performance

    measures to study whether ECE firms outperform non-ECE firms: returns on assets (Desai, Foley,

    and Hines 2004c, Joh 2003), returns on equity (Desai, Foley, and Hines 2004b, Nissim and Ziv




                                                                                                       18

    2001), and net margins (Joh 2003, Lambkin 1988, Lu and Beamish 2001).These are the total profits

    normalized by total assets, total equity ownership rights, and total sales, respectively. To be specific,

    we define returns on assets (ROA) as profits divided by the beginning-of-year assets. Since we do

    not have the beginning-of-year assets directly, we compute them as the end-of-year assets minus the

    profits (which we implicitly assume to accrue as assets for the next year). We define returns on

    equity (ROE) as the ratio between profits and equity ownership rights, and we define net margins as

    the ratio between profits and sales.

             We further adjusted our performance measures to account for the possibility that managers

    might engage in earnings management to hide the true performance of their firms, and that ECE

    firms and non-ECE firms might engage in systematically different levels of earnings management

    activities.6 We report the empirical results using these adjusted measures of firm performance. In

    unreported tests, we confirm that the results are qualitatively similar when we use performance

    measures that are not adjusted for the earnings management possibility.

             Since the results obtained from using the three performance measures are qualitatively

    similar, in the main results reported below we will focus on ROA. But it should be noted that we

    repeated all of the tests on the two other performance measures as well and the results were

    qualitatively consistent across all three performance measures.                         Furthermore, because the

    distributions of the ratio variables are conducive to outliers, following the standard empirical finance

             6
                 To be specific, earnings management is a strategy used by company management to deliberately manipulate
    earnings so as to disguise the company’s true profitability; see, for example, Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998). Following
    the large literature on earnings management, we calculated the discretionary accrual of a firm and adjusted the earnings
    numbers accordingly, thus generating a performance measure that is robust to the possibility of earnings management.
    The detailed procedure for adjusting for the discretionary accrual may be obtained from the authors.




                                                                                                                           19

    and accounting literature on the treatment of outliers, such as Brav and Lehavy (2003) and Durnev

    and Kim (2005), we winsorized the data at the 1% and 99% levels.7 Our results are robust to

    whether or not we perform such winsorisation.

              Following the literature, we included a company’s leverage, age, and the natural log of its

    total assets as the main control variables, together with the set of firm, industry, and province

    dummy controls.             We used the log of total assets because it better approximates a normal

    distribution. Given that China is capital-constrained, in the regression model we additionally

    controlled for the capital-intensiveness of the firm. We measured capital-intensiveness by paid-in

    capital divided by the number of workers. This can be a useful control if ECE and non-ECE firms

    differ in terms of the capital intensity of their production.

              We calculated a company’s leverage by subtracting the equity ownership rights from the end-

    of-year assets and dividing this difference by the end-of-year assets. 8 The age of a company is

    defined as the number of years it has been in operation in China, and it is measured by the census

    year (e.g., 1998) minus the year when the firm was incorporated in China (e.g., 1992). This variable

    helps to capture the variations in production and management experience as well as potential

    differences in the life-cycle stage of the firms that can be crucial determinants of performance. The


              7
                  Winsorising is a transformation of extreme values in the statistical data to certain boundary values. The
    distribution of many statistics can be heavily influenced by outliers. A typical strategy is to set all outliers to a specified
    percentile of the data. For example, a 95% Winsorisation would see all data below the 5th percentile set to the 5th
    percentile, and all data above the 95th percentile set to the 95th percentile. Winsorising usually results in estimators that
    are more robust to outliers than their more standard forms.
              8
                  Essentially, we tried to measure Debt/Total_Asset by (Total_Asset – Equity)/Total_Asset.




                                                                                                                                  20

    long-term survival of a company in the market can also act as a selection control for productive

    companies. One particular dynamic that this variable controls for is the so-called “first-mover

    advantage.” To the extent that ECE investors entered China earlier than non-ECE investors, there

    might be a potential correlation between ECE and first-mover advantage. In our empirical

    implementation, the company age effect is independent of the ECE effect.

            Although not included in the benchmark model, we have compiled an exhaustive list of

    other covariates to better control for the potential confounding effects on performance. The

    standard measure of size is the log of total assets, but because we include total assets in calculating

    the ROA, we also tried the alternative measure for the size of companies as given in the CIC. The

    CIC divides all firms into large, medium, and small categories. Our findings are robust to control for

    this alternative measure of firm size. The influence a foreign investor exerts on managerial decisions

    is usually proportional to her proportion of ownership. We measure foreign ownership by the

    percentage of foreign equity—whether ECE or non-ECE—in total equity.                  In many studies,

    exports are also used as a proxy measure of firm-level productivity (Qian 2007). We use export

    values as a share of total sales to control for the company-specific productivity level.

            Exports might also act as a control for the propensity for transfer pricing. Transfer pricing

    may affect the reported performance of ECE and non-ECE firms differently. By its covert nature,

    transfer pricing intrinsically is difficult to detect and measure, but some researchers have used the

    value of foreign trade as a proxy for transfer-pricing dynamics (Desai, Foley, and Hines 2004a). We

    follow the same procedure here. For this purpose, we generated two variables: the ratio of exports

    to total sales and, for the sub-sample from 1998 to 2001, the sum of exports and imports as a




                                                                                                        21







    fraction of total sales. (Import data are only available for this sub-period.) In order to control for any

    potential differences in how ECE and non-ECE firms are regulated, we generated a dummy variable,

    POLHCHY, which is the position of Chinese joint-venture partners in the Chinese political

    hierarchy. Chinese firms are regulated by nine different levels of government, e.g., the central

    government, provincial government, city and county governments, and so forth. We created this

    variable with the idea that ECE and non-ECE investors may systematically differ in terms of their

    levels in the regulatory hierarchy. In our empirical implementation, we added a control on

    POLHCHY and experimented with different cut-off values for POLHCHY. Our empirical findings

    are unaffected by these specification checks.

    3.4. Summary Statistics

            Our source dataset consists of between 20,000 and 50,000 FDI firms for each year. Not all

    the firms are present in the CIC for each year during the 1998-2005 period. We deleted those

    observations with missing data as well as those that failed some basic error checks. The final dataset

    thus has about 270,000 observations. In Table 1, we present the summary statistics of the main

    variables used in the regression analysis.

            The dataset covers firms in all Chinese provinces from 1998 to 2005. The average

    employment level is 313 headcounts in the ECE group, compared with 308 headcounts in the non-

    ECE group. In the ECE group, the average wage for employees is 13,990 yuan (or US$1,695 based

    on the average exchange rate during the sample period) per capita and the average fringe benefits are

    1,324 yuan (US$162) per capita, compared with an average wage of 17,560 yuan (US$2,128) and

    average fringe benefits of 2,067 yuan (US$252) for the non-ECE group. Firms in the CIC are




                                                                                                           22







    relatively young in terms of age, with a mean age of approximately 6.3 years for the ECE group and

    5.5 years for the non-ECE group. On average, ECE firms in the CIC hold 75.1 million yuan (US$9.1

    million) in total assets and 33.8 million yuan (US$4.1 million) in equity, whereas non-ECE firms

    have assets of 125.9 million yuan (US$15.2 million) and equity of 585 million yuan (US$71.0 million).

    The debt-to-asset ratios are about 0.5 in both groups. Mean profits of ECE firms are 3.6 million

    yuan (US$0.45 million), compared with 8.33 million yuan (US$1.01 million) in the non-ECE group.

    The average sales value is 57.3 million yuan (US$8.2 million) in the ECE group, and 80.9 million

    yuan (US$9.8 million) in the non-ECE group. On average one-third of sales are exported in both the

    ECE and the non-ECE groups.

            ECE and non-ECE firms do not differ in our measures of earnings management and

    leverage. Nor do they differ in terms of their export/sales ratio (which we will use later in the paper

    to control for transfer pricing). The Kolmogrove-Smirnov test does not show significant differences

    between ECE and non-ECE firms in terms of industry distribution. We also plot the distribution of

    ECE against non-ECE firms across industries to visually verify that the distribution patterns are

    similar for the two groups; we did this for two equal sub-periods to make sure that the comparison

    is steady over time.

    4. Empirical Models and Results




                                                                                                        23

           In this section we present our empirical models and results. We start with models that

    compare the performance of ECE firms with the performance of non-ECE firms at a given point in

    time, i.e., the static effects of ethnicity. We then present findings that track the changes in ECE

    firms relative to non-ECE firms over time, i.e., the dynamic effects of ethnicity. Our main finding is

    that ECE firms weakly underperformed against non-ECE firms statically and significantly

    underperformed against non-ECE firms dynamically. The factors best explaining the deterioration in

    performance over time on the part of ECE firms are those variables related to technology and

    human capital. We present our findings that that show that ECE firms significantly under-invested

    in technology and human capital as compared with non-ECE firms.

           There are a number of complications that may confound our findings, such as selection

    biases, transfer pricing, hometown effects, and so forth. Here we will discuss these issues and in the

    Web Appendix we will present additional robustness checks. By and large, our main findings are

    invariant to alternative distribution assumptions and estimation models. Sensitivity analyses

    (following Rosenbaum 2002 and Qian 2007) show that an omitted confounding variable, if it exists,

    has to be unrealistically strong in order to change our main conclusions.

    4.1. Testing the Static Effects of ECE firms

           Our benchmark model is a year-, company-, and province-fixed effects regression model

    carried out on the samples of joint-venture (JV) companies and non-JV companies separately:




                                                                                                       24

             ROAit = 0*ECEit +1*logassetsit +2*leverageit +3*capital-intensivenessit +4*ageit

    +5*ProvDumi +6*FirmDumi+7*YearDumt +it                                                                        (1)9

    where it is the regression residual, and ’s are the coefficients on the respective covariates. The

    main parameter of interest is 0.

             Before presenting our main results, we ran the two following regressions on two simpler

    models to obtain a brief view of the ECE effect: one is the model with only ECE and other fixed

    effects; the other is the model with all the variables, excluding ECE, compared to our baseline

    model. The results show a significant negative effect of ECE (Table 2).

                                                     [Insert Table 2 around here]

             The ECE status is invariant along time for every firm. Therefore, unlike a normal panel

    study, we cannot obtain any information on the ECE effect on performance from the within-groups

    estimator. One simple way to estimate the effect of a time-invariant variable therefore would be to

    use a random-effects model and FGLS. However, a Hausman test rejects a random-effects model

    for our dataset, so instead the following fixed-effects model is employed:



                               ROAit = γZi+βXit+αi+it                                                                (2)


    where Zi=(ECEi, other time-invariant firm characteristics) is a vector comprised of the ECE variable

    and a set of other time-invariant firm characteristics. Xit is a vector of the time-variant individual


             9
               Firm-fixed effects are specific to each firm only, whereas the province dummies capture the time-invariant
    region factors. In Stata, which is the software we use to estimate these regressions, the province fixed-effects are not
    dropped, instead repeated measures of ANOVA are performed. The coefficients on the province dummies compare
    FDI firms across regions.




                                                                                                                               25

    firm characteristics, and αi is the fixed effect for firm i. In our basic model, in addition to ECE, Zi

    includes the province dummy variables to control for the province-specific effect. Xit includes five

    major components: log assets, leverage, capital-intensiveness, age, and finally, a time trend for each

    year from 1998 to 2005. All these control variables follow the finance literature. In addition, we

    assume that it are i.i.d white noise for firm i at time t.

            As suggested by Neter et al. (1996), we perform a regression analysis with corrections to the

    unbalanced panel to estimate the static effect of being characterized as ECE using a fixed-effects

    nested design model. The estimation can be divided into the following two steps:

            First, we consistently estimate β using the within-groups estimator (the regular fixed-effects

    estimator). The within-groups estimator is based on the differences of the time-variant variables

    within each firm, therefore Zi and αi do not affect our estimation.

            Second, the residual obtained from the above is comprised of a constant, a first level ECE-

    group effect, a second level firm effect, and it. This structure coincides with a nested two factor

    design model, whereas the ECE effect is nested in the individual effect. As suggested by Neter et al.

    (1996), we perform ANOVA analysis with corrections to the unbalanced panel to estimate the static

    effect of being characterized as ECE. The coefficient on ECE is the estimated average outcome

    differences between the ECE and non-ECE groups controlling for the observables and the time-

    invariant unobservables. This is exactly what we are interested in studying. The rest of the time-

    invariant effects can be estimated by repeating the above ANOVA estimation process.

            The results are reported in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3. There are negative and mostly

    insignificants or marginally significant, coefficients on the ECE. This implies that after controlling




                                                                                                              26

    for the company and province effects and the set of traditional covariates, there is no robust or

    significantly positive relation between ECE investments and a company’s performance. If anything,

    there seems to be a negative association between ECE status and firm performance, especially for

    the non-JV sample. This finding provides some initial evidence that contradicts conventional

    wisdom that, based on the informational and cultural advantages of co-ethnic networks, ECE firms

    should outperform their non-ECE counterparts.

           The marginally significant estimated ECE effect is -1.4% in the JV sample and -2.2% in the

    non-JV sample. Compared to the average return on assets in the JV sample, i.e., 34.6%, and that in

    the non-JV sample, i.e., 34.7%, the disadvantages of ECE firms are relatively small in both samples.

    However, in both the JV and non-JV samples, the differences of the ROA in the ECE and in the

    non-ECE groups, which are -1.9% and -1.8% respectively, are due mostly to our estimated ECE

    effect. This suggests that the ECE effect accounts for most of the differences in the ROA between

    the ECE and non-ECE groups, compared with the effect of the other control variables.

           The coefficients on capital-intensiveness are positive and significant at the 1% level for the

    JV sample, but less significant (although still positive) for the non-JV sample. The coefficient on age

    is insignificant for the JV sample and negative and marginally significant for the non-JV sample, and

    the log assets are positive and significant for the JV sample but negative and mostly significant for

    the non-JV sample. The “leverage” variable takes on positive coefficients that are significant at the

    1% level for both the JV and non-JV samples.

           So far we have shown that ECE firms, on average, do not outperform non-ECE firms, and

    in some situations even underperform non-ECE firms. In the remainder of this section we examine

    whether this underperformance by ECE firms persists over time. To examine the dynamic effects of

    ECE investments on firm performance, we add an interaction term between the ECE indicator and

    firm age (ECE*Age).



           ROAit = 0*ECEit*Ageit +1*logassetsit +2*leverageit +3*capital-intensivenessit +4*ageit

    +5*YearDumt +αi+it                                                                 (2)



           ECE*age is time-variant. Hence, the relative dynamic effect between the ECE and non-ECE

    groups, 0, can be estimated directly via a within-group estimation (the standard fixed-effects

    estimator) without performing ANOVA analysis. A positive and significant coefficient on 0 would

    indicate that ECE firms enjoy an increasing operational advantage over time. Conversely, a negative

    and significant coefficient on the interaction term would indicate that over time, compared to the

    non-ECE firms, the performance of ECE firms deteriorates. The age variable is mean-centered (i.e.,

    de-meaned and normalized by the standard deviation of the age distribution in the sample) before it

    is interacted with the ECE dummy. This is to make our results easier to interpret. The regression

    results for the above tests are shown in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3.

            The results do indeed show negative 0’s that are statistically significant at the 1% level

    (Row 3 of Table 3). The size of 0 appears to be substantial in some specifications. For example, in

    the regression reported in Table 3 for the joint-venture sample, the coefficient on the ECE*age




                                                                                                     28

    interaction term is -0.024, with a t-statistics of -3.87, and the coefficient on the ECE dummy is -

    0.0103, with a t-statistics of -1.37 in the regression. This implies that when comparing JV companies

    of the same age, the ROA of ECE firms is, on average, 0.024 less than that of their non-ECE

    counterparts. The ROA of a typical JV ECE firm drops by 0.024 from the company age of 6.36

    (mean age value in the sample) to the age of 11.41 (i.e., 6.36+5.05; equivalent to the mean-centered

    age changing from 0 to 1). The overall average ECE effect on the JV sample is -0.03 (i.e., -0.01-

    0.02). This suggests that ECE firms may initially start with a small and statistically insignificant

    disadvantage in performance, but this disadvantage increases over time. These results hold when we

    ran our regressions with age quartile dummies (including their interaction terms with the ECE

    dummy as well as the first order terms). This approach allows a more flexible relationship between

    firm age and our profitability outcome variables.



    4.3. Testing Alternative Hypotheses on the ECE Effects

             There are a number of potential confounding factors. We will discuss several key ones

    here. To save space, we have also performed a large number of tests that are available in the Web

    Appendix or upon request.10 In this section we focus on three potential confounding factors. The




             10
                  For example, we explored whether or not government policies might differ between ECE and non-ECE
    firms, but we failed to find any evidence for policy differences during our sample period. We found that ECE firms
    incurred higher leverage; thus we examined whether different levels of leverage might explain our finding. They did not.
    We tested the idea that ECE and non-ECE firms may differ not only in their mean performance measures but also in
    the variances of their performance measures to see whether or not the lower performance of ECE firms may be justified
    by their correspondingly lower risk. There is no difference between the variances of their performance. We repeated




                                                                                                                          29

    first is a selection bias—that ECE firms with heterogeneous capabilities tended to select themselves

    into investing in China as compared with non-ECE firms. In this scenario, non-ECE firms would

    cluster at the higher end of the profitability distribution than ECE firms. 11 Another related selection

    bias is that ECE firms favor investment locations based on ancestral ties rather than on commercial

    promise. A third potential confounding factor is transfer pricing. The idea here is that ECE firms

    have a higher propensity to engage in transfer pricing compared with non-ECE firms (due, perhaps,

    to the ease of doing so through the porous controls between China and HMT). If transfer pricing is

    pervasive among ECE firms, then they may show paper losses even though in reality they are

    profitable. We examined these three issues and found that they do not change our qualitative

    conclusion that ECE firms do not outperform non-ECE firms.

             First, it should be noted that the pre-entry selection bias does not explain one significant

    finding in our paper—that the performance of ECE firms deteriorates over time. Second, we

    conducted a battery of tests to address this “fat-tails” concern, i.e., excessive entry at one end of the

    profitability distribution. The panel quintile and Huber regressions do not change our findings

    qualitatively. Third, we also omitted those firms we define as new entries (i.e., they entered China

    after 2000). Again all our main findings hold. (In fact, the statistical significance of the ECE*Age


    many tests on the largest ECE firms to see whether the operations of ECE firms may be used by their parent firms as
    experimental “loss-makers.” There is no evidence for this effect.
             11
                  We are grateful to one referee who provided the following illustration of this selection bias: Imagine that
    there are currently two firms with profitability 1 and one firm with profitability 2. The average profitability is 4/3.
    But now the market is flooded with 300 entrants, all with profitability 1. The average profitability falls to (1*300 +
    2*2 + 3*1)/303= 307/303. In the paper, we address this concern about “excessive” entry of low-profitability ECE
    firms in a variety of ways.




                                                                                                                              30

    coefficients increased, although the estimated ECE and ECE*Age effect sizes were similar to those

    under the full sample.)12

            However, to completely rule out the pre-entry selection bias—that ECE firms tend to be

    “marginal”— requires controlling for the characteristics of the parent firms of the ECE and non-

    ECE firms operating in China. Given the huge number of FDI firms in our dataset and the

    likelihood that many of them are not subsidiaries of listed firms, it is not feasible to link these firms

    to any existing international firm databases (such as CRSP, COMPUSTAT, or WORLDSCOPE).

    Fortunately, we obtained a dataset that contains unique firm identifiers in the electronics and related

    industries for two groups of FDI firms operating in China—firms funded by Taiwanese investors

    and firms funded by Korean investors.13 We are able to link these two datasets using these unique

    firm identifiers.

            In the following regressions we benchmarked the performance of Taiwanese firms against

    the performance of Korean firms in the electronics and related industries. (The industries we include

    are from 4000 to 4200 in the Chinese Industry Classification Codes. They include, respectively,

    machinery manufacturing, electronics, and equipment production.) We selected these industries in

    part because of data availability but also for a substantive reason: Taiwanese firms in these industries

    are among the best in the world. As an example, Acer, a Taiwanese computer manufacturer, is the

    second largest in the world in terms of global market share. (HP is the largest.) A detailed analysis

    by three technology experts (Linden, Kraemer, and Dedrick 2009) reveals the competitive edge of

    Taiwanese firms in the electronics industry. These experts traced the country origins of the twenty

    most expensive component suppliers to an iPod product manufactured in China and they reported

    that 13% of the component value was captured by Taiwanese firms, compared with 68.9% by

    Japanese firms, and 16% by American firms. Only one Korean firm, Samsung, made it to the top 20

    suppliers (compared with three firms from Taiwan) and it accounted for 1.6% of the component

    value. As another indication, in the 2006-2007 World Economic Forum’s “Global Innovation

    Ranking,” Taiwan is ranked 9th in the world; Korea is ranked 20th. It is thus unlikely that Taiwanese

    firms operating in China are afflicted by a systematic selection bias that causes them to be “marginal

    firms” as compared with Korean firms.

             In total, there are 25,179 observations for the Taiwan-Korea sub-sample of electronics and

    related firms. Of these, 9,652 are JVs and 15,527 are non-JVs. Table 4 presents the regression

    results. On average, Taiwanese firms, proxying for ECE firms here, substantially underperformed

    against the non-ECE Korean firms in the JV sample. There is no statistically significant difference in

    the non-JV sample.14 The results are robust to the inclusion of the squared terms. These findings are

    entirely consistent with the findings generated on the basis of all FDI firms and on the HMT-based

    definition of ECEs.

                                                       [Insert Table 4 around here]

             Another confounding factor, which is also a selection bias, can be described as a “hometown

    effect.” Field research reveals evidence that ECE firms invest heavily in their own home regions




             14
                  Anticipating the regression runs on the dynamic effects of ethnicity described next, we also ran interaction
    terms between a Taiwan ECE dummy with firm age. Taiwanese firms again underperformed against Korean firms over

    with the explicit purpose of benefiting the local economies and the local residents. 15 Overseas

    Chinese investors often donate to schools and hospitals in their home regions. These “altruistic”

    investment motivations, although perfectly aligned with the particular utility functions of the

    overseas-Chinese investors, may not lead to profit-maximizing behavior. If this is the reason for the

    observed inferior performance by ECE FDI, one can argue that the “hometown investments” by

    ECE firms have a lower “hurdle rate”—i.e., the required returns before making the investment—

    and ECE firms would then exhibit a lower return on their investments. We tested this “hometown

    effect” by conducting regression runs on two separate sub-samples, one including firms in

    Guangdong and Fujian provinces and the other excluding them. (Guangdong and Fujian are the

    ancestral provinces of the vast majority of overseas Chinese.) There is no evidence that the ECE

    effect—both static and dynamic—is systematically different between these two sub-samples, as

    shown in Table 5.

                                                    [Insert Table 5 around here]

             A third confounding factor is transfer pricing. Transfer pricing refers to the practice of

    controlling shareholders to covertly move profits from one location to another location by engaging

    in related transactions of export and import businesses. For example, a subsidiary in China can

    transfer profits to its overseas headquarters by either under-invoicing its exports to the overseas

    headquarters and/or by over-invoicing its imports from the overseas headquarters. One possibility is


             15
                  Evidence reported by Ezra Vogel in his research on China’s Guangdong province shows that many Hong
    Kong firms return to do business in their ancestral home regions. He notes that in the late 1980s half of the export-
    processing contracts in the Dongguan region of Guangdong were with former Dongguan residents living in Hong Kong
    (Vogel 1989, p. 176).




                                                                                                                            33

    that ECE firms engage in transfer-pricing activities more than their non-ECE counterparts, thereby

    leading to lower—but fictitious—accounting profits on the part of ECE firms.

             Given its covert nature, it is difficult to measure transfer pricing precisely. We can only

    indirectly estimate its effect. One suggestive piece of evidence that transfer pricing is unlikely to

    explain the entire ECE effect is provided by the findings on the non-JV sample in Table 3. Transfer

    pricing is often used by the controlling shareholders to enrich themselves at the expense of the less-

    informed minority shareholders. By this logic, transfer pricing is likely to be most serious in JVs with

    a joint shareholding structure between HMT investors and Chinese investors and is likely to be less

    serious among firms wholly owned by HMT investors. As shown in Table 3, ECE firms

    underperformed against non-ECE firms in both the JV and non-JV samples. The ECE

    underperformance is by no means only limited to JVs.

             However, transfer pricing is used not only to tunnel profits at the expense of minority

    shareholders but also to reduce tax liabilities in the operating country. For this reason, we need to

    find a direct way to control for transfer pricing. One feasible solution is to control for the firms’

    foreign trade activities. Since foreign trade is the conduit for transfer pricing, it might be reasonable

    to assume that transfer pricing is correlated with foreign trade.

             Since transfer pricing is achieved by underreporting exports, we define the first proxy as the

    exports as a ratio of total sales. (We conducted the same tests on a sub-sample of firms for which we

    have both export and import data and the results are qualitatively similar.)16 Our regression shows

             16
                  Ideally, we would want to also include controls to address imports, but our full dataset does not give the
    import levels. Thus for the main results reported in this paper, we use export/total sales as our proxy for transfer
    pricing. For the 1998-2001 sub-sample, we do have import data. We thus re-did our transfer-pricing tests for those years




                                                                                                                               34

    that this transfer-pricing proxy does not correlate with ECE significantly, after controlling for the set

    of relevant covariates in the JV sample. Adding this transfer-pricing proxy does not change the

    economic and statistical significances of the coefficients on the ECE indicator from those reported

    in Table 3.

               It is possible that ECE firms focus on export markets, whereas non-ECE firms focus on

    domestic markets. To rule out the possibility that the difference in performance might be attributed

    to the fact that ECE and non-ECE firms differ in their foreign/domestic market orientations, we

    stratified the dataset into five groups: a group that targets only the domestic market and four

    quartiles of firms based on the values of their export-sales ratio. Within each stratum, we repeated

    the regression analysis. These analyses yielded negative and statistically insignificant coefficients on

    the ECE indicator. Thus there is no evidence that our findings are driven by either transfer

    pricing—at least in the way that it is measured here—or by the export orientation of ECE firms.

    These results are presented in Table 6.

                                                      [Insert Table 6 around here]




    4.4.        Exploring the Mechanism for the Dynamic Effects of ECE Firms

               Our literature review suggests a number of potential limitations of ethnic ties, such as

    valuing kinship and relationships at the expense of skills. It is possible that these limitations explain

    why the supposed superior cultural knowledge on the part of ECE firms fails to translate into any

    by proxying the transfer pricing as the ratio of the sum of exports and imports to total sales. The results are qualitatively
    similar.




                                                                                                                              35

    operating advantages. We are able to directly test some of these underlying mechanisms posited in

    the literature.

            One potential explanation for our findings is that ECE investors may under-invest in those

    capabilities that would enhance their long-term performance. We propose using the following two

    variables to measure these capabilities. One is the intangible assets held by the firm. Intangible

    assets, as defined in the CIC and under Chinese accounting rules, are quite similar to accounting

    treatments in the United States, including patented and non-patented technology and know-how,

    brand names and trademarks, royalties, various types of licensed rights and franchise rights, and

    goodwill. (Chinese accounting standards also use an amortization rule similar to that in the United

    States.) The other measure is average wage per employee. The average wage is widely used by labor

    economists to measure skills and productivity levels.

            We conduct a regression analysis on the intangible assets or average wage level by regressing

    them on a variety of firm characteristics and an ECE dummy. The intangibles exhibit positive and

    significant time trends over the census years for the non-ECE firms, netting out the firm- and

    province-fixed effects, indicating that on average non-ECE firms are spending heavily to build up

    their intangible assets over time. By contrast, as shown in Table 7, the ECE firms in our sample

    seem to significantly under-invest in intangible assets and human capital compared with the non-

    ECE firms, controlling for other firm characteristics.

                                             [Insert Table 7 around here]

            We further demonstrate how the differences in intangibles and human capital between the

    ECE and non-ECE investors may affect performance. We show that the “dynamic disadvantage




                                                                                                      36

    effect” of ethnicity disappears once we non-parametrically control for intangible investments or

    investments in human capital (proxied by the wages). We first stratified the dataset into six sub-

    samples by the value of the intangibles: the first sub-sample contains firms that have zero intangibles

    and the five other sub-samples contain firms based on the quintiles of intangibles to which these

    firms belong. The first sub-sample consists of slightly more than 40 percent of the companies, with

    an almost even split between ECE and non-ECE firms. The latter five sub-samples account for

    about 60 percent of the sample, with 22,252 ECE and 39,495 non-ECE firms, respectively, roughly

    evenly distributed among the five quintiles. For each stratum of intangible assets, we regress our

    usual performance measure on the ECE indicator variable, ECE and age interaction term, firm age,

    and a variety of the control variables used in Table 3, controlling for the province, industry, and year

    dummies.

           Table 8 presents the summary of the regression coefficients on the ECE*age interaction

    terms and the corresponding t-statistics. As can be seen, for each of the strata of the data where

    firms have relatively similar levels of intangible assets, the ECE*age coefficients become statistically

    insignificant. In fact, they become positive for lower levels of the intangible assets. This contrasts

    with the earlier evidence that, when regressing intangibles on ECE*age and the set of usual controls

    in the whole sample, ECE*age is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. The new

    results present strong evidence that the intangibles may be the underlying mechanism (or at least an

    important factor) contributing to the acceleration of the ECE disadvantages documented earlier.

    These results hold, qualitatively, when we substituted intangible assets with average employee

    wage—a proxy for skilled human capital—in our regression runs.

    5. Conclusion

           In this paper we explored the question whether “ethnicity” pays, specifically, whether ethnic

    Chinese FDI firms have a systematic operating advantage over non-ethnic-Chinese FDI firms in

    China. Economic theories, although not without some ambiguities, are largely positive regarding the

    economic contributions of ethnic ties. At a micro level, ethnic ties are believed to facilitate

    information provision and to enhance trust. At a more macro level, ethnic ties are believed to

    facilitate cross-country trade and investment flows.

           Our descriptive data support the view that ethnic ties facilitate investment flows. By 1999, 59

    percent of China’s FDI stock came from three regions: Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. More than

    half of the FDI firm observations in the CIC are ECE FDI firms. Ethnicity clearly has a substantial

    effect on the volume of cross-border transactions.

           However, our findings, generated on the basis of an extensive battery of statistical tests, do

    not show that ethnicity has a substantial positive effect on the performance of cross-border

    transactions. Ethnicity does not seem to pay. ECE FDI firms either failed to outperform or actually

    underperformed non-ECE FDI firms in China. The ECE “penalty” is especially pronounced when

    we measured performance over time. This dynamic ECE effect seems to resonate with the criticism

    of ethnic ties by Greif (1994) in his otherwise positive appraisal of the economic effects of ethnic

    ties. Greif argues that the advantage of Maghribi traders is short term as they may have neglected to




                                                                                                       38

    build up institutions and practices that expanded trade in the long run.17 We reveal a similar dynamic

    here. ECE firms seem to have under-invested in technology and human capital. They may, as

    hypothesized by Casella and Rauch (2002), more heavily value kinship and ethnic ties. This might be

    a potential downside to organizing economic and business activities through an ethnic network.

           It should be noted that our study focuses only on data from China and thus is not a

    demonstration of a prevalence of underperformance of ethnically-linked economic activities. That said,

    our findings cast some doubt on the simple or simplistic notion that ethnic ties are always beneficial

    in economics and business. To the extent that a substantial portion of the FDI in many countries,

    particularly in the developing economies, is comprised of ethnic FDI, our results shed useful light

    on the overall patterns of—and limitations with—ethnically-linked activities. We hope that this

    paper, by anchoring our findings on a very detailed empirical investigation, will contribute to the

    general economics literature on ethnicity and to an understanding of this important phenomenon in

    the global economy.

                 Note: The political hierarchy level of a firm refers to the political level to which the firm reports. This variable takes
                 on value 10 if the firm reports to the central government, 20 if it reports to the provincial level, 40 to the regional level,
                 50 to the county-level, 61 to the street-level, 62 to the town-level, 63 to the village level, 71 to theresidential
                 association level, 72 to the village association level, and 90 otherwise. The employment variable refers the number of
                 persons employed in a firm. Export, capital, intangibles, total assets, equity, sales, profits, and wage are all variables as
                 recorded in the original database. We generated the age variable by subtracting the firm's incorporation year from the
                 year of the data. We calculated net margin by profits divided by sales netting out discretionary accrual * assets / sales.
                 ROA is return on assets, defined as profits divided by the difference between total assets and profits, netting out
                 discretionary accrual * assets / (assets - profits). ROE is return on equity, defined as profits divided by equity,
                 discretionary accrual*assets/equity. Capital intensiveness is the capital/labor ratio. The leverage variable is defined as
                 total assets subtract shareholder equity and then divided by total assets. Joint venture dummy takes value of one if the
                 firm is a joint venture corporation, and zero otherwise. In the database, the variable "registration type" identifies the
                 firm’s ownership. Foreign-affiliated firms have register type values of between 200 and 340, with ECEs between 200
                 and 240 and joint ventures between 210 and 310. Transfer pricing is defined as (exports-imports)/(total outputs). All
                 measures of value are in USD with the base unit=1000.

                 Columns 1 and 2 are regressions for the whole sample, and columns 3 through 7 are regressions for the five
                 subsamples according to the export/sales levels (zero exports and quartiles 1 to 4 for positive export/sales levels). T-
                 statistics based on standard errors clustered at the firm level are below the coefficient estimates.
