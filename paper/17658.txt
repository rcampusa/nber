                                            ABSTRACT

We analyze the effects of states’ expansions of CHIP eligibility to children in higher income families
during 2002-2009 on take-up of public coverage, crowd-out of private coverage, and rates of uninsurance.
Our results indicate these expansions were associated with limited uptake of public coverage and only
a two percentage point reduction in the uninsurance rate among these children. Because not all of the
take-up of public insurance among eligible children is accounted for by children who transfer from
being uninsured to having public insurance, our results suggest that there may be some crowd-out
of private insurance coverage; the upper bound crowd-out rate we calculate is 46 percent.

Introduction

Over the next several years, as various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care

Act (ACA) take effect, the landscape of health insurance in the U.S. will increasingly shift. For

children, states’ Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) will continue to play a vital role

in meeting their health insurance needs at least through 2015, although the longer-term outlook

for CHIP is less certain.



In the years leading up to the ACA, many states began moving toward far more inclusionary

CHIP programs, extending eligibility to children in families with incomes far higher than

historical eligibility thresholds. Between 2002 and 2009, for example, 13 states boosted their

income eligibility threshold for CHIP to between 200 and 400 percent of the federal poverty line

(FPL). Several studies have explored the effects of previous public health insurance expansions,

including the Medicaid expansions of the late 1980s and the introduction of CHIP in 1996, on

take-up of public coverage, crowd-out of private coverage, and insurance coverage rates (Cutler

and Gruber 1996; Shore-Sheppard 2008; Bansak and Raphael 2006; Hudson et al. 2005; LoSasso

and Buchmueller 2004; Sommers et al. 2007; Ham and Shore-Sheppard 2005). However,

existing studies of CHIP extend at most through 2002, and none that we are aware of has

explored the effects on coverage of the considerable changes in eligibility associated with recent

expansions.



The extension of eligibility for public insurance to higher income children has not occurred

without controversy. A touchstone has been concern about the potential for and magnitude of

“crowd-out,” defined as the extent to which an increase in the availability of public insurance




                                                 2
decreases coverage by private insurance. In 2007, states’ eligibility expansions triggered a

controversial memorandum (later rescinded) from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid

Services (CMS) outlining a stringent set of conditions that states would have to meet in order to

offer CHIP eligibility to higher income families (Smith 2007). Among other requirements, states

offering eligibility to individuals in families with incomes above 250 percent of the FPL had to

establish a minimum one year-period of uninsurance prior to eligibility for coverage and

document that rates of private insurance coverage did not decline substantially. In practice, states

that extended CHIP eligibility to higher income families additionally attempted to control crowd-

out by requiring those families to pay premiums for CHIP coverage.



In this article, we offer an analysis of the effects of CHIP expansions from 2002-2009 on take-up

of public coverage, crowd-out of private coverage, and rates of insurance coverage. Our results

provide new empirical evidence about how the availability of subsidized public insurance to

higher income families affects enrollment in public insurance, enrollment in private insurance,

uninsurance rates, and the tradeoffs among them. In addition, we describe the implications of our

results for issues related to the implementation of the ACA.



Changes to CHIP—2002 to 2009

Movement toward universal coverage of children is the defining feature of CHIP program

changes during the last decade. Between 2002 and 2009, 18 states increased their income

eligibility threshold for CHIP (Figure 1). In a few states, the changes were modest, from an

eligibility threshold in the range of 133 to 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to a

level at or below 200 percent of the FPL. But in 13 states, the income threshold was boosted to




                                                 3
between 200 and 400 percent FPL, with 7 of the states extending eligibility for those with

incomes between 3 times ($66,150 in 2009) and 4 times ($88,200 in 2009) the FPL (Kaiser

Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009).

Of note, because all states disregard certain types of income and allow certain credits when

determining a family’s income for the purpose of establishing Medicaid or CHIP eligibility,

many families whose total income is above the stated threshold will meet eligibility criteria after

the disregards and credits are applied (Cohen et al. 2008).



In some states, coincident with these changes have been requirements that families share in the

cost of public coverage with premium contributions and/or copayments tied to use of health care

services. By 2008, most states required at least some premium contribution for a subset of CHIP

enrollees; only 16 states had no such requirements at any income level. Among states requiring a

contribution, most absolved individuals in families with income less than 150 percent FPL of any

premium cost-sharing and some only required contributions for families with incomes at least

twice the FPL. Among the states that offered coverage to families with incomes at least 3 times

FPL, premium contribution requirements ranged from $240 to more than $1,000 per year for a

family with two children.1



The movement toward universal coverage in some states has been accompanied by a variety of

additional program modifications, such as targeted outreach efforts, marketing of the program to

reduce stigma associated with participation in a public program, and streamlined administrative

processes for enrollment or renewal—all designed to increase enrollment among eligible

children—as well as precautionary measures designed to reduce crowd-out, such as waiting




                                                 4
periods between loss of private coverage and public eligibility and premium assistance programs

for individuals who have an offer of private coverage (SHADAC 2009).



Previous Evidence on Take-Up and Crowd Out



Take-up and crowd-out have been studied in the context of Medicaid expansions of the 1980s

and, more recently, in the context of CHIP. (Cutler and Gruber 1996; Shore-Sheppard 2008;

Bansak and Raphael 2006; Hudson et al. 2005; LoSasso and Buchmueller 2004; Sommers et al.

2007; Ham and Shore-Sheppard 2005; Gruber and Simon 2008). Studies of early Medicaid

expansions find higher take-up rates of public coverage among newly eligible children compared

to studies of the effects of CHIP implementation. For children made eligible through Medicaid

expansions, Cutler and Gruber (1996) report a 24 percent take-up rate and Shore-Sheppard a 15-

19 percent take up rate, for example. By comparison, LoSasso and Buchmuller (2004) estimate a

take-up rate of between 5.4 and 9.1 percent and Gruber and Simon (2008) report a 7.2 percent

take-up rate among children made eligible for public insurance through CHIP. The relatively low

take-up rate among children made eligible for CHIP (compared to those made eligible through

Medicaid expansions) may reflect a greater likelihood of having health insurance through some

other source.



A number of methodological issues have confronted the estimation of crowd-out. Researchers

haves used alternative definitions of crowd out, and crowd-out estimates have varied according

to the specific eligibility change studied, the timing of the measurement of health insurance, the

specification of controls in analysis, and the type of data used (administrative program data




                                                 5
versus data from population-based surveys). Further, the statistical uncertainty around crowd out

estimates has been infrequently analyzed and reported (Davidson et al. 2004). Studies based on

data from population-based surveys (e.g., the Survey of Income and Program Participation,

Community Tracking Survey, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and Current Population

Survey), typically find crowd-out rates of 25-50 percent (CBO 2007). Gruber and Simon (2008)

broadly characterize findings from initial studies of crowd-out in the Medicaid expansion era as

“large,” though subsequent findings related to the same expansions do not corroborate initial

estimates. Among studies of CHIP, LoSasso and Buchmueller (2004) report an average crowd-

out rate across states with differing waiting period requirements of about 50 percent; Hudson and

colleagues (2005) report a range from 35 to 70 percent; and the main estimate from Gruber and

Simon’s analyses (2008) is 60 percent.



A question of considerable relevance to the design of expansions in public insurance programs is

whether take-up of public coverage and crowd-out private coverage among children in higher

income families differs from that among children in lower income families. On balance, take-up

is expected to be lower among higher income children than their lower income counterparts

because more higher income children have employer-sponsored insurance (ESI); consequently,

the need for public coverage is lower. At the same time, crowd-out may be more pronounced

among higher income children precisely because ESI is more common. On the other hand, higher

income families may be less inclined to enroll in public coverage if they associate greater stigma

with participating in a public program, if public coverage is not as generous or has a more

limited provider network compared to private coverage, or if public coverage is perceived to be

less reliable because of the potential for policy changes affecting eligibility.

Data and Methods



Data Sources



Our main sources of data were the 2002-2009 Annual Social and Economic Supplements

(ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS-ASEC, which is administered each

February-April by the U.S. Census Bureau, collects labor market, sociodemographic, and health

insurance data from samples of households that are representative of each state. The health

insurance questions enable researchers to classify children’s coverage as public (Medicaid or

CHIP), private (group or non-group), or none, and subjects are allowed to report both public and

private coverage. Notably, the CPS includes a confirmatory question for individuals who report

not having health insurance coverage. The study sample consisted of children younger than 18

who were in families with incomes between 200 and 400 percent of the FPL.2



We compiled data from various sources to characterize states’ CHIP programs along a number of

domains, including income eligibility thresholds, income disregards, other eligibility criteria,

whether CHIP is integrated with the state’s Medicaid program or separate, and whether the state

has a waiver that allows for parental eligibility (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the

Uninsured 2002-2009; TRIM3; Bissell and Allen 2001).



We obtained state-level estimates of unemployment rates, poverty rates among children,

unionization rates, and per capita income from CPS data and merged these variables to




                                                 7
individual observations. We obtained information on the employee share of private insurance

premiums for family coverage by firm size for each state and year from summary tables from the

Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC). We used these data to

calculate a state level measure of the average price of private insurance by taking the average by

firm size within a state and multiplying these averages by the percentage of workers within each

firm size in the state.




Econometric Analysis



Our analyses were based on multivariate regression models. Our primary outcome measures

were whether the child had any public insurance during the year, whether the child had any

private insurance during the year, and whether the child had no insurance coverage during the

year. We analyzed each of the dependent variables separately. The key independent variable of

interest was eligibility. We used the information we obtained on states’ eligibility criteria in each

year to impute eligibility for individual children using the demographic and socioeconomic data

reported in the CPS-ASEC.3



As previous studies have highlighted, two concerns about the eligibility variable are that it is

measured with error, given limitations of the survey data on which imputation of eligibility is

based, and that it is potentially endogenous, given families’ ability to modify their income to

meet an eligibility threshold through job choice or hours worked. To address these concerns, we

used instrumental variables estimation, which is a method for obtaining unbiased estimates when




                                                  8
there is measurement error or endogeneity in an independent variable. Our instrument for

eligibility was first described by Cutler and Gruber (1996) and has been used extensively in

subsequent studies (Bansak and Raphael 2006; LoSasso and Buchmuller 2004; Hudson et al.

2005). The instrument was the percentage of a random sample of children of a particular age in

families with incomes between 200 and 400 percent of the FPL from all states in a particular

year who would have been eligible for public insurance in that state and year under the rules in

place in that state at that time. We derived the instrument (a different value for each age-state-

year cell) using a sample of 300 children from each age group and year.



The covariates models include controls for a comprehensive set of individual and family

characteristics including the age, race, and gender of the child; the size of the family and

household structure (one parent family, two parent family, or child lives with grandparent);

parental assessment of child’s health (on a 1-5 scale); highest level of education for either

parent; a set of indicators for whether the child is foreign-born or his/her parent is foreign born

and length of time the child has been in the U.S.; and family income as a percentage of the

poverty line. We include a set of variables describing parental employment to capture differences

across families in the probability of having an insurance offer. Specifically, we include indicators

for whether any parent is employed full time, employed part-time, employed in the public sector,

or is self-employed. For those employed full time in the private sector, we also include indicators

for category of occupation of the parent (where we choose the parent with the occupation that is

most likely to provide an offer of insurance) and for the firm size of the parent in the largest firm.




                                                  9
We also include selected characteristics of each state to control for their potential direct effect on

insurance coverage outcomes and relationship with policy changes affecting eligibility in each

state. We include measures of current and lagged unemployment, per capita income, the

percentage of children age 0-5 in each state who live in poverty, the percentage of children age

6-18 in each state living in poverty, the percentage of employed individuals in the state who are

unionized, and the price of private insurance. We also include controls for several characteristics

of the public insurance programs in the state: whether the SCHIP program is integrated with

Medicaid or separate, and whether the state allows parents of children eligible for SCHIP to

themselves be eligible for SCHIP.



Finally, covariates included year fixed effects to capture national trends in the study outcomes

and state fixed effects to control for unobserved differences among states. Additionally, in

keeping with previous research, we performed sensitivity analyses that allowed for different

trends in each state for particular age groups of children and different trends over time for

specific age groups by including state-age and year-age interactions (Shore-Sheppard 2008).

Estimates were weighted and standard errors were adjusted for weighting and clustering to

reflect the complex design of the CPS, as recommended by Davern and colleagues (2007).



Results

Descriptive Data

The analytic sample in total includes 157,315 children in families with incomes between 200 and

400 percent of the FPL; Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the sample of children from

2009. Approximately 13 percent of children were publicly insured, 84 percent privately insured




                                                 10
and 7 percent uninsured. The majority of children were reported to be in excellent or very good

health, with only 15.5 percent of children reported to be in good, fair or poor health. The highest

level of education for either parent was a high school degree or GED for 22 percent of children;

neither parent had graduated from high school among another 4 percent of children. Among U.S.

born children, 11 percent had no U.S. born parent or grandparent and just over 2 percent of

children were reported to be themselves foreign born. The majority of children, 79 percent, were

living in a 2 parent family. Family income was reported to be between 200 and 300 percent of

the FPL for nearly 58 percent of children; the remainder lived in families with incomes between

300 and 400 percent of the FPL.



Figure 2 shows the percentage of children eligible for CHIP in 2002 and 2009 by income group

in the 18 states that expanded eligibility. Eligibility changed dramatically between 2002 and

2009 for children in families in these states with incomes above 200% FPL. Whereas only 52

percent of children in these states in families with incomes between two and two and one-half

times the FPL were eligible in 2002, 86 percent were eligible in 2009. Similarly, the percentage

of children in families in these states with incomes between 250 and 300 percent FPL who were

eligible increased more than five-fold (from 11 to 63 percent). Less than 3 percent of children in

families with between three and four times the FPL were eligible for CHIP in 2002. By 2009, 45

percent of those with incomes between three and three and one half times the FPL were eligible,

as were 31 percent of those with incomes up to four times the FPL.



Regression Results: Effects on Take-up of Public Insurance and Uninsurance Rates




                                                11
Table 2 presents the results from our multivariate analyses for the three study outcomes: take-up

of public coverage, reduction in private coverage, and increase in insurance coverage rates.

Specifically, we report the number of children who enroll in public coverage, drop private

coverage, and move out of uninsurance per 100 children who become newly eligible for

subsidized public insurance.



We found that, for every 100 children who became eligible for public insurance, approximately 4

took up public coverage and approximately 2 children fell from the ranks of the uninsured (Table

2, Specification 1). The effect of the number of children who have private coverage was not

statistically significant. Our findings were robust to the inclusion of state-age and year-age

interactions as controls, as shown Specification 2.



A noteworthy finding in Table 2 is that the number of children who took up public coverage

exceeds the sum of the number of children who drop private coverage and the number of

uninsured children who gain insurance coverage. This finding reflects the fact that after a public

insurance expansion the number of persons who report both private and public insurance in

population-based datasets like the CPS rises, and is consistent with earlier research (Gruber and

Simon 2008). The degree to which this rise is due to more people having both types of coverage

simultaneously or to transitions between types of coverage is unknown.



Crowd-out

The phenomenon described in the preceding paragraph has led researchers to develop two

alternative methods for measuring crowd-out using a “narrow” definition and a “broad”




                                                 12
definition (Cutler and Gruber 1996; Davidson et al. 2004). Under the narrow definition, crowd-

out is measured as the number of children who drop private coverage divided by the number who

enroll in public coverage.


                                               No. who drop private coverage
          Crowd - out (narrow definition) 
                                              No. who enroll in public coverage



Under the broad definition, crowd out is measured by calculating how much of the increase in

public insurance is not explained by a decrease in uninsurance.4




                                        No. who move from being uninsured to insured 
  Crowd - out (broad definition)  1                                                
                                              No. who enroll in public coverage      



The narrow definition focuses on whether private insurance rates have dropped as a result of

expansion, whereas the broad definition focuses on the gap between the drop in the uninsured

rate and the increase in public program enrollment.5



We found that, using the narrow definition, the point estimate for crowd out is not statistically

different from zero (Table 3).6 By contrast, using the broad definition, the point estimate for

crowd-out is roughly 46 percent and is statistically significant (p<.05). Thus, at most 46 percent

of the increase in public coverage could potentially have come from children who switched from

private coverage.



Discussion and Policy Implications




                                                 13
During the period prior to the ACA’s passage, states increasingly experimented with offering

eligibility for public coverage to children in families with incomes that are more than twice the

FPL. These changes provide an opportunity for new understanding of the effects of eligibility for

public insurance among higher income children on enrollment in public insurance, enrollment in

private insurance, uninsurance rates, and tradeoffs among them.



Our analyses show that the 2002-2009 expansions to CHIP eligibility were associated with very

limited take-up of public insurance among children in families with incomes between 2 and 4

times the FPL, with 4 children enrolling for every 100 who became newly eligible. That such a

small proportion of children newly eligible for public insurance actually enrolled in public

coverage may seem surprising, but the rate is not dissimilar from earlier estimates of the effect of

CHIP eligibility on take-up (LoSasso and Buchmuller 2004; Hudson et al. 2005; Gruber and

Simon 2008), and moreover, reflects behavior among a higher income population compared to

previous studies. Further, comparing our regression results to descriptive data for several states

that expanded eligibility to 300 or 400 percent of the FPL confirms the validity of these findings.

In Illinois, for example, the income eligibility threshold increased from 200 to 400 percent of the

FPL in 2007 and enrollment in public coverage among children in families with incomes in that

range grew from 9.9 percent to 13.8 percent between 2007 and 2008. Similarly, Wisconsin

modified its income eligibility threshold from 185 percent to 300 percent of the FPL in 2008.

Public coverage grew from 8.1 to 12.0 percentage points among children in the 200 to 400

percent of the FPL income band.




                                                14
Several factors are likely to explain the low take-up of public coverage for children in higher

income families compared with their lower income counterparts. First, most children in families

with incomes between 200 and 400 percent of the FPL have private coverage (around 90 percent

in both Wisconsin and Illinois, for example). Second, the expansions of eligibility to children in

these higher income families were coupled with sometimes substantial premium contribution

requirements, which reduce the attractiveness of public coverage. Finally, the limited take-up of

public coverage among higher income children may reflect that public coverage is less palatable

to higher income families because of perceived stigma, a difference in the generosity or quality

of public compared to private coverage options, and concern about the long-term security of

public coverage availability.



Our estimates further suggest that roughly half of the newly eligible children who take up public

insurance were previously uninsured; that is, for every 100 children in families with incomes

between 200 and 400 percent of the FPL who are made eligible for public insurance 2 move

from being uninsured to having insurance coverage. Like take-up of public insurance among

eligible children, the change in uninsurance is relatively small, although statistically significant.

Because not all of the take-up of public insurance among eligible children is accounted for by

children who transfer from being uninsured to having public insurance, our results suggest that

there may be some crowd-out of private insurance coverage. Specifically, the upper bound

crowd-out rate we calculate is 46 percent; that is, for every 10 children who enroll in public

coverage, at most 5 are transfers from private coverage. Our lower bound estimate shows no

statistically significant reduction in private coverage from the expansions.




                                                  15
Our study has several limitations, most of which arise from the limitations of the CPS-ASEC

data. First, there is controversy about the time period to which insurance coverage information

obtained from the CPS-ASEC actually apply. Although the interview questions are intended to

elicit information from subjects about coverage during the preceding year, there is indirect

evidence suggesting that this is not the case (Swartz 1986). In this study, we considered the

coverage data to apply to the year of the interview. However, our results and conclusions did not

change when we considered the coverage data to refer to the year preceding the interview.

Second, some investigators have argued that distinctions between public coverage and non-group

(i.e., individual) private coverage in the CPS-ASEC data may not be reliable (LoSasso and

Buchmuller 2004) However, modifications in the interview instrument that were implemented in

the early part of this decade were specifically aimed at improving this distinction. In preliminary

analyses (data not shown), moreover, we found that reported non-group coverage behaved much

more like group coverage than like public coverage.



To conclude, our results indicate that states’ expansions of public eligibility to higher income

children were associated with limited uptake of public coverage and only a two percentage point

reduction in the uninsurance rate among these children. Not surprisingly, given the low uptake of

public coverage, crowd-out was limited as well. Indeed, concern over crowd-out appears to

provide no more a reason to restrict eligibility for public insurance among higher income

children than it does among lower income children.



Just as premiums for health insurance coverage purchased through the CHIP expansion programs

studied in this article are subsidized for low and middle income families, so too will premium




                                                16
costs be subsidized under the ACA for insurance coverage that families with incomes under 400

percent of the FPL purchase through health insurance exchanges. The results of this study

suggest that the availability of subsidized health insurance coverage for families with incomes up

to 400 percent of the FPL alone, in the absence of a mandate, will not solve the problem of the

uninsured.

1. Some states offered unsubsidized (full-cost) eligibility for public coverage for higher income

children.



2. We limit our sample to children in families with incomes below 400 FPL because children

above this threshold may be eligible to enroll in public insurance at full-cost; however, the

availability of these types of unsubsidized options for families are not comprehensively

documented. We restrict our attention to eligibility for subsidized public insurance. We exclude

children who appear to have neither a parent nor a grandparent in the household or who report

having Medicare.



3. Income disregards for 2002 through 2004 were extracted from the Urban Institute’s Transfer

Income Model, version 3 (TRIM3). Information on disregards for 2008 are taken from the Kaiser

Family Foundation’s State Health Facts website. We imputed income disregard values for

intervening years. For states in which the disregard amounts are the same in 2004 and 2008,

those values are assumed to have remained constant through the three year gap in data. For states

that changed the amount of income that could be disregarded, we assume that the change took

place in 2006.



4. Gruber and Simon (2009) provide a review of crowd-out estimates from various studies and

the calculations underlying them.
5. The narrow definition treats private coverage for children who report both types of coverage

as not being crowded-out and provides a lower bound on crowd out. The broad definition treats

the private coverage for children who have both types of coverage as being crowded-out and

provides an upper bound on crowd out.



6. We determined statistical significance using standard errors for the crowd-out estimates

calculated using the delta method.
