                                              ABSTRACT

Why do low-income individuals often oppose redistribution? We hypothesize that an aversion to being
in "last place" undercuts support for redistribution, with low-income individuals punishing those slightly
below themselves to keep someone "beneath" them. In laboratory experiments, we find support for
"last-place aversion" in the contexts of risk aversion and redistributive preferences. Participants choose
gambles with the potential to move them out of last place that they reject when randomly placed in
other parts of the distribution. Similarly, in money- transfer games, those randomly placed in second-to-last
place are the least likely to costlessly give money to the player one rank below. Last-place aversion
predicts that those earning just above the minimum wage will be most likely to oppose minimum-wage
increases as they would no longer have a lower-wage group beneath them, a prediction we confirm
using survey data.

1       Introduction

Individuals in low-income groups often seem to vote against their economic interests, even as their

shared circumstances would suggest that they would unite to demand greater redistribution. Ameri-

cans have expressed widespread support for repealing the estate tax and for tax reforms that largely

benefit those in the highest brackets (Bartels, 2008). Whereas the median-voter theorem (Meltzer

and Richard, 1981) predicts that the demand for redistribution grows with income inequality, the

large increases in inequality over the past thirty years have not led to greater support for redistri-

bution in the US (Kelly and Enns, 2010), the UK (Georgiadis and Manning, 2011), or other OECD

countries that have experienced rising inequality (Kenworthy and McCall, 2008).1

        Scholars have offered many explanations for the seeming inability of lower-income groups to

unite in support of redistributive policies.2 The Marxist notion of “false consciousness” holds that

the capitalist class promotes ideological concepts that blind the proletariat to their common inter-

ests (Engels, 1893). Similarly, Therston Veblen argued that members of the working class tend to

admire the “leisure class” and even mimic its habits—such as conspicuous consumption—instead

of identifying with members of their own class (Veblen, 1899). Especially in the American con-

text, scholars often argue that racial, ethnic or cultural divisions (Woodward 1955; Alesina et al.

2001; Frank 2004) as well as a belief in income mobility (Bénabou and Ok, 2001) limit support for

redistribution.

        This paper offers another explanation, which to our knowledge has not been formally explored

in past research. We hypothesize that there is a basic aversion to feeling that one is in “last place,”

which increases competition and inhibits political unity among members of lower-income groups.

Instead of uniting in pursuit of general redistribution, working-class groups may wish to punish

those who are slightly below or above themselves, with the hope of having at least one group to

“look down on.” As the probability of falling to the bottom of the income distribution decreases

with income, anxiety about relative position would be less of a concern for middle- and upper-class

individuals.

        Our work relates to the large literature, pioneered by Duesenberry (1949), suggesting that utility
    1

    When we refer to “redistributive policies” we mean policies explicitly designed to address economic inequality.
Of course, many policies redistribute resources from one group to another, and the recipients are often not the least
well off.


                                                         1
is related not only to absolute consumption or wealth but also to an individual’s relative position

in a given set of peers. Last-place aversion predicts that concerns about rank are most acute

at the bottom of the distribution, and thus that utility may be convex with respect to relative

position.3 While we focus on the implications of last-place aversion and not its potential origins, it

is consistent with the large social psychology literature on the power of shame and embarrassment

as social emotions: there is likely little shame in finishing near the middle, so the effect of rank on

shame should quickly diminish once someone moves from the bottom of the distribution.4

    We explore whether an aversion to being in last place can help predict economic phenomena

such as individuals’ preferences over risky versus risk-free payoffs and their preferences regarding

tax and transfer policies. We begin by defining a simple utility function that incorporates last-

place aversion (LPA) and then develop laboratory experiments to test its predictions for both

risk aversion and redistributive preferences. In the first experiment, subjects are randomly given

distinct dollar amounts and then shown the resulting “income” distribution. Each player is then

given the choice between receiving a payment with probability one and playing a two-outcome

lottery of equivalent expected value, where the “winning” outcome of the lottery will typically offer

the player the possibility of moving up in rank. We find that the probability of choosing the lottery

is uniform across the distribution except for the two lowest-placed players, who choose the lottery

more often. These results match the Nash equilbrium of the game when players are last-place averse:

the last-place player is willing to bear the risk of the lottery for the possibility of moving up in

rank, and the second-to-last-player is willing to do the same in order to defend his position.

    In the second set of experiments, players play two money-transfer games. In both games, in-

dividuals are randomly assigned a unique dollar amount, with each player separated by a single

dollar, and then shown the resulting distribution. The first game mimics a typical redistributive
    3
      To the extent non-linearities in the effect of relative position on utility have been explored in existing research,
they have generally been modeled as allowing the effect of the absolute index to vary with relative position, as in
(Clark and Oswald, 1998). For example, Card et al. (2010) find that the difference between own pay and median pay
in a sample of University of California employees has a larger effect for those below the median than those above.
In contrast, Luttmer (2005) finds that the effect of neighbors’ income is the same for individuals who are above and
below the median income in their MSA. Our model of utility in Section 2 focuses directly on rank and not deviations
in the absolute index from a given reference point. Zhou and Soman (2003) offer evidence consistent with concave
effects of relative position in a setting where rank is salient, demonstrating the the probability of an individual leaving
a queue depends more on the number of people behind than the number of people ahead of him, potentially suggesting
that individuals are more sensitive to being close to last place than close to first, though other interpretations are
possible.
    4
      See Goffman (1967) for an early treatment on the function of shame, who writes that “the emotion of embarrass-
ment or anticipation of embarrassment plays a prominent role in every social encounter.”

scheme where individuals are asked to contribute income to those at the bottom of the distribu-

tion. Specifically, we give players the choice between receiving an additional dollar themselves, or

having an additional two dollars added to the last-place player’s balance. As LPA predicts, the

second-to-last place person is the least likely to forgo the dollar.

   Players in the second game are again randomly assigned a place in an income distribution

where ranks are separated by a dollar. They are then given an additional $2, which they must

give to either the person directly above or below them. Giving to the person below means that the

individual herself will fall in rank. We find that the second-to-last-place person is the most likely

to give the extra two dollars to the person above her instead of the person below her, consistent

with LPA’s prediction that concern about relative status will be greatest for individuals who are

at risk of falling into last place. In both games, we can show that merely being in the bottom half

of the distribution does not explain the results—players must actually be close to last place—and

can generally reject inequality aversion as an alternative hypothesis.

   While the experiments allow us to test for LPA in a controlled setting, they cannot directly

speak to how individuals’ preferences over actual redistributive policies vary as a function of their

place in the income distribution. We thus formulate tests of LPA using survey data on support for

minimum wage increases. The minimum wage, by definition, defines the “last-place” wage that can

be legally paid in most labor markets. As such, LPA would predict limited support for increasing

the minimum wage among those with wages just above the current minimum—while their wage

would likely increase to the new minimum, they might now have the “last-place” wage. We find

exactly this pattern using data we collect from our own online survey and find similar results using

surveys on the minimum wage published by the Pew Research Center.

   The evidence from the money-transfer games as well as the minimum wage surveys highlights

why it might be surprisingly difficult to create a coalition in support of redistribution. Groups

close to the bottom of the distribution may only support policies that are rank-preserving, but

such policies may generate little enthusiasm among the lowest group. The minimum-wage results

suggest that even in cases where ranks are not reversed but merely condensed, redistribution may

find little support among those who could previously think of themselves as distinctly above last

place.

   Our results may also shed light on why certain risk-taking behaviors seem concentrated among

                                                   3
lower socio-economic groups. Consistent with LPA, recent work has found that low-income individ-

uals are more likely to play lotteries in laboratory settings when they are primed to think about

their poverty (Haisley et al., 2008). Alternatively, poverty could lead to risk-taking behaviors such

as crime or early initiation of sexual activity because those who would be in “last place” by conven-

tional standards such as income begin to seek status based on alternative norms, as in the model

of Oxoby (2004).

      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple utility function

that allows for last-place aversion. Sections 3 and 4 describe, respectively, the lottery experiment

and the money-transfer experiments, and derive and test predictions from the model in Section 2.

Section 5 presents the results from survey data on minimum wage increases. Section 6 discusses the

potential implications of last-place aversion for behaviors beyond those we study in this paper and

offers concluding thoughts.


2     A simple model of last-place aversion

In this section, we define a utility function that incorporates last-place aversion. The purpose of

this section is merely to describe the properties of this function, and not to explain why individuals

might be last-place averse. It might be an innate human trait, or it might be a conditioned response

to seeing that individuals in last place are treated poorly, or it might have an alternative origin.

We take LPA as given and incorporate it into a simple utility function, which we will later use to

generate predictions regarding how individuals will behave in different settings.


2.1     Individual utility under last-place aversion

Consider a finite number of individuals with income levels y1 , y2 , ..., yN , and let yL be the income

of the lowest-income person. Let the utility of person i be defined by:


                                  u(yi ) = (1 − α)f (yi ) + α1(yi > yL ),                           (1)


where f 0 > 0, f 00 < 0, α ∈ [0, 1] and    1(yi > yL ) is an indicator function that takes the value
of one if an individual is not in last place and zero if she is in last place. Essentially, utility is a

weighted average of a typical concave utility function and a bonus payment to all but the last-place


                                                    4
individual. As α → 0, the function approaches a standard, non-reference-dependent utility function,

and as α → 1, the only factor that determines utility is whether one is in or out of last place. For

convenience, we will sometimes call the first term the “standard term” of the utility function and

the second term the “LPA term” of the utility function.

      Now, consider a small δ-perturbation in income for individuals i. If yi >> yL or yi = yL <<

yL+1 , where yL+1 is the income of the second-to-last person, then the change in utility is merely

(1 − α)f 0 (yi )δ. As such, LPA will typically not affect the decisions of an individual with income far

above that of the last-place person or a last-place person so far behind the next person that he can

never catch up.

      In contrast, if yi − yL < δ, then a loss of δ income—which would put individual i in last

place—yields a utility loss of (1 − α)f 0 (yi )δ + α. Similarly, if yi = yL > yL+1 − δ, then a gain of

δ, which would move i from last place, yields a utility gain of (1 − α)f 0 (yi )δ + α. Therefore, as an

individual approaches the last-place person from above or as the last-place person approaches the

second-to-last-place person from below the change in the LPA term of the utility expression grows

relative to that of the standard term.

      The analysis above suggests that for individuals in or close to last place, standard results may no

longer hold. For example, the last-place person should have a heightened tendency to accept gambles

that provide a possibility of rank improvement, whereas absolute risk-aversion is generally believed

to decrease with wealth (Arrow, 1971). Similarly, warm-glow models (Andreoni, 1990, Andreoni,

1989) predict that most people would choose to costlessly give money to a poorer individual, but

LPA would diminish this tendency for individuals who are themselves close to last place.


2.2     Discussion

In equation (1), there is an increase in utility associated with moving out of last place, and then

no further effect of relative position. An alternative utility function that captures the spirit of

last-place aversion could incorporate a more continuous function of relative position:


                                         u(yi , ri ) = f (yi ) + g(ri ),                             (2)




                                                       5
where ri is individual i’s relative position. Preferences similar to last-place aversion would be

reflected in the shape of g—past work suggests that utility is increasing in relative position (g 0 > 0)

but last-place aversion would suggest that g(·) is also concave and that its gradient is very large

for small values of r (i.e., for individuals close to the bottom of the distribution) but then quickly

flattens out.

    Such a g(·) function would be difficult to distinguish empirically from last-place aversion, espe-

cially in settings without a large number of distinct ranks. In general, our empirical work will not

focus on distinguishing last-place aversion from more general “low-rank” aversion that could be

generated by certain g(·) functions, but will seek to show that last-place or low-rank aversion can

be separately identified from a range of alternative hypotheses such as reference-dependent models

where the median acts as a reference point and inequality-aversion models.


3   Experimental evidence of last-place aversion: making risky choices

Although preferences over redistribution motivate the paper, the model in Section 2 also has direct

implications for individuals’ willingness to bear risk. These predictions provide a useful opportunity

to test the model in a context outside of the one we originally sought to explain while offering

support for the impact of last-place aversion on a wider set of behaviors. In this section, we conduct

an experiment that tests whether individuals choose to bear risk in return for the possibility of

moving out of last place that they choose to forgo when placed in other parts of the distribution.

    Our guiding principle in this and the later experiments is to create an environment that biases us

against finding LPA, so that any evidence we find in support of the model would not be an artifact

of a particular aspect of our experimental design. First, as shame or embarrassment may motivate

individuals’ desire to avoid last place, we take several steps to promote players’ privacy during the

game. Players never interact face-to-face, but instead through computers, and they generate their

own screen names and are thus free to protect their identity. Each individual sits in a separate

carrel, with large blinders placed around each carrel, which should further enhance privacy and

anonymity. Players are not publicly paid at the end of the game and instead money is given to

them while they are still sitting in their carrels.

    Second, all of the experiments involve an initial assignment to a rank, and we make clear to



                                                      6
participants that this assignment is done randomly by a computer. We believe the emphasis on

random assignment should diminish LPA by discouraging players from associating rank and merit.


3.1          Data and experimental design

Participants (N = 72) sign up by registering online at the Harvard Business School Computer Lab

for Experimental Research (CLER). See Appendix Table 1 for demographic summary statistics

as well as more detailed information on eligibility requirements for registration and payment of

participants.

          We randomly divide participants into twelve groups of six in order to play a multi-round game.

At the beginning of the game, the computer randomly assigns each player in the group a rank, and

endows them with an amount of money that corresponds to that rank. The monetary endowment

decreases by 25 cents for each lower rank, such that the player in first place receives $3.00, the

player in second place receives $2.75 and the player in sixth place receives $1.75. Ranks and actual

dollar amounts of all players are common knowledge and clearly displayed throughout the game.

          Next, participants play a series of rounds. At the start of each round, the computer presents an

identical two-option choice set to all players in the game. The first option adds a stated amount

of money to a player’s balance with probability one. The second option offers participants the

opportunity to play a two-outcome lottery, whereby they gain a stated amount with probability
3/4       and lose a stated amount with probability 1/4. After players have submitted their choices, the

computer makes independent draws from the common P (win) = 3/4 probability distribution for

each player who chose the lottery and adds the risk-free amount to the balance of each player who

did not choose the lottery. The new balances and ranks are displayed and the game repeats. We

include the instructions as well as a typical screen-shot of the game in Appendix A.

          Each round, the payoffs associtated with the two options are calculated in a particular manner.

The payment players can receive with probability one is always equal to half the difference between

the current balance of the last-place player and the second-to-last-place player. The “winning”

payment of the lottery is always equal to the difference between the current balances of the last-

place and the fourth-place player. The “losing” outcome of the lottery is set so that the lottery and

the certain payment offered in the first option are equal in expected value.5
      5
          Let δ6 , δ5 , δ4 be the current balances of the sixth- (last-) place player, the fifth-place player, and the fourth-place


                                                                   7
    The payoffs are designed so that last-place players always have the opportunity to accept a

gamble that offers the possibility of moving out of last place, holding all other players’ balances

constant, and, usually, even if the second-to-last-place player took the certain amount.6 In contrast,

taking the certain amount never allows the last-place player to improve his rank, holding other

player balances constant, and in fact only allows a rank improvement if the second-to-last player

chooses the lottery and loses.

    As an example, consider a round in which players begin with the following balances: $6, $6.50,

$7, $7.50, $8, $8.50. They would then all receive the following instructions:


                                     In this round, which would you prefer?

  (i) Win $.25 with 100 percent probability.

 (ii) Win $1.00 with 75 percent probability and lose $2.00 with 25 percent probability.


As described above, the two options have identical expected values (0.75 ∗ 1 − 0.25 ∗ 2 = 0.25).

Similarly, the certain payment is half the difference between the two lowest-ranked players’ balances

(0.5 ∗ (6.50 − 6) = 0.25) and the winning amount of the lottery is the difference between the fourth-

ranked and last-place player (7 − 6 = 1).

    Each game consists of nine rounds, but participants are not told how many rounds the game

entails to avoid end effects.7 Participants are told that one randomly selected player will be paid

his balance from one randomly selected round. Note that while every game begins with the initial

winning prize of the gamble set at $.50, in all subsequent rounds the prize depends on the outcomes

of past rounds and tends to grow over time as the differences between ranks grow in terms of

absolute dollars. The average winning prize in the final (ninth) round is $6.00.8
player, respectively. We define the payment individuals can receive with probability one as θcertain = δ5 −δ   2
                                                                                                                  6
                                                                                                                     and the
payment individuals receive if they win the lottery as θwin = δ4 − δ6 . Thus θlose is determined by setting the expected
value of the lottery equal to the certain payment: 34 θwin − 14 θlose = θcertain . Note that θcertain need not be a whole
number and in such cases we round up to the nearest penny.
    6
      If x equals the balance the sixth-place player will have in the next round conditional on winning the gamble,
and y the balance of the fifth-place player if he takes the certain amount, then x > y ⇔ δ4 > δ5 + δ5 −δ     2
                                                                                                                6
                                                                                                                    ⇔ 2δ4 >
3δ5 − δ6 ⇔ 2(δ4 − δ5 ) > δ5 − δ6 . This condition holds in over 58 percent of the rounds.
    7
      In many experimental settings, subjects play differently when they know they are playing the final round of the
game. See Rapoport and Dale (1966) for an early treatment of so-called “end effects.”
    8
      The fact that the average prize in the final round rounds to a a whole dollar is merely a coincidence: after the
first or second round, the algorithm for determining the θs based on the balances of the sixth-, fifth- and fourth-
place players rarely produces round dollar amounts or even amounts that are multiples of five or ten cents. As a
consequence, the math involved in any optimization becomes more difficult as the game progresses.




                                                             8
      The game generates considerable shuffling between ranks. For example, the median player ex-

periences four distinct ranks throughout a game and the average round results in 57 percent of

players having a different rank than they did the previous round.


3.2     Predictions

Below, we discuss how the model in Section 2 predicts players of different ranks will decide whether

to choose the lottery over the certain payment. To demonstrate the basic intuition, we will assume

in this section that players make their decision either holding other players’ balances constant or

believing that other players are playing a fixed strategy. In Appendix B, we generate the same

predictions by solving for the Nash equilibrium of the game.


3.2.1     Last-place player

Consider the decision of the last-place player with balance y = yL and utility function as described

in Section 2. Holding other players’ balances constant, he chooses to gamble whenever:


                 (1 − α)( 14 f (y − θlose ) + 34 f (y + θwin )) + 34 α > (1 − α)f (y + θcertain ),


or
                         3α
                               > f (y + θcertain ) − ( 14 f (y − θlose ) + 34 f (y + θwin )).        (3)
                      4(1 − α)

      As α → 1, and thus LPA increases, his propensity to gamble grows. As the θs are set such

that two decisions have equal expected value, the right-hand side of equation (3) is merely the

utility of a certain quantity minus the expected utility of a lottery with equal expected value and

is thus always positive so long as individuals are risk averse. Therefore, as risk-aversion falls the

right-hand-side goes to zero and the propensity to gamble also increases.


3.2.2     Second-to-last-place player

The second-to-last-place player should never gamble if he assumes that the last-place player never

gambles—he gains nothing from the LPA term of the utility expression and any amount of risk-

aversion should lead him to reject the gamble based on the standard term of the utility expression.



                                                        9
   Now, suppose the second-to-last-place player assumes the last-place player always gambles.

Then, he will choose to gamble whenever:


3                       1 3                      3
4 ((1−α)f (y+θwin )+α)+ 4 ( 4 (1−α)f (y−θlose )+ 4 ((1−α)(f (y−θlose )+α)         > (1−α)f (y+θcertain )+ 14 α


or, after some algebra,

                       9α
                              > f (y + θcertain ) − ( 34 f (y − θlose ) + 14 f (y + θwin )).              (4)
                    16(1 − α)

   Therefore, again, for α sufficiently close to one, the second-to-last player will always take the

gamble under the specified assumptions. Whether, for the same α, he will more often gamble than

the last-place player depends on how quickly absolute risk aversion diminishes—while the left-hand

side of equation (3) is always greater than that of equation (4), the right-hand side of equation (4)

is smaller than that of equation (3) so long as absolute risk aversion diminishes with income.


3.2.3   Other players

By construction θwin allows the last-place player to attain the current earnings of the fourth-place

player, so choosing the certain option of θcertain will always allow the fourth-place player to remain

at least higher than the current last-place player. Thus, there is no reason for her to bear the risk

of the gamble and she will take the certain option. By the same logic, so will everyone above her.


3.2.4   Summary of predictions

The last-place player will gamble given sufficiently high values of α, the weight on the last-place-

aversion term of the utility expression. Similarly, for sufficiently large α as well as a belief that the

last-place player will gamble, the second-to-last-place player will also gamble. In Appendix B, we

show that these two players will each play a mixed strategy between choosing the lottery and the

certain payment, whereas all other players will choose the certain payment.

   Of course, participants may have considerations beyond their actual payoffs when deciding

between the lottery and the certain payment. For example, they may choose the lottery merely

because adding an element of chance makes the game less boring. Alternatively, players may care



                                                      10
about rank beyond merely avoiding last place, and choose to gamble in the middle of higher parts of

the distribution in order to catch the person above them. As such, some higher-ranked players will

likely choose the lottery as well, but LPA predicts that the last- and second-to-last-place players

should do so at measurably higher rates.


3.3      Results

3.3.1      Basic graphs

Figure 1 shows the share of individuals who choose to gamble, by their rank at the time they make

the decision. The first series includes all rounds of play. The highest-ranked four players choose the

lottery option at very similar rates—just over 40 percent of the time. The last two players, however,

gamble at a higher rate—the fifth-place player chooses the lottery just over sixty percent of the

time and the last-place player just under sixty percent.

       The second series excludes observations from the first two rounds, as players may need time

to understand how the game works even after hearing the instructions. Given past work showing

preferences are more stable as subjects gain experience, we will often show results with the first two

rounds excluded in addition to results with all rounds included.9 The patterns are all very similar,

though in general players seem to gamble at slightly higher rates in the first few rounds. The higher

gambling rates may reflect the fact that the absolute value of the stakes tend to rise as the game

unfolds, though they may also reflect players simply “trying out their luck” in the beginning of a

game.

       Figure 1 also plots p-values from comparing the decisions made at each rank to those made by

the last- and second-to-last place player. These results are based on OLS regressions with standard

errors clustered by player.10 All but one are significant at the ten-percent level (the exception

is rank = 4 when the first two rounds are excluded, with p = 0.157). Overall, these results are

consistent with our predictions that the two lowest-ranked players will bear the cost of additional

risk in an attempt to escape or avoid last place.

Regression results

Table 1 displays results from probit regression analysis. Col. (1) shows that the basic result from

Figure 1 holds when round fixed effects are included. Players in fifth or last-place gamble at a

significantly higher rate than more highly ranked players, and this effect remains after excluding

the first two rounds (col. 2).

       Col. (3) includes only the first round. While there may indeed be more noise in the first round,

one reason to focus on it is that it is the only round where ranks are determined purely via random

assignment and are not in part the consequence of past play. Including only the first round increases

the coefficient on the variable of interest.

       Col. (4) includes all rounds, but adds controls for players’ current balance, as well as the “win-

ning payment” of the lottery and the “certain payment” they can instead receive with probability

one.11 Including these controls increases the magnitude of the coefficient of interest slightly, relative

to that in col. (1).

       A potential confound in the game is that the winning amount of the lottery is equal to the

difference between the fourth-place and last-place players’ balances and thus is not set based on

higher-ranked players’ ability to move up in rank. We can test whether this confound is driving the

heightened tendencies of the lowest-ranked players to gamble by focusing only on the first round,

where the balance differences between players are all equal and thus the lottery provides all players

outside of first place the same opportunity to move up in rank. As seen in col. (3), the coefficient

of interest is actually larger in this sample.

       We nonetheless further probe this potential confound in col. (5) by explicitly controlling for

whether a player could “catch” the next player: that is, for whether the winning amount is greater

than the gap between him and the player above him. As this variable is only defined for those with

a player above them, we exclude the first-place player. Comparing cols. (4) and (5) shows that the

coefficient of interest is unchanged—in fact, the slight decrease in col. (5) is entirely due to the

different sample (running the col. 4 specification on the col. 5 sample yields a coefficient of 0.419).

As this control does not affect the variable of interest and requires us to drop the first-place player,
  11
    Note that current balances vary at the individual level, while the latter two variables vary at the round-game
level. As such, all variables can be identified even though the regressions always include round fixed effects.




                                                       12
we exclude it from the rest of the regressions.12

       In col. (6) we explore whether the effect on the last-place and fifth-place players predicted by the

LPA model can be separated from a more general effect of being below the median. We will return

to this question throughout the paper, as we seek to separate LPA from models where individuals

merely want to be in the top half of the distribution. While adding an indicator variable for being

below the median in the six-person distribution (i.e., in fourth, fifth or last place) reduces the

coefficient of interest slightly from its level in col. (5), it remains positive and highly significant.

       In col. (7) we test whether the effects that we interpret as LPA can instead be explained by in-

equality aversion. Following Fehr and Schmidt (1999), we assume that for player i “disadvantageous”
                              P
inequality is proportional to j6=i max{xj − xi , 0} and “advantageous” inequality is proportional to
P
  j6=i max{xi − xj , 0}, and that the two types of inequality can have different effects on individual

utility. We then calculate the expected value of the two terms under two scenarios: (1) player i

plays the lottery and all other players take the safe option; (2) player i takes the safe option, as

do all other players. For each player, we calculate the difference in disadvantageous (advantageous)

inequality under these two scenarios, and use this difference as a proxy for the net effect of his

decision on disadvantageous (advantageous) inequality.

       The results in col. (7) suggest that these controls have no effect on the propensity of the last two

players to play the lottery. While neither of the coefficients is significant, we note that the estimated

effect of disadvantageous inequality is not of the expected sign—when playing the lottery would

seem to increase disadvantageous inequality, players are slightly more likely to choose the lottery

regardless.13

       In col. (8) we evaluate LPA versus a more general model where rank has a continuous effect

on utility, as described in equation (2). While the two effects are jointly significant (p = 0.002),

neither is individually significant at conventional levels, though the “last or fifth place” dummy is
  12
     Readers may wonder why we designed the game in such a way that this confound would exist. The alternative
would be setting the lottery payoffs differently for each rank. However, doing so then introduces its own confound,
that any differences across rank in the probability of choosing the lottery could be driven by the fact that the lotteries
themselves are in fact different across ranks.
  13
     We experimented with many other specifications to explore the potential effects of inequality aversion, all of
which are available upon request. We calculated the differences in the inequality-aversion terms assuming that: (1)
player i plays the lottery while all j 6= i have their balance held constant, which might be an approximation that
players use; (2) that player i wins the lottery while all j 6= i takes the certain payment; (3) that i wins while all j’s
are held constant. We also simply included the level of each player’s advantageous and disadvantageous inequality at
the start of each round. In none of these specifications does the coefficient on the effect of being in the lowest two
ranks drop below 0.43.


                                                           13
far closer (p = 0.193 versus p = 0.384). With only six ranks, it is difficult to precisely estimate

the effect of both a linear rank term and an indicator variable for being in the bottom two ranks.

Moreover, as we show in Appendix Table 2, when only the first round—which is based on pure

random assignment— is included, the effect of being in the bottom two ranks is highly significant

even when linear rank is included.

      Appendix Table 2 shows that the coefficients of interest in the key Table 1 specifications increase

when demographic controls are added, relative to specifications estimated on the same sample but

without demographic controls. The only demographic variable that is itself significant is political

orientation, with more liberal participants less likely to choose the lottery. The table also shows

that the results are robust to including individual fixed effects in a conditional logit estimation. We

do not emphasize these results because the specification uses no between-participant variation, and

it is the between-participant variation that is at least initially driven by pure random assignment.

The final three columns show that when only the first round is included, LPA can be separately

distinguished from not only a linear-rank effect, as noted in the previous paragraph, but also a

below-the-median effect and inequality aversion.

      We also investigated whether the coefficient of interest was larger among certain subgroups,

though we do not report the results. We found no statistically significant patterns, though insuffi-

cient power is likely a hindrance. The interaction term that comes closest to statistical significance

(p = 0.117) suggests that being religious may mitigate the tendency of low-ranked players to choose

the lottery.


3.4     A note on the dynamic design of the game

We chose to design the experiment as a dynamic game, where the outcomes in all rounds except the

first are determined in part by the decisions individuals made in the previous round, as opposed

to re-randomizing balances each round. This design better mimics the dynamics of the income

distribution, where individuals may be able to improve their position slightly from year to year on

the basis of sound decisions or luck. Re-randomization, in contrast, would imply that a millionaire

and a minimum-wage worker would have the same expected income the following year.

      There are two drawbacks to this decision. First, variation in rank is in part endogenous. While

not ideal, this endogeneity does not appear to matter greatly in practice. As shown in col. (3),

                                                    14
the last-place effect is actually larger in the first round, when rank is purely a function of random

assignment, suggesting our results are not being driven by this endogeneity. It likely has limited

effect because half the players choose the lottery each round, creating a large random component

to players’ balances and ranks even after the first round.

       The second drawback is that the dynamic setting makes it more difficult to draw sharp pre-

dictions from the model. Given that players are paid based on one randomly chosen round and

that they do not know when the game will end, they should weigh both the immediate effect of

their decision on the subsequent round as well as the effect on later rounds. They likely weigh

the immediate effects more heavily as they know the current distribution with certainty and can

only guess at the distribution in later rounds. Moreover, past work has shown that players tend to

maximize current payoffs even in multi-round games where the payoff is explicitly based on the final

balance.14 We thus, as readers may have noted, derive our predictions in Section 3.2 and Appendix

B assuming that players play each round as if it is the one that “counts,” though obviously that is

a simplifying approximation.


3.5      Discussion

The evidence from this experiment provides support for the predictions of the last-place-aversion

model. The last-place player chooses to bear additional risk for the opportunity to move up in rank,

and the second-to-last-place player chooses to bear risk in order to defend his current position. We

also find no evidence that the results can better be explained by players’ desire to be in the top

half of the distribution. Players in first through fourth place exhibit almost identical tendencies to

choose the lottery over the risk-free payment. As such, a prospect-theory model where the reference

point is the middle of the distribution—so that individuals below the reference are risk-loving and

those above risk-averse—would not appear to explain the results.

       The results in this section contrast with the standard result that absolute risk-aversion dimin-

ishes with wealth, and with experimental findings that individuals exhibit diminishing absolute risk
  14
    Benartzi and Thaler (1995) argue that due to myopia and mental accounting, individuals maximize current
payoffs even in settings where the salient outcome is the final future payoff. Gneezy and Potters (1997) show that
individuals tend to maximize over an “evaluation period.” Since we inform all players of the new balances each round,
each round is an evaluation period in our experiment and thus players would play each game as if it is one-shot.
Camerer et al. (1993) use software that allows them to record the information players are viewing as they play a game.
They conclude that even in a sequential game that is relatively simple to solve via backward induction, “subjects
concentrated on the current round when making decisions.”

aversion with respect to laboratory earnings.15 In our experiment, the two players with the lowest

earnings play the lottery most often. Our results thus suggest that the relationship between wealth

and risk-aversion may depend on whether individuals view wealth in an absolute or relative sense.


4        Experimental evidence of last-place aversion: preferences over redistribution

In this section, we return to our original motivation, determining how relative position affects

individuals’ preference for redistributive policies. We present two experiments that explore how

support for redistribution toward either the last-place player, or toward lower-placed players more

generally, vary by rank. The first experiment better mimics common redistributive policies—where

general revenue is raised from the entire population and then directed to the least well-off—but

is a less demanding test of the last-place aversion model. The second experiment provides a more

demanding test of last-place aversion but does not have an obvious policy parallel.


4.1         First money-transfer game: redistribution toward the last-place player

4.1.1         Experimental design

As in the lottery game, the game begins with players (N = 24, divided into four six-player games)

being randomly assigned dollar amounts, in this case $1, $2,...,$6. As before, the ranks and current

balances of all players are common knowledge throughout the game.

         Each player is then given a choice between receiving an extra dollar for herself, or having the

last-place player receive an extra two dollars. In both cases, the money comes from a separate

account and not from the player or any other player. Given that this choice is not well-defined for

the last-place player himself, we give him the choice between keeping the dollar and giving money

to the second-to-last-place player. As only his choice does not involve giving to a less-well-off player,

we generally do not focus on his decision. The instructions and a typical screen-shot from the game

appear in Appendix C.

         After players make their decisions, one player is randomly chosen and his choice determines

the final payoffs of that round. As such, players should make their decisions as if they alone will

determine the final distribution of the round. Players do not know which player is chosen each
    15
         See, for example, Levy (1994) for evidence of diminishing absolute risk aversion in laboratory settings.



                                                              16
round or the outcome of the round. After the end of each round, players are re-randomized across

the same $1, $2,...,$6 distribution and the game repeats. Players are not told how many rounds

there will be, but in practice each game consisted of nine rounds, where the first is a practice round.

They are paid their final balances for one randomly chosen round.


4.1.2      Changes from the lottery experiment

We decided to make several changes based on experience from the lottery experiment. First, in this

and the later redistribution experiments, we re-randomize balances after each round, making the

experiment a series of one-shot games as opposed to the dynamic design of the lottery experiment.

While, as noted earlier, re-randomization poorly captures the dynamics of the income distribution, it

allows us to draw predictions without having to make assumptions regarding players’ time horizons.

       Second, instead of implementing all players’ decisions simultaneously, after each round one

player is randomly chosen to have his decision implemented, so a player need not take into account

other players’ decisions when making his own decision. We made this design choice largely to follow

existing literature, where risk-taking in group settings is often investigated using game shows and

other competitions, where strategic concerns are salient, but preferences over redistribution are

often elicited using Dictator games, where players need not consider the actions of others.16


4.1.3      Predictions

Standard utility maximization would predict that all players keep the additional dollar themselves.

Models in which players try to maximize total surplus would predict all players forgo the $1 in

order to create two dollars for the last-place player. Reference-dependent models might predict

that players’ behavior changes once they have reached a certain reference point, such as the median

of the distribution. Inequality aversion as parameterized in the Fehr-Schmidt model predicts that

the probability of keeping the additional dollar is decreasing in rank.17
  16
     See Gertner (1993) and Metrick (1995) for two early papers using game shows to investigate risk-aversion. See
Camerer (2003) for a review of past work using the Dictator game to elicit redistributive preferences. Of course, we
cannot know for sure whether players still think about what other players are likely to do when they make their own
decisions, even though we emphasize in the instructions that if they are chosen only their decision is implemented.
  17
     Recall that the Fehr-Schmidt P model assumes that individuals are especially sensitive to “disadvantageous in-
equality,” which is proportional to j6=i max{xj − xi , 0}. For the first-place player, keeping the dollar has no effect on
this sum; for the second place player, keeping it decreases the sum by one; for the third-place player, by two, and so
on. Forgoing the additional dollar increases the sum by one for the second-to-last-place player (the last-place player
now has $1 than he does) and by two for the last-place player (the second-to-last-place player now has $3 more than


                                                           17
    Last-place aversion predicts that the second-to-last-place player will be the least likely to forgo

the $1, as doing so would result in his moving to last place. The empirical work that follows attempts

to separate LPA from the models described above.


4.1.4     Results

Figure 2 plots the probability a participant forgoes the extra $1, by the participant’s rank. As

before, we show results for all rounds as well as results when the first two rounds are removed, as

players may need a few rounds to understand the game. The p-values—based on an OLS regression

with the second-to-last player the omitted category—are also plotted. For completeness, we include

the sixth-place player in this figure, even though her choice is not parallel to that of all other ranks.

    The shape of Figure 2 is broadly consistent with the predictions of LPA. The top half of the

distribution is most likely to sacrifice for the benefit of the last-place player—roughly forty percent

of the time, players in these positions forgo the extra dollar for themselves so that the last-place

player can receive an additional $2. This tendency falls slightly for the fourth-place player and is

lowest for the second-to-last-place player, who forgoes the extra dollar only ten percent of the time.

As documented by the p-values on the figure, the pairwise differences between the second-to-last-

place player and more highly-ranked players are generally statistically significant.

    Table 2 shows results from probit regression analysis. All regressions include round fixed effects

and a dummy variable for the last-place player, since her choice is not parallel to other ranks. Col.

(1) shows that, relative to all other higher ranks, the second-to-last-place player is significantly less

likely to forgo the additional dollar. In col. (2), the effect increases after excluding the first two

rounds.

    Col. (3) shows that controlling for whether a player is currently below the median substantially

reduces this effect, though col. (4) shows that after the first two rounds the effect of being in

second-to-last place regains its significance.

    Cols. (5) and (6) explore the effect of inequality aversion. As in the previous section, we cal-

culate the change in advantageous and disadvantageous inequality when a person decides to forgo

versus keep the additional dollar. Given the payoffs of the game, these two variables are a linear
he does), but has no effect for higher-ranked players. Therefore, the net effect of keeping the additional dollar is to
decrease disadvantageous inequality by 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 for, respectively, players in ranks one through six.



                                                          18
transformation of each other, so we only include the change in disadvantageous inequality. The

coefficient suggests that the greater the net increase in disadvantageous inequality associated with

forgoing the additional dollar, the more likely players will keep the dollar. As noted earlier, the

net effect on disadvantageous inequality from forgoing the dollar is decreasing in rank, so it is not

surprising that including this measure in col. (5) reduces the effect of being in second-to-last place.

In col. (6) the first two rounds are excluded and the coefficient of interest regains its significance.

   In cols. (7) and (8) we see whether the effect of being in second-to-last place can be separated

from a general linear trend in rank. Including this measure in col. (7) reduces the coefficient on the

second-to-last-place indicator from its magnitude in col. (8), but it regains its statistical significant

in col. (6) when the first two rounds are excluded.

   In Appendix Table 3 we show that adding covariates to the main Table 2 specifications always

increases the magnitude of the effect of being in second-to-last place. It also shows the main result

holds when a player-fixed-effect model is estimated via conditional logit. We prefer the estimates

in Table 2 because with only eight rounds, ranks are not balanced across players and thus between-

player variation is still useful.

   Allowing the second-to-last-place coefficient to vary for different subgroups of the data does not

yield any evidence that certain groups are driving the effect. In regressions where we interact the

second-to-last-place variable with, sequentially, gender, age, political views and religious views, the

coefficients on the interaction terms are never close to conventional levels of signficance.


4.1.5   Discussion

The results from this first redistribution are generally consistent with last-place aversion. The

second-to-last player is indeed the least generous to the last-place player. While we cannot always

separate this effect from a below-the-median effect, inequality aversion, or a more general effect

of rank, given the small sample size (this experiment was the least well attended of all four that

we conducted) even a small amount of noise would make such a separation difficult. When early

rounds—which we suspect are noisier as players are still learning the game—are removed, the effect

of being in second-to-last place can be distinguished from these alternative stories.

   Given that many redistributive or poverty-alleviation policies (e.g., food stamps, Medicaid,

Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) raise revenue from the general population and then

                                                   19
transfer it to the least well-off, studying individuals’ tendency to transfer money to a last-place

player may indeed help explain variation across the income distribution in support for redistributive

policies. But while this game might approximate typical policies, it has at least one important

limitation in testing last-place aversion as a more general theory of behavior. The game potentially

confounds disutility regarding moving down in rank with any last-place-aversion effect since only

the fifth-place player actually moves down in rank by giving the $2 to the last-place person. This

confounding effect might also impact the decision of the fourth-place person, since giving the last-

place person $2 means she would now be tied with the formerly last-place person for second-to-last

place. Players in all other ranks never move down in the distribution by forgoing the $1. We thus

design a game that tests how sensitivity to moving down a rank varies by rank.


4.2     Second redistribution game

The objective of this game is not to mimic any particular redistributive policy, but rather to test

last-place aversion in a more demanding setting. This game focuses on how individuals treat the

players directly above and below them, and how these decisions vary by rank.


4.2.1    Experimental design

The game is identical to the first money-transfer game (players are randomly assigned across dollar

amounts $1, $2,...,$6; there is re-randomization after each round; decisions are completely confi-

dential; players do not learn the outcome of the round) except we change the two redistributive

outcomes between which players must choose. Each player ranked two through five must choose

between giving the player directly above or directly below them an additional $2. The first-place

player decides between the second- and third-place player, and the last-place player decides be-

tween the fourth- and fifth-place player. These choice sets are summarized in Table 3. As before,

the additional $2 comes from a separate account and not from the player herself. In the interest

of space, we do not show a screen-shot of this game but, aside from the different choice sets, it is

identical to that of the first money-transfer game.




                                                 20
4.2.2      Predictions

Unlike the previous money-transfer game, this game does not allow players to keep extra money

themselves. Their choice set is limited to giving an extra $2 to one of two other players. As such,

pure self-interest does not obviously push them toward one choice or the other, as their balance

remains at its initial level regardless of their decision. Furthermore, because total surplus is held

constant, players do not face an equity-efficiency trade-off, as in Engelmann and Strobel (2004).

       Inequality aversion would predict that all players in ranks one through five give to the lower-

ranked player. In fact, the game is constructed so that the net effect of giving to the lower-ranked

person on the standard Fehr-Schmidt inequality terms is constant for ranks one through five.18 As

such, any variation among these five ranks in the probability of giving to the lower-ranked player

cannot be explained by standard inequality aversion.

       By construction, giving to the lower-ranked player in their choice set causes all players except

the first and last to drop one rank in the distribution. LPA predicts that dropping in rank would

have the largest psychic cost for the second-to-last-place player, and thus we predict that individuals

will be the least likely to give to the lower-ranked player when they themselves are in second-to-last

place.


4.2.3      Initial results

Figure 3 shows how the probability a player gives the additional $2 to the lower-ranked player in his

choice set varies by rank. Overall, players choose to give to the lower-ranked player in their choice

set 75 percent of the time. This probability varies from over eighty percent in the top half of the

distribution, to less than sixty percent for the second-to-last place player. Players are the least likely
  18
     To see this, note that for ranks two through five, giving to the lower-ranked player increases disadvantageous
inequality by one, whereas giving to the higher-ranked player increases it by two, so the net effect of giving to the
lower- versus higher-ranked player is a decrease in disadvantageous inequality of one. For rank one, giving to the
higher-ranked player in the choice set (rank two) increases disadvantageous inequality by one, whereas giving to
the lower-ranked player (rank three) does not change it, so for the first-place player the net effect of giving to the
lower-ranked player is to decrease disadvantageous inequality by one. For advantageous inequality, ranks two through
five decrease this term by one if they give to the lower-ranked player and have no effect on it if they give to the
higher-ranked player, so the net effect of giving to the lower-ranked player is a decrease of one. The first-place player
decreases advantageous inequality by two if he gives to the lower-ranked player and by one if he gives to the higher-
ranked player, so the net effect of giving to the lower-ranked player is a decrease of one. To summarize, for ranks
one through five, the net effect of giving to the lower-ranked player is to decrease disadvantageous and advantageous
inequality by one. As players are assumed to dislike both types of inequality, inequality-aversion would suggest that
all these players always give to the lower-ranked player in their choice set.




                                                           21
to give to the last-place player when they are in second-to-last place and this difference is pairwise

significant for the first-, third- and last-place players, and marginally significant (p = 0.120) for the

second-place player. Those ranked fourth are nearly equally likely to deny the $2 to the lower-ranked

player, though the difference grows somewhat when the first two rounds are eliminated.

   The first- and last-place players are the most likely to give to the lower-ranked player in their

choice set, consistent with their not facing an equality-rank trade-off. The first-place player is the

most likely to give to the lower-ranked player—concerns over rank and inequality both push him

toward giving money to the third- instead of the second-place player. The player in the bottom half

of the distribution most likely to give to the lower-ranked player in his choice set is the last-place

player, consistent with his being able to give money to the lower-ranked player without changing

his rank, as he remains in last place regardless of his decision.

   Table 4 presents probit regression results. In all cases, round fixed effects and separate dummy

variables for the first- and last-place players are included, since these two players do not have

parallel choice sets to those of other ranks. Col. (1) shows that adding round fixed-effects does

not change the general patterns in Figure 3. The fifth-place player is less generous than the other

ranks. However, col. (2) shows that, as in the figure, this effect is largely driven by players in the

bottom half of the distribution (again, excluding the last-place player) being less likely to give to

the lower-ranked player.

   A key challenge in separating any last-place-aversion effect from competing hypotheses is that

with only six ranks we have limited degrees of freedom. This problem is aggravated in the current

game relative to the the earlier ones because only ranks two through five have comparable choice

sets, whereas in the first redistribution game we could compare ranks one through five and in

the lottery game ranks one through six. Being able to compare only four ranks makes it nearly

impossible to separate, say, a story in which individuals dislike being near last place versus one in

which they want to be above the median. For this reason, we decided to re-run the experiment with

eight players.


4.2.4   Results from the eight-player game

The game is exactly parallel to the six-player game described in Section 4.2.1. Players in ranks two

through seven must decide between giving $2 to the person directly above them or below them,

                                                   22
and the first-place player decides between the second- and third-place players while the last-place

player decides between the sixth- and seventh-place players. As before, we also control separately

for players in first or last place as their choice set is not parallel to that of other players.

       Figure 4 is the analogue of Figure 3 and presents the basic results from the eight-player game.

As before, the second-to-last-place player is the least likely to give to the player below him, and

this difference is often pair-wise significant from other ranks. Also as before, the third-to-last-place

player is relatively unlikely to give to the player below him. Importantly, however, the player just

below the median (rank = 5) shows no such tendency, and the pairwise difference with the second-

to-last-place player is statistically significant. Put differently, comparing the six- and eight-player

games suggests that there is nothing particularly salient about being, say, in fourth or fifth place,

but instead behavior appears to depend on how close one is to last place: the fourth- and fifth-place

players in the six-player game show strong evidence of LPA, while the fourth- and fifth-place players

in the eight-player game do not.19

       Cols. (3) through (11) of Table 4 present probit regression results from the eight-player game.

Consistent with the figure, in col. (3) the second-to-last-place player is significantly less likely to

give to the lower-ranked player than all other players (though, again, the first- and last-place players

always have their own fixed effect, so their generally higher tendency to give to the lower-ranked

player is not contributing to the coefficient). In col. (4) we gain precision by including those in third-

to-last place as being affected by last-place aversion: if they give $2 to the lower-ranked player, they

would fall into second-to-last place. This effect increases when the first two rounds are discarded.

For the remainder of the table, we will focus on distinguishing this effect—the aversion to falling

to the bottom two ranks of the distribution—from alternative hypotheses.

       The next two columns explore the hypothesis that players are simply less likely to give to a

lower-ranked player when they themselves are below the median, which we could not distinguish

from last-place aversion in the six-player game. In contrast, the below-the-median indicator in col.

(6) is small in magnitude and statistically insignificant and the estimated effect of being in the

bottom of the distribution increases relative to the estimate in col. (4). Removing the early rounds

(col. 7) only increases the magnitude of the coefficient of interest.
  19
    Interestingly, in both the six- and eight-players games, the second-place player is one of the least likely ranks to
give to the player below him. We speculate that there may be some utility gained from remaining close to first place
in rank, even though he would be further away in terms of absolute dollars.


                                                          23
       Cols. (8) and (9) test whether inequality aversion can explain the reluctance of those close to

last place from giving the $2 to the lower-ranked player. As noted earlier, inequality aversion in

the standard two-term Fehr-Shmidt parameterization cannot explain the results, as the decision

of each player in ranks two through seven has the same effect on the two terms. As such, we test

whether players respond to how the Gini coefficient of the overall distribution changes when they

give to the higher- versus lower-ranked of the two people in their choice set. The positive coefficient

on this variable indicates that the greater this difference, the more players give to the lower-ranked

player, suggesting that, all else equal, players wish to make the distribution more equal. However,

this effect is not statistically significant, and including it only increases the estimated effect of being

second or third from last.20

       Cols. (10) and (11) test whether including a linear rank term diminishes the estimated effect

of avoiding the bottom of the distribution. Again, the coefficient on the indicator for being second

or third from last increases. Although the p-value in col. (11) grows slightly, to 0.102, having only

eight ranks from which to identify a linear effect of rank and three indicator variables (for being

in last, for being in first, and for being in sixth- or seventh-place) likely limits the precision with

which any single effect can be measured. When the first two rounds are excluded, the coefficient

on the variable of interest regains its significance. Finally, cols. (12) and (13) presents the baseline

result when both the six- and eight-player games are included.

       Appendix Table 4 shows that the main results are robust to adding demographic controls and

including player fixed effects. Those who report being liberal are significantly more likely to give

to the lower-ranked player, as are those who report being religious, though that effect is only

marginally significant. Unlike the previous experiments, a few interaction terms are significant.

While on average those who are religious are more likely to give to the lower-ranked player, religiosity

is associated with greater last-place-aversion effects—that is, religious individuals’ relative tendency

to give to the lower-placed player is substantially reduced when they themselves are close to last

place. Younger players also appear to be more last-place averse.
  20
    Readers may wonder why we control for this ∆ Gini variable in this table but not in Table 2. The reason is
that for players of ranks one through five in the first redistribution experiment, the difference in the Gini coefficient
from keeping the $1 versus transferring $2 to the last-place player is itself a linear function of rank. In particular,
∆Gini = 0.318 − 0.0152 ∗ rank. As such, for the five ranks with comparable choice sets in the first redistribution
experiment, we cannot separately identify the effect of rank and changes in the Gini coefficient, so we only consider
rank.

4.3     Discussion

The results using the eight-player design offer broad support for the hypothesis that players expe-

rience disutility from being in the bottom of the distribution. This effect can be separated from

players’ merely wanting to be above the median as well as from inequality aversion. Both the six-

and eight-player games suggest that players take steps to avoid falling not just to the very bottom

rank, but to the second-lowest rank as well.

      It is worth emphasizing that in the second redistribution game those close to last place are

willing to take measures that typically have high psychological cost in order to avoid falling closer

to last place. As Tricomi et al. (2010) show, in both subjective ratings and fMRI data, the poorer

member in a two-player game evaluates transfers to the richer member more negatively than the

richer person evaluates transfers to the poorer person. Indeed, in the middle of the distribution

the participants in our experiments generally make decisions consistent with this finding. However,

between a quarter and a half of those in second-to-last place prefer to give the $2 to a person

who already has more money than they do, suggesting that last-place aversion can outweigh the

general aversion to giving money to a richer person found in other games and in other parts of the

distribution in our experiment.

      The evidence supporting last-place aversion is especially striking given that our experiments

offer players confidentiality and anonymity, as well as emphasize that rank is based on random

assignment and not merit. While we believe that these conditions allow us to test for last-place

aversion in a more rigorous manner, they may limit the experiments’ connection to how individuals’

support for redistributive public policies depends on their actual economic position, as economic

position is typically not randomly assigned nor completely confidential. The remainder of the paper

explores last-place aversion outside the laboratory, using survey data on minimum wage policy.


5     Last-place aversion and support for minimum wage increases

In choosing a “real-world” policy to test the predictions of last-place aversion, we select the mini-

mum wage over other redistributive policies for several reasons. First, the minimum wage defines

the “last-place” wage that can legally be paid in most labor markets, so it allows us to define “last

place” more easily than in the context of other policies. Second, while the worst-off workers are not


                                                 25
always those being paid the minimum wage (e.g., middle-class teenagers might take minimum-wage

jobs during the summer), past work has found that policies that more explicitly target the poor

such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families could have potentially confounding racial asso-

ciations.21 Third, through spillover effects to other low-wage workers, the minimum wage plays an

important role in the compensation of low-income workers and thus analyzing its political support

has potentially important policy consequences.22


5.1      Predicting who would support a minimum wage increase

A minimum wage increase is a transfer to some low-wage workers from—depending on market

characteristics—other low-wage workers who now face greater job rationing, employers with monop-

sony power in the labor market, or consumers who now pay higher prices.23

       Assuming low-wage workers are not concerned with adverse employment effects—a hypothesis

we directly test in the empirical work—they should generally exhibit the greatest support for

an increase relative to other workers. First, they themselves might see a raise, depending on the

difference between their current wage and the proposed new minimum and the strength of spillover

effects to workers just above the proposed new minimum. Second, even for those who would not

be directly affected, the policy could act as wage insurance and should increase their reservation

wage. Finally, if low-wage workers are relatively substitutable, then those making just above the

current minimum should welcome an increase as employers would then have less opportunity to

replace them with lower-wage workers.

       Last-place aversion, in contrast, predicts that individuals making just above the current mini-

mum would have limited enthusiasm for seeing it increased. The minimum wage essentially defines

the “last-place” wage a worker in most labor markets can legally be paid. A worker making just

above the current minimum might see a wage increase from the policy, but could now herself be

“tied” with many other workers for last place.

  22
     In fact, Lee (1999) estimates that the majority of the growth in the wage gap between the tenth and fiftieth
percentiles during the 1980s was due to the erosion of the federal minimum wage during the decade.
  23
     There is a large literature on the effect of the minimum wage on employment levels, which we do not review
here. The monopsony argument was first made by Stigler (1946), and Aaronson (2001) provides evidence of price
pass-through in the restaurant industry.

5.2     Evidence from online survey data

5.2.1     Data collection and summary statistics

Questions regarding the minimum wage have often appeared in opinion surveys, but to the best of

our knowledge none have also asked respondents to report their own wages (as opposed to income).

We thus designed our own survey, which was administered in the fall of 2010.24 Subjects were

randomly selected from a nationwide pool and invited to complete the online survey in exchange

for five dollars. Enrollment in the study was limited to employed individuals between the ages of

23 and 64, so as to target prime-age workers. We also over-sampled low-wage and hourly workers.

      The survey stated the current federal minimum wage ($7.25) and then asked respondents

whether it should be increased, decreased or left unchanged. The survey asked those who iden-

tified themselves as hourly-wage workers: “What is your current hourly wage? If you have more

than one job, please enter the wage for your main job.” For those who did not specifically identify

themselves as hourly workers, the survey asked: “If you are currently paid by the hour for the main

job you hold, what is your hourly wage? (Even if you are not actually paid by the hour, please

calculate your estimated hourly wage. You can do this by dividing your paycheck by how many

hours you typically work in a pay period.)”

      We make the following sampling restrictions in generating our regression sample. First, we

drop the 74 people who completed the survey in less than two minutes (even though we wrote

the survey, it took us an average of three minutes to complete). We also drop from this sample

twelve individuals who report being unemployed but somehow slipped through the survey’s filter.

We also drop 63 observations with missing or unusable wage data (e.g., “I work on commission,”

“Depends”). These exclusions leave a regression sample of 489 observations.

      The first column of Appendix Table 5 displays summary statistics from the online survey data.

Given the explicit oversampling of certain groups and the fact that online surveys by their nature

are not likely to appeal to the entire population equally, we do not expect the data to resemble

a random sample of the U.S. population. Indeed, compared to the sample from the Pew Research

Center that we use later in this section, there is over-representation of women and college graduates,

and under-representation of minorities and married people. The median wage in our sample is $13.60

      The survey was administered by C&T Marketing Group, http://www.ctmarketinggroup.com.



                                                    27
and just over three-quarters of respondents support a minimum wage increase.


5.2.2      Graphical results

Figure 5 shows how support for increasing the minimum wage varies across wage groups in our

survey. The first category includes those with wages at or below the current minimum, and this

group tends to be highly favorable toward minimum-wage increases.25 The most striking feature of

Figure 5, however, is the relative lack of support for minimum wage increases among those making

just above the current minimum. They are, in fact, the group least likely to support it, and the

difference between them and other groups in the figure is often statistically significant.


5.2.3      Regression results

Table 5 subjects the results in Figure 5 to regression analysis. Without any controls, the effect of

being “just above” the current minimum wage (i.e., making more than $7.25 but no more than

$8.25 an hour) is negative but not significant. Note that this specification is somewhat demanding

because we do not include any other controls for wage or limit the sample to those with relatively

low wages. As such, those making just above the minimum wage are largely being compared to

those making substantially more than they do. When we limit the sample to those in the bottom

half of the wage distribution or control linearly for wage, the effect of being “just above” the current

minimum is statistically significant.

       For the sake of being conservative and parsimonious, we choose the more demanding specifica-

tion in col. (1), and in col. (2) adding race, gender and age controls generates a negative coefficient

on the “just above” indicator that is statistically significant at the ten-percent level. Adding controls

for Census division and the state-level minimum wage in col. (3) has no effect on the coefficient of

interest. Controlling in col. (4) for education, marital status and whether a participant is U.S.-born

slightly increases the magnitude of the effect. Controlling for party affiliation, union status and

approval rating of President Obama also increases the effect slightly. With a small sample like ours,

the coefficient estimate might be attributable to randomly having sampled, say, a very conservative

group who happen to make within a dollar of the current minimum. In fact, however, workers
  25
    In one version of the survey, we asked questions specifically designed to illicit information regarding people who
report making less than the minimum wage. About a third worked for tips. More than half reported that they thought
their own wage would rise if the minimum wage increased.


                                                         28
making between $7.25 and $8.25 give Obama the highest approval rating of any of the wage groups

depicted in Figure 5.

       An important concern regarding the results reported so far is that they may be driven by worries

regarding the effect of the minimum wage on the demand for low-wage labor and not last-place

aversion. For this reason, we also asked participants the following question: “Do you worry that if

the minimum wage is set too high, it might make employers reduce hiring and possibly cause you

to lose your job?” In col. (5), we show that individuals making just above the current minimum

are no more concerned than are other survey respondents. In fact, of the four lowest-wage groups

in Figure 5, those making between $7.25 and $8.25 report the lowest concern about employment

effects, and yet they exhibit the greatest opposition to a minimum wage increase.


5.3      Pew Research Center data

Workers in our survey making just above the minimum wage exhibit limited support relative to

other workers for seeing it raised, a result that might be seen as surprising but is consistent with

last-place aversion. We now seek confirming evidence in a more nationally representative sample.

As noted earlier, results from existing national surveys are at best just suggestive, as only income

and not wage data are available. Our approach in this section is to present the data with as little

analysis as possible and merely try to gauge whether the income patterns appear roughly consistent

with the wage patterns in our online survey.


5.3.1      The data

We selected every Pew Research Center survey over the past ten years that both asked respondents

if they approved or disapproved of a minimum wage increase and asked for their income and

employment status.26 Three surveys (from June 2001, December 2004, and March 2006) met these

criteria. During this period, the federal minimum wage was $5.15 per hour, and respondents were

asked about increasing it to $6.45, except that the March 2006 survey randomly assigned half the

sample to consider an increase to $6.45 and the other half to $7.15.
  26
    We excluded other Pew surveys that instead asked whether increasing the minimum wage should be a “top
priority, important but lower priority, not too important or should not be done,” because the wording was not similar
to our web survey. The other publicly-accessible national polls on the minimum wage are conducted by the New York
Times and CBS. We chose Pew over NYT /CBS because Pew offers greater disaggregation of income and thus more
detail on the income levels of poorer households.


                                                         29
   To match the online survey, we sample employed individuals between the ages of 23 and 64.

Summary statistics appear in the last two columns of Appendix Table 5.


5.3.2   Results

Figure 6 shows how support for increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.45 varies across

the income groups in the Pew survey. The raw data show a small drop in support going from the

lowest-income group to the second-lowest-income group, and a general downward trend in support

as income increases. When we control for basic demographics and background characteristics such as

education, marital status and political affiliation, the relative opposition among the second-lowest-

income group increases. Conditional on these controls, individuals with family income between

$10,000 and $20,000 are the least supportive among all groups with annual family income below

$100,000.

   Figure 7 is analogous to Figure 6 but includes only the smaller sample of participants (half of

the March 2006 survey) who were asked to consider a minimum wage increase from $5.15 to $7.15.

Individuals with family income between $20,000 and $30,000 are, both in the raw data and after

controlling for background characteristics, the least supportive of an increase among all respondents

with family income below $100,000. Interestingly, leaving aside the very highest income group, as

the hypothetical new minimum wage increases, the income level of the group most opposed to it

also increases, consistent with the last-place effect reaching further up in the income distribution.

   How might the family income levels in the Pew survey relate to wages? On the one hand,

someone working fifty weeks a year and forty hours a week would make $14,300 at a wage of $7.15

and $12,900 at a wage of $6.45. On the other hand, in the 2004 March Current Population Survey

the median family income of a worker between the ages of 23 and 64 who makes between $5.25 and

$7.15 an hour is between $25,000 and $30,000. As such, those who might be most affected by last-

place aversion concerns arising from minimum-wage increases would likely have income between

$10,000 and $30,000, consistent with Figures 6 and 7. However, it must be emphasized that the

correspondence between family income and wage levels is very rough, and thus that these results,

while generally consistent with the online data, are at most suggestive.

5.4      Discussion

In both our online survey and the Pew data, we find that low-wage and low-income workers are

often the least likely to support increases in the minimum wage. The relatively tepid support

among low-income workers for such a transfer is consistent with last-place aversion, as those who

are marginally better off seek to retain their ability to distinguish themselves from those in “last

place.” One might have expected that in moving from the laboratory—where reference groups are

fixed and highly salient—to the field—where individuals can be members of many peer groups—

would have diminished the LPA effect. However, these minimum wage results suggest that the

income or wage distribution is salient to individuals in the bottom of the distribution, resulting in

behavior consistent with the behavior observed in the laboratory experiments.

       A further prediction of LPA not directly tested here is that not only are those at the bottom

of the distribution opposed to transfers to those just below them, but, relative to low-income

individuals, middle- and upper-income individuals are less opposed to a transfer to a marginally

worse-off group than themselves. A potential test of this prediction would be to ask individuals

their income and then describe a tax credit that phased out just below their income level. LPA

would predict that support for such a scheme would be weakest among low-income workers. In this

paper we wished to focus on an actual policy that would be familiar to respondents, but examining

how individuals respond to hypothetical transfer policies that benefit different parts of the income

distribution is a potentially interesting question for future research.

       As noted earlier, we chose to focus on the minimum wage in part to avoid the strong racial

connotations of redistributive programs such as welfare. But future work might wish to explore

implications of last-place aversion on racial attitudes. For example, African Americans have always

occupied a lower position in the national income distribution than whites, and thus might well serve

as the “last-place” reference group for whites. Of course, individual African Americans have higher

incomes than individual whites, but even today median household income for non-Hispanic whites is

over sixty percent higher than that of African Americans ($55,530 versus $34,218).27 LPA predicts

that this reference group should have little meaning to whites whose incomes place them a safe

distance from the bottom of the income distribution. However, for, say, the thirty percent of whites

with household income below that of the median African-American household, any improvement

in the social or economic position of African Americans may cause significant disutility and thus

lead them to oppose redistributive policies that might benefit African Americans.


6   Conclusion

We began by presenting a simple model in which individual utility depends on a standard concave

function of income as well as an indicator variable for whether one is in last place among a finite

reference group. We then set up an experiment in which the model predicts that the two lowest-

placed members of a six-player game would have a higher propensity to choose a lottery over a

risk-free payment of equivalent expected value. The data strongly support this prediction, and the

elevated likelihood of gambling among the individuals with the lowest income is consistent with

the last-place person bearing the risk of the lottery for a chance to improve his rank and the

second-to-last-place person doing the same to defend against falling in rank.

    In the money-transfer experiments we conducted, the tendency to give to the last-place player

is lowest for the second-to-last place player, again consistent with last-place aversion. Perhaps most

striking is that in order to maintain their rank, players close to last place will often give money to

players ranked above them rather than players ranked below.

    We then apply the insights from the redistribution experiments to predict respondents’ prefer-

ences regarding a particular redistributive policy—the minimum wage. Last-place aversion would

predict that those making just above the current minimum wage would face a trade-off: on the

one hand, they may receive a raise if the new minimum wage is above their current wage; on the

other hand, they would then join the “last-place” group. In data we collect ourselves, we find that

support for a minimum wage increase is lowest among those making just above the current min-

imum. Using data from the Pew Research Center, we also find that support for a minimum wage

increase is relatively low among groups whose income would suggest they themselves make close to

the minimum wage.

    Future research might explore the implications of LPA in a seemingly unrelated domain: con-

sumer behavior. Past work has noted consumers’ tendency to purchase the second cheapest wine

on a menu (McFadden, 1999). While consumers might be making rational inferences about product



                                                 32
attributes (see, e.g., Kamenica, 2008), they might also be exhibiting a standard response to price

but simultaneously avoiding association with the “last-place” product. In a choice set of three or

four, these tendencies would lead consumers to pick a “middle” option—the “compromise effect”

in behavioral decision theory (Simonson, 1989).

       LPA might also contribute to our understanding of the higher incidence of crime and delinquency

exhibited by members of lower socio-economic groups. Violent crime, especially among males, is

often related to status and “saving face,” and LPA would indeed predict status anxiety to be

most acute near the bottom of a given distribution.28 For example, LPA might help explain why

criminal activity increased among the boys who moved to better neighborhoods in the Moving-to-

Opportunity study (Kling et al., 2005), as they now attend better schools where they are more

likely to be at the bottom of the classroom distribution.

       Finally, modifying certain aspects of our experimental design would shed further light on last-

place aversion. While we took steps to design the experiments in a manner that would not bias us

toward finding evidence for last-place aversion, future research could relax some of these conditions

in order to examine which factors intensify or diminish LPA. We suspect that making payoffs public

or making rank a function of task performance would increase the magnitude of LPA. Outcomes

besides risk aversion and redistribution could also be studied; for example, will those in last place

work especially hard at a given task to try to move up in rank, or will they instead tend to give

up?29 In our experiments, the peer groups were randomly assigned and fixed throughout the game,

but future work may focus on the role of LPA in endogenous group formation. For example, LPA

would predict that those with the lowest rank in a current game would be the most likely to choose

to join a different game with lower average payoffs but the promise of an improved rank.

Notes: Based on twelve six-player games of nine rounds each. All regressions are estimated via probit and include
round fixed effects and cluster standard errors by individual player. The dependent variable for all regressions is an
indicator variable coded as one if the subject chose the gamble over the risk-free payment. See Section 3 for further
details on the experiment. In specifications that “exclude early” rounds, the first two rounds are not included. “Could
catch next player” is an indicator variable for xi + winning payment > xi+1 , where xi is player i’s current balance
and xi+1 is that
              P of the player directly above him. Following Fehr and  P Schmidt (1999), Disadvantageous inequality
is defined as j6=i max{xj − xi , 0} and Advantageous inequality as j6=i max{xi − xj , 0}. The ∆ for each of these
variables is defined as the expected value when player i plays the lottery minus the value when he takes the certain
option. ∗ p < 0.10,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Notes: Based on four six-player games of eight rounds each. All regressions are estimated via probit, include round
fixed effects and a separate control for being in last place (as this player’s choice set is not directly parallel to the
others), and cluster standard errors at the individual level. The dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether
the individual chose to forgo the additional $1 so that another player (the last-place player, for ranks one through five;
                                                             P instead receive $2. See Section 4.1 for further details on
the second-to-last-place player, for the last-place player) could
the experiment. Disadvantageous inequality is defined as j6=i max{xj − xi , 0}, and ∆Disadvantageous inequalityi
is defined as this sum when the player i forgos the additional dollar minus this sum when he keeps it. This variable
is collinear with ∆Advantageous inequality and thus we cannot estimate both. ∗ p < 0.10,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Notes: All data are from the minimum wage Internet survey. The first five regressions have as the dependent variable
an indicator variable coded as one if the respondent says he approves of a proposed minimum wage increase. The last
takes as its dependent variable the answer to the question: “Do you worry that if the minimum wage is set too high, it
might make employers reduce hiring and possibly cause you to lose your job?” where one indicates “not at all worried”
and seven indicates “very worried.” “Demographic controls” include age, race, and ethnicity. “Geographic controls”
include fixed effects for the eight Census divisions and the level of the state minimum wage. “Background controls”
include marital status; an indicator for being born in the US; and indicator variables for no high school, some high
school, high school degree, some college, two-year college degree, four-year college degree, master’s degree, doctoral
degree, professional degrees. “Political controls” include: fixed effects for major party affilation; a one-to-seven approval
rating of President Obama; and union status. See Section 5.2 for further detail. ∗ p < 0.10,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Notes: All observations are drawn from the pool of individuals who registered with the Harvard Business School
Computer Lab for Experimental Research (CLER). In order to be eligible, individuals must not be on the Harvard
University payroll, must be 18 or older, fluent in English and comfortable using a computer. For tax purposes, they
must have a valid Social Security number or letter of sponsorship and visa connected to their country of tax residency.
All subjects were paid $15 per hour. Additionally, in the lottery experiment, they were told a randomly chosen player
would receive a cash payment equal to $20 plus his current balance in the game at that point. The $20 was given so
that no player would actually leave the experiment with less money than their hourly compensation.

     Notes: The dependent variable for all regressions is an indicator variable coded as one if the subject chose the gamble over the risk-free payment (see Section 3 for
     further details on the experiment). Each specification tests the robustness of a key result from the main text, and the column headings refer to the specification
     being tested. Fixed effects for educational attainment are included in cols. (2), (5) and (7). “Payment controls” include the individual’s current earnings, the
     winning amount of the lottery and amount of the certain payment. In cols. (1), (4) and (6), observations with any missing value for the variables included in,
     respectively, cols. (2), (5) and (7) are dropped so that the sample is constant for each pair of specifications. Cols. (8) through (10) use only observations from the
     first round to test whether the effect of being in fifth or sixth place can be separated from, respectively, the effect of being below the median, inequality-aversion
     controls, and a linear effect of rank. ∗ p < 0.10,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Appendix A       Instructions for the lottery game

Scrambled is a game of chance, where you play against other players in your row. In this version
of the game, most of you are not playing for real money. However, at the end of the session, the
computer will automatically select one round from one player in the session. That player will be
given an extra $20.00 plus whatever they won or lost in the selected round. With that in mind, you
should play the whole game as if you are playing for real money.
    To get started, please type your name or nickname in the field provided and click the button
to continue. Then, wait for further instructions.
    [Wait 15 seconds People should be standing up.]
    At this point, everyone should see a big red stop sign on their screen. Please raise your hand if
you dont see a stop sign.
    [Fix problems until everyone sees the stop sign.]
    Before we continue, there are two things I need to mention:

  (i) You will play a number of rounds in this game. In each round, before you can proceed to
      the next round, everyone in your row must first make a decision. If you feel you have been
      waiting too long, please raise your hand and I will come around and see whats going on.

 (ii) Please dont click the next, back or refresh buttons in your browser while playing this game.
      If you do, it will break the game for all of the players in your row.

    Does anyone have any questions at this point?
    Please sit down and click the button to continue. You will now see instructions about how to
play the game. Once you have read the instructions, you will be able to click the button to get
started.
    Please read the instructions and click the button marked Continue to begin the game

Appendix B       Solving for the Nash Equilbirum of the Lottery Experiment


Assumptions
As discussed in the text, we assume individuals play each round as a one-shot game. We also assume
that when the fifth-place player takes the “certain” option, the last-place player can pass him if he
wins the lottery (a condition that holds in the majority of rounds in the data).

Claim 1. The dominent strategy of players in ranks one through four is to choose the “certain”
option, whereas for sufficiently large α the players in ranks five and six will play a mixed strategy
between the “certain” option and the lottery.

Proof. The proof for ranks one through four is outlined in Section 3 and here we just focus on the
last- and fifth-place players.
    Since the game is finite by assumption and meets the other conditions of the Nash Existence
Theorem, there must be an NE between these two players. Here, we show that there is no pure-
strategy NE, so it must be the case that the two players play a mixed strategy between taking the
lottery option and taking the certain option.
    Below we show that for sufficiently large α none of the four potential pure strategies are NEs.

Both pick “certain”
If the fifth-place player picks the certain option, then the last-place player will play the lottery
whenever
                        3α
                              > f (y + θcertain ) − ( 14 f (y − θlose ) + 34 f (y + θwin )),
                     4(1 − α)
equation (3) from the text (y is his current balance). In other words, so long as α is sufficiently
large, the last-place player is willing to take on additional risk for the possibility of escaping last
place.

Last-place player picks “certain” and fifth-place player picks lottery
If the last-place player plays certain, then the fifth-place player can always maintain his rank by
also playing certain. He will always prefer this option because he is risk-averse and prefers not to
take a gamble of equal expected value to the certain option. Moreover, this option also brings a
risk of losing the lottery and falling into last-place himself, which has additional, negative utility
consequences for any positive value of α.

Fifth-place player picks “certain” and last-place player picks lottery
This case was already examined in Section 3. If the last-place player plays the lottery, then the
fifth-place player would rather play the lottery whenever
                      9α
                             > f (y + θcertain ) − ( 34 f (y − θlose ) + 14 f (y + θwin )),
                   16(1 − α)

equation (4) from the text.




                                                     51
Both pick lottery
The last-place player would rather pick the “certain” option, because if the fifth-place player picks
the lottery, then playing the lottery never gives the last-place player any greater chance of moving
up than does playing the certain option regardless of whether the fifth-place player wins or loses.
Thus, he would rather avoid the risk and play the safe option.
    Consider the two possibilities when the fifth-place player picks the lottery. If he wins, then even
if the last-place player also wins the lottery he cannot move up, so playing the lottery offers him
no greater chance of moving up than does the certain option (both offer a probability of zero).
    If the fifth-place player loses the lottery, then, as we show below, he will fall into last place with
probability one if the last-place player picks the “certain” option. Thus, playing the lottery gives
the sixth-place player no greater chance of moving up under this scenario either.
    Using the notation from Section 3, let the current balances of the last-place, fifth- and fourth-
place place player be, respectively, δ6 < δ5 < δ4 . Recall that θcertain = δ5 −δ2
                                                                                   6
                                                                                     and θwin = δ4 − δ6 .
                        3        1
    By construction, 4 θwin − 4 θlose = θcertain , or, θlose = 3θwin − 4θcertain .
    Substituting the formulae for θwin and θcertain gives:
                                                                     
                                                              δ5 − δ6
                                    θlose = 3(δ4 − δ6 ) − 4             ,
                                                                 2
or,                                                                   
                                                             δ5 − δ6
                               θlose > 3(δ5 − δ6 ) − 4                     = δ5 − δ6 .
                                                                2
      So, if the fifth-place player loses the lottery, we have that

                                     δ5 − θlose < δ5 − (δ5 − δ6 ) = δ6 .

Therefore, the last-place player will always move up by picking the certain option (or, in fact, by
doing nothing, though that is not an option).

Appendix C         Instructions for redistribution games

The Moneybags Game is a game where you play with X other players in the lab. During the game,
you will play several rounds, and at the beginning of each round, the computer will randomly hold
a lottery, and give you and the other players in your group different amounts of money.
    During each round, you will be presented with a choice about who should get more money. This
additional money is drawn from a separate pool and does not take away from the amount of money
you have. The choices you make are private, and will not be shown to anyone playing the game at
any time.
    Once everyone in your group has made a choice, the computer will randomly select one players
choice, and award the additional money as that player decided. At that point, everyones score will
be updated, but you will not be shown the final score from the round. Then, a new lottery will be
held and the next round will automatically begin.
    In this version of the game, most of you are not playing for real money. However, at the end of
the session, the computer will automatically select one round from one group and every player in
that group will receive their final score from that round. With that in mind, you should play the
whole game as if you are playing for real money.
    To get started, please type your name or nickname in the field provided and click the button
to continue. Then, wait for further instructions.
