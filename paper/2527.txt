                     Optimal Policies with Strategic Distortions




                                        ABSTRACT




      Recent work in optimal trade   policy   for imperfectly competitive markets

usually identifies the optimal level of an instrument, and when more

 instruments are allowed, general interpretations have been unavailable,        This


paper analyzes the jointly optimal levels of a Variety of instruments with

oligopolistic competition.   A targeting principle for identifying optimal

policies is derived using the concept of a "strategic distortion."       It is

 shown how optimal policies vary with the distortions present and the number of

 firms, as well as assumptions about market segmentation and regulation.        The

 principles of targeting are illustrated using agricultural marketing boards.

     Our understanding of the way in which perfectly competitive markets

function, and of optimal policy for such markets when various distortions

exist is quite good.      Optimal policies are often explained by using the

                          targeting developed by Bhagwati,    Ramaswami and
general principle of

Srinivasan,1     among others, and their non-uniqueness is explained by the Lerner

symmetry theorem, Lerner (1936),         In contrast to this, our understanding of

optimal policy in oligopolistic markets is more limited,

     In part, this is because there are so many possible models of

oligopolistic behavior, both static and dynamic, that general results are hard

to come by.      Even limiting ourselves to static models, policies which

"directly"     restrict trade,   such as quotas   or content protection, have very
dif#erent     effects from those which do so       indirectly" via taxes and subsidies.

The former have effects like those of a regime change while the latter do

not.2    Even the literature on indirect policies makes different assumptions

about factors which affect the results.           Assumptions about the strategic

variables used, the number of firms, possible distortions, and the instruments

considered vary among papers.        Assumptions about market segmentation, or the

lack of it, and regulations on firm behavior are also crucial and have not

been systematically analyzed.                                                        -




        In   this paper we develop a targeting approach which helps explain the

nature of optimal policies and how they vary with differences in the above

assumptions.       Since the literature has focused on the first set of assumptions

given above, there is some understanding of how optimal policies vary with
these assumptions.    Our contribution here is to identify overall optimal

                                                                              This
policies and show that they can be interpreted in a targeting framework.

provides a unified way of looking at much of the literature and shows how

confining attention to one policy, as is often done, can result in the

identification of overall suboptimal policies.     In addition, we use this

framework to analyze how regulations influence optimal policies by linking

distortions and creating new ones, both of which affect the targeting of

policies.   We consider regulations which limit domestic monopoly power, as

well as arbitrage, which we show should be thought of as a form of regulation.

We analyze optimal policies for marketing boards since these provide a rich

variety of types of distortions and regulations.     Next, we briefly survey how

our work relates to other work in strategic trade policy.

     Earlier work, such as that of Auquier and Caves (1979), deals with trade

policies when there is monopoly.     Work on oligopoly began with that of Spence

and Brander (1983), who analyze a Cournot duopoly with one home and one

foreign firm and show that an export subsidy can improve welfare.3 Eaton and

Grossman (1986) show that the strategic variable used is critical.     They

identify a strategic distortion using a conjectural variations model, and the

show that this distortion may require a tax on exports with Bertrand

competition.   This strategic distortion differs from the usual terms of trade

distortion.4   Dixt   (1984) and Eaton and Grossman analyze policy when there

are more firms and domestic consumption.

     Only a few papers in   this   area consider more than one policy instrument.

Eaton and Grossman consider the direction of production and trade taxes

                                                             or develop a

targeting approach.    For the Cournot case, Spencer and Brander (1983) consider

jointly optimal R&O and export policies.     Dixit (1984) examines optimal

production and trade tax/subsidies in the Cournot case, and Dixit (1986)

studies how optimal trade and production taxes are affected by changes in

parameters using a conjectural variations model and a linear example.       Dixit

(1988) calculates the optimal levels of these instruments for a simulation

model of the U.S. automobile industry.    Cheng (1986) analyzes optimal tariffs

and production subsidies for a linear example.    A   targeting approach is not

the focus of any of this work, and most of it deals with segmented markets,5

     Our work is also related to the literature on agricultural marketing

boards.   The work most closely related to ours is that of Just et al. (1979),

Markusen (1984). and Thursby (l987).6    While they consider some of the types

of marketing boards we do, neither Just et al, (1979) nor Markusen (1984)

focus on strategic interactions between boards.    Thursby (1987) does consider

strategic interactions between boards but confines her analysis to a linear

Cournot example when markets are segmented.

     The next section sets up the oroblem and discusses the institutional

variations we consider.   Sections 3 and 4 contain the analysis of duopoly with

market segmentation.    in these sections each board is the sole supplier to

consumers in its home market and competes with a foreign board in a third

market.   Thus boards have monopoly power over domestic consumers.     They may or

may not exercise monopsony power over competitive suppliers depending on

whether the boards are producer cartels or monopsonists.     Thus, there are

three distortions possible.   First, there is monopsony power which causes a

board to purchase too little from competitive suppliers.     Next,   there is
                                       -.4-.




monopoly power which causes it to sell too little at home.       These production

and consumption distortions are shown to be optimally targeted by production

and consumption subsidies.    In addition, there is a strategic distortion along

the lines of Eaton and Grossman (1986).        This arises due to the boards

inability to precommit to output levels.        The government's ability to

precommit to taxes and subsidies allows it to correct this distortion.         Trade

                                                                         on
poicy optimally targets this distortion and may require a tax or subsidy

exports depending on the strategic variable, as shown in Section 3.

        Section 4 considers the effect of a regulation which limits domestic

monopoly power by enforcing marginal cost pricing at home.        This regulation

links distortions by linking domestic and export sales, and this is reflected

in the optimal targeting rule.     While the regulation removes the consumption

distortion, it creates another distortion since it encourages boards to raise

exports in order to raise marginal cost and domestic price.        Optimal policy

can be implemented by a single instrument, the trade tax/subsidy, and its

level    is determined by both the linkage of distortions and the strategic

distortion.

        The following section extends the analysis to many boards at home and

abroad,     As expected, having more domestic boards reduces market power in the

                                                                                    It
domestic market which reduces both consumption and production distortions.

also creates a terms of trade distortion because the existence of many home

boards removes the ability of a board to fully internalize the effects of its

actions on the terms of trade.     The strategic distortion remains but depends

on the number of firms.     In this case the targeting principle suggests that

trade tax/subsidies be directed towards the terms of trade distortion as well

as the strategic distortion.
                                         -5-.



     In Section 6, we   consider   the effects of arbitrage on targeting.   With

arbitrage a board cannot determine the amount of home and foreign sales

independently.    In this case, a board which is regulated in its domestic

pricing will be forced to act much like a competitive board.      we show that the

optimal policy in such a case is a trade policy targeted towards the terms of

trade distortion, as this is the only distortion present.      Without price

regulation, there is room for strategic behavior on the part of the board.         As

was the case with market segmentation, the board's inability to precommit

creates a strategic distortion which the government can offset because of its

ability to precommit to tax/subsidy policies.     With arbitrage, however, the

inability of the board to determine home and foreign sales independently links

distortions, and this affects the targeting of policy.      In particular, our

results suggest targeting a consumption subsidy to offset any consumption

distortion, and targeting a production subsidy toward the remaining

distortions including the strategic distortion.     In addition, we show that the

consumption distortion is linked through arbitrage to the price abroad and the

strategic   distortion includes a linkage effect as well.   Recall that linkage

effects are not present and do not affect policy with market segmentation

unless domestic price is regulated.

     These results suggest that a useful way to think of policy comparisons in

situations with and without arbitrage is in terms of a change in regime.       That

is, arbitrage fundamentally changes the way the board is able to operate, and

arbitrage, like a regulation, constrains the profit maximization opportunities

open to the board.   This in turn affects optimal policy.
                                                2.     The Problem

      Agricultural trade              is    often conducted through marketing boards for the

product in question.              Marketing boards exist for a number of commodities,

including wheat, rice, jute, cocoa and coffee and are used by a number of

countries      including        Australia      and Canada.7         These boards       vary    greatly     across

                   in some instances          they are     producer      cartels   who maximize          profits      of
countries,

competitive        producers,       while     in other     cases,     they    are monopsonists       who buy

from competitive           producers.         In many cases,        boards     are regulated       so that         they

can exercise         market     power      in the    foreign   market,       but not   in the domestic

market,

       Initially       we consider a duopoly situation with market segmentation.

There is a marketing board in each country.                           Each board purchases a

homogeneous commodity from competitive producers in its own country and

supplies its own domestic demand.                      However, each competes in a third market

with the other marketing board.                      d(y) is the domestic inverse demand function,

while     d*(y*) is     the foreign countrys domestic inverse demand.                             y and     y are
own   country       sales of each board.              The inverse demand in the third country is

given     by   D(x, x*), where x and x' are sales of each board to the third

country.       Notice that while a homogeneous good is provided by all domestic

suppliers, domestic production may be imperfectly substitutable with foreign

production.8          With market segmentation, each board can price discriminate

between its domestic market and the third market.                               The inverse supply function

from competitive producers is given by c(x +                          y)     at home and      c(x'   ÷ y*)


abroad, where c and c* are marginal cost functions.

        Four institutional variations are considered with market segmentation.

The board maximizes either profits or producer surplus.                                The profit maximizing
                                       —7—


board is called a 'P' board while the surplus maximizing one is a '5' board.

In addition, the board may be regulated to supply domestic demand at its

marginal cost.   This is equivalent to forcing competitive supply in the home

market, with the board as the sole marketing agent in international

transactions.    The absence of regulation is denoted by 'N' whi1e its presence

is denoted by 'R'.     Thus four combinations are possible, and four kinds of

marketing boards, denoted by PN, PR, SN, and SR. are analyzed.

     We assume that the government has the ability to tax or subsidize

exports, domestic production and consumption.      s, v and r   de'ote   the level of

the export subsidy, production subsidy, and co'sumption subsidy if they are

positive and denote taxes, in the event they are negative.

     The timing of moves is crucial.     The government moves first and sets

imposed by regulation.

     Before we begin the analysis, we would like to stress that we use a model

of conjectural variations only to parameterize the nature of competition.            As

is well known, the appropriate choice of conjectural variations gives the

special cases of Cournot and Bertrand competition.9       Also we are considering

                                           retaliation.         That is, although the

    We will first consider the board's problem, and then analyze the optimal

government policy.        We will consider the behavior of a domestic board of any

                                                           to the domestic
type, and we will assume that the foreign board is similar

one.1°       Throughout, r will denote the objective function of the domestic board.

Table    I   gives profits of the PN and SN boards.    These are the sum of revenues

from sales at home and abroad and net subsidies from the government, less

                           Notice the costs of the RN and SN boards differ.      This is
costs to the board.

because the per unit cost to the RN board is the competitive supply price

which rises as the amount purchased increases. Its total cost is this supply

price multiplied by its purchases.        However total cost to the SN board,

C(x÷y), is just the area under the competitive supply curve.

     As usual, each kind of board chooses its home and foreign sales, y and x,

to maximize its objective function, given government policies and its

                                                           y   for the home board and
conjectural variation parameter which is denoted by

y* for the foreign board.        Both x and y are chosen according to the first

order conditions for profit maximization given in Table 1.

        The optimal choice of y is given by the second first order condition for

                                                      This equation defines y for

conditions hold in our model, so that their intersection gives the equilibrium

x and x* for given tax policies of the governments.                 The usual comparative

statics exercises can also be performed by linearizing these two best response

functions.    Notice that cnanges in (r+v) or (s+v) shift the home best response

U'(y)     d(y) = P0 due to utility maximization.
       This gives social welfare as given in Table 1.            Since   x   and y depend on

only (r+v) and (s+v), so does welfarei1               Also, as U(y)      Py   =   $(y)    is

consumer surplus and    it   + T   =   ft   is net profits of the board, welfare         is just

the sum of the board's net profits, consumer surplus, and the surplus of

competitive producers.

       Now we can turn to the optimal levels of (r+v) and (s+v).                  The government

chooses (r+v) and (s+v) to maximize welfare.              The first order conditions for

this problem, after substituting in the board's first order conditions, are

given in Table 1.     We assume that the second order conditions hold, so that

these first order conditions in turn yield the optimal policies also given in

Table 1.    Notice that only (r+v) and (sty) can be defined.              This arises from

the observation that an export subsidy at any rate has the same effect as a

consumption tax and production subsidy at the same rate.              Hence there is one

degree of freedom in choosing r, s, and v.              Also notice that as x and             y   depend

on (r+v) and (s+v), the solutions for these values are implicit, not expiicit

      The first term in the optimal level of (s+v),
                                                    ft*(gy). is the strategic
distortion previously mentioned.              For example, with downward sloping best

responses and Cournot competition, this calls for a subsidy on exports as

      < C when the domestic and foreign goods are substitutes and g <                    y.       This

is because the domestic marketing board takes x* as given (y =                  0),   but along

the foreign best response function x* fails as x rises (g <               0).     Since the

government chooses policy first, it can correct this distortion by choosing

s =
      ft*(gt)   > 0 which encourages exports and increases profits as
                                                                      ft><

objective function does not include the profits of competitive suppliers.

This distortion arises because of the board1s monopsony power.                                     An increase in

output raises       ir0   and so raises welfare.                  This calls for a subsidy on

production, so V =                   .    If   g =   y,    there is no strategic distortion, and the

optimal s+v is positive to correct the distortion present due to the monopsony

oower of the board,             In addition, the optimal level of (r+v)                       is such that

r     t' >    0;   because of its monopoly power, the board sets j                        too      low, so that a

oonsumptior subsidy is called for,                          This dscussion illustrates our targeting

principle in oligopolistic markets.                          The export subsidy/tax is targeted to tne

strategic distortion, the production subsidy/tax is targeted to the production

distortion, while the consumption distortion is targeted by a consumption

subsidy/tax.12

       Our results can also be illustrated using Figure 1.                            "he     loci   XX and VY

)rder conditions hold.                   Thus the point A represents the profit maximizing

hoice of x and y in the absence of policy.                            The point B in the figure depicts

Lhe welfare maximizing choice of x and y for any                             x.   it is determined by the

intersection of the xx and yy loci,                          The yy locus depicts the combinations of

    and y such that the derivative of welfare witn respect to y is zero.                                  xx is

naiogously defined taking into account that x* varies with x along the

oreign best response function. Again the relative slopes are given by second
)rder conditions.           Notice that xx and yy do not shift with (r+v) and (s÷vJ

when foreign policies are given.                          Optimal tax/subsidy policy is determinea so

:hat the board's profits are maximized at B rather than A.                                The levels of r,s,

and v such that welfare is stationary in x and y                     at    the profit maximizing

point give the optimal policies of Figure 1.

        Recalling that an increase in (r+v) shifts the XX locus to the right, an

an increase in (s+v) does the same to the Yt locus, we can determine the sign

of optimal policies by evaluating the derivative of welfare with respect to x

and y at A.13          Notice that at A welfare is always increasing in y.                     This

follows because the derivative of welfare with respect to y at A is

['(y) +      ne],          The derivative of welfare with respect to x at A is

                  +   cl        If (gy) <   0,   welfare is increasing in x at point A, but            i




(g.y)    >   0,   welfare may be increasing or decreasing in x at A since

              and     n     have opposite effects.            Hence whether B lies to the northeas

of A as we have drawn it, or northwest, depends on the sign of (g-y).

        If (g-y) <         0,   the point B lies to the northeast of A.            This calls for


(r+v)    > 0 and (s+v) > 0 in order to shift the XX and yy loci so that they

intersect at B.             However, (g-y)       >   0 will imply B lies north or northwest of         A


Hence optimally (r+v) >              0,   but the sign of (s+v) will depend on the relative

strengths of the strategic and producer surplus distortions.                         If the strategi

distortion outweighs the producer surplus distortion, that is, B is in

Region 2 of Diagram I, (s+v)                <   0 and   (r÷v)   > 0 is called for.    If the opposit

is true,      B is in Region 3, so that both (s+v) and (r+v) are positive.                        It is

profits, welfare, and the first order conditions for profit and welfare

maximization are given in Table 1, as are the optimal policies.                            In tnis case,

as no production distortion exists, it is optimal to set v                          0.     (ft   denotes

net profits with a PM or SM board for notational convenience.                            The   ft's    refer

to different functions in the two cases.)

        Again Figure 1 can be used to illustrate the optimal choice of                           (v)     and

(s+v).        As before, the XX and YY loci depict the first order conditions for

the board for a given x* and y in the absence of policy.                    The xx and yy loci

are defined as before so that the point B depicts the                   eifare       maximizing

choice of x and y for any x*.              As before, the value of the derivatives of

e1fare        with respect to x and y at A indicate the positior of B relative to A,

and thus the direction of optimal policies.                    The derivative of welfare with

respect to y at        A   is   '(y)    which is positive.       The derivative of welfare              ith
respect to x at A is simply (g-l')ft* with the SN board,                   rence (g-y) < 0

implies welfare is increasing in x at A, and this calls for (r+v) > 0 and

(s+v)    >    0.   However, {g-y) > 0 implies welfare is decreasing in                   x at     A.    As

with    the    PN board,   Regon    I   can be ruled    out,    so that B is   in   Region        2 which

calls for (r+v) > 0 and (s+v)              <   0.   Optimal policies again are defined by

stationarity of welfare with respect to x and y at the profit maximization

point.

        For both the PM and SM ooards, tnere is no terms of trade distortion

motivating trade policy with market segmentation,                    A terms of trade distortion

arises in perfectly competitive models of large countries because,Ia                              n    the

absence of government policy, marginal cost is equated witn the average,

rather than the marginal terms of trade from the country's point of view,                                 No

such distortion arises in these models of trade with market segmentation

because, in the absence of policy, both the profit and surplus maximizing

boards choose the level of exports which equates marginal cost with the

marginal revenue from exports.                  In the next section we show that this changes

when the government allows price discrimination, but does not allow the board

to exercise monopoly power at home.



                             4.    ed                               Boards

      In this section we study the effects of a particular way of regulating

domestic pricing policies on optimal government intervention.                     The price at

which consumers are willing to buy an extra unit is given by d(y) +                    r.   This

is called the demand price.              The price at which competitive suppliers are

willing to sell an extra Unit is called the supply price and equals

c(x+y) —     v.     The regulation considered requires that the demand price equal

the supply price.          This regulation prevents the exercise of monopoly power

over domestic consumers.

      The regulation requires that:


(1)            c(x+y) =    d(y)    +   (r+v).

      We focus first on a profit maximizing board.                   The profits of the board ar

given in Table 2.          However, due to the regulation, the board cannot choose the

level of y.         Given any (r+v), and x, the level of            y   is determined by (1) and i

denoted by (x,r+v),            It is easy to verify that          x = c(x÷y)/d'(y) -
while   y           =
                        [d (y) -   C   (x+y)]
                                                .   Thus the optimal choice of x for the board
            (r+v)
is given by the first order condition for x in Table 2.                      An analagous

condition holds for the foreign board, and                  the two conditions together

determine      the equilibrium levels of x and              x   given the tax policies of

governments.        y(x,r+v) is determined through the regulatory constraint.

        As before, the government need only choose (r+v) and (s+v) to maximize

social welfare given in Table 2.                  Notice that in contrast to Section 3,

the choice of y is not such that it maximizes profits given x, i.e.,                                           0.
Substituting for y(x,r÷v)             in   welfare and using the profit maximization

condition yields the first order conditions for welfare maximization given in

Table 2.

        As usual,       r, s, and v    are     not uniquely defined,           Our targeting principle

still applies, and differences between policy here and in                             the   absence of

reguiaton can be explained in terms of a market linkage created by the

government regulation.           We illustrate this in two ways.

        If the export subsidy/tax targets the strategic distort-ion,                           then

s   ft(g-7). at the optimum,                   The optimal production subsidy/tax is then

                    +           This     is because the presence of regulation creates a

link between the distortions on the production and consumption side since an

increase in x reduces y.              A production subsidy raises x out lowers y.                        The

total    effect of a unit increase in x on (x+y) is                                  which is positive.

This raises      rrc   by   [l+y}        and this effect calls for v >                0.    However, the

reduction in y also changes                by i'y> and this effect calls for v <                   0.     The

optimal value of         v   is determined by both these effects.                    Similarly, a

consumption suesidy raises y.                  However, regulation requires that the increase

in y be induced by a reduction in x and a net reduction in                             (xy).     The

increase in y raises welfare while the reduction                       -in   (x+y)    lowers it.        The
optimal value of r is determined by both these effects to be

r =
      —'x — m°[i+]               Notice that r =        -v.
      Alternatively, the optimal policy can be implemented with only one

instrument, s, being non-zero.               The regulation targets the consumption

distortion.       Since there is no consumer distortion when c(x +              y)   =    d(y),    the

                                                             and the simplest
regulation requires that any non-zero r and v be offsetting,

way to do this is to set both to zero.                  The strategic and monopsony

                                                                                     —         +
distortions remain, but these can be offset by setting s                     ft*(g

But notice that the optimal            level      of (s+v) also includes   y(5C      +   ').       This

term exists because the board sets foreign sales above the level at which

                                                        It does so in order to circumvent the
marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
                                                                hence domesti
regulation as increasing foreign sales raises marginal cost and

price.    Thus a further distortion is introduced by government regulation.

      The analysis is similar when the marketing board maximizes producer

surplus and is regulated.            Profits here differ from the PR case only in that

the latter do not include the profits of coapetitive suppliers.                          Once again y

is not chosen since the hoard is regulated.                   The first order condition for

                                                               as is social
maximizing the board's objective function is given in Table 2,

welfare, which is the sum of net profits of the board, A, and consumer

surplus,      .   As before      (r+v) and (s+v)        are the only instruments required, and

the first order conditions governing their choice are given in Table 2.

Since

                                    c(')j,       the optimal level of (r+v) must be zero, and

that of (s+v) must be           s(g-y)       +           Notice   again that only s need be

non-zero at the optimum.             Also, since the interests of competitive producers

are taken into account in A, the monopsony distortion is removed.                          When only

one instrument is used, s targets the strategic distortion and the induced

distortion in consumption.             Raising x reduces y and therefore p, which gives

the induced consumption            distortion,

     These results can also be illustrated using Figure 1.                 Where x* is given

as before, point A depicts the choice of x and y which maximizes the board's

objective function in the absence of either regulation or taxes.                   The point B

depicts the welfare maximizing            choice of x and y.

     Under regulation, the board's choice of x and y is defined by the

tangency of its highest perceived isoprofit contour with the regulatory locus,

whose position is determined by (r+v).               Since the objective is to have the

tangency occur at B, this requires setting (r+v)                0 so that the regulatory

locus coincides with the yy curve.               The tangency occurs at a point C in Figure

I for r =      v   = s =   0.    By altering (s+v), different points along the yy locus

can be reached.            In particular, the point B can be made to be the board's

optimal choice.        The (s+v} that performs this function is implicitly defined

by the slope of a perceived isoprofit contour given y and this (s+v) being

equal to the slope of the yy locus at B.

     This results in levels of (s+v) given in Table 2.                 The sum of the last

two terms in the optimal value of (s÷v) for the PR board is positive, so that

(s+v) > 0 when (g-y) < 0.             In this case the point C, i.e., the tangency for

(s+v) =   0,    occurs to the left of B.         Shifting the board's isoprofit contours

appropriately       can be achieved by an export subsidy which raises x, moving the

tangency point towards B.             When (g—y) > 0, appropriate policy may be either an

export tax or subsidy since the tangency for (s+v) =              0   may occur either to the

export tax or subsidy depending on the sign of                        ÷
                                                                          ''>'   i.e.,   the

    Notice that (r+v) is optimally zero in the regulated case since B lies

along the yy locus and (r+v) = 0 along this locus.        However, regulation alonE

does not lead to the first best optimum since tangency at B is not ensured

when (s#v) =   0.


                         5.    The Case of Many   Market-ins
     In this section we analyze optimal government policy when there are       m

domestic marketing boards and m* foreign marketing boards.        While Sections 3

and 4 describe the cases one usually thinks of with regard to agricultural

marketing boards; there are cases where different regions within a country

have their own marketing boards,         In addition, our analysis is intended to

apply to policy targeting for any oligopolistic industry where imperfectly

competitive exporters purchase a product from competitive producers to sell

both at home and in world markets.         Hence it is of interest to know how the

number of boards in the domestic and        foreign market affects optimal policy.
     We shall present the analysis for boards which maximize profits in the

absence of regulation.         As in Section 3, domestic boards are the sole

suppliers to domestic consumers, and compete with foreign boards in the thirc

market.   They are assumed to price discriminate between their domestic markel

and the third market.         We choose this example to illustrate the effect of

having more boards because of the existence of both producer and consumer

surplus distortions.

     Recall that optimal policy was determined by three kinds of distortions

when a single domestic marketing board and a single foreign board competed           ir



a third market.     A   consumption distortion called for a consumption
                                        -19-

subsidy/tax,   a production distortion called for a production subsidy/tax, and

a strategic distortion called for an export subsidy/tax.      As the number of

boards in the domestic market is increased, we would expect the consumption

and production distortions to decrease because the ability of boards to

exercise monopoly or monopsony power would decline.      As these distortions

decline we would expect the role of government policy in offsetting them to

decline.    Also, the results of Dixit (1984) and Eaton and Grossman (1986) show

that the strategic distortion depends on the number of boards and that a terms

of trade distort,on is created because of the inabflty of a domestic board to

internalize the effects of its actions on the terms of trade.      This intuition

is easily verified.

     in oroer to focus on the effect of market size on distortions, we present

the case of many marketing boards with Cournot competition.      We look at

identical boards at home and, similarly, at identical boards abroad, and

consider the symmetric equilibrium.

     Profits of the ith domestic board are given in Table 3.      Capital V and X

denote total sales of all domestic boards at home and in the third market, and

X* denotes total sales of foreign exporting boards in the third market.

Profits of the jth foreign board are given by an analogous equation.      Each

ooard chooses x1 and y1 to maximize ir,    given   r, s, v and its conjecture that


both domestic and foreign rival boards maintain given sales at home and

abroad.    The first order conditions for each board are as given in Table      3.


Given Cournot competition, the sum of all of the m boards' first orde'

conditions at home can be written as:
                                               -20-


(2)           d'(Y)Y + md('() —   c'(X+Y)(X+Y)   - mc(X+Y)   +   m(r+v)   =   0


(3)            D!(X+X*)X + mO(X+X*)    c'(X+Y)(X+Y)      mc()+Y)     +   m(s+v) = 0


Similar equations arise from summing the m* foreign boards! first order

conditions.       It is easily verified from these four equations that
dX*Id(sv\ = dX*Id("+v\ which we        will denote by g. The usual second order
dX/d(s+v)         dX/d(r÷v)
and   stability conditions are      assumed.

        The                                                                         Table 3
              government chooses (s+v) and (r+v) to maximize welfare.

gives   social welfare and the      first order conditions for       welfare maximization,
where   use is made of (2) and (3) and the definition of g given above.                  These

first order conditions define the optimal policies in Table 3.                    As before, v

can be targeted toward the production distortion, and equals rr /m.                    r then


targets the consumption distortion, given by          '/m.       The strategic and terms of

trade distortions are targeted by s, which is now given by D'Xg +                   D'X[m-l]/m,
The first term represents the familiar strategic distortion in the Cournot

case.    With downward slcping best response functions this calls for a subsidy.

However, with more boards, competition among hoards in the third market is
excessive since firms do not fully internalize the effects of their output
decisions on price faced by domestic ooards, This is captured by the second
term and calls for a tax for ml,, Since the strategic and terms of trade
distortions have opposing effects, the sign of s is ambiguous and depends                     on

the relative magnitudes of g and [m—1]/m, The slope of the foreign best
response      function, g, depends on the number of foreign boards as well as

demand     cost parameters, so that whether an export tax or subsidy is called
          and

for depends on the relative number of boards at home and abroad.

     As before, the optimal policies are implioit as X and V depend on               (r÷v)

and (s+v).    Explicit solutions for the optimal policies in a linear example

are available from the authors.       With linear demand and marginal cost, the

optimal value of (r+v) approaches zero as the number of home boaros approaches

infinity This results from the diminished ability of home boards to exercise

monopoly and monopsony power at home as m becomes large.           The optical (s÷v)

oecomes a tax as m approaches infinity           This is oecause the terms of trade

distortion outwe'ghs toe strategic distortion, and the production distortion

vanishes.



                            6.    orcratnArbitrae
64   The Ef'ect of Arb4traae

     in our analysis so    fr     we have assumed that no arbitrage is possible

between markets     This is wrat allowed the neat targeting results of the

earlier   sectors    in   tbs    section we show that the   effec   of arcitrage on the

nature of    optma poHcies       is sbstant'al,     Aro4rage-   l4ks   marKets    an

setting domestic and foreign sales separately, the government can helo

separate marKets by   settng      trade taxes'sios'dies to do so.

     We show that with arbitrage, a regulated board loses toe            ad' ity    to

behave strategically.     This is because regulation with aro4trage regulates the

world market and essentially redvoes the board to follow marginal cost pricing

and behave comoetitively.        This remojes any production,    cnrsumpton        and


strategic thstortions.     However, it creates the usual terms of trade
                                          22
distortion since the government can change toe teras of trade by its trade

tax/subsidy policies.     Thus   the   optsa poroy     here is shown to be one that

targets tne terms of trade distortion and consists of only an export tax or

:wport tariff depending or whether the country 45 5 net exporter cr                worte,

This is true whether we consicer a PR or SR board.

reduces the domestic price, raising domestic oorsusption.              An ino'ease in

However, in this case y and x are positively related, wnile with reguiatior

oney are negatively related.       In addition, the arbitrage locus is not as
                                                     —23—




closely    related to the welfare maximizing locus, yy, as the regulation

condition is.

      We will consider the case with arbitrage and regulation first since it

more transparent.


6.2   Arbitrage and Regulation

      Regulation requires that the board equate the demand and supply price                         a
home.     With arbitrage this means that it must be set so that


(5)         d(y(x+x*, s-r)) +     r    =   c(x   +    y(x÷x*,   s—r))     v.


Thus, for a given x*, the board has no choice in setting x.                         Thus   (5   is tne

analogue of the home     boards       best response function in earlier sections,                  Th

analogous equation defined for the foreign board gives another relationship

between x and x*, and is


(6>         d*(y*(x+x*, s*r*)) +           r*        c*(x* +   y*(x+x*,   5*_r*))     v.

      Together these equations solve for the equilibrium levels of x and x*                          f

any given levels of taxes.        Notice that (5) and (5) hold irrespective of

whether we have a PR board or a SR board,                   Also, since home taxes/subsidies

only affect the location of (5), g, the change in                   x as x     changes along (5)

the ratio
               dx/da
                       for a =   (r+v}     and (s-r).          As usual, we assume that the

relative slopes of best response functions are such that the equilibrium is

stable.

      Now we are ready to define optimal policy.                   As before, welfare equals         t

sum of consumer surplus and total net profits.                     With a SR board these are        u
                                                                —24--



the board's profits.               With a PR board, these equal the sum of the board's

profits and those of competitive                       producers.            In either case:


(7)          W =       $(y('))         +    [d(y('fly(') +          D(x+x*)x         -
                                                                                         C(x+y('fl]

                =   (y()) + ft(x,x*,v(.))
where C(S) is total cost.                     Since the equilibrium level of x depends on (s-r),

(rev), (s*_r*), and (r*+v*) from (5) and (6), so does y.                                         Therefore welfare

can be affected only by changing (s—r) and (rev).                                        The former is the

difference    between the price consumers face at home, d(y), and the price that

consumers face abroad, D(x+x*) as seen from the arbitrage condition                                           (4).   The

latter is the difference between marginal costs and the price consumers face

at home by (5).

       Thus, the optimal                   levels of (s-r) and (rev) are implicitly defined by the

following:16

                dW       =   V         +
                                            7tg    +            +
                                                                                            ldx       =   0
             d(r+v)                                    my           $'(Y)]Y+*(1+g)j+(

             d(r)

                                                                    Nv
                                                                         +   '           J[vx+x*1+9d(r)
                                                                                                              +            =


This   requires that:


(10)
             lty
                   +   t'(y)       =   d(y)    —
                                                   c(y)     =   0




(11)               +           =   D'(x+x*)x(l+g)               + 0(X+X*) -          c(x+y)

                               =   0'(x+x*)x(l+g)                   (s+v) =      0
                                             —25'-



where the second equality in (11) comes from the arbitrage and regulation

conditions.         Thus, from (10) and regulation we know (r+v) = 0 optimally, while

from (11) we know that (s+v) =         0(x+x*)x(1+g).       Therefore, r = V =             0,   and

s < 0 if x > 0, i.e.,          an export tax, and s > 0 if x < 0.            As usual, we

interpret the latter as an import tarif',             in this we are assuming that

(1÷g)    >   0   as it is with symmetry and stability.

        The optimal policies can be understood using Figure 2, whicn is drawn for

x* equal to its equilioriua value with r, s, v, set optimally.                     yy and xx have

the same interpretation as before,           The FR line gives the locus of points

                                                     RR is drawn for (rev)             0.       It lies
satisfying the regulation eouation (5).

above yy ehich is also the regulatory if (rtv) =             0.    xx and yy intersect at B.

The curve aa is the arbitrage ecJation (4) for 5                  r =   0.    The 4ntersecton of

RR and ca at A gives the equiiibHun levels of x and y for s =                      r   =    0, v   > 0.


The governmert's proolem is to scve A to B.              This is done by        settng          r = v =


which moves RR to        yy.    This moves tne intersection to C.            in addition, tne cc

curve has to cc moveo to go througn B.           This is done by changing 5.                    gure      2


is drawn for the case where an export tax is optimal                    A    tax on exports is

optimal if the equilibrium level of x, when policies are set optimally, is

positive.         In this case the cc curve with s = 0 lies below B as showr.                      A

decrease in s shifts cc up to          cc   so that the intersection ooint of the

arbitrage and regulation equations goes through B.


6,3     raewithoutReulat)On
        In the absence of regulation, arbitrage merely limits the ability o                            the

board to set both x and y independently.              It does not remove the cno Ce of
                                                           -26


output itself as occurs when regulation is also imposed.                             We will consider the

SN board here, leaving the analysis of the PM board to the reader.                               ft   denotes

net profits of the board.

       Maximization of profits, after substituting in for y(xtx*,                          sr)

determined by (4), gives:


            a       +
                        a,i      +    (s+v)     + Lit +
                                                           (r+v)]y*(1+7)         0


here    y is the conjectured variation on                     x   by the home board.      A similar

souction exists for the foreign board, and the equilibrium values of x and

are iapiicitiy defined by these two equations.                            Once again changes in r, s.

and v shift (12), and trace out the foreign best response function so that g

has the usual meaning.

       The welfare maximizing choices of (s+v) and (sr) are defined by the

oovernment's first order conditions.                        These imply that the optimal (sty) and

(s-r) are those defined by (13) and (14) below:


C13)
•           a

                    +   'i'(y)       =   d(y)     c(x+y)

                                     = O(x+x*)       c(x+y) +     (s-r)   = 0


where the second equality arises from using the arbitrage condition.                                  The

optimal level of (s-r) is thus:


            sr          =   _(D(x+x*)           c(x+y)]


Therefore, if the world price exceeds marginal cost of production, the price

to consumers at home should be below the price to consumers in the third

market,    Le.,   this calls for a consumption subsidy.                    Substituting for the

                                                                    D-c)y+*(l+T)
                                                                                        = 0


This gives the optimal level of (s+v) as:




             (s+v) =
                                        —
                                            [fty   +   (0-c)] 1+y(1+y)

Let s = 0 so that (15) gives r and            (1'7)    gives   v.

        To interpret these policies first recall that there is no production

distortion with the SN board.           The board exercises monopoly power at home in

the absence of     regulation,   and    our   analysis shows a consumption subsidy should

be targeted toward this distortion Notice that the consumption subsidy is

set so that d(y)       c(x+y), but arbitrage links d(y) to the world price.

        Also notice that, because of the multimarket linkages caused by

arbitrage, the strategic distortion does not enter in                       the   setting of (s-r),   so

that    a production subsidy can be         targeted     toward the        strategic distorticn
Again,    arbitrage crucially affects the targeting principle as the optimal

level    of v is determined by linkage effects in addition to the strategic
                                                                      ft

distortion.  Hence, the strategic term in (17) is 1+y             Also notice
                                                      x+x* (1+)')
that the optimal v includes both this strategic effect and an additional terii

because of arbitrage.

                                 7.   Conclusion

     In this paper we have attempted to illustrate how the oonoept of a

strategio distortion can be used to identify optimal polioy in imperfectly

competitive markets, and to derive an analogue of the targeting principle for

competitive markets.   As we have shown, this is such easier, when price

disorimination is allowed between markets, as arbitrage links markets togetner

creating muitimarket effects of a policy.      However, even in the presence of

arbitrage and in the absence of regulation, the strategic distortion

infThences only (s÷v), the wedge between the producer price and the consume

price in the third market,         the world price.    It does not affect (sr),

the wedge between the consumer price at home, d(y), and the world price,     ON)
Regulation eliminates any strategic distortion and a role for policy exists to

the extent that exports exist and the terms of trade can be affected by

pol icy

     There are a             issues which are not addressed in our analysis.

nkating boards     are often direct extensions of the government, and have the

same objective function as the government.      in this case, the government can

have no effect on welfare unless it has some advantage, informational or

otherwise over the board.    However, in general, any objective function on the

part of the board and of government can be handled and the results will, of

course, be sensitive to the formulation employed.

     it may be argued that the direction of the strategic distortion is hard

to identify in practice; however, recent work suggests that computable partial

equilibrium models, such as Dixit (1288), can be used to estimate the

strategic distortion, making practical applications feasible.      On the other
                                       —29—




hand, precommitment to    a policy may be hard and possible retaliation by other

countries could undo any beneficial effects of such policies.     Also optimal

policy becomes much more complex when one allows for endogenous distortions,

as in Rodrik (1987).     Simple targeting prnciples are no longer applicable in

such scenarios.   Finally, the reader may be perturbed by the nonuniqueness of

r, s, and v.   Such nonuniquesness is generic in these models, and in this

paper we assign instruments to distortions following economic intuition.     A

way of pinning this down would be to include a cost of such policies but this

would obfuscate the targeting principles derived    here

     We beiieve that our work is important for at least two reasons.     First,

it shows that use of trade policy should be examined, in terms of optimality,


by considering all existing distortions and avalable instruments.      This is

because trade policy may be unable to target all the distort4ons and thus be

far from first best when consioered in isolation-     Our targeting principle

allows us to interpret when trade policy is first best.

     Second, while computable part1al equil4brium models promise to help

formulate optimal policy, our results show that optimal poiicy is sensitive to

assumptions about market structure, arbitrage, and regulation.     The use of

such models is warranted only when sensitivity analysis ndicates the results

are not dramatically affected by changes in model structure,     Our work would

help in developing model variations for sensitivity analysis and in

interpreting the results of such exercises.     In future work we hope to provide

further applications of targeting as well as address some of the issues raised

above.

literature in detail, but refer the interested reader to the excellent survey

by Dixit (1987).

4.   The terms of trade distortion exists because of a coordination problem.

The individual firms take the world price as given, when it, in fact, depeno;

on total domestic output.     In the case of one home firm, no such problem

arises,

5.   Eaton and Grossman (1986) allow arbitrage when domestic consumption is

included and point out that the effect of policy on the price faced by

doaestic consumers is vital,

6.   Just et al. (1979) derive optimal policy for each of the institutional

variations in marketing boards we consider in Sections 3 and 4.     However,

their analysis is of a marketing board which is a monopolist in the world

market, so that strategic effects are absent.     Their analysis is also a

partial equilibrium one like ours.

     Markusen (1984) examines a board which maximizes producer surplus, with

and without regulation.     His analysis is a general equilibrium one, but his

focus is not on strategic interactions between boards.

7.   See Hoos (1979) and World Development Report (1986) for some examples of

real life marketing boards and how such boards operate in different countries.

         Greater product differentiation can be allowed, but as it adds little to

he interpretations offered and does complicate the derivations.                         In later

ections when we allow arbitrage, we assume the same homogeneous good is

roduced by both domestic and foreign firms as product differentiation greatly

omplicates tne analysis.

         The standard objection to conjectural variations models is the absence of

    well defined extensive form.                 However, we feel that its usefulness in

arameteritng the nature of competition and the strategic distortion warrants
ts use as an expository tool in this paper.

0.       Changing this assumption will only have quantitative, not qualitative,

ffects.

1.       It is worth noticing that 1n the absence of arbitrage between home and

oreign markets, the government can create a wedge between the price producers

et at home,                  and the   pice    consumers pay at home        and the price producers
                         P
at abroad            P   and the price consumers pay abroad,                Since

     =   d(y)    +   (r+v),     pn =   d(y),      =   D(x,x*)   ÷ (s+v), end    =   D(x,x),    the

ormer wedge is given by the size of (r+v), and the latter by (s÷v),                           This is

he reason why only (r÷v) and (sty)                     enter the problem.

2.       Expressing these policies in                 tems   of e1asticites provides additional

ituition.            s/D =     -(gy)9/E     where 9 is the share of the home board in the

nird market and E is the elasticity of denand in the third market.                            Thus the

Kport subsidy as a percentage of the world price is greater the larger is

/E.       Also r/d =          I/c   where e is the home market's elasticity of demand.           Thus

ie consumption subsidy is high in percentage terms when the market elasticity

s    low.       Finally, v/c =         r   where p is the elasticity of marginal cost.         Thus v
                                          —32-


as a percentage of marginal cost is large when marginal cost is elastic in

output, i.e. when marginal cost rises relatively fast.

13.        Of course, we are assuming that both welfare and the board's objective

functions are well behaved.        That is, they are quasiconcave and have a unique

maximum.

1&         See Jones (1987) for a discussion of the optimum tariff and market

segmentation with a private monopolist.

15         This allows us to keep the framework as close to the no arbitrage case

possible.        Allowing product differentiation with arbitrage would significanti
                                                                results
complicate the analysis of arbitrage without adding much to the
