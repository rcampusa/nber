                   Public   Sector Recognition Strikes:
                            Illegal and Ill-Fated


                                 ABSTRACT




     This   study investigates the relationship between strike activity by

nonunion public employees and unionization. Examining the strike activi-

ty and unionization rates of some 600 nonunion municipal police depart-

ments from 1972 to 1978, this study finds that recognition strikes are

concentrated where bargaining laws provide little or no protection of

bargaining rights for municipal police. However, these strikes do not

increase the unionization propensities of these police departments.

I.   INTRODUCTION

     Recent studies on union growth in the public sector find that the

nature of the state bargaining statute regulating public sector bargain-

ing is the single most important determinant of unionization. Saltzman

documents this relationship for the occupation of teachers,1 while

Ichniowski reaches the same conclusion for police. 2   Research on public

sector strike activity during the 1970's finds that most public sector

work stoppages in this period of rapid growth in public unionization were

strikes by nonunion departments in states with little or no statutory

protection of public employee bargaining rights.3 Often these strikes by

nonunion departments were for union recognition. While the first set of

studies indicates that little unionization exists in states without

bargaining laws, the second set of studies suggests that the low levels

of unionization in these states may not correspond to similarly low

levels of demand for unionization by employees in these states. Specifi-

cally, employees in states without laws are more likely to strike even

though public employee work stoppages, particularly among public safety

employees, are almost always illegal.4 When the two sets of studies are

considered together, a natural question arises. Are public employees who

strike for recognition successful in their attempts to unionize? Or, do

adverse public sentiment and the attendant penalties and fines for

illegal work stoppages cause these efforts to fail?

     The theoretical answer to this question is ambiguous. It has been

argued that public employees, especially police and firefighters, can

wield considerable economic power by striking since the essential nature

of their services may mean the labor demand curve is highly inelastic,

particularly in the short run.5 However, employers may be able to oppose
                                                                           2




the unionization efforts by imposing penalties (or threatening to impose

penalties) against employees who are involved in illegal work stoppages.

     By examining the rate of unionization among those nonunion police

departments that went on strike for recognition between 1972 and 1978 and

comparing it to the rate of unionization among other municipal police

departments, this study addresses this unanswered question. The analysis

reveals that nonunion police who specifically strike for recognition do

not increase the probability of unionization in their departments. In

fact, the rate of unionization among all nonunion departments that engage

in a work stoppage (that is, not just those work stoppages where the

principal reason was for recognition) is significantly lower than the

unionization rate of police departments that do not strike.



II. SAMPLE DESIGN, DATA, AND MODEL

     To assess the impact of police recognition strikes on unionization

propensities appropriately, the research design should incorporate

several features. First, the study would be able to identify dates of

the strikes and dates of unionization to determine precisely whether

strikes preceded or post-dated unionization. Second, subsequent union-

ization of striking nonunion departments would be compared to the union-

ization rate among other police departments as the relevant control

group. Additionally, other municipal and state characteristics that

could affect unionization rates of police departments should be con-

trolled in multivariate probability equations. The sample, variables,

and model in this study incorporate these features.
                                                                           3




Unionization Measures

     Since actual dates of unionization among public sector employees is

required in this study, I use responses from a 1979 survey6 that

specifically asks the following two questions: "Does your city have a

written labor contract covering wages, hours, and conditions of employ-

ment for police personnel?" and "What year was the first written labor

contract signed?" According to these questions, formal recognition

exists (i.e., UNION = 1) once a written collective bargaining agreement

is negotiated. Other kinds of police associations that do not negotiate

written contracts will not be considered as unionized departments in this

study. It is assumed that cities that report having a contract have

continually been party to the agreement since the date given in response

to the second survey question. This survey covers nearly 1,000 munici-

palities with populations above 10,000 that reported municipal police

employment in the Municipal Yearbook in l978.

Work Stoppages

     Data on work stoppages by municipal police departments were collect-

ed from two sources. When available, information was taken directly from

the reporting form filed with the Industrial Relations Unit of the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).8 Since the data on dates of police

unionization extend only through 1978, the forms reporting data on police

work stoppage were collected for years prior to 1978. They were avail-

able for 1972, 1973, 1976, 1977, and 1978. Similar work stoppage data

are reported in volumes of Labor-Management Relations in State and Local

Governments.9 Data tapes for these volumes were used to identify police

departments that went on strike between October 1974 and December 1975.

Records to identify those police departments that went on strike from
                                                                           4



January 1974 to September 1974 were not available; however, the aggregate

number of police strikes in this period is available from the 1974

published volume. According to these different sources, there were a

total of 115 police strikes between 1972 and 1978. Excluding the four-

teen police strikes during 1974 for which the exact municipalities

involved could not be identified, 52 of the remaining 101 police strikes

were identified as involving nonunion police departments. Of these 52

strikes, 22 reported that the principal issue involved was recognition or

the attempt to obtain a first contract. When recognition or a first

contract is reported to be the central issue, a dummy variable for the

presence of a recognition strike (RECOGA) equals one. Since the report-

ing forms are retrospective, and since managers or clerks completing this

form may underreport the existence of recognition strikes when such

strikes do not lead to unionization, a broader definition of a recogni-

tion strike (RECOGB) is also used. RECOGB equals one any time a nonunion

police department goes on strike. Here, the argument is that even though

the principal issue may not be recognition, recognition may be a minor

issue or become an issue as the strike progresses. The rate of unioniza-

tion among departments for which RECOGA = 1 is expected to be greater

than the rate of unionization among the larger set of nonunion depart-

ments for which RECOGB = 1.

     Since the strike data are collected back to 1972, the sample for

this study consists of municipal police departments that were nonunion at

the beginning of 1972. Specifically, if responses to the unionization

survey indicate that the first collective bargaining agreement was signed

before 1972, the municipality can not be included in the sample. The

number of municipalities which meet these criteria and which report all
                                                                          5




additional control variables described below is 579. Between 1972 and

1978 then, there were 52 strikes among these 579 nonunion police

departments.

Bargaining Laws

     Among other variables that influence the propensity of public

employees to unionize, the most significant according to previously cited

studies are the state bargaining laws. In developing these categories, I

focus on two related dimensions: the degree to which bargaining rights

are protected and the degree to which impasse procedures ensure closure

of the bargaining process.

     The first category is "bargaining permitted" (BP). These legal

frameworks establish the legality of collective bargaining for covered

employees. However, under such frameworks employers are not obligated to

bargain with employees. These policies are often stated as giving

employees some weak form of rights "to meet and confer with" or "to

present proposals to" their employers.

     The second law category is comprised of states which have a "duty-

to-bargain" provision (DTB). In moving from BP to DTB environments, the

choice to bargain or not shifts from the employer to the employees.

Employees may be more likely to try to organize where employers have an

affirmative obligation to bargain with representatives of the police than

where employers may still choose not to bargain.

     Still, a DTB provision does not necessarily ensure closure to the

bargaining process. In the private sector, the strike threat forces

negotiators to evaluate impasses and ultimately moves the parties to some

resolution of differences in their positions. However, since police

strikes are illegal, one can imagine an employer in a DTB environment
                                                                           6




"bargaining't but not conceding to any union demands since the threat of a

strike may be significantly dampened. By 1978, fourteen states had

enacted some form of compulsory interest arbitration statutes for police

negotiations. These environments form the fourth law category (ARB).

Under such a statute, police labor organizations need not rely on the

final consent of the public employer to determine the terms and condi-

tions of their employment, but rather a neutral third party has power to

arbitrate contract terms. If employees perceive that this shift in final

decision making authority enhances the opportunity for securing greater

wage gains, employees would have an additional stimulus for forming an

employee organization. What limited empirical evidence there is on the
                                                                          10
impact of arbitration on salaries provides some support for this claim.

In any case, as long as employees perceive the potential for such an

impact of arbitration, this could be enough to stimulate union growth.

     These categories are not separated by well-defined boundaries.

Certain states, for example Maine, provide a degree of binding arbitra-

tion, but the arbitrator's decision is only advisory with respect to

salaries and wages.11 Since the hypothesized relationship between the

ARB variable and unionization is based on expectations about increased

salary growth under arbitration, statutes like Maine's are kept in the

DTB without arbitration category.

     Furthermore, these categories do not capture differences in state

laws regarding strike penalties. The New York statute penalizes striking

public employees two-for-one in pay (the loss of a day's pay for not

working and an additional penalty of a day's pay for striking

illegally).12 Wisconsin, in contrast, fines an employee ten dollars per

day.13 Variables describing these statutory penalties would be important
                                                                            7




controls in unionization equations if the penalties not only reduce the

likelihood of a strike, but also the impact of a strike on recognition

once it has begun. However, these strike penalties are not consistently

enforced and therefore inaccurate measures of the actual penalties. In

retrospective telephone Interviews with representatives from the 52

police departments that had recognition strikes (RECOGB =      1),   none

reported any monetary or jail-term penalties being levied against strik-

ing police. Still, if the threat of these penalties helps to end recog-

nition strikes before recognition is obtained, these controls would be

important.
                    .

                  Still, the four categories of laws that will be included in

the unionization equations have been shown to be critical determinants of

police unionization, and are therefore important control variables in the

union probability equation.

Other Controls

     Besides the categorical law variables, several additional control

variables are included in the unionization equation that might influence

police unionization. Here, state-level variables include four geographic

region dummy variables (Northeast, North Central, South, and West), the

percentage of a state's non-agricultural work force who are public

employees, and the percentage of a state's private sector nonagricultural

work force that is unionized. The region controls and the percent union

variable will indicate how favorable the climate is toward unionization.

If patterns in the locus of public sector unionization parallel those in

the private sector, one would expect lower rates of unionization among

southern municipalities. The percent union variable is expected to

increase unionization rates. High levels of private sector unionism

should correspond to higher area wages and may increase the expectations
                                                                           8




about a reasonable wage increase. If police in environments with higher

levels of private sector unionism do have such expectations, they may be

more likely to unionize in an effort to obtain higher wages. The rela-

tionship of the percentage of the state workforce in public employment to

police unionization is less clear. Where a greater proportion of a

statets workforce is in public employment, a greater degree of acceptance

of unionism may have been fostered. Conversely, the taxpaying public may

find it more important to be represented by public managers who will

oppose unionism (and keep labor costs down) where there are relatively

more public employees.

     Several municipal—level control variables are available for a large

proportion of the municipalities in the sample: population, per capita

income, per capita municipal revenue, central city dummy variable, and

three government-type dummy variables (Council-Nanager, Nayor-Council,

and Commission).15

     The population variable acknowledges the importance of unit size in

the unionization process, as larger municipalities will have larger

departments. In studies using data on representation elections in the

private sector, the most common finding is that unit size is negatively

related to union support in certification elections.16 The sign of the

correlation in this public sector sample may be different. The private

sector samples are generally certification elections from the 1970s or

early 1980s more than thirty years after the enactment the the National

Labor Relations Act (NLRA). In the early years of the NLRA, the first

private sector bargaining units to organize may have been relatively

large. Here, with a sample of police departments during the period from
                                                                                9




1972 to 1978, the study focuses on the process of unionization fairly

soon after any applicable state bargaining laws were enacted.

     Ability-to-pay variables (revenue and income) might indicate an

increase in the public employerts ability to satisfy the employees in

different municipal departments, including the police department, vying

for a share of the municipal budget. In this way, managers in wealthier

cities and towns might be better able to avoid unionization. Conversely,

the incentive to unionize may be greater where municipal revenues are

larger. A priori, the direction of the correlation between these

ability-to-pay measures is ambiguous.

     Central cities may be associated with relatively high area wages, a

greater degree of private sector unionization, and perhaps more hazardous

duties for its police. If these forces make police more likely to

consider unionization, this variable will cause an upward shift in the

union hazard function. Finally, the degree of bureaucratization of

different government structures might affect the responsiveness of an

employer to employee desires, so that certain government structures might

be more highly correlated with the probability of municipal unionism.

Estimating Equation

     To isolate the impact of the RECOGA or RECOGB variables on unioniza-

tion, a binary logistic equation is estimated:


                                 1
          Pr(UNION.it) =

                           1+e

where Pr(UNION.) is the probability that municipal department i

unionizes in period t and            represents a vector of control variables

that includes either RECOGA or RECOGB in addition to the other
                                                                          10




state-level and municipal-level characteristics described above. This

specification is used to overcome the difficulty that ordinary least

squares regression has in modeling the binary unionization outcome, as

OLS produces inefficient estimates and predictions, possibly outside the

0-1 range by forcing a normal structure on the error term.

     The success of recognition strikes in stimulating police unioniza-

tion is judged in two different ways that lead to analysis of samples

with different constructions. First, if unionization occurs after the

strike but in the same calendar year as the strike, the recognition

strike almost certainly played a critical role in the process of union-

ization. To test for the relationship between recognition strikes and

unionization within the same year, a panel consisting of nonunion munici-

pal police departments is created for each year from 1972 to 1978. The

1972 panel consists of 579 nonunion police departments. The number of

nonunion police departments decreases each year. For 1978, the panel

consists of 369 nonunion departments. Across the seven years, the sample

for this pooled cross-section sample consists of 3,246 department-years.

     It may be misleading to judge the success of the recognition strikes

in stimulating unionization by whether a nonunion police department

unionizes in the same calendar as its strike. A recognition strike may

not lead immediately to unionization, but contribute indirectly to

unionization in some later time period. Therefore, a single cross-

section sample is also analyzed. In this complementary analysis, there

is only one observation for each of the 579 municipalities that enter

1972 with a nonunion police department. RECOGA and RECOGB equal one if

those variables equal one in any of the years in the pooled analysis.
                                                                          11




The dependent UNION variable equals one if by 1978 the police had union-

ized. In this analysis, then, a strike will be considered to have played

a role in the unionization process, if the police organize in any year

after they went on strike.

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

     Before presenting the parameters estimated in the logit equation,

several statistics are presented to indicate the frequency of recognition

strikes (according to the RECOGA and RECOGB definitions). The RECOGA

frequencies are given in Table 1A by year and by type of law. Since the

number of nonunion municipalities may vary across the different legal

environments, strikes as a percentage of all nonunion municipalities in

the given law category are also given in parentheses. The frequencies

for all strikes by nonunion police departments (i.e., RECOGB   1) are

presented in Table lB. Of the 52 strikes by nonunion police departments

in the six years for which complete data are available, 22 were reported

as primarily being for recognition. Only 1 of these occurred in an

environment with a duty-to-bargain provision. According to the percent-

ages given in the last column, nonunion municipalities in BP or No Law

environments were somewhat more likely to experience a RECOGA or RECOGE

strike. (The denominator for these percentages in the last column is the

total number of nonunion municipalities in that law category in 1972).

In the analysis to follow, the unionization rate among these municipali-

ties with police strikes is compared to the rate of unionization among

other municipal police departments in the sample.

1972-1978 sample,17 the parameters presented in columns (1) and (2) of

Table 2 are obtained. When the "cross-sectiontt sample with only one

observation per municipality is considered, the column (3) and (4)

parameters are estimated.

     When RECOGA is used to define the presence of a recognition strike,

one observes that these strikes have no discernible impact on the process

of obtaining recognition. Interestingly, when any strike by a nonunion

police department is considered to be a recognition strike (i.e., RECOGB

  1), one observes in columns (2) and (4) that these nonunion police

departments are less likely to obtain union recognition. Clearly, the

difference between the RECOGA and RECOGB coefficients may well be attrib-

utable to a selectivity bias. Specifically, the additional municipali-

ties included as RECOGB strikes that are not a part of the RECOGA group

are police departments that struck but that did not report recognition to

be the principal issue. One would clearly expect that RECOGB strikes to

be less likely to have a positive correlation with subsequent unioniza-

tion than do RECOGA strikes. In light of the insignificant coefficients

on the RECOGA variable in columns (1) and (3), the negative coefficients

on RECOGB in columns (2) and (4) are not surprising.

     While a more thorough investigation of the other correlates of

police union growth over a longer time period are reported elsewhere in a

related study,18 the results obtained from these logistic equations for

the 1972 to 1978 period corroborate results in the previous studies.

Specifically, the bargaining law variables have the largest impact on

police unionization. The logistic coefficients from the column (1)

specification on the ARB, DTB, and BP variables are respectively: 6.136;

4.052; and 2.678. All are different from zero at the .01 level of

 significance. The difference between the ARB   and   DTB parameters is

 judged to be significant. This finding is different from that obtained

 in the study that investigates the impact of the laws on police union

 growth over a longer time period. The difference in the results may be

 attibutable to the larger sample and longer time period considered in the

previous study.19 Among other variables, one observes that Southern

municipalities are significantly less likely to unionize than those in

other regions, while Northeastern municipalities exhibit a significantly

higher rate of unionization than other municipalities. Additionally,

large, urban cities are much more likely to unionize during the 1972 to

1978 period as judged by the logit coefficients on the population and

central city control variables.

Recognition Strikes Within Different Law Categories

     It may be possible that interactive effects between recognition

strikes and other variables exist. A likely candidate for such interac-

tive effects with recognition strikes are the law variables. Specifical—

ly, when there are legal provisions guaranteeing police bargaining

rights, recognition strikes may be more likely to lead to unionization.

However, many cells in the expanded set of dummy variables have so few

observations that there is no variation along the dimension of the

dependent variable. For example, the only RECOGA strike in a DTB envi-

rormient resulted in unionization. Therefore, maximum likelihood logistic

equations do not converge. Still, simple unionization rates for munici-

palities with and without police recognition strikes within each law

category can be compared to gain some insight into this hypothesis.

     Table 3 presents the unionization rates among municipalities with

RECOGA strikes and the rates among those without such strikes within each
                                                                             17




law category. For municipalities in states without laws, only one of the

eight recognition strikes eventually led to recognition by 1978. Howev-

er, the overall rate of unionization among all other NO LAW municipali-

ties is even lower (11/198 =    .056).    RECOGA strikes, as described in

Table 1B, are virtually nonexistent in either DTB or in ARB environments,

underscoring the results of previous research which suggest that laws

that contain a duty-to-bargain provision reduce strike propensities

dramatically. In the BP law category, the rate of unionization between

1972 and 1978 is slightly lower among municipalities with RECOGA strikes

(i.e., 4/13 = .308) than among those without recognition strikes (64/169

=   .379).   None of the differences in the percentages in any category of

law is significant according to a t-test. The similarity in the union-

ization rates for municipalities with and without strikes across all law

categories presented in line 5 of Table 3 again reflects the insignifi-

cant coefficient on the RECOGA variable in Table 2.

IV. CONCLUSION

      This paper documents a greater propensity for municipalities without

bargaining laws (NO LAW = 1) and with weak bargaining laws (BP = 1) to

engage in recognition strikes than do cities in states with some duty-to-

bargain provision (DTB = 1 or ARB =      1).   Recognition strikes, resorted to

more often where bargaining laws are weak or nonexistent, do not increase

the probability that municipal police will obtain recognition from their

employers.

     Discussions with representatives from the fifty-two departments that

went on strike provide additional insights and suggestions for future

research. As mentioned in Section II, these discussions revealed that in

no case were fines or penalties levied against striking police. Further-

more, in only one case was there a report of police being replaced by

municipal managers. The legal sanctions against strikes and the ability

of managers to replace public employees who strike illegally represent

two key forces that influence the ability of public employees to achieve

their goals (here, to obtain recognition) by striking. Additional

research on the existence of different statutory penalties against

strikes, even if they are not used, would provide insights on whether the

threats of the penalties influence strike activity. In the context of

this study, if the threat of certain penalties reduces the duration of

strikes,20 the existence of penalties may make strikes less effective

weapons for employees. The replacement of public employees who go on

strike again raises the issue of how elastic the demand for labor is in

public sector occupations. While some estimates of the elasticity of

demand for public sector workers do exist,21 further research on the

ability of public sector managers to find alternative ways to provide

services in the short run would also yield greater understanding on the

potential consequence of public sector strikes.

     of this study, not illegal. In Wisconsin, where an interest arbi-

     municipal management and police agreed not to submit their dispute
     to arbitration. In occupations other than the protective services,
     strikes are somewhat less likely to be illegal. For the legal
     sanctions against teachers strikes, see Hirsch, Werner Z., "Anti-

14. The recent results reported in Hirsch (see footnote #4, supra)
     indicate that the existence of certain statutory penalties reduce
     the duration of teacher strikes. The analysis here is currently
     being extended to incorporate an additional set of variables on
     penalties against police strikes to see if the existence of these
     penalties influences the probability that a strike by nonunion
     police will lead to recognition.

17. Even though only the October 1974 through December 1974 can be
     identified with the exact municipality where the strike occurred, an
     entire panel for 1974 is included in the pooled cross-section
     sample, since aggregate data indicate that only three recognition
     strikes occurred during 1974. It is therefore assumed that, even if
     these three municipalities were in the data set, failure to identify
     these few cases would not alter the results appreciably. In fact,
     when the 1974 panel is deleted from the pooled cross-section analy-
     sis, estimated paramters are nearly identical to the ones obtained
     in Table 2, columns (1) and (2). For aggregate data on police
     strikes for 1974, see U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Depart-
