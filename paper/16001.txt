                                              ABSTRACT

Firms in Africa report "regulatory and economic policy uncertainty" as a top constraint to their growth.
We argue that often firms in Africa do not cope with policy rules, rather they face deals; firm-specific
policy actions that can be influenced by firm actions (e.g. bribes) and characteristics (e.g. political
connections). Using Enterprise Survey data we demonstrate huge variability in reported policy actions
across firms notionally facing the same policy. The within-country dispersion in firm-specific policy
actions is larger than the cross-national differences in average policy. We show that variability in
this policy implementation uncertainty within location-sector-size cells is correlated with firm growth
rates. These measures of implementation variability are more strongly related to lower firm employment
growth than are measures of "average" policy action. Finally, we show that the de jure measures such
as Doing Business indicators are virtually uncorrelated with ex-post firm-level responses, further evidence
that deals rather than rules prevail in Africa. Strikingly, the gap between de jure and de facto conditions
grows with the formal regulatory burden. The evidence also shows more burdensome processes open
up more space for making deals; firms may not incur the official costs of compliance, but they still
pay to avoid them. Finally, measures of institutional capacity and better governance are closely associated
with perceived consistency in implementation.

       Introduction

       The Investment Climate Enterprise Surveys have conducted detailed face-to-face

interviews of over 80,000 entrepreneurs in over 100 countries, including 11,150 in 34

Sub-Saharan countries. The issue firms most frequently identify as an obstacle to their

growth is “regulatory and economic policy uncertainty” (Smith and Hallward-Driemeier

2005). In Africa, 60 percent of surveyed firms regard “economic and regulatory policy

uncertainty” as an obstacle to their firms’ growth and almost 40 percent regard it as a

“severe” or “major” obstacle (figure 1). This finding creates a puzzle. The other

obstacles in the top 5 of Figure 1 are easy to understand: lack of electricity creates

obvious production problems, macro-economic instability has its obvious consequences,

firms everywhere and always complain about taxes, and “access to finance” as been

widely investigated as a limit to firm expansion. Moreover, these other obstacles--

infrastructure, macroeconomic instability, access to finance--are relatively easily linked

to related literatures on country aggregate growth and to programmatic activities. But

until we understand what “regulatory and policy uncertainty,” is, such that firms hate it

so, we cannot investigate its impacts at the aggregate level nor what could be done about

it.

         One view is that firms are concerned about a lack of political and policy making

stability which leads to frequent and unpredictable changes in the formal rules and de



1
  “Policy uncertainty” as one of the potential constraints was not included in the later surveys; it was
changed to “political uncertainty” which gets much lower ratings. This chart reflects the responses of 3317
firms in 13 countries. Data presented in the rest of the paper uses the full sample of firm responses in Sub-
Saharan Africa.

                                                                                                            2
jure policies2. We argue for a different interpretation of firms’ complaints. Firm

profitability is not directly affected by “policy” but rather by policy actions taken by

agents of the state in the course of policy implementation. In the weak organizational and

institutional environments for policy implementation which are common across Africa,

policy does not predict policy implementation actions at the firm level. Even when

policy is unchanging and even when there is macroeconomic stability, firms face massive

risk and uncertainty about their operations and profitability due to variability in policy

actions that result from the weak capability for implementation of regulatory and

economic policy.

         The evidence of variation in the implementation of policy is striking. We show

for a number of specific policy outcomes – getting an operating license, getting a

construction permit, clearing goods through customs – that the variation within country is

much greater than the variation across countries. Studies that focus on measures of

country averages are thus missing where most of the action is.

         This variation in implementation in turn is associated with greater activities on the

part of firms to influence the outcomes (e.g. paying bribes or spending time with

officials). Rather than coping with the application of (more or less favorable) rules, the

evidence indicates firms in Africa face deals. The policy actions actually taken are

influenced by actions (e.g. bribes) and characteristics (e.g. political connections) of the

firm. However deals do not assure a certain outcome. Deals themselves create ex ante or

ex post uncertainty to a differing extent depending on whether deals are ordered or



2
 Another view is that firms are complaining about the inter-temporal uncertainty and volatility in overall
economic conditions created by poor macroeconomic policy—but “macroeconomic instability” is a
separately identified obstacle.

                                                                                                             3
disordered, and whether these deals are open to all firms or deal-making opportunities are

closed (i.e. only open to firms with certain characteristics).

         The firm level evidence also shows why firms hate uncertainty. Variations in

policy outcomes are correlated with lower firm employment growth. In fact, it is the

variations themselves rather than the average level of policy outcome that is associated

with firm performance. We then use a “differences in differences” approach to show

policy implementation uncertainty has a greater relative effect on firms that are more

susceptible to policy uncertainty.

         Finally, we show that, in Africa, there is almost no connection between firm

reported policy actions and de jure policies (e.g. as measured by Doing Business) across

countries. Knowing the Doing Business measure, i.e. how long a procedure is formally

supposed to take, provides no power in explaining how long it will actually take a firm to

complete the procedure. Doing Business is not aiming to measure what actually happens,

but what is supposed to happen. That there is little relationship between the two is

further evidence of the role of deals in shaping the conditions firms actually face. And,

telling, the gap between the de jure and de facto measures grows with the burdens or

delays implied in the formal rules. The space for deals thus grows with the burden of the

regulatory requirements.

         This finding, however, raises questions about whether reforming the formal rules

will have much impact.3 If a rule is not being applied, changing it may have little impact.

But it could still reduce costs if the space for deals shrinks and firms need to incur lower


3
  The Doing Business project rightly points out that the regulatory requirements can be excessively
burdensome in some countries. Simplification of the regulations can remain a worthy goal – with added
benefits of reducing the institutional capacity needed for implementation and likely helping close some of
the opportunities for bribes.

                                                                                                             4
costs of avoiding the less burdensome formal requirements. Simplifying the rule could

even be associated with longer times reported by firms if compliance actually goes up in

the wake of reforms.4 In looking for impact, the role of institutional quality appears to

help predict the range of reported firm outcomes. Where institutional quality is higher,

rules are more likely to be implemented, and so changes in rules will more likely be

reflected in the conditions firms face. This insight helps reconcile the “institutions rule”

evidence on aggregate performance with the mixed success of “policy reform.”

         The paper is organized as follows. The second section elaborates on the

distinctions between policy, policy implementation and policy actions. The third section

then develops in greater detail the framework for thinking about policy uncertainty,

focusing on the gap between de jure rules and actual implementation, and the behaviors

firms engage in to shape the actions taken by agents of the state.

         The third and fourth sections of the paper look at the evidence provided by firm

surveys of 11,150 firms in 34 countries in Africa. It looks at the variation in policy

outcomes as reported by firms, and relates that variation to deal making activities and to

firm performance. Section four focuses on three specific regulatory areas: getting a

construction permit, getting an operating license and clearing customs. It shows the lack

of relationship between the de jure and de facto policies indicating the prevalence of

deals, and that this gap grows with the de jure delays and burdens of the regulations. It

also relates the findings to broader debates about institutional capacity and discusses

possible avenues for reducing implementation uncertainty.

 In additional work we are testing the impact using the time series data; here the results are based on cross-
sectional variation. (Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett 2010).

                                                                                                            5
    I)        Policy, Policy Implementation and Policy Actions

         The conceptual distinction can be illustrated with the example of a seemingly

simple policy, like an import tariff. With strong capability for implementation a firm’s

import tax payments actually collected (the policy action) are well-predicted by the firm’s

import value (a factual state of the world) and the tariff code (the rule or mapping

between states of the world (sales) and policy actions (tax to be collected)). In a study of

Kenya’s import tariff revenues Pritchett and Sethi (1994) compared the ad valorem

collected rate (ratio of revenue collected to declared import value) to the actual ad

valorem rate for the 3,392 separate items of the tariff code. There was surprisingly little

connection as items with the same official rate had very different collected rates5. For

instance, of the 435 items in the tariff code with an ad valorem tariff of 40 percent (which

recorded positive imports) the 25th percentile of the collected rate was zero, the mean was

20 percent and the 75th percentile was 24 percent. An item’s tariff rate had very little

predictive power for the tariff actually paid due to a large number of officially sanctioned

deviations due to exemptions for certain purposes, exemption of certain importers, etc.

which meant that even if two firms were importing exactly the same item they might pay

completely different rates.6

         A recent study of the acquisition of driver’s licenses in Delhi, India (Bertrand,


5
  While naively one might imagine a regression of ad valorem revenue on ad valorem rates might yield a
coefficient of 1 and an R-squared near one (e.g. items with a 20 percent rate would have 20 percent
collection rates and items with 30 percent would have a 30 percent collection rate (this is not about demand
elasticity as this is normalized by import value). Instead, across a variety of functional forms the official
rate could only explain about a fifth of the observed variation across items in the collected rate. Of course
this potentially vastly overstates the connection between the official tariff and tariff collected on the actual
import of specific items as it does not include smuggling or mis-declaration.
6
  If exceptions are formally recognized and there are enough of them, then the lack of correlation on the
non-exempted tariffs and actual revenue could be an example of the rules actually being applied. However,
the variations within narrow ranges of goods are too great. Rather, the existence of such exemptions
themselves indicates that deals were sought – and granted.

                                                                                                              6
Djankov, Hanna and Mullainathan 2007) also illustrates nicely the conceptual

distinctions between policy, policy implementation and a policy action. The policy in

Delhi stipulates the standard requirements for a driver’s license: proof of identity, age,

residence, and demonstrated competence in driving. The policy also stipulates the formal

procedures for implementation: the organization responsible for issuing driver’s licenses

and the criteria they are to use in assessing whether or not an individual meets the

requirements, e.g. the standards of proof for age, and the contents of the examination to

assess driving competence. Actual policy implementation was investigated by asking

people on their way into the building to get a driver’s license to cooperate in a study of

the process. The subjects were divided into a control group and two treatment groups

(one of which was given a bonus if they got their license faster and one of which was

given free driving lessons to improve their driving skills). The control group results are

interesting in their own right. First, most people in the control group hired a private agent

to handle the process for them. Second, only 12 percent of the control group who hired

an agent took the driver’s examination required by policy--but the policy action was that

they received a license anyway. In contrast, 94 percent of control group people who did

not hire an agent were required to take the driving exam and many were failed7. Clearly

in the process of policy implementation states of the world that mattered according to the

policy rule (knowing how to drive) did not matter in determining the policy action for

individuals while states of the world that did not matter in the policy rule (paying a tout)



         7
           At least in their first attempt, many then learned and hired an agent and got their license that
way. The study also documents that the public policy purpose of the driving examination was subverted
by the exemption from the exam. They hired a firm that teaches driving in Delhi to independently assess
the driving competence of those who received licenses and found that, of those in the control group that
hired an agent and got a license 69 percent were “automatic” failures in a driving test.

                                                                                                              7
did matter in determining the policy action8.

          In an idealized “rules” world policies are predictive of policy actions as the

implemented policy action is in each instance the result of the application of the policy

mapping between factual states of the world and the actions stipulated by the policy and

nothing else—the rules are the rules. In a “deals” environment policy actions are the

result of not just the policy rule but also potentially the lack of organizational capability

for enforcement, inadequate technical capacity of front-line implementers, self-interest of

the agents of the government at all levels (politicians and bureaucrats), as well as actions

and characteristics of firms. In a sufficiently weak environment everything is potentially

uncertain and/or negotiable. While negotiated firm specific deals have some positive

effects in freeing firms from the worst consequences of unreasonable rules, the nature of

the environment for deals can potentially create the types of policy implementation

uncertainty that inhibits transactions, investments, firm growth, and productivity.



    II)      The Varieties of “Policy Uncertainty”?

                                          Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.

                                                                                           Albert Einstein

          Firm outcomes, such as profitability, revenue growth, and hence firm choices are

affected by the actual and anticipated policy actions taken by agents of the state. Policy

actions are choices made by the agents responsible for policy implementation. We call

the way firms form their expectations of future policy actions a positive model of

implemented policy (PMIP). If firms have, and complain of, policy uncertainty this

8
  Another interesting finding of the study is that not all elements of the policy were equally subverted:
hiring a tout could easily get you out of taking the driving exam but not so easily get you out of having the
right documentation.

                                                                                                            8
implies that firms have, at least implicitly, probability distributions over future policy

actions. Economic agents make both business decisions (e.g. investments, product

choice, technique of production, number of workers to hire, who to contract with,

whether to comply with regulations) and policy implementation influence decisions (e.g.

how much to offer as a bribe, which politician to befriend, whether to register or remain

informal) based on their PMIP, which maps from states of the world to distributions of

policy actions, distributions which naturally both central tendencies and dispersions. We

are not going to impose much structure (e.g. rationality, optimality, completeness) on

firms’ PMIPs, rather we only use the concept to provide distinctions needed to

distinguish the relevant types of policy uncertainty, which we then attempt to illustrate

and disentangle empirically in section II and document the impacts of policy uncertainty

on one dimension of firm performance, job growth, in section III9.

         A notional policy mapping (NPM) is one element of a PMIP. We define this as

the officially declared mapping from specified contingent factual conditions about the

world to actions by an agent of the state10. With perfect enforcement “rules are the

rules” and hence the predicted policy action for any firm is a function only of the

administratively relevant state of the world. Under perfect enforcement (and perhaps

therefore full compliance as an equilibrium choice of firms)11 there is a natural conflation


9
  Pritchett (2005) has a much fuller discussion of the elements of positive models of implemented policy.
10
   A completely fixed action that is not contingent is just a special case in which the mapping is from all
states of the world into the same policy action (e.g. a k percent money growth).
11
   Given the PMIP each firm also makes compliance decisions. With additional assumptions about
probabilities of detection one can produce an equilibrium in which the optimizing calculation of all agents,
both agents of the state in implementation and economic agents, is compliance and firm voluntary truthful
disclosure and compliance is the equilibrium strategy. But even if the rules are not susceptible to influence
firms might try to avoid the rules, even with the expectation that if detected the rules (including penalties
for non-compliance) will be enforced. We often get parking tickets but never try and bribe the meter maid.
But, without explicit limitations on implementation capacity one can nearly always specify an enforcement
mechanism that induces compliance as an equilibrium strategy.

                                                                                                            9
of “policy” with the notional policy mapping in that it is assumed all firms have the same

PMIP and that each firms PMIP is the NPM, all firms share the positive prediction that

the NPM predicts policy actions conditional on states of the world independently of the

firm’s influence activities or characteristics. This assumption is common, such as the

seemingly innocuous expression of a firm’s net of sales tax revenue as their sales less

their sales times the sales tax rate:

         Revenuei = Salesi – * Salesi

This simple equation assumes that the actually tax rate paid is common across all firms

and that reported sales and actual sales are equal.

         “Rules are the rules” is not a terrible first approximation in many policy domains

for many firms in countries with strong implementation capability. Firms expect their

property tax to determined by the administratively declared valuation and the property tax

rate, their feasible land-use to be determined by zoning, their labor contracts (e.g.

minimum wage) to be determined by the labor law—and expect this with relatively little

variation12. Of course, even in strong implementation countries there is regulatory

capture (including “intellectual capture”) in some policy domains that influences

implementation for favored firms or industries13. Moreover, in many policy domains

even in countries with “good” implementation environments there is often substantial

uncertainty in determining the “state of the world” creating ample room for both

extended regulatory disputes, civil lawsuits, and scope for deals—there are after all

12
    Or at least expect variation of predictable types. I may think the probability of getting a speeding ticket
might be low, even if I drive above the limit, but have essentially zero expectation of getting a speeding
ticket if I am factually driving exactly the speed limit. So while there is “uncertainty” about enforcement it
is of a predictable type.
13
   Johnson (2009) argues both the financial crisis in the United States and the responses to that crisis are an
illustration of garden variety control of segment of elites over the policy process seen in many developing
countries.

                                                                                                            10
850,000 lawyers in the USA.

        In the idealized “rules are the rules” world, conditional on the NPM and the states

of the world, there is little policy action uncertainty from implementation. In this case

the major form of “policy uncertainty” would be inter-temporal uncertainty in the

notional policy mapping.

        In Sub-Saharan Africa the NPM or de jure rules are only one element of a firm’s

PMIP. We define a policy deal as firm specific policy implementation (in one or more

policy domains) that results in policy actions that differ from what would have happened

under perfect enforcement and/or full compliance.14 A deal might explicitly create

separate conditions for a firm or project—e.g. waiving compliance with certain

regulations, creating special definitions. Deals can be across policy domains for a

specific firm, such firms with politically powerful patrons who are then treated

differently in all regulations (e.g. with the tax collector, the safety regulation, land use,

labor, etc.). Deals might just allow the firm to do in a timely manner what is allowed

under the rules so the deal simply avoids a delay that might be longer than perfect

enforcement. Some policies essentially require deals, as when the policy is conditioned

on subjective or non-verifiable characteristics or intended to achieve policy goals for

which there is no consensus model (e.g. land use for which zoning waivers are available

for certain purposes, “high bandwidth” industrial policies to promote innovation).

Influencing deals may take the form of pure persuasion, meeting with government agents


14
   This is analogous to descriptions of transactions between private individuals. Completed transactions
between individuals that are routine and hence involve no specificity are not typically referred to as
“deals”—if I buy a dozen eggs from the grocery store it would be odd to say I completed a “deal” with the
grocery store of money for eggs. There is another entire literature about Africa how weak environments for
transactions (including the inability to rely on government for disinterested and objective third party
enforcement of private deals) lead greater portions of economic activities to be carried out as “deals”
involving specific characteristics rather than as routine arms-length transactions (e.g. Fafchamps 2004).

                                                                                                       11
to induce a favorable decision even without illicit consideration of any type. Deals can

also be the result of illicit collusion, paying direct bribes, donations, favors. Deals can be

large—between a firm and the president of the country or small between a person running

a tortilla stand on the side of the road and the local police officer/precinct or anywhere in

between. We also consider subterfuge as a type of deal, altering the policy action

through attempting to avoid the implementing agents, hide sales or assets, or remain

entirely unregulated through “informal” status, particularly if the agents are willing to

play along or avoid investigations. We intend the word “deal” as descriptive of the firm

level hyper-specific nature of the implemented policy actions and do not intend the

contrast with “rules” to necessarily have pejorative connotations (“getting a deal” or

“reaching a deal” are usually positive).

         In modeling, simple is good, but too simple is bad and “rules are the rules” is far

too simple understand why African firms say they hate “policy uncertainty.” Firms

operating in countries with weak implementation capability must have PMIPs (mappings

from states of the world to distributions of policy actions) that are more complex than

“rules are the rules” (or alternatively that the NPM is the PMIP) in three ways. First,

firms pursue actions to influence policy actions and hence their PMIP must provide a

mapping not just between factual states of the world and policy actions but also between

influence activities of the firm (e.g. lobbying, bribes, evasion, meeting with officials,

hiring facilitators) and policy actions, even conditional on the “facts”15. Second, policy

implementation may depend not just on the actions of the firms but also their

characteristics, so that a PMIP is, at least potentially, heterogeneous across firms, even in

15
   This is distinct from the usual discussion of the changes in behavior induced by the regulation, along the
lines of the tax aversion (avoiding taxed activities) versus tax evasion (avoiding tax on activities)
distinction.

                                                                                                           12
the same country and sector. Third, firms face a variety of regulations and hence have to

consider the connections across regulatory domains (e.g. becoming a legally recognized

firm may bring the attention of tax authorities, getting a bank loan may require land-use

registration) which may not share PMIPs.

        To discuss how deals translate into policy implementation uncertainty for firms

we need two further distinctions in the policy domain specific environment for deals.

The first is whether the deals environment is “ordered” or “disordered.”16 The second is

whether deals environment is “open” (available to all firms) or “closed” (deals are

available depending on firm characteristics and/or a limited number of deals are

available). The distinction between rules and deals and the distinctions among deal

environments (discussed more fully below) creates five possible categories: rules, open

ordered deals, closed ordered deals, open disordered deals, closed disordered deals.

These produce conceptually different sources of “regulatory and economic policy

uncertainty” and potentially distinct magnitudes of this as a concern to firms (Table 1).




16
  This is closely related to the distinction of Shleifer and Vishny (1993) between “organized” and
“disorganized” corruption.

       Keep in mind these types of deals environments are not characterizations of

“countries” but rather are firm specific and policy domain specific, interactively (some

firms may have favorable deals in one policy domain but not another). Kaufmann,


                                                                                           14
Mastruzzi, and Zavaleta (2003) in Bolivia show large differences in the implementation

capability across public sector organizations so firms in some policy domains may face

“rules are the rules” while in others face disordered deals. This extends to firm specificity

as well as firm may have a closed ordered deal in one domain (say, capture of their

industry’s regulatory body) but face open ordered deals in others, say land use,

disordered deals in another, say tax collection and face “rules are the rules” in yet

another, say environmental regulation. Firms, even in the same activity in the same

country do not face some common abstract “policy” or even “environment” rather they

form their own positive model specific to each policy domain.

         Open Ordered Deals. One possibility, as illustrated in the driver’s license

example above is a deviation from the formal rules (hiring a facilitator exempts one from

the driving exam) but one that is open to all comers and one with a predictable outcome

(hiring the facilitator does result in the license). In this case there may be very little

policy implementation uncertainty—the deals environment resulting from weak

organizational capability for policy implementation takes the form of thwarting the public

policy purpose of the regulation (ensuring competent drivers) but does not create

uncertainty. That is, while there might be variation (across regions or countries) in how

costly or onerous a barrier the deal constitutes to getting a driver’s license it need not

create much additional uncertainty. One might even argue that the “rules” versus “deals”

distinction does not hold as this is just a contrast of “formal rules” with “informal rules”

but we prefer the distinction between formal rules and deals when the policy deal is in

explicit violation of the formal rule and hence not legally enforceable in principle17.


17
  Some of the literature on “institutions as rules” takes a very broad view of a rule as a pattern of “beliefs
norms and practices” and hence view “rules” and implemented formally or informally. However, we

                                                                                                            15
         An important distinction for open ordered deals versus other types is often is

between deviations in two conceptually distinguishable steps of policy implementation: a

“findings” or determination step, in which the state of the world is administratively

established, and a policy action step, in which the agent of the state (of the designated

organization) takes an action. While conceptually distinct, these steps may be taken by

the same person simultaneously (e.g. health inspector inspects the premises and issues a

rating), but they may also done by different agents in the same organization (e.g. one

agent gives the driving exam and another issues the licenses), or undertaken by separate

organizations at distinct times (e.g. a policeman issues a citation, a court adjudicates the

claim and issues a fine). Table 2 gives examples from a variety of common functions of

the state: tax collection, regulation, and program implementation/service delivery just to

emphasize the conceptual distinction between findings and actions. This distinction is

important because many deals are not about violating the rules but rather about altering

the administratively declared state of the world—irrespective of the factual state of the

world--such that application of the rule produces the desired policy action. This tends to

produce more ordered deals: once legally granted, even if in violation of the procedures

for doing so, the determination is often difficult to revoke.




maintain there is an important difference between “informal institutions” that arise outside of formal rules
that may provide quite stable environments for deals between private actors (Greif 2006) and practices,
even common widespread practices, that are explicitly forbidden by formal rules between agents of the
state and private actors.

                                                                                                           16

   Closed Ordered Deals. The distinction with open ordered deals are deals that are

ordered—in that they are roughly predictable both ex ante and ex post—but which are




                                                                                           17
“closed” in that they are only available to some firms18. In a “closed ordered deals”

environment characteristics of the firm may alter the scope of deals available. There may

be implicit or explicit “regulatory forbearance” for firms owned by the government, or by

members of the President’s family, or firms owned by powerful families or business

groups or the military, or special deals for some international firms. Fisman (2001) has

shown for instance that the stock market value of firms owned by people related to the

Indonesian ruler Suharto were substantially higher than otherwise because of their

connections to Suharto19. In this case there is a different set of available deals for the

connected firms as the influence is done “wholesale” rather than “retail.” These firms get

deals that are closed in that the same deal may not be available to other firms. In fact, as

documented in Hellman, Jones and Kaufmann (2000) Seize the State to Seize the Day

dominant firms may use their influence over governments not only to improve the policy

actions they face but actively worsen the policy and policy actions their competitors face

(both formally and informally)20 Similarly, Slinko, Yakolev, and Zhuravaskaya (2005)

show that politically connected firms receive specific differential treatment that both

improves their performance and lowers the performance of other firms in the same region

that are not politically connected.

     This distinction implies that the “policy environment” varies across firms so that one

would expect policy action variability (even conditional on a state of the world) so that

18
   Although we had made this open/closed distinction prior to reading North, Wallis and Weingast (2009)
our distinction is obviously similar to their distinction between “open access” societies in which something
like the same set of rules applies to all actors versus what they term as “natural” states in which there are,
explicitly or implicitly, one set of rules for the “elite” and another for others.
19
   A month or so after Suharto was replaced by Megawati a businessman saw Megawati’s husband in a
restaurant with prominent private sector figures. He said to his lunch companion “I didn’t know
Megawati’s husband was a business man.” The response: “He is now.”
20
   Again, a process not at all exclusive to developing countries as “raising rival’s costs” through regulatory
actions that favor incumbent firms (such as imposing the adoption of techniques or standards costly to
entrants or licensing procedures) is an integral part of regulatory capture.

                                                                                                           18
the goods of connected firms may clear customs faster, their licenses approved more

rapidly, their taxes audited less often, etc. This creates differential policy action

uncertainty across different firms as the non-connected firms may face an “open

disordered” deals environment, which is not a notion of “dualism” not necessarily

between “informal” and “formal” firms but between “favored formal” firms and all

others, including non-favored firms in the formal sector21.

     Disordered Open Deals. Not all “open” deals environments are “ordered” in that the

mapping between the influence actions of firms and the policy action outcome are known

with reasonable precision up front and the policy action taken ex post of the firm’s

influence actions will stay done. As Shleifer and Vishny (1993) argue, the distinction

between “organized” and “unorganized” corruption can make a difference in its impact.

In a disordered deals environment firms feel the need to use deals but still have large

residual inter-temporal uncertainty about future policy actions. Bribing an official today

may not mean I don’t face a different official tomorrow. Or, across policy domains,

bribing an official to get a land-use permit may not help getting an operating license or

protect me from police extortion or a rapacious tax collector.

     Disordered Closed Deals. A “closed” deal environment also may be uncertain, in

two dimensions. First, it is inter-temporally uncertain if the underlying power that

structures the “order” in the deals is itself inter-temporally uncertain. So, it may well be

the only way to do business is to have the President’s brother-in-law as a partner but that

same connection may prove to be a negative when that President is replaced by another.


21
  De Soto’s Mystery of Capital describes this as those firms inside a bubble in which they could count on
their property rights being protected by the formal apparatus of government and those that cannot. This
should not be elided with the notion of access to the “rule of law” or not as the protection of property rights
inside the bubble need not be the operation of the “rule of law” open to all but rather a different order.

                                                                                                            19
This isn’t to conflate the order with a particular political administration, this varies

widely as some closed power structures may persist across political administrations

(when “elites” have a common interest) while others may not. This distinction has been

made in various ways, identifying regimes that are “patrimonial” or the focus on the lack

of constraints on the executive, which combined with inter-temporal uncertainty about

regime duration, can create substantial firm level uncertainty, even for those firms inside

“closed” deals.



   III)    How to interpret firms’ aversion to “Policy Uncertainty”

                                                            Rules? In a knife fight? No rules.

                                                        Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid

   The Enterprise Surveys implemented by the World Bank contains both subjective

assessments by firms about the obstacles to their growth, but also quantitative

information about how long it takes to get various things done and how much they cost –

including actions to influence policy implementation, like bribes or gifts or meeting with

government officials. Using these data we show six overlapping pieces of evidence that

firms complaints of “policy uncertainty” are mainly about policy implementation

uncertainty.

       First, to show uncertainty we start by showing firm level variability. The

Enterprise Surveys have been used to document differences in the investment climate

across countries or regions within countries (Dollar, Hallward-Driemeier, and Mengistae

2005) by looking at the averages or central tendency across firms and, at times, the

differences in averages across types of firms, such as small versus large. Here we focus

                                                                                           20
directly on the variability of the firms’ response to the same questions in the same

country about how long accomplishing various regulatory tasks take to show that there is

indeed enormous variability, which we will then show is related to policy implementation

uncertainty. Figure 2 shows the 90th, 50th and 10th percentiles for the most recent

Enterprise Survey data for each Africa country for all countries with more than 30 firm

respondents for each question. Figure 2a shows the distribution of the number of days to

get an operating license and Figure 2b the number of days for imports to clear customs.

   What is striking is that the variation across firms within a country is, in many

instances, enormously larger than the differences across countries. Of the 24 countries

the country with the lowest median time is Rwanda, at just 1 day and many others report

low median times—the median in Ghana is only 4 days. The slowest are Zambia and

South Africa at 21 days. Clearly the “typical” firm gets a license much faster in Rwanda

or Ghana than Zambia or South Africa. However, 25 percent of firms in Zambia or South

Africa report they get their license in 7 days or less while 25 percent of firms in Ghana

report it took them 14 days or longer. Taking the 90th-10th or 75th-25th percentile spread

as a measure of dispersion across firms shows that in all but one country (Rwanda) the

90th-10th spread is as large as or larger than the maximum range (21 days) across

countries. The median 90th-10th spread in these countries is 46 days and the median 75th-

25th spread is 21 days. The implication is that firms that get licenses quickly get them

almost instantaneously while firms that get them slowly get them very slowly. The same

is true of spreads across firms of the time reported to get goods through customs. The




                                                                                            21
median 90th-10th spread across countries is 14 days, so that firms in the 20th percentile

report 1 to 2 days while firms in the 90th percentile typically report two weeks or more22.

22
  Obtaining construction permits is reported by fewer firms so only 12 countries had more than 30 firms

compared the maximum cross country range of 68 days.

    Of course this reported variability is potentially the result of many sources of

heterogeneity and hence represents different types of firm uncertainty. One is the

possibility of measurement error in the firms’ responses. Another is that not all firms are

in the same sectors and there may be true “rules are the rules” variability if the rules

require different times for implementation (one would expect a construction permit to

take longer for a nuclear plant than a restaurant). But there are also other sources of firm

level variation from deals. Some of this firm level variability could reflect differences in

treatment of favored and disfavored firms by their characteristics (e.g. ownership). As

these policy implementation realizations are conditional on firms chosen influence

activities, some of the firm level variability could reflect firm’s uncertainty about the

influence function and some got a good deal and some a bad deal. Alternatively, some of

the variability could reflect firms’ differential willingness to trade off influence activities

                                                                                             23
for delay. Finally, some variability could just reflect randomness in implementation,

even after firms’ influence activities.

   One piece of evidence that the variability is the result of unpredictable policy

implementation is that firms were asked if they believed that implementation of

government rules is “consistent and predictable.” Figure 3 shows the association

between the fraction of firms who believe implementation is “consistent and predictable.”

Across the countries, at least 40 percent of firms in Africa report that their positive

expectation (PMIP) of policy implementation is that it will have substantial

“unpredictable” uncertainty. Moreover, as can be seen in Figure 3 this is reasonably

associated with the 90th-10th percentile gap for days to get an operating license (Figure

3a) and days to clear customs (Figure 3b). For instance, in Mauritius where the intra-firm

variability is clearing customs only 8 days around two-thirds of firms believe rules are

predictable, whereas in Mozambique where the spread between the 25th and 75th

percentile is 28 days only 21 percent of firms agree that the implementation of the rules is

predictable.




                                                                                            24

     A second piece of evidence that the firm variability is not simply random but is

related to firms’ perceived policy implementation uncertainty is that there are often

differences across firms in whether or not the implementation of rules is “consistent and

predictable” consistent with differences in whether firms face ordered versus disordered

implementation and how open or closed it is to all firms. Table 4 shows that in Nigeria,

which all agree is a weak overall implementation environment, small firms are much

more likely to believe that the government is not “consistent and predictable” than are

large firms (64 percent versus 39 percent). In Ghana, although firms are much more

likely in general to believe implementation is consistent and predictable, capital intensive

firms are much more likely to think implementation is consistent and predictable than

labor intensive firms (24 versus 39 percent). In the average of all firms in the Africa

sample it is the case that small firms are less likely to believe implementation is

consistent and predictable than large firms (54 versus 46 percent). While all evidence is

subject to multiple interpretations, these results are consistent with differences in the

policy implementation even when firms facing the same de jure policy.23 In an

environment of closed deals, firms would be more likely become large or capital

intensive if they have preferential access to deals to accommodate the uncertainty of

policy implementation, hence for those firms implementation is consistent and

predictable.




23
  It is true that in some countries the de jure rules may vary by size. For example, large firms may need to
provide financial statements in calculating tax payments, while small firms may be assessed a ‘presumptive
tax’. This of course leaves more room for arbitrariness – and something over which to make a deal.

                                                                                                         26

   A third piece of evidence that policy implementation is uncertain is that firms engage

in actions aimed at influencing policy implementation, including actions, such as paying

bribes, that are not a part of the de jure policy implementation or the notional policy

mapping. The extent of policy influence activity firms report varies across countries and

across firms within a country. Table 4 shows the fraction of management time spent with

government officials, the fraction of firms who report paying bribes and the proportion of

revenue paid as bribes for those who do pay bribes. Obviously if the rules were followed

irrespective of whether a bribe was paid the fraction paying bribes would be small, but in

half of the countries half of the firms report paying bribes. The fraction reporting paying

bribes varies from ubiquitous, over 80 percent, in Burkina Faso, DRC, Guinea to 20

percent or less in Rwanda and South Africa.

     Table 5 examines the variation across firms of the types of actions that could be

undertaken to influence policy implementation outcomes by examining the correlates of

(admitting to) deal making, measured as ‘bribes paid to ‘get things done’’. To investigate

if bribe paying is associated with policy implementation uncertainty we need a measure

of the policy uncertainty a firm faces. We proxy this by using the both the observed

levels and variability of similarly situated firms. We do this by forming summary

statistics of the level and variability of observations in the same “cell” (country, city,

sector, size) as any given firm.24 For instance, firms are asked what percent of

management time is spent with government officials. We can calculate not only how

much time firm i spent with government officials, but also the average of all other firms

in the same cell as firm i and the standard deviation of those firms. This captures the

differences across firms. We do the same thing for whether firms consider policy

implementation is “consistent and predictable”; how much firms disagree with the extent

of consistency and predictability there is in policy implementation might actually be a

good proxy for implementation uncertainty overall.

     Table 5 shows that including the cell standard deviations, the average levels of

management time and consistency are not significant except in the case of the size of

bribes paid. While these associations are obviously subject to a variety of interpretations,

it is striking that whether a firm pays a bribe is associated with how much disagreement

there is among firms in the firm’s same location, sector, and size about whether

regulations are “consistent and predictable.” Similarly, paying a bribe is not associated

  We exclude cells without at least 6 or more responses. We also ran robustness checks only using cells
with 30 or more responses and the results were similar.

                                                                                                          29
with the average time similar firms spend with officials but with the differences across

firms in the same cell in the amount of time spent.25




25
   Variation in the “cell” of firms in the assessment of consistency does not necessarily imply ex ante
uncertainty; some firms, for instance, the politically well connected, could know in advance the differential
treatment they would receive. The point is that deals involving bribes appear more likely not just when
firms think there is less consistency but where there is a difference across firms with respect to the extent of
consistency, i.e. when some firms report consistency and some do not, which means firms are uncertain and
this condition appears to be more favorable to try to influence policy actions via firm specific deals.

    One difficulty in parsing the evidence about why firms reporting disliking “policy

uncertainty” is disentangling whether it is the fact of deviation per se or whether it is the

uncertainty created by “disordered” deals or whether firms are expressing resentment at

the uneven access to deals. An interesting finding comes from several of the surveys,

which asked a question meant to elicit whether the practice of bribery, if it was regular

and predictable, in and of itself constituted an obstacle to business. The firms were given

the following vignette:

    Musyoka needs to renew a small business license from a local government office each
    year. Bribes are welcomed. Musyoka usually includes an additional bribe with his
    applications. When Musyoka had not included bribes, his application was sometimes
    lost or there were long delays such that the firm had to re-file.

Firms were then asked “Does corruption represent an obstacle to the operation and

growth for Musyoka's business?”

a) In Nigeria, the question was posed after a series of questions asking about corruption, while in the
other 3 countries it was part of extension module looking at issues of gender and the prior experience of
the entrepreneur.




    Consistently more than half of firms in the three countries in which this was asked in

a specialized module about entrepreneur experience regarded this as either no or a minor

obstacle to business (Nigeria’s results are quite different but this may be the result of

“priming” as it was asked in a module about corruption and hence following a larger

                                                                                                            32
          number of questions about corruption). This suggests that firms are distinguishing

          between “having to pay bribes” per se which in an open ordered deal environment creates

          a predictable “tax” and policy uncertainty.

               Another piece of evidence supports this conclusion. Firms in Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya,

          Nigeria and Senegal survey responded to whether ‘policy uncertainty’ was related to

          concerns about how existing laws and regulations would be applied to them as opposed to

          intertemporal changes in the laws themselves. Just over 60 percent agreed it was a

          moderate to severe constraint (similar to the rate given in figure 1). But even more

          tellingly, firms who report “knowing a bribe will get something done” is not a constraint,

          were less likely to see uncertainty in implementation as a constraint.

          IV. Impact of Deals

                    As a final step, we turn to examine the impact of uncertainty and the extent of

          deals on firm behavior. We look at firm employment decisions and employment growth

          over a three year time period. The focus is not whether or not a particular firm benefits

          from participating in a deal, but rather the effect of the ‘deals environment’ on firm




                                                                                                             33
growth.26 Does the prevalence of deals affect firm growth? Does the orderliness of such

deals affect firm growth? This is a new question as while many studies have examined

the impacts of various dimensions of the policy environment on firm performance they

have focused on the average not the uncertainty. A very recent exception is Sequira and

Djankov (2010) who, in a detailed study of ports in Southern Africa find that firms will

ship to a much more distant port in order to avoid corruption. Their estimates suggest

that firms will incur additional shipping costs that are eight times the average bribe paid,

suggesting a very large willingness to pay to avoid the uncertainty induced by (coercive)

bribes.

          To measure the ‘deals environment’, we again use the location-sector-size cells of

the firms. The regressions include both a measure of the average level of the deals

indicator and the standard deviation of that indicator within the cell. To the extent there

is greater variability within the cell, this is an indication of the disorderliness of the deals

– not everyone is able to get the same deal on the same terms. This variation could also

be an indicator of uncertainty about whether the deal struck will in fact be honored. If

uncertainty is the underlying concern, we would expect the results on the variation

measures to be particularly strong.

          The dataset includes information on employment at the time of the survey and

three years prior to the survey. In calculating employment growth, we follow

Haltiwanger’s (2009) approach of using the difference divided by the average. This gives



26
   Firm level regressions would also raise concerns about possibility endogeneity – whether expanding
firms attract the attention of officials and become targets for officials seeking additional payments. Using
location-sector-size averages has been used as a technique to address this concern (Dollar et al 2006,
Aterido et al. forthcoming). Here, our interest is different, how the averages and extent of variation
themselves affect firms’ decisions.

                                                                                                           34
a value that is between plus and minus two and minimizes the role of large outliers that

can be present, particularly for smaller firms.

         Again, a number of firm characteristics are controlled for, including the average

size of the firm over the time period, the age of the firm, its ownership (foreign-domestic,

state-private), its sector, and location within the country. The average size of the firm is

used rather than the initial size to minimize the effects of transitory changes in

employment (Haltiwanger 2009). Country dummies are included to absorb country

characteristics, so the variation is between firms within a country.

         Another question regards the appropriate size to use in constructing these

averages. Most of the questions were made in reference to conditions at the time of the

survey, for which current size might be appropriate. However, if firms’ size has varied,

the responses may better be reflections of the experience of firms like what they had been

over a longer period. We opted for using average size. This has the added advantage that

it is not necessary to rematch firms to the measured location-sector-size indicators, which

would be necessary if firms changed size categories such their responses on deals

indicators would be used for, say, large firms, but the conditions they faced at the outset

were those of small firms.27

         Our two principle measures of ‘deals’ are used: overall management time with

officials and the size of bribe payments made to ‘get things done.’ Standard errors are

then clustered by cell.


27
  An alternative would be to exclude size as one of the dimensions in constructing cells; the results are
very similar although the significance levels are somewhat lower.

                                                                                                            35

       The first result is that spending time with officials is indeed associated with better

firm outcomes. In areas where firms are able to make deals, growth is higher. To the


                                                                                           36
extent the time represents efforts to make deals with officials, on average, it appears to be

worth the effort. However, the inclusion of the standard deviation is also significant –

and negative. While securing a deal may be advantageous, to the extent there is

uncertainty regarding what is required to secure the deal, the benefits are reduced.

         The average size of the bribe is not associated with higher growth. However, the

standard deviation of bribes paid is. Greater variation in the size of bribes paid in a

location-sector-size cell is associated with lower employment growth. Again, this would

be consistent with greater uncertainty about whether the deal, once struck, will actually

stick.

         As a second approach to examine the issue of variability in deal making, we use a

difference-in-difference methodology. The approach tests whether the degree of

openness and orderliness of the system of deals matters, whether deals can be had by

anyone willing to pay, or whether the system is largely closed to all but those with the

right (political) connections. If the system is relatively open, the average level of bribe

may be high or low, but there should be relatively little variation in the size of bribes paid

or in the time managers spend with officials. However, if the system is less open, the

variation in bribes paid or the time spent with officials working out deals or seeking

compliance with regulations will likely be higher. If only some firms are benefitting

from the deals, the greater variation in bribes and/or management time should be

associated with relatively larger gaps in opportunities between the two groups.

         As a first step we need to construct a measure of the extent to which sectors vary

in the degree to which they interact with officials. For firms in sectors that have a higher

underlying rate of interaction, the relative openness of making deals is likely to matter



                                                                                              37
more. To construct a measure of a sector’s intensity of interactions with officials, we use

the time spent in inspections, using Germany as the benchmark. Of all the countries that

have conducted an ES, it is the one whose measures of rule of law, control of corruption

and government effectiveness are strongest. To measure the orderliness of deals in a

location, we use two measures: the variation in the size of bribes paid and the variation in

the time managers spend with officials in that location.

       In determining firms that are more or less likely to have access to orderly deals,

information on connections to officials would be desirable, but unfortunately is not

available to us. Rather, we use two proxies: size and age. Larger firms and older firms

are more likely to have developed close relationships with officials and to benefit from

the existing system of deals than smaller firms or newer firms still trying to get

established. Several papers have found that smaller firms are more likely to be adversely

affected by red tape and corruption (Aterido et al. forthcoming; Beck et al.2005). It is not

that small firms or young firms don’t try to get a deal – it is that the terms of the deal and

the security of the deal are likely to be more uncertain.

       Thus the specification is the following:

              ,




where yls is the gap in growth rates between large and small firms in a given sector-

location cell. Thus the regressions are testing whether the gap between large and small

firms performance is relatively larger in those sectors that would have more interactions

with officials and where deals are less open (i.e. greater variability in the bribe payments

made and the time spent with officials.).


                                                                                            38
       As table 8 shows, the gap between large and small firms’ growth is relatively

higher in sectors with more interactions with officials and in locations where deals are

less orderly. This is particularly true when looking at firms by size. And the effects are

more significant for bribes paid than for management time spent with officials.

prevalent, particularly in sectors where more interactions with officials are needed

    Most of the self-reported obstacles to their own firms’ growth have both been

recognized in the macroeconomic literature as inhibitors of growth and have had clear

programmatic responses. While we cannot do full justice to the complex topics of how to

relate policy implementation uncertainty to economic growth and programmatic

responses, in this final section we hoped to at least point in some potentially promising

directions.

    V.A) Policy implementation uncertainty and growth

    The Hausmann, Rodrik, Velasco (2004) “growth diagnostics” framework starts

heuristically from the firm level first order condition for investment (marginal benefits

versus marginal costs) to develop a diagnostic tree to identify the contextually most

“binding” constraints. Figure 4 (Hausmann, Klinger, Wagner 2008) shows a simple

version of the growth diagnostic tree, in which the correspondence between a growth

framework and the firm’s complaints about obstacles to growth is easily seen: “high cost

of finance” to firms’ complaints of “access to finance”; “bad infrastructure” to firms

identification of “electricity” or “transport” or “telecoms”; “low human capital” to firms’

“skills availability” as a constraint). One major branch of the growth diagnostic is

“appropriability,” that, although investments would be productive, they would not be

reliably profitable to individual forms because of “low appropriability” from either

market failures (e.g. informational externalities, too little “self discovery” (Hausmann

                                                                                            40
and Rodrik (2002)) or coordination issues) or government failures. Government failures

can be macroeconomic risks, which are identified by firms as “macroeconomic

instability.” But government failures also play out in microeconomic risks, from either

government agents themselves or from other private agents with unreliable contracting.

Our interpretation is that firm complaints of “policy uncertainty” reflect concerns that

policy implementation uncertainty creates risks to the appropriability of the gains from

firm level investment or innovation28.

     We argue that a number of the firm reported obstacles in Figure 1 are related to

appropriability risks created by policy implementation uncertainty. In addition to

“economic and regulatory policy uncertainty” firms identify not just “policy” variables

like the tax rate but also tax administration. Firms commonly identify customs

clearance as an obstacle, which is arguably more an implementation than a policy issue.

Firms’ expressed concerns with “licenses” and “access to land” combine both the policy

(is it de jure difficult) but also the de facto concerns about implementation. We believe

the broader lens of policy implementation uncertainty also provides a lens into

complaints about corruption, both in that it can be disordered and it can create obstacles

to firms when corruption is “closed” and is used to close off market competition.




     28
       Bigsten and Soderbom (2005) review the research based on a first round of firm surveys in Africa
and concluded the uncertainty, paired with irreversibility, explains low investment in African firms not low
productivity.

       Figure 4: Growth diagnostic decision tree




    Source: Hausmann, Klinger, Wagner 2008.

    The focus on policy implementation uncertainty also draws a link between the

mainstream growth literature and firm level “policy uncertainty.” A substantial branch of

the growth literature argues that measures of “institutional quality” are related to

economic growth (e.g. Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson 2001). Even more strikingly,

several recent papers have argued that when “institutions” and measures of “policies”

(usually policy outcomes like budget deficits or inflation) are jointly included it is

institutions not measured “policies” that matter for long-run economic growth (Rodrik,

Subramanian and Trebbi 2004, Easterly and Levine 2003). As argued by Acemoglu,

Johnson, Robinson and Thaicharoen 2003 at the macroeconomic level this is because

macroeconomic symptoms like inflation are the result of institutional weaknesses, which

results in both poor policy and poor policy implementation. Our argument is the

microeconomic counterpart, low appropriability can inhibit growth and innovation not


                                                                                         42
necessarily as the result of bad policy (e.g. tax rates that are “too high”) but as the

combination of policy with weak implementation so that the implementation of complex

taxes results in substantial uncertainty.

     The policy implementation interpretation links firms’ concerns about policy

uncertainty and the suggestive evidence about the impact of uncertainty on firm

employment growth with the growth literature, both the standard growth regression

literature and the literature on episodic growth, generally (e.g. Hausmann, Pritchett,

Rodrik 2005) and its application to Africa (Abarcha and Page 2007, Patillo et al. 2005)29.

        V.B) Programmatic responses: de jure “Policy Reform”

     As raising economic growth rates in Africa has been a development priority for

decades, there have been clear responses, both programmatic and in overall reform

efforts, to the major growth obstacles identified in the macroeconomic and

microeconomic literature. Obviously addressing “macro instability”—reducing inflation,

macroeconomic imbalances, exchange rate crises, debt—has been a major agenda for

decades. “Access to finance” has been addressed through both big picture reforms of the

financial sector and through programmatic attention to micro-credit and SME financing.

Infrastructure and its shortages as obstacles to growth are also again attracting enormous

attention and investments. Our argument is that inadequate conceptualization of the

problem of policy implementation has hindered effective response to the problem of

policy uncertainty30. It is not at all obvious that the typical approach to “policy reform” of



29
   For instance, Abarcha and Page (2007) find that a variety of indicators of “institutional quality” (the
World Bank’s CPIA and all six components of the KKM indicators) are lower during growth decelerations.
30
   One reaction to the empirical finding of consistently high levels of firms complaining of “policy
uncertainty” is that the question was dropped from the standard Enterprise Survey instrument precisely
because it was difficult to interpret the results and translate them into programmatic action.

                                                                                                       43
modest, incremental, reductions to policy barriers without quite dramatic changes in

implementation can be effective in reducing policy uncertainty.

     The Doing Business project has attempted to identify obstacles to private sector

firms’ growth by examining the de jure regulatory environment that firms face. The

existence of (reasonably) common indicators in both the Doing Business (derived from an

examination of the regulations) and Enterprise Surveys (from firm responses) allows a

comparison of the de jure notional policy mappings and reported de facto policy

actions.31 Figure 5 shows the results for three indicators: time to get a construction

permit (5a), days to start a business (5b), and time to import goods (5c). While there is

not an exact correspondence of the respective concepts, there are nevertheless three

striking points from these figures. One, there is almost no increase in the average

enterprise survey reported days with respect to the Doing Business days. Clearly deals

are prevalent. Two, there is, as documented above, large firm specific variability in the

reported days but, even the reported delays de facto at the 95th percentile are far lower

31
   E.g. The Enterprise Surveys ask the “average time to clear goods through customs”, while Doing
Business covers all the steps from the paperwork to port-handling and customs to delivery of the imported
goods. The Enterprise Surveys ask “the number of days to get a construction permit”, while Doing
Business asks for all the days for all the procedures needed to comply with getting permission to construct
a warehouse. It is possible that some of the gap between the ES and DB is due to additional procedures
being covered in the DB than the ES. However, it is difficult to see how this could account for the lack of
correlation of the variation in ES and the DB indicators across countries. We tested for the sensitivity using
the time to import goods, subtracting off the time for inland transportation within the DB indicator. While
the distribution shifted slightly to the left, there was little change in overall pattern.
          Looking at the sub-indicators within each Doing Business indicator, there are some that are not
just based on the interpretation of regulations on the books, e.g. inland transportion withing ‘trading across
borders’. For these sub-indicators, the lawyer or accountant that is making the evaluation provides an
estimate, assuming that no intermediaries (legitimate or not) are used and no additional payments or bribes
are paid. The size of the gap between the two sources of data illustrates how costly it would be not to try to
strike a deal – and that assuming no deals are made does not reflect what in fact firms do given how far
below the 45 degree line most observations are.
          Another difference in methodology between the two datasets that should be kept in mind is that
DB has a precisely defined firm conducting the transaction, e.g. 50 employees, domestically owned private
company. The ES are a sample of firms – both larger and smaller than 50 employees. It is possible that
some of the variation within country in the ES is that the regulatory requirements themselves vary by firm
size. Only using firms close to the DB case could help improve the comparison, but the size of the samples
is reduced dramatically – but will little change in the basic patterns reported.

                                                                                                          44
than the de jure days (around which, in the naïve positive model of complete compliance,

one might expect to find the observations clustered).32 In Figure 5b on days to start a

business the top end (90th percentile) appears to be about 60 days—whether the de jure is

60, 100, 150, or over 200—as the DB days grow, the gap between DB and ES just grows

one for one; the space for deals rises with the DB indicators. Three, the explanatory

power of the reported Doing Business days for the realized policy action for a specific

firm is very near zero. That is, whether a firm is in a country where the time to get a

construction permit is 100 days or 500 days, there is almost no change in either the

“expected value” or actual time nor much reduction in the observed variation. But there is

evidence suggesting that the deals are more costly where the de jure rules are more

burdensome; firms cannot fully escape the costs of greater regulatory burdens.




32
  The graphs exclude ‘outside values’ or outliers (approximately 5% of the distribution.) In fact, not all
countries have such outliers, and for those that do, many of them are below their DB measure. However,
there are some firms whose reported experiences are greater than the Doing Business measures. Including
them extends the scale, making it hard to see the inter-quartile ranges. Versions of these figures are
available in the appendix with the outliers included.

                                                                                                        45

     Table 9 shows the regression counter-part of the graphs in Figure 5 by asking, how

much of a firms reported policy action is associated with the cross-national differences in

the de jure reported policies. The country average of “policy” has almost exactly no

explanatory power for the firm reported policy actions. Whether it took your firm a long

time or a short time to get a construction permit or operating license or have imports clear

customs has next to nothing to do with what the Doing Business survey reports about

your country. This is not just a low-powered “failure to reject” as the hypothesis that the

firm reported average increases one to one with the DB reported days can be decisively

rejected for each indicator.33

    This complete lack of association raises questions about both the efficacy and

political economy of the de jure “policy reform” approach to improving the investment

climate. What is the expected aggregate firm response (in investment, in innovation, in

output) to changes in the notional policy mapping about taxes, labor regulations, land use

regulation, licensing requirements, import procedures, etc.? All existing firms have

accommodated themselves to the existing environment and have made deals to do

business (whether they are favored or disfavored in the deals process and whether the

deal was expected to stay done or not). The question of the impact of de jure reform on

firm performance may be like asking how much faster submarines will go if the wind

blows harder: once you are under water (doing deals) changing the speed of the wind

might have little impact.

    On the other hand, there is evidence that while there appears to be little impact on the

times firms report, there could be effects on the costs of the deals they have to strike.

These relationships reported here are all in the cross-section, and a true test of the impact

of a reform requires time series or panel data. But they are still telling: as the Doing

Business indicator rises, both the average and the standard deviation of bribes paid rises

(see Table 10). Thus reforming may not impact the days needed to comply with the

regulation, but it could lower the cost of having to make a deal to avoid a less

burdensome rule.

      One example on which there was detailed study is revealing. A comparison of the de

jure processes of registering a new export business in Chile and Brazil revealed that the

regulations in Brazil were complex and time consuming compared to the simpler process

in Chile. This might have suggested reforming the rules in Brazil would lead to much

greater exports. However, a detailed study (Stone, Levy, and Paredes, 1991) of the de

facto processes of business registration in Brazil found that in practice businesses hired

facilitators who made registration no more complex or time-consuming in Brazil than in

Chile, and only moderately more expensive. The environment of open ordered deals—all

firms could hire facilitators, the facilitators made the process predictable with little ex

post uncertainty about the durability of the deal—actually replicated in many respects a

regime of favorable rules—but perhaps at the expense of the policy purpose of the

regulations.

      We are not proposing that the impact of notional policy mapping reform on firm

growth is zero, but it is far from obvious that modest (or even quite major) policy


                                                                                              50
reforms, independently of changes in policy implementation, would have any impact on

firm expectations of the policy actions that would result from implementation.34 The

impact would depend critically on the previous situation—if it were one of open ordered

deals this would have a very different impact than if the initial situation is disordered to

which the policy reform is able to bring order. Of course, radical policy reform could

drive the de jure regulation to zero or to the levels compatible with the existing

organizational capability for implementation (which may be close to zero (Pritchett

(2010)) and hence eliminate implementation uncertainty entirely (at least in that policy

domain) but this is very different story as this requires sacrificing whatever policy

purpose the regulation intended to accomplish.

     A naïve view of the political economy of reform is that there is a broad coalition

between agents interested in promoting economic growth: (economists, external

assistance groups, potential foreign investors) and the domestic “business community” to

improve the investment climate. However, in a deals environment this is far from

obvious. Worse, in a closed ordered deals environment the economically and political

powerful firms may have differentially favorable treatment in deals which gives them a

competitive advantage over other firms, an advantage that would disappear in a rules

environment. At least since Schumpeter’s Can Capitalism Survive? economists have

realized that successful capitalists were not reliable supporters of capitalism, not

34
  On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as further evidence of the importance of streamlining
and simplifying regulations. Excessive or burdensome requirements aren’t being complied with or
implemented consistently. Keeping them on the books only encourages deals and undermines the
credibility of the regulations and the public interest goals they are ‘supposed’ to be protecting. Changing
the formal rules may not result in much change in firm behavior if the earlier rules were not being
implemented, but if the reforms themselves are a signal that the implementation regime will also be
changing, then there could be effects. In further work we explore the relationship between the distribution
of policy action outcomes pre and post-reform episodes for a wider set of countries. Within Africa, there
are only a few examples of panel datasets that capture pre and post reform periods. Looking at the
Cameroon and Uganda, we find the dispersion actually increases post reform.

                                                                                                         51
particularly caring for the “destruction” half of creative destruction. Rajan and Zingales

(2003) for instance emphasize that incumbent firms often favor a weak financial sector,

unable to reallocate resources into new (potentially threatening) innovations. Hellman,

Jones, and Kaufmann (2000) argue that in the transition to “better” policies in the

transition countries the shift in the institutional environment create opportunities for

massive “closed” deals in which forces “seized the state” and then used it to favor their

economic interests in both policy implementation and policy formulation. And even

worse than these problems with favored firms, even among the disfavored firms there is

the problem of coalition formation to lobby to change a rule when in a deals environment

one can buy/lobby/influence policy implementation35.

     V.C) Reducing policy uncertainty

     Given the variation across firms in the reported predictability of implementation and

the associated spreads in actual policy outcomes across firms in the same location, it is

not surprising any given firm’s outcome is uncorrelated with measures of the formal

rules. Of interest is to know if the individual outcomes are correlated with other

dimensions of regulations, namely assessments of the ability to implement rules. Figures

6a and 6b show the correlation of the share of firms reporting implementation is

consistent and the standard deviation within the location-sector-size cells with measures

of Government Effectiveness and Control of Corruption (Worldwide Governance

Indicators, World Bank). If Government Effectiveness or Control of Corruption provides

     35
        Moving beyond this naïve political economy there may be reasons for external actors (e.g. donors,
foreign firms) to push for more favorable de jure rules rather than focus on policy implementation. Official
external agencies are more comfortable dealing with rules as focusing on implementation would have to
confront the massive deviation of de jure and de facto and its causes, which is a more awkward topic that
technically neutral “policy reform.” Foreign firms might prefer rules to deals if they have a competitive
disadvantage in local deals. Administrative simplification of large enough magnitude to make compliance
a feasible option might level the playing field for foreign firms.

                                                                                                         52
greater certainty, one would expect a positive association with the average level of

consistency reported and a negative association with the variation. Indeed, this is what

we find. So building institutional capacity may well be one way to address policy

uncertainty.

    While policy implementation uncertainty is related institutional performance and

government efficacy, these evolve slowly. Are there ways to shift expectations about

policy uncertainty in the short run? We wish to address two, definitive policy shifts

(often associated with clear political shifts) or the use of a selective reduction of policy

obstacles for favored firms.

    Decisive shift to a “pro-business” environment. As Shleifer and Vishny (1993) have

pointed out, it is not obvious that compliance with “rules” or a lack of corruption is either



                                                                                          55
a necessary or sufficient condition for rapid growth. Many of the world’s episodes of

extremely rapid growth have occurred in environments in which corruption was

pervasive and “closed ordered deals” was the basic structure of the formal economy (with

smaller firms exposed to mostly to a dual economy with “open ordered deals” as long as

their operations were not a threat). The economic successes of Indonesia from 1966 to

1997 or of South Korea in the 1960s (Haggard, Kim, and Moon, 1990)—among others--

were clearly not the result of an absence of corruption. The rapid growth of countries

today such as China, India (or even more strikingly the more modest but still impressive

growth of Bangladesh) can hardly be attributed to a lack of corruption. In fact, one could

argue that “closed ordered deals” environment in which the interests of certain large

industrial enterprises are well represented in policy making and policy implementation,

whether officially (as in the large industrial groups of Japan and Korea (Wade 1990,

Evans 1995)) or unofficially (with the preferred conglomerates in Indonesia) can lead to

more responsive government action on key dimensions, a de facto “high bandwidth”

policy making (Hausmann 2008).

    There are African examples of dramatic turn around in policy implementation

uncertainty. After the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, the country experienced a rapid

recovery to pre-conflict levels of investment (Figure 6), which is typical in post-conflict

countries. But in Rwanda another investment boom followed and capital formation is

now at roughly twice the pre-conflict level. Even more remarkable for a small,

landlocked nation in an unstable region it has also managed to attract significant foreign

direct investment. They did this not only by fighting corruption very aggressively,

which increased the credibility of government policy implementation, but also by



                                                                                          56
prioritizing specific deals. Rwanda’s success in sequencing its reforms was in part due to

a long-term vision of policy framework and development goals outlined by the

government. Rwanda Vision 2020 provides a policy framework to reform that allows for

consistency and reduces the inter-temporal policy risk faced by private investors.

    In the past 10 years, Rwanda has made significant progress in both simplifying the

rules and in enforcing them effectively, as can be seen in the cross-national tables above.

In Rwanda 90 percent of firms believe regulations are enforced “consistently and

predictably” (Figure 3), the level and variability of days to get an operating license are

among the lowest (Figure 2a and 2b), and in Rwanda, less than 5% of the firms identify

corruption as a constraint, according to the World Bank Enterprise Survey 2006,




                                                                                                                                                                          57
compared to 73% of firms in Kenya or 50% of firms in neighboring Tanzania and only 20

percent report paying bribes (fourth lowest).

     Rwanda prioritized enforceable policies, avoiding the common practice ignoring

enforcement capability and promulgating a long list of complex laws that are not reliably

enforced opening space for deals and uncertainty. Rwanda’s judicial system reform since

2001 is an example improving institutions while maintaining stability. The country

transitioned from its colonialist inherited civil law system to common law, in the process

both reducing the length of procedures (from 5 to 10 years down to only 2 to 3) 36 and

increase the reliability of the court system. In the 2006 Enterprise Survey data 67% of

firms believed their court system is fair, impartial, and uncorrupted (compared to only

16% in Mozambique or 22% in Kenya and 25% on average).

     Rwanda did more than improving the overall climate, the government also made

specific deals with mostly US-based multi-national companies and were able to rapidly

increase its exports significantly (mainly with the US). The increase in trade due to these

targeted agreements was bigger than multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the African

Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The most prominent deal was in Rwanda’s coffee

sector. Recognizing the importance of the coffee sector for its economy (especially

exports) as well as providing stable income for farmers, Rwanda conducted high-level

talks and negotiated special agreements with big importers of coffee from the United

States. These specific deals achieved a bigger result than a traditional bilateral country-

to-country trade agreement. On one hand, the government addressed the basic needs of

the coffee importers, such as security and reliability, and on the other hand, it helped

coffee growers meet quality standards for export. Rwanda’s highest-level government

leaders approached directly the heads of specific coffee-roasting companies in the US,

such as Starbucks, and CostCO. Rwanda has attracted unlikely investors such as Better

Place, a California-based start-up company that produces batteries for electric cars.

Given that Rwanda imports electricity itself, the presence of such companies is testament

to the country’s gain in credibility and improved business environment.

     Special initiatives to reduce policy uncertainty. The risk of country-wide approaches

to improving credibility is that they often hinge on the credibility of a specific regime or

individual, such as Kagame in Rwanda, and experience has shown that this credibility is

often very difficult to depersonalize and institutionalize (not to mention the political

ramifications). An alternative to either across the board de jure reform or across the

board agendas is to pursue the creation of reliable implementation incrementally. That is,

while the goal is to reduce policy uncertainty overall, one can start by focusing on

specific spaces, specific policy domains, or specific types of firms.

     For instance, the traditional approach to special economic zones was to create

enclaves strictly for production for export. However, the Chinese appear to have used

them on a much larger scale as a device to introduce different policy sets and

expectations about implementation that did not require taking on entrenched interests

immediately. The idea of “charter cities” (Romer 2009) is in some sense a natural, if

audacious, extension of this notion that policy implementation is important in creating an

environment capable of sustaining high productivity firms and dense economic

transactions but at the same time policy implementation is difficult to reform wholesale

in situ.



                                                                                           59
    An alternative approach is to focus on particular policy domains and attempt a

simultaneous reform of policy and policy implementation, something like an “island of

integrity” approach. One could begin with a policy domain that firms find particularly

egregious. However, if firms are caught up in multiple regulatory domains it may be that

the policy incremental approach will be limited. Certainly the litany of failures with the

introduction of special economic zones of various types suggests special zones are not

intrinsically special. Governments that lack the credibility to commit to good policy

implementation may also lack the credibility to commit to good policy implementation

even in a “special” zone.

    The final alternative is to identify firms engaged in prioritized activities and rather

than pursue traditional “industrial policy” instruments such as subsidies or credit or

privileged tax status make them the focus of implementation reform. In reality this is just

making the de facto situation of closed deals more ordered and hopefully creating some

degree of transparency and rationality to the selection of the firms/industries/sectors for

which policy implementation reform is a priority.

    VI. Conclusion

       Firms hate “regulatory and policy uncertainty.” We argue this is more than just

disliking “bad policy” and more than inter-temporal changes in the rules. We argue that

what firms dislike is that doing business in countries with weak capability for policy

implementation consists of a set of specific, potentially complex, inter-related, deals with

the various agencies of the state. As we document, this results in huge ex post variability

in policy actions that are not predicted by policy. Many firms face a closed environment,

in which deals are limited to firms with favored characteristics and/or a disordered



                                                                                              60
environment in which it is difficult to reliably predict policy action outcomes, even when

firms undertake influence activities. This conceptual shift to thinking about the firm

specificity for the space for deals—rather than an abstract country “environment” of

better or worse general rules—helps both in reconciling the micro-economic and macro-

economic literatures on institutions and policies, and, more importantly, in thinking

through innovative ways of addressing policy uncertainty, even with institutions that are

capable only of gradual change.
