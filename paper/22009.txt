                                              ABSTRACT

A large body of recent empirical work on inflation dynamics documents that current real variables
(like unemployment or output gaps) have little explanatory power for future inflation. Motivated by
these findings, I explore the properties of a wide class of models in which inflation expectations respond
little, if at all, to real economic conditions. In this general context, I examine Markov equilibria to
games in which the relevant forcing processes are Markov chains and the central bank chooses a short-
term nominal interest rate at each date subject to a lower bound. I construct a simple numerical algorithm
to solve for such Markov equilibria. I apply the algorithm to a numerical example. In the example,
the economy can experience long periods of what looks like secular stagnation because households
believe that there is a significant risk of a crisis (that is, a sharp decline in economic activity). Within
the example, there are large benefits to being able to reduce the lower bound on the short-term nominal
interest rate by as little as fifty basis points.

1         Introduction

Over the past twenty years, a large body of work has documented that in US data, real vari-
ables like unemployment and output “gaps” have little additional forecasting power for future
inflation relative to current and lagged values of inflation.1 Motivated by this line of research,
I analyze a class of economic models in which inflation expectations respond sluggishly, if
at all, to real economic outcomes. Within the models, a central bank chooses a short-term
nominal interest rate at each date subject to a zero lower bound. I model the various forcing
processes as Markov chains, and focus on Markov equilibria to the resultant dynamic game.
I provide an easily verifiable sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of such
equilibria. I construct a simple numerical algorithm, analogous to the linear algebra solution
methods in Mehra-Prescott (1985), that rapidly solves for the unique Markov equilibrium,
while taking full account of the zero lower bound.
        I apply the algorithm to a simple numerical example. In the example, in “normal” times,
households assign a low probability to a crisis (that is, a sharp downturn in real economic
outcomes consistent with target inflation). The crisis is (on average) short-lived, but is
followed by a sustained fear period. In the fear period, growth normalizes, but households
remain concerned about the risk of a return to the crisis state. The Markov equilibrium in
this example involves the central bank’s being constrained by the zero lower bound during the
crisis period and the fear period. The economy exhibits a pronounced shortfall in economic
activity during both periods (but not during the normal growth period, when households
view the risk of a crisis as small).
        The focus on Markov equilibria eliminates the use of so-called “Odyssean” forward guid-
ance (Justiniano, et. al., 2012). Within the numerical example, forward guidance of plausible
average durations (less than a decade) is ine↵ective. However, I document that relatively
small relaxations of the zero lower bound via negative nominal interest rates can enhance
economic efficiency in both the crisis and fear periods greatly.

   The class of models that I investigate is highly general. Equilibrium allocations must sat-
isfy two sets of restrictions (but may satisfy many others). The first set is a collection of Euler
equations that restricts the stochastic evolution of the cross-sectional average of the realized
marginal utility of consumption. The second is a collection of restrictions between expected
future inflation and the current gap between the (average) marginal utility of consumption
and its natural level. Both of these sets of restrictions are assumed to be structural, in the
sense that they are required to be invariant to the policy choices of the central bank.
   There are also three forcing processes that are invariant to the policy choices of the central
bank. The first is a stochastic trend in the natural level of the average marginal utility of
consumption. The evolution of this stochastic trend gives rise to variation in what is usually
termed the natural or neutral real rate of interest, even though households’ psychic discount
factors do not fluctuate.
   The second forcing process is a disturbance to the otherwise fixed relationship between
current real outcomes and inflation expectations. Loosely speaking, this process can be
viewed as a “Phillips curve” shifter. The third forcing process is a shock to ex-post inflation
realizations. All of these shocks are potentially correlated with one another. Hence, inflation
can be highly persistent and exhibit non-trivial conditional heteroskedasticity (so that the
inflation risk premium varies over time).
   My approach to modeling the evolution of inflation expectations is related to, but dis-
tinct from, that followed in the vast sticky price literature. The more standard approach is
grounded in the twin assumptions of Calvo pricing (or Rotemberg pricing or menu costs) and
rational expectations. The model of firm pricing decisions generates a connection between
real conditions and inflation outcomes. Rational expectations about those firm pricing de-
cisions then generates a connection between real conditions and inflation expectations. The
models that I study in this paper abstract from the specifics of firm pricing, and so are
considerably more agnostic about the source of the connection between real outcomes and
inflation expectations.

    Unlike Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) or Werning (2012), I do not limit attention to
the behavior of the economy after it hits the zero lower bound. However, these authors
are focusing on the benefits of commitment, which I ignore through my focus on Markov
equilibria. In its focus on Markov equilibria, my paper is related to the work of Adam and
Billi (2007) and Armenter (2015). It is also related to recent work by Hills, Nakata, and
Schmidt (2015) that explores how the zero lower bound has an adverse e↵ect on the economy
even when it is not binding. Michau (2015) examines the costs and benefits of various forms
of fiscal policy during long stays at the zero lower bound.



2     Model

In this section, I present a general class of models in which allocations are required to satisfy
at least two sets of restrictions. The first set of restrictions are a collection of aggregate Euler
equations. The second set of restrictions describes relationships between real outcomes and
inflation expectations.


2.1    Model Generalities

I consider a discrete-time infinite horizon economy in which all agents are infinitely-lived, have
a common utility discount factor , and have common beliefs. Suppose that any equilibrium
allocation in the economy satisfies the aggregate Euler equations:


                                                  1
                              mt = Rt Et {mt+1 ⇧t+1 }, t = 1, ..., 1                            (1)


where mt denotes the cross-person period t average of the marginal utility of consumption
associated with that allocation. (Equilibrium allocations might, of course, satisfy additional
restrictions.) In (1), Rt denotes the gross nominal interest rate in period t, ⇧t+1 is the
gross inflation rate from period t to period (t + 1), and Et represents the agents’ common
expectation of period (t + 1) random variables conditional on information available at date t.

                                                 4
These aggregate restrictions assume that agents do not face binding short-sales constraints
on their holdings of short-term assets.
   I model the evolution of inflation as follows:


                                   1
                                ⇧t+1 = ⇣(mt /mnat      1
                                              t ; ⌫t ) ⇠t+1 , t           1                      (2)


                       1
where {⌫t , mnat
             t , ⇠t+1 }t=1 are a triple of exogenous positive stochastic processes. I assume

that:
                                          Et ⇠t+1 = 1 for all t

This assumption implies that the agents’ (harmonic) one-period-ahead expectation of (gross)
inflation at date t is given by:


                                            1     1
                                     (Et ⇧t+1 )       = ⇣(mt /mnat
                                                               t ; ⌫t )                          (3)


The process ⌫ represents exogenous shocks to inflation expectations. The function ⇣ describes
the influence of current real conditions, as measured by equilibrium marginal utility mt
normalized by the exogenous natural marginal utility process mnat
                                                              t , on inflation expectations.

(By exogenous, I mean that the natural marginal utility process is invariant to decisions about
monetary policy by the central bank.) Going forward, I will refer to the stochastic process
b ⌘ m/mnat as being the equilibrium marginal utility gap. Along those lines, it is useful to
m
rewrite (2) as:
                                        1
                                     ⇧t+1     b t ; ⌫t ) 1 ⇠t+1 , t
                                          = ⇣(m                       1                          (4)

   It is helpful to substitute (4) into (1). To that end, I assume that there exists a function
 (.; ⌫) such that, for all ⌫,      is strictly increasing in its first argument and such that:


                          b m;
                         (m⇣( b ⌫); ⌫) = m                   b in [0, 1)
                                         b for all ⌫ and all m




                                                        5
       nat
Let    t+1   ⌘ mnat   nat
                t+1 /mt   denote the gross growth rate of natural marginal utility. Then, we can
use      and     to rewrite (1) as:


                                                                    nat
                                  bt =
                                  m                    b t+1 ⇠t+1
                                               (Rt Et (m            t+1 ); ⌫t )                             (5)


      This nonlinear di↵erence equation (5) will be the foundation of the remainder of the
paper. In order to simplify the analysis of the equation, I assume that                       is Lipschitz with
modulus B so that:


                    | (y; ⌫)     (y 0 ; ⌫)|  B|y       y 0 | for all (y, y 0 ) in R+
                                                                                    2
                                                                                      and all ⌫


Notice that if ⇣ is constant at ⇣ ⇤ , so that there is no connection between real outcomes and
inflation expectations, then          exists and is Lipschitz with modulus 1/⇣ ⇤ .2


2.2      Markov Models

In this subsection, I specialize the model by imposing a Markov chain structure on the various
forcing processes. I then define and characterize a Markov equilibrium for two distinct central
bank objectives within this model.


2.2.1     Markov Structure

Suppose that agents believe that st follows a Markov chain with transition matrix P and
state space S = {1, 2, .., J}. Agents all observe st at each date t. However, their observations
do not lead agents to change their beliefs that st evolves according to the Markov chain
defined by (P, S).
                                        nat
      I suppose that the shocks (⌫,           , ⇠) to inflation expectations, natural marginal utility, and
inflation realizations are all governed by the underlying Markov chain st . More specifically,
  2
    More generally, the strictly increasing function            exists and is Lipschitz with modulus B if
             0
inf⌫ infm      b ⌫)m
        b 0 ⇣ (m;  b + ⇣(m;
                         b ⌫) = 1/B.



                                                        6
I assume that there are sets:


                         V = {v̄j }Jj=1 ; ⇤ = { ¯ nat J            ¯ J
                                                  ij }i,j=1 ; ⌅ = {⇠ij }i,j=1




such that:
                                ⌫t = ⌫¯st ;    nat
                                               t     = ¯ nat             ¯
                                                         st 1 st ; ⇠ t = ⇠ st   1 st




The assumption that Et ⇠t+1 = 1 implies that:

                                       J
                                       X
                                               Pij ⇠¯ij = 1 for all i
                                        j=1


2.2.2   Games and Equilibrium

In this section, I consider two distinct policy games and study the unique Markov equilibrium
to each. The games share the following common structure. At each date, the central bank
chooses Rt , taking as given the Euler equation restrictions (5) described above and the
Markov chain law of motion for the exogenous variables. I will describe the central bank’s
objective in these games later. For now, it suffices to say that I focus on Markov equilibria,
                                  b t is a function only of st . The aggregate Euler equation
in which the marginal utility gap m
(5) can then be rewritten as a system of J nonlinear equations:

                                          J
                                          X
                         bi =
                         m         ( Ri         Pij ¯ nat ¯ b j ; ⌫¯i ), i = 1, ..., J
                                                      ij ⇠ij m                             (6)
                                          j=1



It will be useful to rewrite this system (6) of nonlinear equations as:


                                 bi =
                                 m                   b ⌫¯i ), i = 1, ..., J
                                              (Ri Qi m;                                    (7)


where the J ⇥ J matrix Q is defined by:


                                              Qij = Pij ¯ nat ¯
                                                          ij ⇠ij


                                                         7
The notation Qi refers to the ith row of the matrix Q.
    Note that in a Markov equilibrium, the (logged) equilibrium level of marginal utility is
                     b + ln(mnat )) of two processes. The first process is endogenous and
given by the sum (ln(m)
stationary. The second process is exogenous and non-stationary. Hence, logged equilibrium
marginal utility shares a common, exogenous, stochastic trend with logged natural marginal
utility.
    In the next two subsections, I describe two dynamic stochastic policy games, and their
Markov equilibria.


2.2.3      Game 1: Targeting A Desired Real Outcome

In Game 1, the central bank seeks to target a desired real outcome that is uniquely identified
with the marginal utility process mdes . I define m
                                                  b des = mdes /mnat to be the desired marginal
utility gap (more precisely, the level of marginal utility associated with the desired allocation,
                                                                              b des is governed by
relative to the natural level of marginal utility). I assume that the process m
the underlying Markov chain st , so that there exists a set M des = {m̄des J
                                                                                  b des
                                                                       j }j=1 and m t   = m̄des
                                                                                            st .

This assumption implies that the central bank’s desired level of marginal utility shares a
common, exogenous, stochastic trend with logged natural marginal utility. This assumption
is consistent with the central bank does not seek to o↵set permanent shocks to the level of
natural marginal utility as being desirable.
    Then, at date t, the central bank chooses the nominal interest rate Rt so as to minimize
a loss function      bt
                  1 (m    b des
                          m t ), where   1   has a global minimum when its argument is zero. It
faces the constraint that the gross nominal interest rate Rt is required to be no smaller than
one.
                                                               b ⇤i , Ri⇤ )Ji=1 such that:
    I define a Markov equilibrium of this game to be a vector (m


                  For all i = 1, ..., J, Ri⇤ 2 arg min    1(        b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i )

                                                                                    i )
                                                      R

                                                s.t. R    1


                                                  8
and:
                                  b ⇤i =
                                  m        (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                                   b ⇤ ) for all i = 1, ..., J

The main restriction in a Markov equilibrium is that, when choosing at date t, the central
bank treats the future evolution of marginal utility gaps as outside of its control.


2.2.4     Game 2: Targeting Expected Inflation

In the second game, the central bank’s loss function                2   is defined over the di↵erence between
the expected inflation rate and a target inflation rate ⇧⇤ . The loss function is at a global
minimum when its argument is zero. In this game, I define a Markov equilibrium to be a
        b ⇤i , Ri⇤ )Ji=1 such that:

3        Results

In this section, I prove three results about Markov equilibria in each of the two games. The
first result is that there is a unique equilibrium. The second result is that, in the unique
equilibrium, there is at least one state in which the zero lower bound does not bind. The
third result provides a condition such that the zero lower bound does in fact bind in a given
state.
    All three of these results will hinge on the following assumption. Recall that, in a Markov

equilibrium, we can write the aggregate Euler equation as:


                                 b ⇤i =
                                 m        (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                                  b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ) for all i = 1, ..., J


In order to prove the relevant results, we need an assumption that limits the dependence of
the current marginal utility gap on the future marginal utility gap vector. This assumption
takes the following form. Recall that the function                 is Lipschitz with modulus B. Let ||Q||
be the norm of Q associated with the Euclidean norm on RJ . (This matrix norm is equal to
the square root of the maximal eigenvalue of Q0 Q.) Then, I impose the following restriction
on B and Q.

Assumption 1. B||Q|| < 1

         This assumption is the foundation for all of the analysis that follows.3
         At the end of the section, I connect the characterizations of equilibria in the two games
to the notions of divine coincidence and the natural rate of interest often used in the New
Keynesian literature.


3.1         Results for Game 1

I begin by establishing uniqueness of Markov equilibrium in Game 1.

Proposition 1. Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied, and that the central bank’s loss function

 1                                                                        b ⇤ , R⇤ ) to game 1 in
     is strictly quasi-convex. Then there is a unique Markov equilibrium (m
which the central bank targets its desired allocation. The Markov equilibrium is characterized

    In Kocherlakota (2016), I examine finite-horizon versions of models with near-vertical Phillips curves. I
show that, given a lower bound on the nominal interest rate, these models exhibit a wide class of sunspot
equilibria. These sunspot equilibria feature extreme dependence of current outcomes on long-run outcomes
when the Phillips curve is close to vertical. Assumption 1 rules out the possibility that the Phillips curve is
near-vertical in the class of models under study in this paper.

                                             b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ), i = 1, ...J


Proof. I first show that any solution to the central bank’s decision problem when st = i
satisfies the two sets of restrictions. Because         1   is strictly quasi-convex, there is a unique
solution to the central bank’s decision problem for any st = i. There are two possibilities.
First, suppose:
                                             b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i )  m̄des
                                         (Qi m               i


Then, since       is strictly increasing, we know that the zero lower bound does not bind. As
                                                                   b ⇤i = 1. Alternatively,
a result, the central bank can achieve a global minimum by setting m

                                             b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ) > m̄des

Then, the zero lower bound binds, and the central bank’s solution is to set R = 1. Since             is
strictly increasing, it follows that the unique solution to the central bank’s decision problem
when st = i satisfies the system of nonlinear equations in the Proposition.

The proposition assumes that B||Q|| < 1. It follows that T is a contraction with respect to
the Euclidean norm, and we can conclude that there is a unique fixed point to T.

state in which the central bank is able to achieve its desired outcome.

This is a contradiction.

   Proposition 2 rules out the possibility that the economy is stuck forever at the zero lower
bound in a Markov equilibrium. This result stands in contrast with the findings of Benhabib,
Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2001). They study a class of models in which there is a steady-
state equilibrium in which the nominal interest rate is always zero. The di↵erence in results is
attributable to di↵erences in the treatments of inflation expectations. In Benhabib, Schmitt-
Grohe, and Uribe (2001), the zero lower bound binds in the long run because expected
inflation converges to a low level. In contrast, in this paper, Assumption 1 ensures that
expected inflation remains sufficiently high so that the zero lower bound can’t always bind.
   The next proposition provides a sufficient condition on exogenous parameters that ensures
that, in a Markov equilibrium, there is a state in which the central bank is at the zero lower
bound.

Then, in any Markov equilibrium (m

Proof. Since the loss function        1   is strictly quasi-convex, a Markov equilibrium is character-

These equations imply that if the assumption in the proposition is satisfied :


                b ⇤k = max(m̄des
                m                    b ⇤ ; ⌫¯k ))

and so Rk⇤ must equal one.

   As we shall see later, the converse to Proposition 3 may not be true.


3.2    Results about Game 2

In this section, I prove analogous results about Game 2, in which the central bank targets an
expected inflation rate of ⇧⇤ . The results are analogous because Game 2, is in some sense,
simply a special case of Game 1 in which the central bank’s desired marginal utility process
is given by ⇣   1
                    (⇧⇤ ; ⌫).
   I begin by establishing existence and uniqueness of Markov equilibrium.

Proposition 4. Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied, that the loss function                   2   is quasi-convex,
and the function ⇣ (that maps marginal utility into expected inflation) is strictly increasing or
strictly decreasing with respect to marginal utility. Then there is a unique Markov equilibrium
 b ⇤ , R⇤ ) to Game 2. The Markov equilibrium is the unique solution to the system of nonlinear
(m

                        b ⇤i =
                        m          (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                           b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i )


Proof. The function ⇣ can be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing in its first argument.
Suppose first that ⇣ is strictly decreasing. Then, since                     2   is strictly quasi-convex, the function

 2 (⇣(m; ⌫
         ¯i )    ⇧⇤ ) is strictly quasi-convex as a function of m. It follows that at any date t,
the central bank’s decision problem has a unique solution. There are two possibilities. The
first is that:
                                              b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ); ⌫¯i )
                                       ⇣( (Qi m                              ⇧⇤

Then, since      is strictly increasing and ⇣ is strictly decreasing, we know that the zero lower
bound does not bind and the central bank can achieve a global minimum by setting Ri⇤
sufficiently high so that:
                                     ⇣( (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                                b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ); ⌫¯i ) = ⇧⇤

and:
                                            m⇤i = ⇣        1

Alternatively, suppose:

Then, higher values of Ri than one will increase the central bank’s loss, and the central bank
should set Ri⇤ = 1. It follows that any Markov equilibrium (m

by the nonlinear equations:

   Suppose next that ⇣ is strictly increasing. Again, because                               2   is strictly quasi-convex,
there is a unique solution to the central bank’s decision problem. There are two possibilities.
The first is that:
                                                     b ⇤ ); ⌫¯i )  ⇧⇤
                                              ⇣( (Qi m

The central bank can achieve a global minimum by setting Ri⇤ sufficiently high that ⇣( (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                                                                               b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ); ⌫¯i ) =
⇧⇤ and m⇤i = ⇣       1
                         (⇧⇤ ; ⌫¯i ). Alternatively, suppose:


                                                    b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ); ⌫¯i ) > ⇧⇤
                                             ⇣( (Qi m


Then, higher values of Ri than one will increase the central bank’s loss, and the central bank
should set Ri⇤ = 1. It follows that any Markov equilibrium (m
                                                            b ⇤i , Ri⇤ )Ji=1 is fully characterized
by the nonlinear equations:


                                    b ⇤i = max(⇣
                                    m                   1

                                                                             b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ))

                                    b ⇤i =
                                    m           (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                                        b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i )


Given the restriction on Q assumed in the proposition, we can use the contraction mapping
logic from the proof of Proposition 1 to establish that there is a unique solution to these
equations.

   Note that Proposition 4 is agnostic about whether ⇣ - the function that links the equi-
librium marginal utility gap to inflation expectations - is strictly increasing or decreasing.
Hence, higher inflation expectations can be associated with higher or lower levels of real
economic activity.
   The next proposition establishes that, as in game 1, there is no Markov equilibrium in
which the zero lower bound always binds.

Proposition 5. Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied and suppose too that the central bank’s
loss function    2                                                               b ⇤ , R⇤ ), there
                     is strictly quasi-convex. In the unique Markov equilibrium (m

exists some i such that Ri⇤ > 1.

Proof. Same as the proof of Proposition 2.

   The next proposition provides a necessary condition on exogenous parameters that ensures
that the central bank is at the zero lower bound in a given state in a Markov equilibrium to
game 2.

Proposition 6. Suppose that the loss function              2   is strictly quasi-convex and the function ⇣
is invertible. Define the vector µ̄ ⌘ (⇣      1
                                                  (⇧⇤ ; ⌫¯k ))Jk=1 ,; and suppose there exists some k such
that:
                                           µ̄k <      (Qk µ̄; ⌫¯k )

                                 b ⇤ , R⇤ ) of game 2, Rk⇤ = 1.
Then, in any Markov equilibrium (m

Proof. Since the loss function     2   is strictly quasi-convex, a Markov equilibrium is character-
ized as the solution to the equations:


                          b ⇤i = max(µ̄i , (Qi m
                          m                    b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i )), i = 1, ..., J

                          b ⇤i =
                          m              (Ri⇤ Qi m
                                                 b ⇤ ; ⌫¯i ), i = 1, ...J




In state k:


                   b ⇤k = max(µ̄k , (Qk m
                   m                    b ⇤ ; ⌫¯k ))

                                                              b ⇤j
                             max(µ̄k , (Qk µ̄; ⌫¯k )) because m             µ̄j for all j

                        > µ̄k


and so Rk⇤ must equal one.

3.3        Divine Coincidence

In simple New Keynesian models, the equilibrium allocation is efficient when the central bank
achieves its inflation target in all dates and states. This situation has been termed a divine
coincidence. Along those same lines, I say that there is a divine coincidence in this class of
models if:
                                         ⇣(m̄des
                                             i ;⌫¯i ) = ⇧⇤ for all i = 1, ..., J

so that the central bank’s desired allocation is consistent with achieving its inflation objective
(in an expected sense) in every date and state.
    The equilibria of the two games are identical if there is a divine coincidence.

Proposition 7. Suppose that ⇣ is invertible and that Assumption 1 is satisfied. Then, the
unique Markov equilibria of game 1 (real outcome targeting) and game 2 (inflation targeting)
are the same in a divine coincidence.

Proof. The equilibrium outcomes are characterized by the same nonlinear equations, because
µ̄i = ⇣    1
               (⇧⇤ ; ⌫¯i ) = m̄des
                               i   for all i = 1, ..., J.

    In a divine coincidence, the conditions in Propositions 3 and 6 become the same. We can
connect this common condition to a more familiar one in the literature. Define the (gross)
natural real rate of interest in state k to be:

                                                                 1
                                                rknat =     PJ
                                                             j=1   Pkj ¯ nat
                                                                         kj


Note that the natural real rate of interest depends on the current state k only through
households’ beliefs (Pkj )Jj=1 about future realizations of the natural growth rate of marginal
utility.
    The following proposition supposes that ex-post inflation is (conditionally) independent
of natural marginal utility growth, that the central bank’s desired marginal utility process is
in fact the same as the natural marginal utility process, and that there is a divine coincidence.

                                                            18
It shows that under this assumption, the sufficient conditions in Propositions 3 and 6 are
equivalent to the natural real rate of interest being higher than 1/⇧⇤ - that is, equivalent to
the natural nominal rate of interest being larger than 1.

Proposition 8. Suppose that for all i, m̄des
                                         i   = 1 and:

                                   J
                                   X                       J
                                                           X
                                          Pij ¯ nat ¯
                                                ij ⇠ij =         Pij ¯ nat
                                                                       ij
                                    j=1                    j=1



In a divine coincidence, rknat ⇧⇤ < 1 if and only if m̄des
                                                       k <             (Qk m̄des ; ⌫¯k ).

Proof. We can readily show that:

                                 ⇧⇤                 ⇣(m̄des ; ⌫¯k )              1
                                                                                  (m̄des
                                                                                     k ;⌫  ¯k )
               rknat ⇧⇤ =   PJ                 =   PJ k ¯ nat ¯ =
                             j=1   Pkj ¯ nat
                                         kj          j=1 Pkj kj ⇠kj
                                                                                 Qk m̄ des



which proves the proposition.

    Gali (2008) shows that in a simple New Keynesian model characterized by the divine
coincidence, monetary policy can only be optimal if the real interest rate is equal to the
natural real rate of interest in every date and state. However, Gali’s analysis assumes that
there is no lower bound on the nominal interest rate. Of course, when the lower bound
binds, the central bank is forced to set the short-term interest above its natural level (as
in Propositions 3 and 6). The following proposition uses the conditions in Proposition 8
to show that, if there is some risk of the lower bound’s binding in the future, a currently
unconstrained central bank will set the real interest rate below its natural level.

Proposition 9. Suppose that there is a divine coincidence, and that for all i, m̄des
                                                                                 i   = 1.
Suppose too that inflation is conditionally uncorrelated with the natural level of marginal
utility:
                                   J
                                   X                       J
                                                           X
                                          Pij ¯ nat ¯
                                                ij ⇠ij =         Pij ¯ nat
                                                                       ij
                                    j=1                    j=1




                                                    19
Consider a Markov equilibrium with states (j,k) such that Rj⇤ > 1, m
                                                                   b ⇤k > 1, and Qjk > 0.
Then:
                                           Rj⇤ < ⇧⇤ rjnat

Proof. The proof of Proposition 8 shows that, under the conditions of Proposition 9, it is
true that for all i:
                                      (rinat ⇧⇤ Qj m̄des ) = m̄des
                                                               i


If Rj⇤ > 1 in a Markov equilibrium, then it must be true that m
                                                              b ⇤j = 1. In that case, we know
that:
                                       1=     (Rj⇤ Qj m
                                                      b ⇤ ; ⌫¯j )

      b ⇤k > 1 and Qjk > 0, we know also that:
Since m


                                            b ⇤ > Qj m̄des
                                         Qj m


It follows that:
                                           Rj⇤ < rjnat ⇧⇤




    Suppose that there is a state k such that the natural (gross) nominal interest rate is less
than one. Proposition 9 implies that if the central bank is unconstrained in state j, and there
is a positive probability of transiting from state j to state k in finite time, then the nominal
interest rate in state j is below its natural level.



4       Secular Stagnation: A Numerical Example

In this section, I first describe how to solve numerically for Markov equilibria under As-
sumption 1. I then discuss the properties of a particular numerical example. I argue that



                                                 20
these properties correspond to what some observers4 have termed “secular stagnation”. More
specifically, in the (unique) Markov equilibrium, the economy spends long stretches at the
zero lower bound with large marginal utility gaps. During these periods, the natural nominal
interest rate is actually positive most of the time.


4.1       Solution Method

In this subsection, I describe how to solve numerically for the set of Markov equilibria in
games 1 and 2 under the assumptions made in Propositions 1 and 4. Recall that we defined
the matrix Q by:
                                             Qij = Pij ¯ nat ¯
                                                         ij ⇠ij


and the function        is restricted to be Lipschitz with modulus B. Assume that Assumption
1 is satisfied, so that B||Q|| < 1.
      In game 1, consider the operator T1 : RJ+ ! RJ+ defined by:


                                b i = max(m̄des
                           (T1 (m))                 b ⌫¯i )), i = 1, ..., J
                                            i , (Qi m;




The proof of Proposition 1 shows that T1 is a contraction. It follows that we can find the
unique equilibrium to game 1 by iterating on T1 from an arbitrary positive J-dimensional
vector:
                                           b ⇤ = lim (T1 )N (m
                                           m                 b 0)
                                                 N !1


      In game 2, consider the operator T2 : RJ+ ! RJ+ defined by:


                                   b i = max(⇣
                              (T2 (m))               1
                                                         (⇧⇤ ; ⌫¯i ), (Qi m;
                                                                          b ⌫¯i ))


Under assumption 1, T2 is a contraction. It follows that we can find the unique equilibrium

      See, among others, Summers (2014).

to game 2 by iterating on T2 from an arbitrary positive J-dimensional vector:


                                      b ⇤ = lim T2N (m
                                      m              b 0)
                                              N !1



   In the next section, I apply these solution methods to a particular numerical example to
illustrate how fear of a sharp crisis can lead to secular stagnation.


4.2     A Numerical Example

In this subsection, I describe, and solve, a simple numerical example in which the number of

The example features fixed inflation expectations, so that ⇧⇤ = 1.02 and ⇣(m;
                                                                           b i) = 1.02 for
    b and i. I set
all m                = 0.97 (the settings for ⇣ and     indicate that this is intended to be an
example in which the length of a period is a year). The state space for natural marginal
utility growth is ( ¯ ij )3j=1 =(0.98, 0.98, 1.23) for all i. This state space indicates that the
realization of natural marginal utility growth in a given period is independent of information
received prior to that period. The state space for inflation realizations is given by (1, 1, 1).
The transition matrix P is:
                                       0.975    0    0.025
                                        0.1    0.7    0.2
                                         0     0.5    0.5

The stationary probability vector associated with P is (0.71, 0.18, 0.11).
   In this example, state 1 is relatively safe, because average marginal utility is shrinking
over time, and agents believe that there is a high probability of staying in state 1. However,
state 1 does admit a small probability of exiting to state 3, in which the the growth rate of
average marginal utility is very high. In state 3, the probability of immediately returning to



                                                22
the (good) state 1 is zero. However, there is a chance of returning to state 2. In some sense,
state 2 is a good state because marginal utility growth is low (just as low as in state 1). But
state 2 is a delicate one, because there is a relatively high probability of switching back to
state 3.
       I focus on Game 1 and assume that m̄des
                                           j   = 1 for j = 1, 2, 3, so that the central bank’s
desired real outcome is to keep equilibrium marginal utility equal to its natural level.5 Given
the central bank’s objective, the vector of natural nominal interest rates is given by:

                                        1
                                 ( PJ           )3i=1 = (1.067, 1.021, 0.95)
                                      j=1 Qij


We know, therefore, that the zero lower bound has to bind in state 3 in a Markov equilibrium.
However, in the unique Markov equilibrium, the marginal utility gap vector is given by:


                                                (1, 1.096, 1.23)

The central bank achieves this outcome by setting the (gross) nominal interest rate vector
equal to:
                                                 (1.058, 1, 1)

       In this example, the zero lower bound binds in both states 2 and 3. The marginal utility
gap in state 2 is very large, even though the realized decline of natural marginal utility in
state 2 is the same as in state 1. Note that the central bank sets the nominal interest rate
lower than its natural level in both states 1 and 2. The natural interest rate in a given state
is defined as the interest rate that delivers the best outcome in that state, conditional on
the central bank’s achieving the best outcome in all other states. Since the central bank is
unable to achieve the best outcome in state 3 (because the zero lower bound binds), it is
desirable to set the nominal interest rate below its natural level in all other states.
   5
     This assumption means that, in states 1 and 2, the central bank’s desired level of marginal utility is
falling steadily. However, if state 3 occurs, there is permanent upward shock to the natural level of marginal
utility, which is inherited by the central bank’s desired level of marginal utility.


                                                      23
   One useful way to summarize the properties of the Markov equilibrium is through average
transition times. Suppose that the economy starts in state 1. Then, on average, it enters
state 3 in forty years. State 3 is a crisis state, in which the marginal utility of consumption in
the central bank’s desired allocation is rising rapidly. The central bank responds by lowering
the gross nominal interest rate to one. The economy exits state 3, on average, in 2 years.
However, even after the economy returns to state 2, the central bank keeps the nominal
interest rate at the zero lower bound. It stays at the zero lower bound until the economy
returns to state 1 - which only takes place, on average, sixteen years after the initial entry
into state 3.


4.2.2   An Enhanced Set of Policy Instruments

Central banks have used a variety of policy tools at the zero lower bound, including quan-
titative easing, forward guidance, and negative interest rates. In this subsection, I discuss
each of these briefly. The first is the simplest: in this simple framework, quantitative easing
would have no e↵ect (just as in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)). In order to change this
result, we would need to enhance the model to incorporate e↵ects of quantitative easing on
the central bank’s objective, on the evolution of inflation expectations, or on the natural level
of marginal utility.
   There is some room for e↵ective forward guidance in the example. I have used the
concept of Markov equilibrium to model the outcomes of central bank choices over time.
This concept eliminates the ability of the central bank to commit when at the zero lower
bound to future choices. In particular, the central bank could improve outcomes in states 2
or 3 by committing to deliver higher inflation and lower marginal utility than are achieved
in the Markov equilibrium upon re-entry into state 1. However, recall that the central bank
stays in state 3 for, on average, two years, and then stays in state 2 for, on average, fourteen
years. In this example, e↵ective forward guidance requires very long periods of commitment
- lasting well over a decade on average. (Of course, as is true in any context, e↵ective forward


                                               24
guidance actually requires the commitment to be of arbitrary duration.)
       In contrast, negative nominal interest rates are extremely powerful within this model.
Suppose that the lower bound on nominal interest rates is -0.5%, rather than zero. Then, we
can use the proof in Proposition 1 (or 4) to show that the the unique Markov equilibrium in
either game 1 or 2 is characterized as the fixed point to the nonlinear operator:

                                                      3
                                                      X
                         b ⇤i
                         m      = max(1, 0.995              Pij ¯ des ¯ b ⇤ ), i = 1, 2, 3
                                                                  j ⇠j m  j                             (8)
                                                 ⇧⇤   j=1


The factor 0.995 reflects the reduction in the lower bound on gross nominal interest rates.
       The solution to (8) is given by:
                                                 (1, 1, 1.11)

The zero lower bound only binds in state 3. The marginal utility gap in state 3 is now only
11%, not 23%. The central bank achieves this outcome by setting the gross nominal interest
rates in the three states equal to:


                                          (1.063, 0.995, 0.995)


Hence, the central bank makes use of its new tool by lowering the gross nominal interest rate
to 0.995 in both states6 2 and 3. The better outcomes in states 2 and 3 mean that it is that
it is desirable for the central bank to set the nominal interest rate equal to a higher level in
state 1.
       Why does a seemingly small fifty basis point reduction in the lower bound have such a big
impact on real outcomes in this example? The intuition is that the fifty basis point reduction
is expected to last, on average, for a long period of time. Thus, in state 2, the fifty basis
point reduction is expected to last, on average, for fourteen years. The reduction in the lower
bound is much less e↵ective if the central bank perceives it as an “emergency” measure that
   6
    More precisely, the gross nominal interest rate is 0.99501 in state 2. The lower bound is not binding in
that state.



                                                      25
would be applied only in state 3. Such a transitory reduction in the lower bound results in
a Markov equilibrium marginal utility gap vector of the form:


                                            (1, 1.057, 1.18)


This represents a noticeably smaller improvement over the original Markov equilibrium.



5     Conclusions

The term “nominal rigidities” in macroeconomics is generally used to refer to frictions in
the adjustment of prices and wages. However, from the point of view of monetary policy,
these frictions are really just one way to motivate why anticipated inflation seems to adjust
only slowly in response to macroeconomic shocks and policy adjustments. In this paper, I
proceed more directly and simply assume that one-period-ahead inflation expectations adjust
sluggishly, if at all, to real economic conditions. This assumption is consistent with a wide
range of recent empirical work. I focus on the properties of Markov equilibria in a dynamic
stochastic game in which exogenous variables evolve according to a Markov chain and a
central bank chooses a short-term nominal interest rate subject to a zero lower bound. I
allow for two distinct objectives for the central bank: targeting a desired level of economic
activity or a desired level of inflation.
    In this context, I make two substantive contributions. First, I develop a numerical solution
algorithm to solve for the unique Markov equilibrium. The solution procedure is simple but
still takes full account of the presence of the lower bound on the short-term nominal interest
rate. Given its simplicity, the algorithm could readily be used by first-year Ph. D. or advanced
undergraduate students. Instructors in these kinds of courses could use the framework in this
paper and the associated solution procedure, as a way to help their students understand the
basic consequences of the zero lower bound.
    Second, I use a numerical example to show that, after a crisis event in which economic


                                                  26
activity declines rapidly, the central bank may be constrained by the zero lower bound be-
cause the economy has entered a “fear” period in which households assign a relatively high
probability to another crisis taking place. In the example, the after any crisis, the economy
typically endures long stays at the zero lower bound that are associated with large efficiency
losses. The extended duration of these “fear” periods imply that there are large gains to
relaxing the zero lower bound by being able to lower the short-term nominal interest rate
below zero by relatively small amounts (as little as 50 basis points). The bulk of these gains
are only achievable if the central bank is willing to use negative nominal interest rates during
periods in which households are afraid of a crisis (and not just during crises themselves).
