             The Social Security Disability Program and
                     Labor Force Participation




                              ABSTRACT



         In the last twenty years the labor force participation rates of

45 to 54—year—old men have fallen 10.6 percentage points among non—whites

and 4.4 percentage points among whites. I find that nearly half of this

puzzling decline can be explained by the growth of the Social Security

Disability program. By 1975, 6.22% of the prime—age non—white men and

3.57% of the white men were Social Security Disability beneficiaries.

Despite the medical screening of applicants, I find in cross—section

estimates an elasticity of .35 for beneficiary status with respect to

benefit levels. As eligibility requirements have eased and as benefit

levels have increased relative to earnings more men have dropped out of

the labor force and become Social Security Disability beneficiaries.

     In 1977 about one out of every five non—white 45 to 54—year old men were

out of the labor force during a typical week, Of    these,   about one—third were

Social   Security Disability beneficiaries. Over the past two decades the labor
force participation rates of these prime—age males have fallen 4.4     percentage

points   among whites and 10.6 percentage points among non—whites. At the sane

time, an increasing proportion of these men have become Social Security Disa-

bility (SSD) beneficiaries (see Figure 1). Why are an increasing number of

prime age men without a job and not looking for work? Why are so many of them

becoming SSLJ beneficiaries?

     I shall show that the liberalization of SSD eligibility requirements and

the increases in SSD benefits relative to potential labor market earnings have

caused more men to drop out of the labor force and become SSD beneficiaries.

The liberalization of SSD benefits can account for nearly one—half of the

puzzling   decline in the labor force participation rates (LFPR) of 45 to 54—year
old men over the past twenty years. Unlike other forms of social insurance,
policy   in the SSD program is explicitly predicated on the assumption that bene-

ficiaries are medically incapable of work. The heart of the SSD program assumes

that the reduction of labor supply commonly induced by welfare programs cannot

occur among the totally disabled, and significant efforts are made in screening

applicants in an attempt to ensure that those who could work do not become

beneficiaries. Yet I shall show that even in the seemingly clear—cut case of

disability insurance, a social welfare program reduces labor supply. iligher

benefits cause men to drop out of the labor force and become SSD beneficiaries.1

This helps explain how LFPR can drop and SSD beneficiary roles can expand at a

tine when health care expenditures are increasing and men are moving out of physi-

cally demanding work.

     The following section will detail the growth of the SSD program and the

concurrent decline in LFPR. We shall also see what men who are out of the labor

force are living on and show the long—term nature of most non—participation.

In section II I develop the specification of a model of SSD beneficiary status.

Section III presents logistic regression results, applying this model to cross—

section data to forge the link between expected benefits and beneficiary status.

I also present time series regressions that show that the growth of the 5513

program has contributed to the decline in LFPR. In Section IV I examine and

reject a number of alternative explanations for the decline in LFPR, and present

evidence suggesting that the reduced LFPR caused by the disability insurance

program is not unique to the U.S. Conclusions are presented in the final section.

 I. The Social Security Disability Program and Labor Force Participation.

     Enacted into law in 1956, the SSD program was designed to provide income

 for the totally disabled, defined as those "unable to engage in substantial

gainful activity because of any medically determinable physical or mental

 impairment of long—continued and indefinite duration or expected to result

in death." There have been two major liberalizations of the eligibility re-

quirement for SSD. In 1960 men below the age of 50 first became eligible for

SSD benefits. In 1965 the definition of disability was expanded to include

impairments expected to last for at least one year. At the same time,

benefit levels have been increasing with the level of nominal earnings, and

have in addition been sporadically but persistently increased by Congress.2

This double indexing, common to all Social Security programs, was formalized

in the 1972 amendments.

    Throughout its existence the SSD program has provided average benefits for

a disabled worker, his wife, and two dependant children, equal to about 55%

of the average pre—tax earnings of production workers. Due primarily to double

indexing this replacement ratio has risen on average to 64% in 1975 and even

higher for new recipients. To the extent that SSD recipients would earn less

than average, and since the relevant comparison is to after—tax earnings, the

replacement ratio is even more generous. However, since few 45 or 54—year old

men have eligible dependents we expect the typical replacement rate to be closer

to the 52% net of tax for a male worker alone. For a sample of disabled workers

allowed benefits in 1972 (Treitel, Table 5), 24.3% had annual benefits greater
                                                                             5




than 100% of pre—tax predisability earnings, and only 23.3% had a replacement

ratio below 50%.

       SSD benefits are calculated in the same way as Social Security Retirement

benefits. This is a complex non—linear function of past earnings and family

composition.3 Applicants must have worked in Social Security covered employment

in half of the previous forty quarters,4 must meet the disability standard

stated above, and must wait five months from the date of disability determination

before benefits are paid.5

       Entrance into the program is administered at the State level. Since

the program is Federally funded, the States have little incentive to police entry

into the program or to review the current disability status of beneficiaries,

save that explicitly budgeted for by the Federal government. In recent years

there have been roughly equal numbers of denied and accepted applications for

SSD benefits.6 As the percent initially denied has risen recently, so has the

percent who appeal the initial denial. In 1973, 24% of those denied eligibility

at the initial medical determination were eventually enrolled through the appeals

process (Social Security Administration, Office of Research and Statistics, p. 3).

       The outcome has been the explosive growth of the SSD program. By 1975

the program had expended to pay out 8.414 billion dollars with 1,750,000 disabled

worker beneficiaries. These included 6.22% of all non—white and 3.57% of all white

45— to 54—year old men.   (See Appendix A for data on LFPR and the SSD program.)

       By law a SSD recipient must be incapable of holding any job in the national

economy, so the SSD program will tend to lower LFPR as long as some beneficiaries

would otherwise be in the labor force. Beneficiaries are allowed trial work

periods, and were allowed to earn less than $140 per month in 1972, but these
                                                                               6




options are infrequently exercised. So most recipients are by law and in fact

out of the labor force. To prove that the SSD program has led to decreasing

LFPR we shall show that not all recipients would have been out of the labor

force in the absence of SS]D.

         In effect, SSD recipients are permanently out of the labor force. "The

data show that very few of the older middle—aged workers left the rolls for

recovery of the ability to work in gainful employment. Essentially, the program

appears to function as an early retirement program for older middle—aged persons

with severe medical impairments."7 The termination rate is about 10% —     only
3%   through recovery, 7% through   death.8

         Before   proceeding, we can determine an upper bound on the proportion of
the decline in LFPR that can be attributed to the growth of the SSD program.
If   all SSD beneficiaries would otherwise have been in the labor force, then at

most 66% of the 8.9 percentage point decline in non—white LFPR and 90% of the

3.7 percentage point decline in white LFPR form 1957 to 1975 could be attributed

directly to the SSD program. We shall actually be able to show that about 43%

of the decline in LFPR of 45 to 54—year old men is due to the growth of the

SSD program.

         This may seem startling to those who view labor force non—participation

as a transient phenomenon, fluctuating with the number of discouraged workers

cast off during the downturn of the business cycle. The evidence points to a

different type of non—participation: hard—core long—term drop—outs. In 1976,

39.8% of the 45 to 54—year old white men who were out of the labor force had

been out of the labor force for more than five years. For non—whites the

corresponding number was 43.5% (Deutermann). In 1970 more than half the 45

to 54—year old men who were out of the labor force had not held a job for at
                                                                                 7




least three years (u.s. Census 1970a, p. 706). For these men, being out of

the    labor force is not a temporary state. It is this long—term chronic
non—participation among a large and growing portion of the adult male population
that    is    so troubling.
             What do these men live on? Table 1 shows that the major sources of income

for men who are out of the labor force are Social Security Disability benefits,

Veteran's Assistance payments, wife's earnings, and government employees pension

or   disability benefits.9 Of these, SSD is the largest source of income. In
1970 56% of SSD recipients had received benefits for more than 3 years, matching

the    long—term nature of most non—participation. Given the accelerating growth
of   the program this is probably an underestimate of the length of completed spells

of   beneficiary status.
             The long—term nature of most non—participation is coupled with the fact
that the LFPR of 45 to 54—year old men has been declining at an accelerating
rate over the last 22 years, through all phases of the business cycle. Nost
men who are out of the labor force claim to be disabled, but it is difficult
to believe that between record health care expenditures and 051-IA an increasing
proportion of men are becoming and staying       disabled.

         We    have shown that one—third of the men who are out of the labor force
are SSD      beneficiaries,   and most of them have been out of the labor force for
years. SSD benefits have increased and eligibility has been expanded so that
the proportion of SSD beneficiaries has grown as LFPR declined. In the next
section we shall measure the increase in the probability of becoming an SSD
beneficiary as expected benefits increase relative to expected labor market
earnings,      holding health characteristics fixed. using these estimates, we

shall project the increase in SSD beneficiaries and decrease in labor force

participants due to the liberalization of the SSD program.

II. The Model


          I shall deal with the following model, in which equation 3 is to be

estimated.




(1)                          SSDK = F(SSD, w, x)




(2)                             WZb+u

(3)                          SSDK = F(SSD, Zb + u, X)




where

SSDK =    probability   of being an SSD beneficiary.

SSD   = expected Social Security     Disability benefits
  W   =   expected labor market income
  X = a     vector of background characteristics, including marital status

  Z = a     vector of background characteristics determining wage, including

          past wage and excluding marital status.


          Health and other background characteristics affect incomes and may enter

significantly into our final estimates if utility functions or discount rates

differ systematically across individuals. For example, the old or disabled may

have higher discount rates.

          Our goal is to estimate the probability of being an SSD beneficiary as

a function of expected SSD benefits, expected labor market income, W, and back-

ground characteristics     X. The major econometric problem is that a large portion
                                                                       10




of our sample, in particular the SSD beneficiaries, is out of the labor force

and has no observable current wage. One might want to impute wages for this

group using a wage equation estimated for the sub—sample with observable

wages, and correcting for sample selection bias following llecSan. This

method requires estimating the probability of observing a positive wage, but

in our application this is nearly equivalent to estimating the probability

of not being an SSD beneficiary, which is what I am after in the first place.

This approach, which does not arise in the original Heckman application because

the probability of having an observable wage is not taken explicitly as a

function of the expected wage, would require maximum likelihood estimation

of a non—linear simultaneous system.

       Since I am willing to leave the coefficient on W in the beneficiary

equation unidentified, I can avoid the simultaneity problem. As in indirect

least squares, we replace W by Zb + u as in equation 3. Note that the estimated

coefficient on an element of Z, say Z, that is also an element of the vector

X, will be the sum of the coefficient on Z. in equation 1 plus the product of

the coefficient on W in equation 1 times the coefficient on Z. in equation 2.

       Expected SSD benefits are estimated as the product of de jure benefits

given eligibility, times the probability of being eligible for benefits. Using

a sample of recent applicants, we shall estimate the probability of eligibility

as a function of health and background characteristics. We shall assume no sample

selection bias in the eligibility equation. If applicants were more eligible

than non—applicants in ways not controlled for in our eligibility equation, then

the estimated coefficient on SSD would be biased toward zero in equation 312

       Our data—set includes the respondents' claimed knowledge of a Social

Security program that pays disability benefits. We can take this knowledge as

either endogenous or exogenous. If we impute positive SSD benefits even to
                                                                            11




those who claim to be ignorant of the program, then equation 3 can be thought

of in two ways. Either we have made the restrictive assumption that   everyone
knows about the program, or, we are estimating the joint probability of knowing

about and applying for the program. Alternatively, if positive expected benefits

are imputed only for those who know of the program, then knowledge of the

program is taken as exogenous, and we have a classic control group with which

to test the effect of SSD benefits on labor force participation..

       I use past wage to help infer current expected wage. My data set

includes the Social Security Earnings Record, which reports annual earnings up

to the maximum amount that is subject to Social Security taxes. I select

the most recent positive past annual earnings and correct for quarters worked

and inflation. The specification includes a binary independent variable set to

one if the past wage was at the taxable ceiling, to correct for the truncation

of this variable.

       To correct for health and disability status I use a set of 27 binary

independent variables for specific health conditions, as detailed in Appendix

B.13 The coefficients for this vector of health coefficients in our estimated

eligibility and beneficiary equations are discussed in Appendix B.

III. Regression Results


       The Social Security Disability program has had a large and significant

effect in reducing labor supply. The elasticity of labor supply in response to

expected SSD benefits is found to be .35 in the results discussed below.

Estimation of the model supports our hypothesis that   labor   force participation

falls because more men become SSD beneficiaries when expected SSD benefits

rise relative to wage income. In this section we first estimate the probability

of eligibility for SSD benefits, which will be used to impute expected benefits.

We then estimate the effect of increased benefits on the proportion of SSD

beneficiaries and labor—force drop—outs in the population, finding a significant

strong response with health characteristics and expected labor market income

controlled for.

       We estimate the effect of the SSD program on LPPR in two steps. First

we estimate a cross—section logistic equation for the probability of being an

SSD beneficiary. Note that this cross—section is direct evidence of the

reduction in LFPR caused by the SSD program.    If all SSD beneficiaries

would have been out of the labor force even in the absence of the SSD program,

it is unlikely that we would observe, as shown below, that the probability of

being a beneficiary is strongly responsive to expected incomes. In the second

step we use time—series regressions to explicitly estimate the number of labor—

force withdrawals caused by the increase in SSD beneficiaries. When we apply

the cross—section coefficients to changes in the variables over time, we can

explain half of the increase in the SSD beneficiary population and about

half of the decline in LFPR from 1957 to 1975. Separate time—series evidence

from regressions of LFPR on benefit levels, earnings, and cyclical indicators
                                                                                  3-3




provides   independent support for large decline in LFPR   caused   by the 5513

program.
         The results below are based on an unweighted sample of 45 to 54— year

old men who were not last employed by the government. In general, government

employees are not covered by Social Security, so they have been eliminated from

the sample. The sample is drawn from the 1972 Social Security Survey of Health

and Work Characteristics, in which 18,000 persons were selected from the 1970

Census 5% sample and re—interviewed. It includes 11,7000 people who indicated

that they were disabled prior to 1969 on the 1970 Census questionnaire. A

1971 mail screening produced 5,100 non—disabled and 1,200 newly disabled

people. The sample is designed to represent the non—institutionalized civilian

population of the U.S. aged 18 to 64. This survey data is merged with beneficiary

data   form the Social Security Master Beneficiary Record File, and with earnings
history from the Social Security Earnings Record File.
       The key variable, 5513 benefits, is :Lmputed in two steps. IDe jure
benefits are calculated as a deterministic function of past wage history and
number of dependents. The correlation between our calculation of de jure bene-

fits and actual benefits received by beneficiaries is .81, since we do not have

exact data on the date of disability determination. To impute expected SSD

benefits we multiply the calculated de jure benefits by the probability of

being eligible, which is estimated using a sample of recent applicants. Eli-

gibility for 5513 benefits is determined by State agencies in a subjective process

that takes account of age, education, occupation, and the degree of disability.

Legally, total disability expected to last at least one year is the prerequisite.

90% of the recipients in the sample report themselves totally disabled, as do

68% of the non—recipients who are out of the labor force. As our results (Table
                                                                             14



2) show, for a sample of 45 to 54—year old men who applied for SSD between

1966 and 1972, health condition is obviously a prime determinant of eligibility.

Another major factor is having established disability insurance coverage

by having worked the required number of quarters in Social Security coveted

employment. So far the provisions of the law seem to be borne out in actual

practice. According to the law race should not affect eligibility. That being

non—white significantly decreases eligibility is either evidence of sample

selection bias or measurement error, or else reflects the de facto application

of the law.

    We find that a $180 increase in yearly benefits will increase the

proportion of SSD beneficiaries in the population by 1 percentage point.15

(See equation A, Table 3.) This is equivalent to an elasticity of .35, a

substantial response among men who are usually considered incapable of workingJ6

This specification can be interpreted as estimating the joint probability of

knowing about and applying for SSD benefits, and probably underestimates the

true response since we impute positive expected benefits to those who claim

to be ignorant of the program. The same 1 percentage point increase in the

proportion of beneficiaries is produced by a $105 increase in mean yearly

benefits when the sample is limited to those who claim to know of the SSD

program17 (equation B, Table 3). This corresponds to an elasticity of .44.

This estimate is unbiased if knowledge of the program is taken to be exogenous.

Spreading knowledge of the SSIJ program does not by itself seem to be a sufficient

explanation for the growth in the beneficiary rolls. Even when the sample is

limited   to those who know of the program, those with higher expected benefits
are more likely to be beneficiaries.

        Similarly, the more one expects to be able to earn the less likely
one is to be a beneficiary. As past wage reaches the ceiling on Social
Security taxable earnings, the probability of being a beneficiary approximates
zero. The elasticity-of beneficiary status with respect to having    wages
that surpass the ceiling is —19.4. Below the ceiling the probability of
becoming a beneficiary drops by 1 percentage point with a 12% increase in the
level   of past monthly wages. The sharply decreased probability of becoming a bene-

ficiary when past wages are at or above the ceiling nay reflect the fact that

a disabled white—collar worker can often continue working while an identically

disabled blue—collar worker cannot due to the physical demands of the job. The

negative coefficient on years of schooling is taken as further evidence of the

same effect.

        Note that the color of one's skin makes little difference. We find a

higher proportion of black than white males in the SSD program, not because

blacks have a greater predilection for this program, but rather because blacks

face poorer job opportunities and are in poorer health. If the economic posi—

tion of blacks comes into line with that of whites, we expect equal proportions

of blacks and whites to be beneficiaries.

        These results indicate that the growth in the proportion of SSD beneficiaries

among prime age males has been due to the liberalization of eligibility require-

ments, and to the increase in benefit levels relative to potential earnings.

Declining job opportunities seem to be a plausible explanation for the program's
                                                                              18




accelerating growth during the 1970's, but not for the 1960's. Given the

increases in real incomes and real per—capita health expenditures it seems

implausible to attribute the increasing proportion of beneficiaries in a

given age group to deteriorating health.

        Do   these estimated cross—section responses correspond to   the observed

changes      over time? We find that we can account for half of the increase in
the   proportion of SSD beneficiaries by applying the cross—section coefficients

from equation A to t:ine—series data. We shall show that this in turn can

explain about half of the decline in LFPR, using t:ine—series regression.

Between 1957 and 1975 the average monthly benefit of new 45 to 54—year old

beneficiaries rose from $94 to $148 in real 1972 dollars. The real average

monthly earnings of production workers increased from $374 to $437 during

the same period. The percentage of all male workers with annual earnings

below the taxable ceiling fell form 41.3 to 23.8. Over this period there

have been seven jumps in the ceiling, so the annual percentage above the

ceiling has not dropped smoothly. Changes in other variables have been negli-

gible. For example, the percentage married—spouse—present inched up from

83.9 to 84.3.

       Multiplying the changes over time in wages and benefits by the estimated

coefficients from equation A we find an implied 1.8 percentage point increase

in beneficiaries, more than half of the historical 3.5 percentage point increase

for men of both races)8 Since more men are below the taxable ceiling because

the ceiling has been raised, and not because these men are earning less in

the sense of the cross—section regression, we have left this factor aside.

Most of the action is beneath the ceiling in any case.
                                                                         19


      Over time increases in beneficiaries have been matched more than one for

one by decreases in labor force participants. In time—series regressions of

LFFR on the proportion of recipients (REC) and cyclical indicators (eq. 1—6,

Table 4), we observe LFPR to drop by at least one point when REC increases

by one point. We would be unlikely to observe this relation if all beneficiaries

would have been out of the labor force even in the absence of the SSD program.

Since we previously found a 1.8 percentage point increase in beneficiaries

applying   cross—section coefficients to time—series changes, and that LFPR
drops by more than 1 point when the percentage of SSD beneficiaries increases
by 1 point, our results imply at least a 1.8 percentage point decrease in
LFPR. The actual decline from 1957 to 1975 was 4.2 points for men of all races,

so we conclude that the growth of expected benefits relative to potential

earnings can explain nearly half of the puzzling decline in LFPR.

      In a separate set of time—series regressions of LFPR on average SSD

benefit levels and average earnings (eqs. 7—12, Table 4) we see evidence

consistent with our cross—section findings of a large effect of benefit levels

on LFPR. Even when the business cycle, trend, median earnings, and trend since

1960 when the eligibility rules changed, are controlled for, the SSD benefit

levels still significantly contribute to the decline in LFPR. With earnings

controlled for, the business cycle does not strongly or significantly affect

LFPR. These time—series results indicate that a $100 increase in average

real SSD benefits will reduce non—white LPPR by 4 percentage points and white

LFPR by 3 percentage points.

      Since it is difficult to separate out the effects of the SSD program

from othermacro—economic factors in a set of 22 observations, the time—series

results should only be considered suggestive of the magnitude of the effect

of the SSD program on LFPR. While future research may find smaller effects,

it is unlikely to overturn the basic result that the growth of the SSD

program has caused a significant part of the decline in LFPR.
                                                                            22



PT. Alternative Explanations

        We have   shown that the growth of the Social Security Disability
program has been the major factor behind the decline in LFPR over the past
twenty years. In this section we shall examine and dismiss three alternative

explanations of the decline in LFPR. 1) Thedeclineis due to the dissolution

of the American family. 2) Nale LFPR declined because female LFPR increased.

3)   The decline is the product of past economic dislocations.

        The   first argument is that since single men commonly have lower LFPR, the
break—up of the family could account for the reduction in aggregate LFPR. The
premise   that fewer men are with spouses in this age group is false. For 45

to 54—year old non—white men, the proportion married spouse—present has remained

a steady 71% in every census since 1940. For both races it has increased from

.78 in 1940 to .84 in 1970. Using more recent CPS survey data for 1964 to

1975, changes in the marital status of 45 to 54—year old non—white males, which

itself shows no strong trend, can account for at most 16% of the variance in

LFPR.

        If the decline in male LFPR is not due to the weakness of the family,

perhaps it is due to the strength of the family. If more women are entering

the labor force, perhaps their husbands can afford to take longer vacations by

dropping out. Once again the premise is incorrect. Among both married and

unmarried non—white 45 to 54—year old women LFPR declined from 1965 to 1974

(U.S. BL.S). In regressions using the 1966 National Longitudinal Survey, wife's

income had no significant effect on husband's LFFR.
                                                                       23




      Perhaps the decline in LFPR we observe today is not the product of

current forces, but rather the fruit of seeds sown long ago. If the mature

man of today was unemployed as a youth, might not the permanent scars reduce

current LFPR? If so we would expect this cohort to have had low LFPR over

its entire life—cycle. Decennial Census data shows this is not true. The 50—

to 54—year olds of 1970 were the 40 to 44—year olds of 1960, and had a LFPR

of 89.9%. This is only 1.2 percentage points less then the LFPR of 40 to

44—year olds in 1950, and only 1.8 percentage points less than the LFPR of 40

to 44—year olds in 1940. The problem is not one of a peculiar cohort that has

always had a weak attachment to the labor force. The drops in LPPR have

occurred across a number of age groups, primarily in the last twenty years.

      This suggests that a more recent event is at the source of our current

problems, perhaps a great occupational or industrial shift like the black exodus

from Southern farm to Northern factory. Such a dislocation could also reduce

LFPR because the grey area between working and not working is more sharply de-

fined once off the family farm. Only 2% of the non—white cohort aged 55 to

64 in 1970 were employed as farmers in 1970 (U.S. Census 1970b, Table 4 ) .   5.6%

of the same cohort were farmers in 1960, and 12.7% in 1950 (U.S. Census 1960,

Table 7). Over the same period this cohort has moved into crafts and service

work and out of non—manufacturing labor. But we have already seen that this

cohort had fairly typical LFPR in 1960. The changes in occupational and

industrial distribution since 1960 out of unskilled physical labor and into

crafts and services do not seem large enough to have "shocked" many men out

of the labor force.
                                                                    24




      The phenomenon of a falling LFPR in response to a disability insurance

program does not appear to be unique to the 13.5. In Canada, the LPPR of

45 to 54—year old men has fallen 2.3 percentage points in the past 7 years

(Statistics Canada, 1972—1979), following the inclusion of disability insurance

in the Canada and Quebec Pension plans in 1970.19 Perhaps the most outstanding

example of this sort is in the Netherlands, where disability insurance has

reached crisis proportions. By 1977, 23% of all insured 50 to 54—year olds,

31% of the 55 to 59—year olds, and 42% of the 60 to 64—year olds were bene-

ficiaries of the Dutch Disability Security Act (Hans Emanuel, p. lO).20

      Social insurance programs for disability seem to have reduced LPPR among

prime age males in the Netherlands and Canada, as well as in the U.S. Other

explanations of the decline in LFPR in the U.S. do not appear to be consistent

with the data.
                                                                      25



V. Conclusion

      The labor force participation rates of prime age males have been decreasing

since 1957 in response to the growth in the number of Social Security Disability

beneficiaries. We have shown that the increase in SSD benefits relative to

earnings can explain roughly half of the increase in beneficiaries and decrease

in labor force participants. The SSD program has acted as an escape hatch out

of the labor force for disabled men. The more generous the benefits and the

poorer labor market conditions, the more attractive the escape hatch. Reducing

unemployment, improving rehabilition efforts among the partially disabled, and

recent legislation to extend Social Security hospital insurance and supplemental

medical insurance to the disabled in the labor force would all be humane ways

of helping these men to continue productive lives. We are left with the disturb-

ing question: why are so many men in a position where the Social Security

Disability program is an appealing alternative?

     The coefficients on the vector of health conditions from equation A are
generally sensible. The most disabling condition, multiple schlerosis, increases
the probability of beneficiary status by 34 percentage points. Since eligibility
benefits has already been allowed for, the coefficients presented below as well as
on all variables that enter the structural wage equation, reflect the effect on
beneficiary status directly as well as indirectly through the prospective wage.

1. I shall not deal with the issue of whether part of the growth of the SSD

     beneficiary roles is fraudulent. Given the law that is essentially a medical

     issue on which i    have neither the data nor the skill to judge. This

     paper   does suggest that it is difficult to determine whether a person is
     totally disabled.
2.   A more equitable indexing system would deflate earnings before computing

     average monthly earnings, then index benefits to correct for inflation.

     Since the present system calculates benefits based on nominal earnings it

     tends to benefit beneficiaries with more recent, highly inflated earnings.

3. Between January, 1971 and September, 1972, the primary insurance amount

     (PIA) was equal to 90.01% of the first $110 of the average monthly wage plus

     32.74% of the next $290, plus 30.59% of the next $150 plus 35.96% of the

     next   $100 plus 20% of the next $100. Balf of the PIA is added for each eli-
     gible dependent, subject to certain individual and family minimums and
     maximums.

4.   There are special eligibility requirements for the blind and those younger

     than   31.
5.   The date of disability determination may precede the date of application

     for benefits, so benefits nay be paid sooner than 5 months after applications.

     Conversations with the Social Security Administration indicated that in

     1979 the shortest wait would probably be 77 days, the average processing time.
                                                                                   31

  6.    In 1970, the leading primary diagnoses among 40 to 49—year old male new

        beneficiaries were chronic ischemic heart disease — 16.2%, schizophrenia —

       8.1%, slipped disc — 6.4%, tuberculosis — 3.4%, and emphysema — 2.5%.

        (See Lerner, p. 27.)

 7.     (See Treitel, p. 11.) lIe also notes the curious fact that the recovery

       rate among SSD recipients has not increased even though the average age has

       declined. He finds in a logit regression that high ratios of benefits to

       predisability earnings significantly reduces the probability of recovery,

       holding health, occupation and other background variables constant.

 8. These termination rates are derived from 1972 data in Social Security

       Bulletin, Tables 67 and 108.

 9..   In cross—section regressions, veteran status increases the probability

       of being out of the labor force. The percentage of veterans among 45

       to 54—year olds has been declining since the l960's as the bulk of World War

       II veterans   passed through this age group. It should also be noted that
       both   Government employees' disability and private disability insurance

       programs reported unusual growth during the 1970's, contributing to the

       decline in LFPR.

10. We assume a discount rate sufficiently high that current income is a sufficient

       indicator of the present value of a stream of income. Note that it is

       probably not in the worker's interest to delay entrance into the SSD program.

       if he is eligible. The average 45 to 49—year old new beneficiary in late

       1972 bad benefits of $201 per month, which corresponds to average yearly

       earnings of $3828. Assuming that the worker had static expectations on the

       benefit computation law, he would have to increase his average yearly earnings

       by 16% if he worked another year in order to increase his benefits by 10%.

       Of course, to increase average yearly earnings by this much earnings in the

       additional year he would have to increase by much more than 16% over the

       previous year; an unlikely prospect.

11. The missing data problem could be dealt with and the coefficient on expected

      wage identified using maximum likelihood techniques as outlined in Criliches,

      Hall and Hausman, but these methods are quite expensive in this application.

12. We underestimate the true effect of SSD benefits. For example, consider

      two men, Smith and Jones, with identical reported characteristics but

      different true levels of disability. Assume only Jones, who is more

      disabled in ways the Social Security Administration can observe but which

      are not recorded in our data, applies for SSD benefits. We use only the

      reported characteristics to infer Smith's eligibility; so we will overestimate

      it. Since expected benefits are simply benefits conditional on eligibility

      times the probability of eligibility, we also overestimate expected SSD

      benefits among non—applicants, biasing the coefficient toward zero.

13. Our data—set includes self—reported disability status. We prefer to use the

      detailed health questions because they invite less self—justification on

      the part of those men out of the labor force. We did not use the health

      vector   to form instrumental variables for disability status in the implicit
      structural wage equation because of the nature of our reduced form estimation
      procedure.
14.   The estimated coefficients are the B from the logistic equation

      p =   l/(l+exp(—   B)).

15. dp/dxB(p)(l—p) in the logistic model: ln(p/1—p)=xB, where p is the mean

      probability of being a beneficiary. The elasticity is equal to B(l—p)

      since benefits are measured in logs. Since the logistic function

      is non—linear, all elasticities are calculated holding the mean values of

      other variables constant, and using mean probabilities.
                                                                               33


16.   It is unlikely that the estimated relation between high SSD benefits and

      the probability of being a beneficiary is just a spurious correlation. When

      the sample is l:Lmited to those who do not know of the program, the coefficient

      becomes weaker and less significant. S:imilarly, high SSD benefits increase

      the probability of being out of the labor force in cross—section estimates,

      but the coefficient becomes weak and insignificant when SSD beneficiaries

      are eliminated from the sample. If all SSD beneficiaries would have been

      out of the labor force in the absence of the SSD program it is unlikely that

      we would observe that the probability of being out of the labor force

      increases with SSD benefits, and that higher expected earnings decrease the

      probability of being a beneficiary.

17. In other regressions it appears that the effect of higher expected benefits

      works mostly through the changes in expected eligibility.

18. The calculation is: A% beneficiaries=.1131*(.40*ALss2_.58*aws), where LSS2

      increased from 4.52 to 5.07 and LW5 increased from 5.98 to 6.08.

19. Decennial census data, though not strictly comparable, shows only a 1.6

      percentage point drop for this same group from 1961 to 1971.

20. Though Dutch disability beneficiaries need not withdraw totally from the

      labor force, most of the older ones do. In 1977, the LFPR for men aged

      60 to 64 was 58.0, a drop of 13.9 percentage points from only 6 years earlier.

      55 to 59—year olds dropped 7 points to 79.9 and 50 and 54—year olds dropped

      4.8 points to 87.8 (I.L.0.).
