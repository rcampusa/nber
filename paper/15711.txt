                                             ABSTRACT

This paper uses international trade data to examine the effects of climate shocks on economic activity.
We examine panel models relating the annual growth rate of a country’s exports in a particular product
category to the country’s weather in that year. We find that a poor country being 1 degree Celsius
warmer in a given year reduces the growth rate of that country’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.7 percentage
points, with no detectable effects in rich countries. We find negative effects of temperature on exports
of both agricultural products and light manufacturing products, with little apparent effects on heavy
industry or raw materials. The results confirm large negative effects of temperature on poor countries’
economies and suggest that temperature affects a much wider range of economic activity than conventionally
thought.

       This paper uses international trade data to examine the effects of climate shocks on

economic activity. At the aggregate level, Melissa Dell, Benjamin F. Jones, and Benjamin A.

Olken (2008) [hereafter, DJO] have demonstrated that higher temperatures in a given year reduce

the growth rate of GDP per-capita, but only in poor countries. The analysis of trade data in this

paper builds on that finding, with three principal motivations. First, international trade links the

fortunes of countries, providing potentially important conduits for geographically limited

climatic impacts to have global economic effects. Second, international trade data is the best

available source for identifying economic activity worldwide separately by narrowly-defined

sectors. Examining international trade data, one can thus say more precisely what sectors are

affected by climatic changes. Finally, the trade data, collected by the importing country,

provides a check on the potentially low-quality national accounts data provided by the home

country.

       Our analysis employs datasets on national climate, exports to the United States, and

exports to the broader world. Using these data, we run panel regressions relating the annual

growth rate of a country’s exports in a particular product category to the country’s weather in

that year (i.e., its average temperature and precipitation). We control flexibly for product-year

interactions (to capture, for example, price or demand changes in a particular product) and

product-country interactions (to capture, for example, the fact that exports of certain products

grow faster in some places than others).

       Using this approach, we find two main results. First, higher temperatures in poor

countries lead to large, negative impacts on the growth of their exports. Depending on the dataset

and specification, we find that a poor country being 1 degree Celsius warmer in a given year

reduces the growth of that country’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.7 percentage points. We find


                                                -1-
no effect on rich countries. These results match the qualitative pattern of temperature effects on

GDP found in DJO (2008). The magnitudes here are larger than the estimated magnitude of

GDP effects in DJO (2008), suggesting a relatively greater sensitivity of national exports.

       Second, we examine the industrial breakdown of the impacts of temperature. We find

substantial loci of negative impacts on agricultural exports and light manufacturing exports, with

little apparent effects on heavy industry or raw materials production. While the negative impact

on agricultural exports is consistent with the primary thrust of the climate-economy literature, the

negative impact on manufacturing may be more surprising. It is, however, consistent with a long-

standing literature emphasizing that factory workers are less productive when it is hot (e.g.,

Ellsworth Huntington 1915), and the findings of DJO (2008), which also found a negative impact

of higher temperatures on industrial output in the national accounts data.

       A further advantage of using export data is that it alleviates concerns about data quality in

poor countries. In particular, authors have recently questioned the validity of poor country GDP

data (e.g., Angus Deaton 2005, Alwyn Young 2009). Since export data (particularly exports to

the United States) is recorded by the importing country (e.g., the United States), and measured

with a high degree of accuracy at the importing ports, export data are likely to be much more

reliable than national accounts data, particularly for poor countries. The fact that we find similar

impacts in the export data as in the national accounts data in DJO (2008) suggests that the effects

we are picking up are, indeed, real effects rather than artifacts of the data.

  I.   Data and Methodology

A. Data
       The historical weather data are taken from the Terrestrial Air Temperature and

Precipitation: 1900-2006 Gridded Monthly Time Series, Version 1.01 (Kenji Matsuura and Cort

Willmott 2007). This data set provides worldwide (terrestrial) monthly mean temperature and
                                                 -2-
precipitation data at 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution (approximately 56km x 56km at the equator).

We use geospatial software to aggregate the weather data to the country-year level, weighting by

the population distribution within the country. More details about the construction of the weather

data can be found in DJO (2008).

       The trade data come from two sources. For the U.S. trade data, we use the NBER U.S.

Import Data (Robert C. Feenstra, John Romalis, and Peter K. Schott 2002). For the World Trade

data, we use the NBER-United Nations Trade Data (Feenstra et al. 2005). We aggregate these

data to either the 1 or 2 SITC digit level. We restrict our attention to those 1 or 2 digit product-

country time series where we observe positive exports in all years of the data from a particular

country, though the results are very similar if we do not make this balanced-panel restriction

(results available on request).

       It is important to note that the variance in export growth is extremely large. Moreover,

the variance in export growth depends sharply on the country and product, with smaller export

volumes tending to be much noisier. For example, the standard deviation of growth of exports to

the world for a country-product time series ranges from a minimum of 5.85 percentage points

(product 11, “beverages”, from Canada) to a maximum of 235 percentage points (product 09,

“miscellaneous edible products”, from Guatemala). A Breusch-Pagan test rejects homoskedastic

export growth for both the US and World trade data at both 1 or 2 digit levels (p<.0001 in all

cases). The empirical analysis below therefore uses Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS)

to adjust for the dramatic heteroskedasticity across the product-country time series in the data.

B. Empirical Methodology
       The estimating equation follows Dell, Jones, and Olken (2008). To estimate the

relationship between weather shocks and growth in international trade, we estimate the following


                                                 -3-
equation, regressing the change in the growth rate of exports of product p from country c on

temperature and precipitation in the exporting country:

    (1)       log                 log



In this specification, the product-country fixed effects,                     , capture fixed differences in the

growth rate of exports of product             from country . The product-year fixed effects,                   , capture

time specific worldwide shocks in trade of product                      (for example, they capture changes in

prices; they also capture common world time effects such as worldwide recessions). The dummy

variable             captures whether the country is in the bottom or top half of the world per-capita

PPP income distribution in the first year GDP data is available, as in DJO (2008). The coefficient

    provides the impact of a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase in year                        on average exports

from wealthy countries, while                    is the impact of a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase in

year on average exports from poor countries.

          Given the substantial heteroskedasticity in export growth rates between products and

countries (see discussion above), we estimate equation (1) by FGLS, weighting each product-

country time series by the inverse variance of its residuals (see William H. Greene, 2003). Given

the large range of variances among series, correcting for heteroskedasticity is important, and

analysis without any such corrections produces noisier and less conclusive estimates.1 Standard

errors are clustered by country to allow for arbitrary serial correlation within countries and to

allow for arbitrary correlation across different exports from the same country. To learn more

about which products are more and less sensitive to temperature, we also estimate equation (1)

1
  Specifically, if we re-estimate Table 1 without weights, the results at the 2-digit level are qualitatively similar to
the weighted results, but are statistically significant only for the world data. The unweighted results at the 1-digit
level are inconclusive (negative and insignificant in the world data and positive and insignificant in the U.S. data).

 II.      Results

A. Overall results
          The results from estimating equation (1) are shown in Table 1. Column (1) shows results

using 1-digit SITC data on exports to the United States (i.e., an observation is the export growth

from country to the United States between time and             1 for a single 1-digit SITC category).

Column (2) presents the same results but using data at the more disaggregated 2-digit SITC level.

Columns (3) and (4) repeat the same specifications, but consider exports from country to all

countries in the world trade data (i.e., to the substantial but ultimately limited set of countries

that report in the Feenstra et al. 2005 data), rather than just exports to the United States.


                                                 -5-
       The results show large, negative effects of higher temperatures on exports from poor

countries, and no effects on exports from rich countries. Focusing on the bottom row of the table,

which reports the total impact of temperature on poor country exports (             ), we see that a 1

degree Celsius temperature increase reduces the export growth rate from poor countries to the

U.S. by between 3.8 percentage points (1 digit SITC data) and 5.7 percentage points (2 digit

SITC data). These effects are statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Looking at all exports

to the world, we also find very large effects – 1 degree Celsius reduces the export growth rate by

between 2.0 percentage points (1 digit, statistically significant at 5 percent) and 2.4 percentage

points (2 digit, statistically significant at 1 percent). The first row of the table shows that we find

no impact of temperature shocks on exports from rich countries. We also find little impact of

average precipitation on exports – the only exception is column (4), which suggests that greater

average precipitation in poor countries leads to more exports in the world data, though this

impact is smaller than the impact of temperature and is not robust to specification.

       The patterns we see here – very large impacts of temperature on poor countries and no

impact on rich countries – mirror precisely the effects seen in Dell, Jones and Olken (2008). This

is particularly remarkable given that the data in this paper – exports – is measured predominantly

by the importing country (i.e., reported by the United States in the case of the exports to the U.S.

data, and primarily by OECD countries for exports to the World), whereas the GDP data

examined in DJO (2008) came from the poor country itself. Given recent criticisms of national

accounts data (e.g., Deaton 2005), the fact that these impacts are showing up in export data

measured by the importing country suggests that these are very much real impacts, and are not

just an artifact of the way GDP data is put together.

       It is interesting to note that the magnitudes estimated here are 2-3 times larger than the


                                                 -6-
estimated impacts of temperature on the growth rate of GDP in DJO (2008), which were on the

order of 1-2 percentage points per degree Celsius. This extra sensitivity is consistent with trade

models in which domestic consumption is relatively steady, so that volatility in domestic

production translates into greater volatility in net exports.2

B. Heterogeneity by Product
        Table 2 reports the results of estimating equation (1) separately for each 2-digit SITC

category of exports to the United States. Each coefficient is the total effect on poor countries (i.e

          from equation (1)), and the listed p-values are from the test of no effect in poor

countries, i.e. the test that               0. To conserve space, we report coefficients only for

products where the effect of temperature is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Panel A

shows SITC codes where the estimated temperate effect is negative and statistically significant;

Panel B shows those SITC codes where the effect is positive and statistically significant.

        The first finding that emerges from Table 2 is that there are many more SITC products

that are negative and statistically significant than positive and statistically significant. Were there

no true relationship, then by random chance one would expect 2.5% of the categories (1.65 out

of 66) to be negative and statistically significant at the 5% level and a similar amount to be

positive and statistically significant. In fact, we find negative and statistically significant impacts

of temperature on exports for 20 out of the 66 categories, consistent with the very large negative

effects shown in Table 1. By contrast, we find positive and statistically significant effects for

only 2 of the 66 categories, or exactly what one would expect from random chance.



2
  For example, consider a model with homothetic preferences (such as Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek) where a country’s
domestic consumption of each good scales linearly with its income. Then shocks to the domestic production of a
subset of goods will cause domestic consumption of each good to change only to the extent that aggregate national
income changes. The net exports of any particular good will thus see greater volatility than domestic output.

       Examining the negative and statistically significant categories, we find that the negative

impacts of temperature seem to fall into two broad categories: agricultural products (e.g., cereals,

dairy products and eggs, leather, feed stuff for animals) and light manufacturing (e.g., photo

equipment, footwear, misc manufactured goods, electrical machinery, rubber manufactures,

(mining, petroleum, wood and pulp) seem generally unaffected. The explanation for agriculture

seems clear (plants and animals may not thrive as well when it is too hot), and is consistent with

negative effects on agriculture in poor countries reported elsewhere (e.g., DJO 2008, Raymond

Guiteras 2009). The negative impacts on manufacturing are perhaps more surprising, and suggest

that factory workers may be less productive when conditions inside the factory become too hot.

This is consistent with the large literature on worker productivity and temperature dating back to

Huntington (1915). It is worth noting, however, that DJO (2008) also find negative impacts on

temperature on industrial GDP growth in poor countries when examining national accounts data,

so the findings in this paper confirm the findings there.

III.   Conclusions

       This paper has examined the impacts of temperature shocks on exports. We find

substantial impacts of higher temperatures on poor countries exports, with no effects on richer

countries’ exports. Specifically, we find that an additional 1 degree Celsius reduces the growth

rate of a poor country’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.6 percentage points. We find that the

impacts are concentrated in exports of agricultural products and light manufactures.

       The findings of this paper have several implications. First, the findings here are

remarkably similar (though greater in magnitude) to the findings that higher temperatures

negatively impact growth of GDP in poor countries, but not in rich countries, reported in Dell

Jones and Olken (2008). The fact that similar results are found in independent data lends

credibility to these estimates. Second, the impact on exports suggests that – even though we

estimate no direct impacts of higher temperatures on rich countries – rich countries may

nonetheless be affected since their imports will decline. Climate change may therefore decrease

welfare in rich countries not by affecting production directly, but by raising prices and reducing


                                                -9-
quantities of goods imported from poorer countries. Analyzing the welfare consequences for rich

countries is one trajectory for further work.
