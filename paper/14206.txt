                                              ABSTRACT

During the contest for Kansas attorney general in 2006, an organization sent out 6 pieces of mail criticizing
the incumbent's conduct in office. We exploit a discontinuity in the rule used to select which households
received the mailings to identify the causal effect of mail on vote choice and voter turnout. We find
these mailings had both a statistically and politically significant effect on the challenger's vote share.
 Our estimates suggest that a ten percentage point increase in the amount of mail sent to a precinct
increased the challenger's vote share by approximately three percentage points. Furthermore, our results
suggest that the mechanism for this increase was persuasion rather than mobilization.

1. Introduction

       Understanding how partisan campaign activity affects vote choice and voter

turnout is a central issue in both political science and economics. If campaign activity

has an independent effect on election outcomes, then the policy preferences of election-

oriented politicians may not perfectly reflect those of the median voter (Baron 1989,

Grossman and Helpman 1994). Estimates of the effect of campaign activity are also

essential to predicting the impact of reforms to the political process such as restrictions

on campaign spending.

       Yet, despite an extensive empirical literature devoted to this topic, the magnitude

of the impact of campaign activity on voters is still unresolved. For several reasons

simple correlations between campaign activity and vote share do not represent a causal

effect. Campaign activity and vote share are both outcomes of a complex process that

depends on many aspects of candidates and elections that are difficult to measure. For

example, if more able candidates attract both more campaign resources and more votes,

and candidate ability is not fully observable, then regression estimates of the effect of

campaign spending on vote share will inevitably reflect some combination of the true

causal effect and unobserved heterogeneity.

       In this paper, we use a regression discontinuity (RD) approach to identify the

effects on campaign activity on turnout and vote share. Although previous papers have

sought to address the endogeneity of campaign activity, none has used RD to do so.

During the contest for Kansas attorney general in 2006, an organization sent out 6 pieces

of mail criticizing the Republican incumbent’s conduct in office. We obtained a complete

record of which households received the mailings as well as the algorithm used to select




                                                  3
the households for inclusion in the universe of households that received the mail. We

also obtained precinct-level candidate vote totals, the lowest level of aggregation at

which candidate choice is observed, and individual level voter turnout records. We

exploit our knowledge of the selection rule to isolate a discontinuity in the targeting

algorithm which resulted in substantially different amounts of mail in otherwise similar

precincts. Our identification strategy compares precinct-level vote shares and individual

turnout decisions in similar precincts that received substantially different amounts of mail

as result of this discontinuity. We find that the 6 piece mail campaign had no effect on

turnout but caused a sizable increase in the vote share of the Democratic challenger.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the previous

literature on the topic. Sections 3 and 4 present the study design and data respectively.

Section 5 describes our econometric model and presents results. Section 6 provides

additional analysis to flesh out the mechanism behind our results in Section 5. Section 7

concludes.



2. Previous Literature

       Jacobson (1985) was the first to use statistical methods to estimate the effect of

campaign spending. Using the then-newly-available FEC data on candidate expenditures

in US House and Senate races, he finds large positive correlations between challenger

spending and challenger vote share, but little relation between incumbent spending and

incumbent vote share.

       This provocative finding spurred researchers in political science and economics to

search for ways to deal with the problem of the endogeneity of campaign activity. One




                                                 4
approach seeks to identify the effect of campaign spending from races in which the same

candidates face each other on repeated occasions (Levitt 1994). Although fixed-effects

models like this hold constant the characteristics of candidates and areas, they remain

vulnerable to bias if spending adjusts to changes in political conditions. Another

approach seeks to use instrumental variables that induce variation in spending but are

uncorrelated with the characteristics of candidates and elections (Green and Krasno 1988,

Gerber 1998, Erikson and Palfrey 2000). Complementing these studies on the effects of

campaign spending are several recent papers employing natural experiments to measure

the effects of mass media communication on voter turnout and candidate choice (e.g.

Gentzkow (2006), George and Waldfogel (2007), DellaVingna and Kaplan (2007)).

However, each of these studies is vulnerable on the familiar grounds that the exclusion

restrictions or modeling details justifying the instrumental variables approach are not

valid.

         A third approach uses randomized field experiments to assess how voters respond

to campaign activity. Most of this work has focused on estimating the effects on turnout

(Gerber and Green 2000; Green and Gerber 2008). According to meta-analysis of dozens

of studies of each of the alternative methods of voter mobilization, door-to-door

canvassing prior to the election often has a large effect on voter turnout, raising turnout

by approximately eight percentage points in a typical election, while phone calls and

mailings have more modest effects. A live phone call from a commercial firm raises

turnout around 0.5 percentage points, a call from a volunteer, two and a half percentage

points, and several pieces of campaign mail boosts turnout by approximately one

percentage point (Green and Gerber 2008).




                                                  5
         Substantially fewer field experiments have been employed to study the effects of

campaign activity on vote share. Although randomized experiments are free from the

biases inherent in the use of observational data, they have other limitations when applied

to the study of voter choice. First, the secret ballot means that individual voters'

candidate choices, unlike their turnout, are not a matter of public record. One response to

this is to randomize mailings at the household-level and measure the effect on vote share

using post election surveys. Gerber (2004) uses this method to study the effect of

campaign activity in a collection of local elections from 1999 and 2000 and finds that

incumbent spending was ineffective while challenger spending was effective. These and

similar studies tend to be small due to the cost of administering post-election surveys and

vulnerable to bias due to high rates of survey non-response.1 An alternative response is to

randomize campaign activity at the precinct level. Gerber (2004) uses this approach to

study the effects of an incumbent’s direct mail campaign in a 2002 US House primary

and general election, and finds large effects on vote share in the primary and no effects in

the general election. While potentially quite promising due to the availability of vote

share at the precinct level, the application of this method is limited by the fact that few

campaigns, particularly those in competitive electoral environments, are willing to

remove a substantial number of precincts from the campaign’s communications efforts.

         In this paper, we use regression discontinuity (RD) methods to avoid some of

these limitations. While we are not the first to apply RD to politics (see, among others,

Lee 2001, Petterson-Lidbom 2006, Ferraz and Finan 2008), we are the first to use RD to

assess the effect of campaign activity on voter choice. Although field experiments

 There are additional concerns that the treatment may affect survey responses, but not vote-choice, or vice-
versa.


                                                         6
require fewer identifying assumptions, RD enjoys several potential advantages in this

context. First, RD is less obtrusive. Campaigns may be reluctant to alter their campaign

plans to produce control groups, while RD merely requires the campaign to keep track of

the rules (and cutoffs) used to determine the campaign targets. This suggests that RD

might be applied to a larger and potentially more representative sample of campaigns.

Second, RD can be applied historically if campaign records can be obtained. Many

campaigns are currently being conducted and treatment assignment rules are held secret.

If the selection rules for the mailings and other campaign activity are preserved, these

campaigns can be a source of valuable information about the effects of campaign activity

once there is no longer a need to maintain secrecy. This holds for all contests, including

competitive races, where political actors might be especially resistant to setting aside

control groups.



3. Study Design

       Our study focuses on the effects of a 6 piece direct mail campaign in the highly

competitive Kansas state attorney general race in the 2006 midterm election. This

election featured a Republican incumbent against a Democratic challenger. The mail,

which was sponsored by the advocacy group Kansans for Consumer Privacy Protection,

informed constituents about the group’s concerns regarding the incumbent’s conduct in

office, suggesting that the incumbent was violating citizens’ privacy by “snooping”

around peoples’ medical records rather than fighting crime. The mailings, which featured

pictures of a variety of dogs to illustrate the snooping theme, are included in the

appendix. The mailings were sent every two or three days in the final two weeks before




                                                 7
the election to a selected set of households with at least one registered voter in a subset of

Congressional districts. Households received either one set of mailings or no mailings,

regardless of how many registered voters resided there. We consider a voter to have

received mail if anyone in his or her household received mail.

       The vendor sent mail to a voter according to a function of three groups of

variables: the background characteristics of each of the registered voters in the

household, including party registration, gender, voting history, time since registration,

and other demographic characteristics; responses to a phone survey designed to exclude

from the mailing registered voters who stated that they were committed to voting for a

specific candidate; and the voter's location in a census block in which more than 5.08131

percent of the households had incomes greater than $150,000. We observe the variables

in the first and third group, but do not observe responses to the phone survey.

       Simple least-squares estimates of the Democratic challenger's vote share on the

proportion of registered voters in a precinct receiving mail are likely to be inconsistent.

The probability of receiving mail is positively correlated with voters' background

characteristics, phone survey responses, and census-block income levels, all of which

might also be correlated with voting behavior. However, the pseudo-random experiment

created by the discontinuity in the targeting rule allows us to estimate the causal effect of

mail by comparing precincts that contain census blocks with incomes just above the

income threshold with those precincts that contain census blocks just below the income

threshold.

       We develop an instrumental variable (IV) specification based on a fuzzy

regression discontinuity design (Hahn, Todd, and Vand der Klaauw, 2001) to identify the




                                                  8
causal effect of mail on election outcomes. Because census block demographic

discontinuities are common in political targeting formulas, we generate a specification

that can be applied generally to problems of this type. Although census block and

precinct boundaries are drawn independently, the geographic clustering of mail in certain

census blocks also resulted in the clustering of mail in certain precincts. The share of

voters in a precinct receiving mail thus varied depending on the weighted average of the

census-block incomes for all census blocks contained in the precinct. The fuzzy

regression discontinuity design takes advantage of the fact that living in a precinct

containing a census block above the income threshold increases the probability of

receiving mail; however, unlike with a sharp discontinuity, it does not determine

treatment status. We use the fact that the vendor informed us whether they would have

sent each voter mail, had the voter lived in a census block that met the income threshold.

We refer to this variable as the mail eligibility of a voter. The first stage of our IV

regression estimates the effect on the share of voters in a precinct receiving mail of an

increase in the share of voters residing in census blocks just above the income threshold,

holding constant the share of voters in the precinct who are mail eligible. The second

stage regression then estimates the effect of this variation in the share of voters receiving

mail on the vote share of the Democratic challenger.

       The exclusion restriction necessary to ensure the consistency of the IV estimate is

that precincts containing census blocks with incomes just above the income threshold are

similar to precincts containing census blocks just below the income threshold, but for

their probability of receiving mail given the control variables in the second stage. To




                                                  9
enhance the validity of this exclusion restriction, we restrict our analysis to those

precincts that contain census blocks in a small window around the income threshold.

       Because we are using a quasi-experiment rather than a randomized experiment,

we can not be certain that the probability of receiving mail is orthogonal to unobservable

determinants of vote share. We therefore develop an estimation framework that attempts

to isolate the effect of mail from any pre-treatment differences in those precincts

containing census blocks just above versus just below the income threshold. We use a

difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) specification to allow for the possibility

that unobserved determinants of support for the Democratic challenger were somehow

correlated with the receipt of mail.

       To implement our DDD specification we first take the difference in the vote share

of the 2006 Democratic attorney-general candidate in those precincts with voters in

census blocks just above versus just below the income threshold. We then compare this

difference to the difference in the same precincts in the 2002 attorney-general race. This

is designed to capture pre-treatment differences in the support for Democratic attorney-

general candidates in precincts containing census blocks just above versus just below the

income threshold.    We also estimate the same difference-in-difference for a “control”

race that was not subject to the income threshold used in the attorney-general race. This

control difference-in-difference is design to capture changes in the general tendency to

vote Democratic across time in precincts with voters just above and just below the

income threshold. We then take the difference in the difference-in-difference in the

attorney-general and the “control” race to get our DDD estimate of the effect of mail.

4. Data

         We use two sources of data. We use precinct-level election returns from the state

attorney general, gubernatorial, and secretary of state races from the 2006 election. We

also obtain precinct-level returns from the state attorney general, gubernatorial, and

secretary of state races from the 2002 election to control for the pre-treatment political

preferences of each precinct's registered voters.

         Second, we match to this file to precinct-level summaries of an individual-

registrant level voter file obtained directly from the mail vendor. The voter file contains

all of the variables used by the vendor to select households to receive mail and the

turnout of each household's registered voters in the 2006 election. As discussed above,

the vendor sent mail according to the income of the voter's census block and the voter's

mail eligibility.

         Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for a selected set of these characteristics. The

Secretary of State’s office reports election results for 2,711 precincts in the targeted

Congressional Districts. After eliminating precincts because the precincts used in the

vendor’s voter file did not match those used by the Secretary of State’s office, because

precinct boundaries changed over time, or because individual vote history was

unavailable, we are left with a final sample of 1731 precincts.2

         Table 2 illustrates the identification strategy and our basic result. The first row of

the table reports vote shares from precincts that had at least 10 percent of voters that were

2
  We exclude 293 precincts, covering 8.1 percent of registrants, because the precincts in the vendor’s file
did not match those used by the Secretary of State’s office. We exclude 383 more precincts, covering 25.8
percent of registrants, because precinct boundaries change between 2002 and 2006. We exclude an
additional 109 precincts, covering 2.8 of registrants, because we don’t have either 2002 or 2006 vote
history. Finally in 265 precincts we need to consolidate two or more precincts into a single observation in
order to match between the vendor’s file and the Secretary of State’s files. These 265 precincts are
collapsed down to 70 observations.

mail eligible and from census blocks with 5.08131-8.08131 percent of households

earning more than $150,000.3 In the 77 precincts that met these conditions, 16.8 percent

of voters received mail. The second row of the table reports vote shares for precincts that

had at least 10 percent of voters that were mail eligible and from census blocks just below

the income threshold -- that is, from census blocks with 2.08131-5.08131 percent of

households earning more than $150,000. In the 337 precincts that met these conditions,

7.5 percent of voters received mail.

         Column (1) in Table 2 reports the vote shares in the 2006 attorney general

election in precincts just above and just below the income threshold. It shows that in the

77 precincts just above the income threshold, the Democratic candidate received 55.0

percent of the vote compared to 54.5 in 337 precincts just below the income threshold. If

we assume that there were no pre-treatment differences in precincts just above and just

below the income threshold, we can estimate the percentage point change in the level of

the Democratic attorney-general candidate's vote share caused by the receipt of mail, by

taking the difference in the vote share received in precincts just above and just below the

income threshold. The single-difference estimate of the effect of mail is thus

         D = 55.0 – 54.5 = 0.5 percentage points (standard error 1.4).

         Of course, precincts are not randomly assigned to be just above or just below the

income threshold; therefore there may be some pre-treatment differences in the likelihood

of choosing the Democratic attorney-general candidate.4 Column (2) shows the vote

  In this section we will refer to these precincts as precincts just above or below the income threshold, even
though technically the income threshold is a property of a census block, and not a precinct.
4
  Later in the paper we compare the party registration, mail eligibility, and the gender of registrants for the
414 precincts that are used to construct Table 2. There are important differences in precincts above and
below the income threshold; for example, precincts getting more mail had substantially more Republicans
and fewer Democrats.

share of Democratic attorney-general candidate in 2002, when no mail was sent, for

precincts above and below the income threshold. We use the 2002 results to calculate a

2002 analog to D, which captures the pre-treatment “placebo” effect of mail. We find in

2002 that the Democratic attorney-general candidate received 46.9 percent of the vote in

precincts just above the income threshold, which is 1.6 percentage points less than the

48.5 percent of the vote received in precincts just below the income threshold. If we

assume that these differences in the support for the Democratic attorney-general

candidate in precincts above and below the income threshold are time invariant then DD,

the difference-in-difference estimate of the causal effect of mail, is:

       DD = ((55.0 – 54.5) – (46.9 – 48.5)) =

                             2.1 percentage points (standard error 1.3).

       The difference-in-difference estimate allows voter preferences for Democratic

attorney-general candidates in the precincts just above and just below the income

threshold to differ. However, it assumes that any differences in preference for

Democratic attorney general candidates in precincts just above and just below the income

threshold are constant across time. This assumption may be problematic if precincts just

above the income threshold became more or less Democratic in general between 2002

and 2006 than those just below the income threshold. The remainder of Table 2 explores

the possibility that precincts above and below the income threshold differed in their

general tendency to vote Democratic across time. In columns (3) and (4) we investigate

how precincts just above and just below the income threshold differed in their voting

patterns in the 2002 and 2006 gubernatorial race.     To do this, we calculate the

difference-in-difference effect of mail in the gubernatorial race, which was not subject to




                                                 13
a mailing with an income discontinuity in either 2002 or 2006. Under the assumption

that the differential preference for Democratic candidates across time in precincts just

above and just below the income threshold is constant across offices, the gubernatorial

race provides a counterfactual of the change in Democratic attorney-general vote share in

precincts just above and just below the income threshold absent any mail. Contrary to

what we would expect if precincts just above the income threshold became more

Democratic between 2002 and 2006, we find that the trend in gubernatorial vote shares

declined by -0.3 percentage points (standard error 0.9).

        The final row of the table presents the DDD effect of mail: the difference in

Democratic votes shares in precincts just above versus just below the income threshold,

in the 2006 versus the 2002 elections, for the attorney general versus governor. To

estimate the difference-in-difference-in-difference effect of mail we subtract the placebo

difference-in-difference effect we observe in the governor race from the difference-in-

difference effect we observe in the attorney-general race. The DDD estimate of the effect

of mail is thus:

        DDD = ((55.0 – 54.5) – (46.9 – 48.5)) – ((54.6 – 57.2) – (51.0 – 53.4))

                        = 2.4 percentage points (standard error 1.1).

        This effect is quite substantial in political terms. Given that the difference in the

share of households receiving mail in the two sorts of precincts is 9.3 percentage points

(= 0.168 - 0.075), this implies the average treatment-on-the-treated effect of mail was

about 25.8 percentage points. This suggests that a moderately intensive down ballot

direct-mail effort can persuade enough voters to alter the result of a close election.




                                                  14
        Table 3 suggests that the DDD estimate of the effect of mail from Table 2 is not

an artifact of voter preferences for the particular “control” office we selected to construct

the DDD. This might occur, for example, if the relationship between income and

preference for Democratic candidates were stronger in up-ballot races such as governor

as compared to down-ballot elections like attorney-general or secretary of state. In both

the 2002 and 2006 elections, the vote shares for the Democratic secretary of state were

smaller in the precincts just above versus just below the income threshold. Moreover,

there was greater relative support for the Democratic secretary of state candidate in

“control” precincts than “treatment” precincts in 2006 than 2002. This suggests using

vote shares from the election for secretary of state, rather than vote shares from the

election for governor, would not change our results. We explore this hypothesis in

greater detail in the econometric models that follow.



5. Econometric Model and Results

Model

        The results above suggest that receipt of mail may have had large effect on voting

behavior in the 2006 Kansas attorney-general race. In this section we develop an

econometric model to formalize the assumptions necessary to identify this effect. We

model the share of votes received by the Democratic candidate in race r = (attorney

general, governor) or (attorney general, secretary of state) and precinct p = (1, …, P) at

year t = (2002, 2006), Srpt. Vote share Srpt depends on (race × year)-specific constant

voter is mail eligible, registered Democratic, registered Republican, female, and the

percentage of households in the voter's census block with incomes above $150,000. The

vector function gp(Ω) returns 14 variables defined at the precinct level: the share of

voters who are mail eligible, registered Democratic, registered Republican, and female,

Xp; a cubic polynomial in the estimated proportion of residents in a precinct who have

                                                 ∑R

voters in precinct p who live in census block b; interaction terms between Xp and this

cubic polynomial; and two additional variables g1p and g2p. The variables g1p and g2p

partition the precinct level variable mail eligible into sections defined by census-block

income to capture nonlinearities in the relationship between census block income and

mail eligibility. They measure the share of voters from high- and moderate-income

census blocks who are mail eligible (the omitted category is of voters from low-income

census blocks who are mail eligible):


home counties and media markets to account for home-town candidate preferences that may cause
differentials within precincts in Democratic vote shares across the two races.

  gp(.) is a function of voter-level variables because the determinants of the Democratic candidate's vote
share can not be written as a function of precinct-level summaries of the elements of Ω; the vendor's
targeting rule depended on interactions at the voter level between mail eligibility and census-block income.


                                                                16
        g1p = share of voters who are from a census block with more than (5.08131 + s)
               percent of residents with incomes above $150,000 AND are mail eligible

and
        g2p = share of voters who are from a census block with percent of residents with
               incomes above $150,000 between (5.08131 - s) and (5.08131 + s) AND
               are mail eligible

where s = 1, 2, or 3.

        For the reasons discussed above, simple OLS estimates of (1) are likely to be

inconsistent: mp explicitly depends on Ip and implicitly on εrpt (because of the unobserved

phone survey). We therefore write mp as a function of a constant term θ0, a vector

function hp(.), and an error term ωp:

                                 m p = θ 0 + h p (Ω)θ 2 + ω p .

        To estimate (1) by instrumental variables, we impose the exclusion restriction that

mail-eligible voters from census blocks with just more than the threshold share of

households earning above $150,000 have the same propensity to vote for a Democratic

candidate as mail-eligible voters from census blocks with just less than the threshold

share of these households. We implement this identification strategy with the following

specification of h(.):

                                    h(Ω) = [g(Ω) | h1p] ,

where

        h1p = share of voters who are from a census block with percent of residents with
               incomes above $150,000 between 5.08131 and (5.08131 + s) AND are
               mail eligible

        The vector functions g(.) and h(.) are specified to make this exclusion restriction

as weak as possible. By including a cubic polynomial of Ip in g(.), we attempt to capture

any possible direct effects of census-block income on voters' propensity to choose



                                                  17
Democratic candidates. Interacting the cubic polynomial of Ip with Xp in g(.) allows the

effects of the covariates, most importantly mail eligibility, to vary with the income-level

of the precinct.

           The inclusion of g1p and g2p in g(.) allows for the possibility that mail eligibility

and census-block income interact to affect the probability of voting Democratic in some

way that is not captured by the precinct-level interactions between Ip and Xp. By including

g1p and g2p, identification is reduced to the condition that after controlling for Xp, the

cubic polynomial of Ip, and the interaction of Xp and the cubic polynomial of Ip, the

interactive effect between census-block income and mail eligibility does not change over

the interval (5.08181 – s, 5.08181 + s). The exclusion of h1p from g(.) only assumes that

mail-eligible voters from census blocks with between 5.08131 and 5.08131 + s percent of

households earning more than $150,000 have the same propensity to vote Democratic,

conditional on observables, as voters from census blocks with between 5.08131 - s and

5.08131 percent of high-income households. We vary the size of the window s to

investigate the sensitivity of our results to the scope of our exclusion restriction.



Results

          Table 4 presents IV estimates of the effect of the proportion of registered voters

receiving mail on Democratic vote shares for attorney general and the control race in

2002 and 2006. The table reports estimates of four parameters: the effect of mail on the

vote share in the control race in 2002, α1; the differential effect of mail on the attorney

general race in 2002, β1; the differential effect of mail on the control race in 2006, δ1; and

the differential effect of mail on the attorney general race in 2006, φ1. The regressors




                                                   18
underlying the first three of these parameters are meant to capture heterogeneity in voter

preferences correlated with a precinct receiving mail but not due to the causal effect of

mail: indeed, there can be no causal effect of the mail on the any of the 2002 elections,

because the mail was not sent until four years later. The parameter of interest in this

model is φ1, which is the IV analogue of the DDD estimate from Table 2. Standard errors

allowing for arbitrary within-precinct correlation of the error term εrpt are in parentheses.

         Table 4 shows that the IV estimate of the effect of mail is, if anything, larger than

the DDD effect in Table 2. Column (1) of the Table presents estimates from the IV

model that is the closest analogue to Table 2 -- one that uses the governor's race as a

control and uses a window of 3 percentage points around the income discontinuity (s =

3). In that specification, a 10 percentage point increase in the share of voters receiving

mail leads to a 3.34 percentage point increase in difference in the share of votes for the

Democratic candidate for attorney general versus the Democratic candidate for governor,

in the 2006 versus the 2002 election (standard error 1.97 percentage points). Substituting

the secretary of state race for the gubernatorial race (column (2)) gives a similar estimate

of 3.62 percentage points, but does lead to a slight decline in its standard error (standard

error 1.58 percentage points).7

         Columns (3) - (6) of Table 4 present results from models that use a smaller

window around the income discontinuity. By using a smaller window, these models

impose a weaker exclusion restriction; they reduce the income range of precincts that are

assumed to be otherwise conditionally similar in their preference for the Democratic

candidate for attorney general in 2006. Shrinking the window used to identify the IV


7
  The standard errors in the Secretary of State’s race are likely lower because the same two candidates race
in both 2002 and 2006.

effect leads it to decline slightly in magnitude and statistical significance, but does not

alter our basic result. The smallest estimated effect of mail that we obtain, based on a

model with a window size of s = 1 and the secretary of state as the control race (column

(6)), still implies that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of voters receiving mail

leads to a 2.49 percentage point increase in the differential vote share for candidate of

interest (standard error 1.42).

       The fifth row of the table presents the p-value of the test of the hypothesis that the

effect of mail on the level of the Democratic vote share for attorney general in 2006

equals zero (i.e, h0: α1 + β1 + δ1 + φ1 = 0). Each of the coefficients β1, δ1, φ1 represent an

effect of mail on some difference in vote shares, either over time or across races; the sum

of α1, β1, δ1, and φ1 represent the total effect of mail on the level of the Democratic vote

share in the race of interest. Except in models that use the smallest window around the

income discontinuity, the effect of mail on the level of vote share is positive and

statistically distinguishable from zero.



6. Identifying the Mechanism for the Change in Vote Share

       In the previous section, we showed that a direct mail campaign that criticized the

Republican incumbent attorney general increased voters' propensity to vote for the

Democratic challenger for that office relative to their propensity to vote for the

Democratic candidate for governor. There could be two possible reasons for such a

causal effect. The first is that receiving the direct mail persuaded individuals who were

already going to turnout to switch for whom they voted. The second is that receiving the

direct mail persuaded individuals who supported the Democratic attorney general




                                                  20
candidate to turnout to vote. In this section, we investigate whether there is any evidence

for the second possibility.

       Estimating the effect of mail on turnout is more straightforward than estimating

the effect of mail on vote share because we observe at the individual level both whether

an individual received mail and whether s/he turned out to vote. Formally, for each

registered voter j = 1, … , N in precinct p = (1, …, P) at year t = (2002, 2006) we specify

turnout Tjpt, as a function of precinct-level fixed effects, λ0P and π0P; whether the voter

received mail in the 2006 elections, mjp; a vector function gjp(Ω) of the characteristics Ω

of voters and census blocks; and an error term εjpt:

        T jpt = λ0P + λ1m jp + g jp (Ω)λ 2 +
                                                                                       (2)
                YEAR2006 t (π 0P + π 1m jp + g jp (Ω)π 2 ) + ε jpt

In this model, the vector function gjp(.) is defined analogously to the function gp(.) in the

precinct-level model, except that all elements are returned at the individual or census

block level. For the same reasons as in the precinct-level model of vote share, OLS

estimates of the effect of mail on turnout are likely to be inconsistent. We therefore write

mjp as a function of precinct fixed-effects ρ0P, a vector function hjp(.), and an error term

ωjp:

                               m jp = ρ op + θ 0 + h jp (Ω)θ1 + ω p

       Analogously to the case before, to estimate (2) by instrumental variables, we

impose the exclusion restriction that mail-eligible voters from census blocks with just

more than the threshold share of households earning above $150,000 have the same

propensity to vote for a Democratic candidate as mail-eligible voters from census blocks




                                                    21
with just less than the threshold share. We do this by defining the vector function h(.)

analogously to the precinct-level model.

        Table 5 presents IV estimates of the effect of mail on turnout, λ1 and π1 from

equation (2). As in table 4, standard errors allowing for arbitrary within-precinct

correlation of the residuals are in parentheses. In contrast to the estimates in table 4, the

effect of persuasive mail on turnout is neither statistically nor politically significant.

Using the smallest possible window around the discontinuity (column (3)), the point

estimate of the effect of mail on turnout in 2006, over and above the "control" or

"placebo" effect of mail in 2002, π1, is 0.023, which implies that a 10 percent increase in

the likelihood of receiving mail would have at most a 0.2 percent effect on turnout. A

turnout effect of this magnitude can not explain the finding in the previous section.

There, a 10 percent increase in the proportion of registered voters receiving mail led to an

increase in vote share of approximately 3 percentage points -- more than ten times as

much. Even assuming a turnout effect equal to the upper bound of the 95 percent

confidence interval of the estimate from column (3) can explain only a very small portion

of the effect of mail on vote share. At least for the experiment we evaluate here, the

effect of mail on voting appears to come through persuasion of individuals who were

already going to turnout to switch for whom they voted.



7. Conclusion

        To explore the importance of campaign activity on political outcomes, we

estimate the effect of a series of direct mailings on voter turnout and candidate choice in

the 2006 Kansas attorney general race. We find that mailings sent criticizing the




                                                  22
Republican incumbent had both a statistically and politically significant effect on his vote

share. Our estimates suggest that a ten percentage point increase in the amount of mail

sent to a precinct increased the Democratic challenger’s vote share by about three

percentage points. Furthermore, we find no evidence that these mailings affected turnout.

As a result, we conclude that these mailings persuaded individuals who were already

going to turnout to switch for whom they voted.

       These effects are quite large. By comparison, in a meta-analysis of field

experiments, Green and Gerber (2008) find that several pieces of direct mail increase

turnout by about one percentage point. There is only limited evidence on the persuasive

effects of direct mail campaigns, but previous studies find much smaller effects than

those reported in tables 2 and 4 (Gerber 2004). A number of factors might account for

this difference. First, these are estimates and one standard deviation is approximately

40%-50% of the size of the measured effect. Although we reject the hypothesis that the

true effect is zero, we can not reject the hypothesis that the true effect is materially lower

than the point estimate. Second, the particular race we study is a down-ballot race; it was

not the primary race mobilizing voters to the polls. Direct mail likely has a larger

potential effect in such environment than in a presidential race where voters are much

better informed about the issues. Third, the local-average treatment effect we estimate

only applies to so-called "mail eligible" voters -- namely, those who were predetermined

by the vendor to be particularly susceptible to persuasion; mail almost surely would be

less effective in the population at large.

       The magnitude of our estimate might also be evidence of spillover effects, or

social interaction among voters. Our treatment effects are estimated at the precinct level




                                                  23
and may reflect changes in households that were not send mail but live in a precinct

where the mailings were concentrated. Even if such spillover effects are only half as large

as direct effects, each treated household influences one other household through social

interactions, and for simplicity the effects of such additional communications are linearly

additive and confined to the precinct, then social interactions would account for one-third

of the magnitude of the total effect. Designing an experiment or formulating a structural

model that could distinguish between direct and spillover effects of voter persuasion is an

important area for future research.

       Although our study is of a single direct mail campaign, the method we propose

for analyzing campaign communications is general and can be applied to other situations

where there exist geographic discontinuities in targeting formulas. Because this method

can be applied retroactively, it may permit scholars to analyze elections that have already

occurred. RD is likely to be acceptable to a broader set of campaigns than randomized

experimentation, which requires setting aside randomized control groups. RD analysis

may therefore represent a complementary methodology to field experiments in learning

how and when campaign activity affects citizens’ voting behavior.
