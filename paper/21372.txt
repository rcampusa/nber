Military Officer Quality in the All-Volunteer Force

                                             ABSTRACT

We show a statistically significant and quantitatively meaningful decline in the intelligence of Marine
Officers from 1980 to 2014 as measured by their scores on the General Classification Test (GCT)
which has been shown to be a good predictor of success in the military. This contrasts with the increasing
quality of enlisted personnel since 1973 when conscription ended. We argue that the source of this
decline is the greater number of young Americans in college since Marine officers must have a four-year
degree. The increasing diversity of the pool of incoming officers has not contributed to the decline
in GCT scores.

    I.      Introduction

         The question of “Who serves when not all serve?” has been a central issue in

the all-volunteer United States military, even before the end of conscription in

1973.1 Advocates for the end of the peace-time draft argued conscription was, in the

words of Milton Friedman, “inequitable and arbitrary, seriously interfer[ing] with

the freedom of young men to shape their lives.”2 Others, however, were concerned

with the potential quality of an all-volunteer force.3 Given the strong link between

intelligence and job performance, the military has measured the quality of its

enlisted force by their scores of intelligence tests. While the military services

initially faced challenges in attracting high-quality enlisted personnel, the problems

seemed to have been resolved by the late 1980s. Bernard Rostker, one of the

foremost experts on military manpower analysis, declared in his 2006 RAND

monograph I Want You that “the alternative to the draft, the all-volunteer force, has

been a resounding success for the American military and the American people.”4

Even during the most trying years of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, around 60

percent of new recruits were deemed “high-quality,” possessing a high school

diploma and being above the average intelligence of the American population

(compared to a low of 27.1 percent of new recruits deemed high-quality in 1977).

        The success of the volunteer military in attracting high quality enlisted

recruits, however, does not necessarily carry over with respect to its ability to

attract high-quality officers.5 Commissioned officers comprise about 16 percent of

the military, but they make up its leadership and exert a disproportionate impact

on military effectiveness. The importance of the intellectual capability of officers is

explicitly stated in the foundational Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication 1 (1997)

     “A leader without either interest in or knowledge of the history and theory
     of warfare—the intellectual content of the military profession—is a leader in
     appearance only. Self-directed study in the art and science of war is at least
     equal in importance to maintaining physical condition and should receive at
     least equal time. This is particularly true among officers; after all, the mind
     is an officer's principal weapon.” (p. 64)

There is anecdotal evidence of a decline of intelligence in the officer corps; Major

John Jordan writes in the Marine Corps Gazette in 2014

     “A frequent topic of discussion in the pages of the Marine Corps Gazette is
     the difficulty of developing critical thinking skills in Marine Officers. The
     persistence of this theme implies that these essential skills are not as
     prevalent as they need to be; in fact, most Marines could easily point to
     examples of officers of any grade who seemingly lack these faculties.”6

There is also deep concern about the consequences of this lack of critical thinking

skills among the officer corps in a military that increasingly emphasizes “maneuver

warfare” in which control is decentralized and in which junior officers must have a

command of technical skills, be sensitive to the social environment and culture in

which he or she is deployed, and plan and implement complex operations.7


5 In the American military, officers are said to receive a commission for service rather than enlisting. Enlisted
personnel can be promoted to be non-commissioned officers, but these positions are distinct from those of
commissioned officers (who are simply called officers, the term we will henceforth use in this paper).

     Up until now, however, there has been no systematic study of trends in officer

intelligence, nor of what factors are most influential on the average intelligence of

incoming officers. In this paper, we show that the intelligence of officers in the

Marines, as measured by scores on the General Classification Test (GCT), a test

that all officers take, has steadily and significantly declined since 1980.8 For

example, the GCT score in 1980 that demarcated the lower one-third of new officers

that year demarcated the lower two-thirds of the new officers in 2014. While 85

percent of those taking the test in 1980 exceeded 120, the cut-off score for Marine

officers in World War 2,9 only 59 percent exceeded that score in 2014. At the upper

end of the distribution, 4.9% of those taking the test scored above 150 in 1980

compared to 0.7% in 2014. This negative trend could contribute to adverse

consequences for military effectiveness and national security.

        We also examine the relationship between the annual averages of these test

scores and the size and composition of the pool of potential officers (i.e., college

graduates), labor market conditions, and the ethnic, racial and gender composition

of incoming officers. We find that the dominant correlate to the declining GCT

scores over time is the expansion of the pool of potential officers as the ranks of

college graduates has risen over the past three decades. There is no evidence that

the increasing proportion of women or African Americans in the ranks of incoming

officers are independent causes of the decrease in test scores, and while in some

Recruits who took General Classification Test (GCT) from 1980 to 2014. The data provided do not include any
individual level characteristics, such as race or gender, in order to preserve privacy for the test takers.

specifications there is a significant effect of the proportion of incoming Hispanic

officers on these scores, largely because of the rapid increase of Hispanics attending

college, the quantitative effect of this on the average GCT is very small,

representing only about 5 percent of the decline; the other 95 percent is due to the

expansion of the pool of non-Hispanic college students.

      The next section of this paper traces the history of intelligence testing by the

American military in the 20th century. This section also includes a brief discussion

of America’s return to an All-Volunteer Force in 1973. Section III presents our

analysis of the GCT individual-level data that shows a steady and significant

decline in the mean scores across the period 1980 to 2014 as well as a significant

shift in the distribution of the scores. Section IV presents a regression analysis of

the partial correlates of annual mean test scores with the characteristics of the

potential pool of officer candidates, the gender, racial, and ethnic characteristics of

the candidates, and labor market and other factors that could potentially affect the

quality of incoming officers and, therefore, the GCT scores. We offer some

concluding comments in Section V.

      II.      The General Classification Test

            The military developed new intelligence tests at the beginning of World War

II in order to classify incoming servicemen during the huge buildup of forces. The

Army General Classification Test (initially called the AGCT to distinguish it from

the Navy’s test, but subsequently called simply the GCT) was given to all entering

service members due to its utility in sorting initial entrants into the military. By

the end of the war, over 12 million men and women had taken this test. The GCT

was designed to have a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 20 (standard

IQ tests have standard deviations of 15). Those who took the test were placed in

one of five categories, with Category I being those with the highest scores. In a

1946 Science article, one of the creators of the test, Walter V.D. Bingham, stated

that the average score for college graduates was 130, which was the lower boundary

for a test-taker to place in Category I.

            The link between intelligence, as measured by the GCT, and military

performance was systematically studied during World War II. Research found that

enlisted soldiers in Category IV or V (those with GCT scores below 90) were not able

to learn at the same pace as soldiers of average mental ability, and Special Training

Units were established to prepare these men for basic training.10 Studies also

showed that the GCT was a powerful tool for predicting officer performance in basic

training. In World War II, enlistees in the army without a college degree who

scored above 110 on the GCT were considered for Officer Candidate School (OCS),


10   Bingham (1947).


                                              5
which was used to train and screen potential officers (those with a four-year college

degree could be commissioned without taking the GCT). A candidate’s GCT score

was found to be highly correlated with his or her success at OCS.11 In fact, there

was much debate about whether 110 was a sufficiently high minimum score for

enlistees to enroll in OCS since most of the failures at that school were from

candidates who scored between 110 and 115.12

        The GCT had been replaced by the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude

Battery (ASVAB) by the time the All-Volunteer Force (AVF) began in 1973 for all

branches of the services. Out of all the services, the GCT is only still administered

in the Marine Corps, and there only to officers. The GCT was found to be highly

predictive of officers’ success at The Basic School, a six-month training course that

all new Marine officers take in Quantico, Virginia.13 While the importance of the

GCT in deciding a young officer’s Military Occupational Specialty has declined,

those who take it continue to treat it as a serious and important requirement.14

         All candidates to become officers in the Marines, except those coming from

the Naval Academy, must complete Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Quantico,

Virginia, as well as completing a four-year Bachelor degree.15 There are several

programs that may take an aspiring officer candidate to OCS, such as the Reserve

Officer Training Corps (ROTC) or the Platoon Leader’s Class (PLC).
11 Palmer (1948).
12 The minimum score for Marine Officers in World War 2 was 120: (Nalty and Moody, 1970)
13 Stoloff (1983).
14 Anecdotally, one of the authors can attest to the seriousness with which it was taken when he was a

lieutenant at The Basic School in 2009; it is hard to find a group of young people quite as earnest and
competitive as new Marine lieutenants.
15 Graduates of the Naval Academy typically represent around 15% to 20% of each year’s group of new Marine

officers.


                                                     6
OCS represents the primary screening tool for Marine officers, with grades

determined through a combination of physical fitness, academic, and leadership

evaluations. There is usually a 40% attrition rate at OCS. Failure is not often due

to academic evaluations; in fact, academic talent is not a good predictor of success at

OCS.16 Rather, most failures come from orthopedic injuries that arise because of

the physical intensity of the course, or from failures to exhibit leadership.17 Those

candidates that successfully complete OCS are commissioned as second lieutenants

upon receipt of their Bachelor’s degree (or upon completion of OCS if they already

have their degree). One could offer a simple formula for creating a Marine officer in

the years of the AVF: OCS completion + 4-year Bachelor’s degree = an officer.

         After commissioning, all Marine officers go to a six-month course called The

Basic School (TBS) in Quantico, Virginia. Newly-commissioned lieutenants

attending The Basic School learn infantry tactics and general knowledge about the

Marine Corps. It is here that lieutenants take the GCT, at a consistent time in

their careers and in a consistent environment (as opposed to, say, being

administered by a recruiter in varying conditions). The Basic School is an

academically intense experience, and success there is strongly predicted by a

lieutenant’s score on the GCT.18




16 Stoloff (1983).
17 If a candidate fails five academic tests, then they are supposed to fail the course. According to Stoloff (1983),
however, this rarely happens. Anecdotally, when one of the authors was at OCS, a few candidates failed five
tests but were prevented from being kicked out by instructors who placed a high value on physical fitness. A
similar result has been found for Army Officer Candidate School (Allen, Bynum, Oliver, Russell, Young, and
Babin, 2014).
18 Stoloff (1983)

        The GCT provides a valuable source of consistently normed test data; unlike

the ASVAB, which is normed every 15-20 years, and the SAT, for which there are

different versions given every year, the data from the GCT can be compared across

years because the questions remain the same and the scores are not re-normalized.

Along with consistency, another reason to consider the GCT is relevance. According

to the 2009 version of the Marine Corps Order on Testing, “…the GCT is generally

used as a metric for measuring the intellectual health of the officer corps.” 19 The

intellectual health of junior officers is especially important in the military because

there is no lateral entry into mid-level management positions and there is an “up or

out” promotion system. This means that the military pays a premium in order to

attract especially high quality junior officers, as the most senior leaders in twenty

years must be chosen from amongst them.20 Additionally, it has been shown that

more intelligent officers themselves benefit more from the mentoring of successful

senior officers.21 If the ‘intellectual health’ of new officers suffers, it affects the

military not just in the short term, but for a long time. In the next section, we

investigate the evolution of this health over the past 35 years.

    III. GCT Scores, 1980 to 2014

    We received data on the GCT scores of all officers at The Basic School from

Fiscal Year 1980 to Fiscal Year 2014 through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)

request to the Marine Corps.22 The data we obtained (over 46,000 observations)

included only the test scores, with no other individual-level information, for reasons

of privacy. As we show in this section, there was a statistically significant decline

in these scores over time and the magnitude of the change is relevant given the

distribution of the scores.

        Table 1 presents statistics for the mean, standard deviation, range and

number of observations for every fifth year of the sample, beginning with 1980, and

including the information from the last year for which we have data (2014) as well.

The table shows a steady decline in the average test scores. Figure 1 presents the

mean GCT score along with the 95 percent confidence interval of the mean for 1980

to 2014. The figure shows that the decline in the mean was not monotonic, but the

general downward path is evident. The average annual rate of decrease during this

period was 0.19 percent per year, giving a cumulative change of 6.6 percent. This




22 We received only 272 observations for 2013 (which is roughly the size of one class of TBS), a year in which,

according to the Marine Corps Times, over 1,400 Marine officers joined the Corps (to put this in context, we
have 1,320 observations for 2012). In the analysis that follows, we do not use the 2013 observations.

percent of the standard deviation of the 46,341 observations.23

        The means and standard errors of the means presented in Figure 1 suggest

that there was a significant decline in the average GCT score over time. Table 2

confirms this. The statistics reported in this table represent t-tests of the

differences in means in 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. These differences increase with

the difference in years, and are significant at better than the 99 percent level of

confidence for each ten, twenty and thirty year interval presented in this table.

  In response to a separate FOIA request (DON-USMC-2014-009339), Marine Corps Recruiting Command
provided the average SAT scores of new officers from 2005-2014 (the average SAT scores for officers before 2005
are not available). According to the scores provided, the average SAT for new Marine Officers is well above the
average SAT for college bound high-school seniors; for example the average for officers in 2014 was 1,200, as
compared to the overall average of 1,010 for college-bound high school seniors. This is consistent with the result
in 1980, as reported by Stoloff, when the average SAT for Marine officers was 1,050, as compared to 860 overall.

        Figure 2 illustrates the change in the distribution of GCT scores in 1980,

1990, 2000 and 2010. This figure shows a steady leftward shift in the kernel

distribution of scores across the decades. The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test allows us

to consider whether these distributions significantly differ across time.24 The D-

statistics for these tests, and the associated p-values, are provided in Table 3. The

statistics in this table show that, in fact, there is a significant difference in the

distribution between each ten-year period, as well as between the longer periods

(1980 vs. 2000, 1980 vs. 2010, and 1990 vs. 2010). Thus, the distributions of test

scores, as well as their means, exhibit a decline decade-by-decade. In the next

section, we investigate possible causes of the decline in average annual GCT scores.




24The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test generates the D-statistic that can be used to test whether two distributions are
statistically distinct, with larger values of this statistic associated with lower p-values for the null hypothesis
that the two distributions are not different.

 IV. Determinants of GCT Scores
        The decline in the average GCT scores documented in the previous section

raises the question of the sources of this change. In this section we address this

point by regressing the average value of the GCT score in each year against a

variety of variables observed at an annual frequency.25

        The basic framework for our analysis is one that draws on the institutional

features discussed in Section II. In particular, in the period under study, officer

candidates must have completed a four-year college degree and, to have progressed

to the point to attend The Basic School and take the GCT, the candidates must also

have completed Officer Candidate School. As mentioned above, attrition from

Officer Candidate School is typically due to physical limitations or failures to

display leadership, not due to a lack of intellectual ability that would be reflected in

the GCT. While there has been much written about the effect of military

demographics and the GI Bill on college participation,26 college participation also

might have an impact on military demographics. The key point is that the pool of

those attending and completing college has increased dramatically over time,

increasing the pool of potential officer candidates. If the expansion of this pool over

time is biased towards increasing those who were less well-suited for higher

education, then the average intellectual ability of college graduates will decrease

over time. This will be reflected in a decrease in the average GCT score over time if


25 Ideally, we would have liked to have used information on individuals in order to use a panel data set but, as
mentioned above, privacy concerns meant that we only had individual-level GCT scores in each year rather than
these scores along with any individual-level characteristics.
26 For example, see Bound and Turner (2002).




                                                      14
there is not a preliminary selection by the Marines towards those with higher

intellectual abilities; as we have discussed, OCS does not primarily select or retain

based on intellectual ability.

        To illustrate this point, we begin with a highly stylized model. For simplicity,

consider a situation where the range of intelligence of potential college students

follows a uniform distribution bounded by the values L and U. Suppose that the

most intelligent potential students go to college but, over time, the college

population expands.27 If the lower bound of those going to college is LC > L, then

the mean intelligence of college students is (U + LC)/2 and the proportion of those

going to college is (U – LC)/(U – L). If there is an increase in the proportion of

college attendees to (U – LC′)/(U – L) where L < LC′ < LC, then the average

intelligence of college attendees decreases to (U + LC′)/2 which is less than (U +

LC)/2. If the pool of those wanting to become Marine officers is representative of the

pool of college attendees, and if there is a positive, monotonic relationship between

intelligence and GCT scores, then the expansion of the pool of college students will

be associated with lower average GCT scores.28

        In an effort to test the basic message of this framework, we first investigate

the potential link between college participation and the GCT scores by estimating

the regression

27
   By some calculations, around 85% of the Americans in the upper quartile of intelligence went to college by
1980. See Herrnstein and Murray (1994), p. 34.
28 It is straightforward to extend this framework along several dimensions, for example, by allowing for a

change in the upper bound as well or for allowing some type of selection into the pool of potential officers that is
not completely neutral with respect to the size of the pool. With reasonable assumptions, these modifications
would not alter the main conclusion on the link between the size of the pool of college attendees and the average
GCT score.

           (1)    ln                      ln    ∑

where ln            is the logarithm of the average GCT score in year t and                      is the

college participation rate of those between 18 and 24 years old, so the regressor,

ln   ∑            , is the logarithm of the average value of the college participation

rates capturing the experiences of those who, in year t, are between 20 and 29 years

old.29 Based on the discussion above, we expect                       0.30

         The first column of Table 4 presents the estimate of Regression (1). The

coefficient on college participation is negative and significant at better than the 99

percent level of confidence. The goodness of fit is also very large, with an R²

statistic of 0.92. Figure 3 illustrates these results, plotting the observations and the

regression line. We calculate the quantitative relevance of this estimated effect by

considering the proportion of the change in the GCT explained by the rise in the

college participation rate. The estimated cumulative change in the college

participation variable over the 35 years is 52 percent. The estimated effect of

college participation on the GCT is the product of this number and                         . The

estimated effect of an increasing college participation rate is 96 percent of the

actual percentage change in the GCT over this period.



29 The proportion of young people who have completed college, rather than those attending college, would be a

preferable regressor, but these data are not available.
30
   According to the College Board, the mean SAT scores for college bound high school students has remained
relatively constant since 1980, even after adjusting the scores for score recenterings. There is some debate on
this point, especially after the 1995 recentering. See for example ‘Educational Reform: 1994-1995’, Educational
Excellence Network, 1995. The result presented in our paper would also be in line with a large meta-analysis of
IQ tests in North America, which suggested that IQ declined when controlling for education during the time
period studied. See Uttl and Van Alstine (2003).

                    The other columns of Table 4 show the robustness of the effect of college

participation rates on the annual average GCT scores while controlling for other

factors. Column II presents a regression that includes labor market factors. The

relative pay of young military officers to that of civilians of similar educational

attainment and age is expected to have a positive coefficient, since higher pay

makes a military career more attractive to those who might otherwise chose a

civilian path. We do find that there is a statistically significant effect of this

variable on the annual average GCT score at the 90 percent level of confidence. The

other two variables in this regression measure broad labor market conditions, the

unemployment rate for those aged 25 to 29 and the labor market participation rate
                                                                          18
for this age group.31 The expected sign of the coefficient on the unemployment rate

is negative if a weaker civilian labor market makes a military career more

attractive to college graduates who cannot otherwise find a job. The participation

rate is included to control for the possibility that, say, a decrease in the

unemployment rate is just reflecting a decrease in labor market participation. The

coefficient on the participation rate would be negative if a higher participation rate

indicates a more vibrant civilian job market and a more limited pool of potential

military officers. But the coefficients on these two variables are not significant in

the estimates presented in this table.

        The estimates presented in Columns III through V of Table 4 show the

robustness of the effect of the college variable to the inclusion of other factors that

might be suggested as potential contributors to the decline in the GCT scores over

time. Column III presents a regression in which the logarithm of the number of

incoming officers is included; the argument is that a larger number of incoming

officers means a weaker pool. As shown by the results in this column, however,

there is no evidence of this effect. The estimates in Column IV consider the

hypothesis that an aversion to the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan led to lower

GCT scores because of the effect of this war weariness on the pool of applicants

similar to how it made recruiting high-quality enlisted personnel more difficult.32

Again, there is no empirical support for this proposition. Finally, in Column V we

31 Previous analyses of recruiting high-quality enlisted have focused on number of potential recruits, number of
recruiters, unemployment, and the ratio of Civilian/Military Pay. See Murray, Michael, and Laurie McDonald.

include all regressors. In this estimate, as well as in all others presented in this

table, there is little change in the value or the statistical significance of the

coefficient on college participation, suggesting that the change in college

participation over this period is not serving as a proxy for any of these other factors.

        We conclude this section by considering whether changing demographics of

the pool of incoming officers has contributed to the downward trend in the GCT

scores. Figure 4 presents the proportion of incoming officers who are African

American, Hispanic, and Female over the period 1980 to 2011, with the respective

estimated trend lines and, corresponding to an inverted scale on the right axis, the

trend line for the GCT scores (the axes are presented as a logarithmic scale). This

figure shows that there has not been a significant increase in the diversity of

incoming officers with respect to the proportion of African American incoming

officers over the 1980 – 2011 period. But there has been a statistically significant

trend in the proportion of incoming officers who are female and who are Hispanic.

The proportion of incoming officers who were women almost doubled from about 4.9

percent in 1980 to 9.5 percent in 2012, with a statistically significant estimated

annual average increase of 3.1 percent. The proportion of incoming officers who are

Hispanic was less that 0.6 percent in 1980, and this rose to 6.4 percent in 2011,

representing a statistically significant estimated growth rate of 6.0 percent.33



33
   This estimated rate of growth for Hispanic incoming officers is heavily influenced by the especially low values
of incoming Hispanic officers in 1980, 1981 and 1982. The proportion of incoming Hispanic officers jumped from
0.7 percent in 1982 to 2.7 percent in 1983. Accordingly, the estimated growth rate from 1983 to 2011 is 3.4
percent, which is still statistically significant, but which is also only a little more than half as large as the
estimated growth rate if the first three years of the sample are included.

                                     One way to test for the effect of increasing diversity on the average GCT

scores is to simply augment the regression specification (1) with the logarithm of

the proportion of incoming officers who are women, African American, or Hispanic

(we estimate separate regressions for gender and for race and ethnicity because we

do not have information by gender-race or gender-ethnicity groups and therefore

there is overlap between the category of females and the categories of African

American and Hispanic). If, in fact, the increasing diversity of the pool of incoming

officers is contributing to the decline in GCT scores, then we would expect to find a

negative and significant coefficient on these variables.

                                     The estimates in Column I of Table 5 shows that there is not a significant

relationship linking the higher proportion of women incoming officers to lower GCT

                                                                         21
scores; in fact, if anything, a higher proportion of incoming women officers is

associated with a higher average GCT score (although this result is not significant

at standard confidence levels since the p-value is 0.16). The college participation

rate variable is still highly significant and little changed from the estimates

presented in Table 4. The estimates in Column II show that the results of the

effects of the proportion of women in the incoming class of officers, and the

estimated contributions of women to the change in the average GCT scores over

time, are little altered by the inclusion of labor market regressors used in Table 4.

        What is the magnitude of these effects? In the lower part of the table, we

present the overall percentage change in the GCT over the sample period as well as

the amount attributable to the factors included in the regression and the proportion

of the overall change attributable to each of these factors.34 These statistics show

that, in the estimates presented in Columns I and II, the actual change in the GCT

is about the same as the change attributed to the increase in the college

participation rate. The estimated change due to the changing proportion of female

incoming officers is actually positive, rather than negative.

        Columns III and IV present this type of analysis for the proportion of

incoming officers who are African-American and Hispanic. These estimates show

that, as with the number of incoming female officers, there is a positive relationship

between the number of incoming African-American officers and the average GCT
34
  As in the discussion of the contribution of the increased size of the college pool to the overall change in the
GCT based on the estimates in Column I of Table 4, the percentage change attributable to each variable is
calculated as the product of the change in that variable over the sample period and the respective estimated
coefficient. The proportion of the overall change is this value divided by the percentage change in the GCT over
the sample period.


                                                       22
score and, unlike the case with incoming female officers, this estimated effect is

statistically significant (at better than the 99 percent level of confidence).

Conversely, the estimated effect of the proportion of incoming Hispanic officers and

the average GCT score is negative and statistically significant.35 The lower panel

shows that two-thirds of the change in the GCT score is still attributable to the

increased size of the pool of college students. The estimated change in the GCT

score due to the changing proportion of incoming African-American officers is

positive, not negative. In contrast, there is a relatively substantial estimated effect

attributable to the increased proportion of Hispanic officers; in the estimates in

Column III, this is -1.8% (representing 29% of the total change in GCT scores over

this period) and in Column IV it is -1.4% (representing 22% of the change in GCT

scores). In the estimates in Column IV, however, the estimated coefficient on the

proportion of incoming Hispanic officers is not significant, while that on the college

participation rate and the proportion of incoming African-American officers remain

significant.




35
  Figure 4 shows that the growth rate of incoming Hispanic officers is heavily influenced by the low values in
1980, 1981, and 1982. In order to consider the sensitivity of the results in Column III to the inclusion of these
three observations, we re-estimate this regression for the period 1983 to 2011. In a regression with same
specification as in Column II, the coefficient on the logarithm of incoming Hispanic Officers is 0.0086 and its
standard error is 0.0053, with a p-value of 0.12.

        The relatively large and significant estimated contribution of incoming

Hispanic officers to the decline in GCT scores in Column III raises the question of

the source of this effect. One possibility is that the main mechanism we consider,

the increasing proportion of college students, is especially pronounced for Hispanics;

over the sample period, the average annual increase in the college participation rate

for Hispanics was 4.1 percent, as compared to 1.7 percent for the non-Hispanic

population. We investigate this possibility by first defining the geometric average of

the GCT score in any year as

           (2)

where            is the average GCT score for Hispanics in year t,        is the average

GCT score for non-Hispanics in that year, and         is the proportion of incoming

officers who are Hispanics in year t. It is worth noting, at this point, that the

proportion of incoming officers who were Hispanic varied quite a bit over the sample

period, rising from 0.6% in 1980 to a peak of 8.2% in 1999, and ending the sample

period at 6.4%.

        A version of Specification (1) that disaggregates college attendance into the

Hispanics and non-Hispanics populations, and takes into account the changing

proportion of incoming officers who were Hispanic, is

           (3)    ln                  ln          1      ln       .

The variables in the regression are the product of the proportion of incoming officers

who are Hispanics,        , and the logarithm of the proportion of Hispanics who are in

college,         , and the corresponding variables for non-Hispanics, 1      and      .



                                             25
We can use the results from this regression to estimate the contribution of the

incoming Hispanic officers to the GCT in each year relative to the variation in the

GCT,     , by calculating


       (4a)


and a comparable estimate for the non-Hispanic population,          , is


       (4b)                     .


       We present the estimate of this regression, and        and      , in Column I of

Table 6. As shown in that Column, the estimated coefficient         is very significant,

but the coefficient    is no longer significant at the 95 percent level of confidence

(the p-value is 0.078), and these two coefficients are statistically indistinguishable

(the p-value of the test that the coefficients differ is 0.218). More telling, the

average value for      is 0.06 while that of     is 0.94. This is illustrated in a year-

by-year basis in Figure 5 which plots bars whose heights represent the estimated

contribution of Hispanics (red bars) and non-Hispanics (tan bars) for each year.

       We conclude this section by considering a model that nests both the

regression presented above, in which the contribution of incoming Hispanic officers

to the GCT is through the change in the proportion of incoming officers and the

proportion of Hispanics attending college, and a model in which there is some

Hispanic-specific effect on the GCT scores unrelated to these changing proportions.

coefficient    is significant at better than the 99 percent confidence level and the

coefficients    and    are virtually identical, suggesting no difference in the

contribution of Hispanics and non-Hispanics to the GCT score. This implication of

the similarity in these two coefficients is bolstered by the insignificance of the

coefficient on incoming Hispanic officers,        (the p-value of this estimated coefficient

is 0.51). Thus, these results show no evidence that the proportion of incoming

officers who are Hispanic plays any meaningful role in the average GCT scores in

any year.

     V.      Conclusion

     Twenty percent of the United States federal budget goes towards funding the

American military36 and it is one of America’s most trusted institutions.37 Yet

despite the intense scrutiny of the intelligence of the enlisted force, there has been

little study of the intelligence of the officer corps. This paper analyzed the

intelligence of the officers of one branch of the military, the Marine Corps, and

found a relevant and steady decline in intelligence, as measured by GCT scores,

since 1980. This decline was closely associated with an expansion of the pool of

young college graduates during the same time period, which potentially diminished

the overall intellectual quality of that pool.

          Our results also support those who argue that affirmative action has not had

a negative impact on the quality of the officer corps. The Marine Corps has, since

the 1990s, actively recruited African American officers, and there has been some

debate on whether this is harmful to overall officer quality.38 A similar debate has

played out recently about the recruitment of women. We find, in fact, a positive

association between African American officers and mean GCT score, perhaps

because recruitment efforts by the Marine Corps have attracted minority officers

who are more qualified than the typical college graduate. There is no evidence that

a greater proportion of incoming Hispanic officers reduces the annual average GCT

scores for any reasons other than those identified for the non-Hispanic group and

                                                     29
furthermore, given the small proportion of incoming Hispanic officers, this effect

has no meaningful quantitative contribution to the change in GCT scores over time.

Overall, then, this study rebuts the often tacit assumption that minority officers are

less qualified than their counterparts.

      What has been the impact of this drop in intelligence on the effectiveness of

the military? Answering this question is beyond the scope of this paper. Given the

myriad studies associating performance with intellect, however, it is hard to

imagine anything other than a seriously deleterious impact on the quality of officers

and, by extension, on the quality and efficacy of the military.

       o Data is sorted by fiscal year, instead of calendar year
       o Comparing the number of valid scores we received with the number of
          Marine Officers who were commissioned in each year according to the
          annual Personnel Readiness Reviews, it appears that we received the
          scores of around 90% of the officers.
       o Erroneous scores of 0 were deleted
       o Those scores below 80 were deleted as unlikely
       o 96 members of the third TBS class of 2004 was assigned a score of 100,
          which must be erroneous; in 2003, for example, only 3 officers received
          a 100 out of the entire year. It would appear that the scores of two
          platoons in the third TBS class of 2004 were lost and a default value of
          100 was entered. All values of 100 from the third TBS class of 2004
          were therefore deleted. If anything, this means that we are missing a
          few officers who really did score 100 in that year.
       o While all values from 2014 were received, there were only 272 values
          reported in 2013 (corresponding to one class of TBS). According to the
          Marine Corps Times, over 1400 Marine officers joined that year, a
          normal amount. We are therefore missing over a thousand scores from
          that year, making it suspect.
