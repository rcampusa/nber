          THE IMPACT OF TAX REFORM ON CHARITABLE GIVING: A 1989 PERSPECTIVE


                                            ABSTRACT

      The purpose   of   this paper   is   to examine the   predicted effects of   tax

reform in the 1980s (the tax acts of 1981 and 1986) on charitable

contributions by individuals and to conpare them to the actual and apparent

effects,   viewed from the perspective of 1989. The paper discusses what the
economic models can and cannot be expected to do. Then, using published data
from tax returns, the paper compares        actual   and predicted changes in giving as
a result of both of the    major tax   reform acts. The paper      concludes   that the
changes    in contributions are quite consistent with the economic model of

giving. As a result of these tax changes, average giving in high income

classes declined. These results imply that tax policy should continue to be

considered one important determinant of the level of individual charitable

contributions.

                      Bob Smucker, Independent Sector, August, 1986, about

                      the new tax bill.



       In 1988 individuals in the United States contributed an estimated $87 billion to tax

exempt nonprofit organizations, including churches, community chests, museums, and colleges.

l'his amount was more than seven times the total given by corporations and through bequests.

Although not a large number in relation to total tax revenues, charitable contributions loom

large for the nonprofit sector, which has come to depend on such giving as a major source of

revenue. As debate over tax reform intensified during the 1980s, influential spokesmen for

nonprofit organizations came to view such reform as a serious threat to that source of revenue,

a view that was bolstered by economic models of charitable giving. Finding it uncomfortable to

oppose tax reform itself, the nonprofits nevertheless fought to maintain tax incentives for giving,
                                                                                                  2

with the result that the treatment of charitable contributions provided some of the gloomiest

predictions and most heated debate among the provisions involved in tax reform during the

1980s. There were many doubters who thought the sector's jeremiads amounted to little more

than crying wolf.

       The purpose of this paper is to examine the predicted effects of tax reform in the 1980s

on charitable contributions by individuals and to compare them to the actual and apparent

effects, viewed from the perspective of 1989. The first section of the paper presents a

description of the issues and tax provisions relevant to charitable contributions. The second

section focuses on specific characteristics of the models used to predict the effects of tax reform

on contributions and asks whether the predictions were in fact warranted by the models and

indeed how one would test the models. The paper's third section describes several approaches

that can be used to assess the models and data that can be employed for that purpose, and the

fourth section compares predicted with actual changes in contributions during the 1980s. The

final section draws conclusions from the analysis.




I. The Tax Treatment of Charitable Contributions

        The federal tax code accords special treatment to most nonprofit organizations, including

exemption from corporate income taxation. For a large subset of nonprofit organizations, it

also allows individuals (as well as corporations and estates) a tax deduction for the donations

they make to these organizations. The charitable deduction in the income tax, by virtue of the

 preponderant importance of donations by individuals, is the most important of these deductions.

 Applying only to taxpayers who itemize their deductions, it is certainly one of the oldest

 personal deductions in the tax code) having existed almost as long as the income tax itself. An
                                                                                                  3

important effect of this provision is to lower an individual's net cost of making gifts. For

example, a taxpayer subject to a marginal tax rate of 30 percent who is able to deduct a

contribution of $100 will enjoy a tax reduction of $30, thus reducing the after-tax net cost of

the contribution to $70. The taxpayer can be thought of as receiving a discount on the price of

making gifts; the deduction reduces the net cost of donating a dollar to 70 cents. State income

tax deductions reduce this net cost further, though data on state tax rates are typically not

available and thus are usually ignored in statistical analyses.

       There is an additional benefit of making contributions in the form of appreciated

property such as stock, real estate and objects of art. Donors of such gifts not only receive the

tax deduction for the asset's current market value, typically they also avoid paying tax on the

capital gains that would otherwise have been associated with the sale of the asset. For

example, if the gift described above had not been cash, but rather $100 of stock that had

originally been purchased for $50, the tax code's forgiveness of the tax on the capital gain of

$50 would further reduce the net cost of giving if the stock would otherwise have been sold. If

the capital gains tax were 20 percent, for example, the taxpayer would save an additional $10

that would otherwise have been due had the stock been sold, reducing the net cost of the gift

to $60, or 60 cents per dollar. As above, these calculations generally apply only to taxpayers

who itemize their deductions.

        As a result of this tax treatment, the net cost of contributions comes to depend crucially

on two factors: first, tax rates and, second, how widespread the deductibility of gifts is. In

general the latter equates to the proportion of taxpayers who itemize their deductions, which

depends in turn on the size of the standard deduction and the number and size of other

itemized deductions.
                                                                                                   4
B. Tax Reform in the 1980s

        Each of the two major tax bills of the 1980s contained provisions that affected taxpayers'

net cost of making contributions, and the most important of these are summarized in Table 1.

The 1981 act (the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981) modified the tax rate schedule by

cutting the top marginal tax rate, from 70 to 50 percent and reducing other tax rates

proportionally. At the same time the act failed to adjust the tax tables for inflation, thus

allowing taxpayers to slide into higher tax brackets and largely nullifying the cut in rates for

most people. The cut in the top rate of course meant an increase in the net cost of giving for

those with high incomes. Working in the other direction was the likely increase in the number

of itemizers that would result from a fixed standard deduction during a period of inflation.

Surely the most obvious provision likely to affect contributions was a new charitable deduction

for nonitemizers that was to be gradually phased in between 1982 and 1986. However, only in

1985 and 1986, when the very low dollar limits on this deduction were removed, was it likely to

have an important effect on contributions.

       The 1986 act (the Tax Reform Act of 1986) likewise contained several important

changes having implications for charitable contributions. First, it continued the work of the

1981 act in cutting the top tax rate. The highest marginal tax rate was reduced to 33 percent

for 1988, and taxpayers in the highest income brackets faced a rate of only 28 percent. Tax

rates were not cut for all taxpayers, however. Hausman and Poterba (1987) estimate that only
59 percent of taxpayers saw their marginal tax rates decrease as a result of the new law.

Second, the nonitemizer deduction was eliminated from the code after being fully in place for

one year. Third, the number of taxpayers who would itemize their deductions would be

reduced markedly due to increases in the standard deduction amounts, the elimination of the

sales tax deduction, and the curtailment of the personal interest and miscellaneous deductions.
                                                                                                   5

The net effect of these three changes was to increase the net price of giving for virtually all

taxpayers either by removing deductibility of gifts or reducing the value of the deduction for

those who continued to itemize. A fourth important change related to charitable giving was

made in the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), a provision applying only to a comparatively

small number of very wealthy taxpayers. To the existing list of "tax preference" items in the tax

base of the AMT was included the heretofore untaxed appreciation of donated capital assets.1

As discussed below, the effect of this provision was to diminish the attractiveness of giving away

assets whose basis was small in relation to market value. A fifth and less important provision

affecting contributions was the taxation of capital gains at regular rates. For taxpayers not

subject to the AMT, this provision would in fact increase the relative desirability of giving away

appreciated property since the foregone capital gains tax had increased. The 1986 act

contained a number of other provisions affecting certain kinds of donations or nonprofit

organizations more generally, but these provisions are of lesser importance for individual

contributions in the aggregate.2

        Two ready measures of the impact of the two tax acts on the net cost of making

contributions are shown in Table 2. The table shows that the proportion of taxpayers who

itemized their returns increased steadily over the period in which the standard deduction was

not adjusted for inflation. From 31 percent, the share of itemizers rose to 40 percent before

being cut back to 30 percent by the large jump in the standard deduction contained in the 1986

act. The last column in the table chronicles the decline in the tax code's highest rate bracket.

For a taxpayer subject to that rate, the cost of making cash donations more than doubled, from

30 to 67 cents per dollar. For those subject to the 28 percent rate in 1986, it increased even

more.
                                                                                                    6

II. Assessing the Impact on Charitable Giving

A. Models of Charitable Giving
       In the decade between 1975 and 1985 there appeared at least a score of empirical

studies of charitable giving based on a common basic economic model of giving. As developed

by Feldstein (1975) and modified in subsequent studies, this basic model takes charitable

contributions to be a function of after-tax net income (Y), the tax-defined price of contributions

(P), and other factors thought to affect charitable behavior (X). Typically this relationship has

been estimated using a log-linear specification:

       (1)lnG=d +alnY+blnP+cX+e,
where G is defined as contributions plus $1 or $iO, d, a and b are parameters, c is a vector of

parameters, and e is an error term. Price is defined as the dollar amount of consumption

foregone per dollar of contributions. For donors who receive no tax deduction for their gifts --

 nonitemizers in most cases and all those owing no tax — this price is simply Si. For an

itemizer with a marginal tax rate of m, the price of making ordinary cash contributions is 1-rn,

since each dollar's worth of giving causes the person's tax liability to be reduced by Sm.

       The model implies that taxes affect contributions in two ways -- through net income and

through the price of giving. Thus almost any change in the tax rate schedule or in the number

of taxpapers who itemize their deductions will tend to have an impact on giving. It is

straightforward to use such models to simulate the effects of tax changes on charitable giving.

For example, if non-tax factors remain the same, the simple model in (1) implies that

contributions will change only as a function of changes in the tax-defined variables. Where a

and b are, respectively, the estimated income and price elasticities, the predicted level of

contributions in the second period is

        (2) G1 = G0 (Y1/Y0 (P1/Pg
                                                                                                    7

A similar approach can be taken with more complicated specifications. But whatever the exact

specification, it is useful to emphasize what an approach of this sort implies about charitable

behavior. It is not predicated on the assumption that taxes are the only or the major
determinant of charitable giving, but only that they are one influence. If the basic equation is

correctly specified and estimated and if non-tax factors are indeed unchanging, an equation such

as (2) can be used to predict the effects of tax changes. It is important, however, to consider

several issues that complicate the use and interpretation of this simple modeL

       Estimated elasticities. The simple model given in (1) implies constant elasticities of

contributions with respect to both the tax-defined price of giving and net income. Typical

estimates for the price elasticity are greater than one in absolute value, which implies that

contributions would fall by more than 10 percent in response to an increase in the net price of

giving of 10 percent. The income elasticity has most often been estimated to be positive but

less than one. In the present paper, I use estimates presented in aotfelter and Steuerle (1981)

to be representative of the empirical studies on this subject: -1.27 for the price elasticity and

0.78 for the income elasticity. The literature on this subject is not unanimous regarding the

size or the constancy of these important parameters, however. There is some evidence, for

example, that the elasticities differ by income level, with low-income households being less

responsive to changes in price than others. And there are a few studies that suggest that both

price and income elasticities are quite a bit smaller in absolute value than the majority of

studies indicate.4 In order to reflect these alternative views of charitable giving behavior, the

current paper compares the predictive success of the simple constant elasticity model using the

above parameters with a variable elasticity model estimated in Clotfelter and Steuerle (1981) as

well as a model that incorporates price and income elasticities of zero.
                                                                                                     8

        Gifts of appreciated property. In the past it has usually been advantageous for donors

to make gifts in the form of appreciated property, such as stock, real estate and works of art, as

opposed to giving the same amount in cash, no tax being assessed on the capital gain that

would have arisen had the asset been sold. This additional benefit is added to the value of the

charitable deduction itself to make the net cost of giving such assets even less than that for

giving cash. Because gifts of appreciated property are an important part of contributions for

some types of donee organizations and among wealthy taxpayers, it is important to consider

what this tax treatment implies for the price of giving. Where g* is an asset's gain-to-value

ratio in the year it is given away, n is the tax rate on capital gains income, and R is a

dichotomous variable that takes on the value of 1 if the asset would have been sold

immediately if it were not contributed and 0 if the asset would not otherwise have been sold,

the net cost of contributing the asset is

        (3) P=1-m-Rgn.
Note that in the case of an unappreciated asset such as cash, this expression reduces to the 1-

m used above.5 As noted above, the 1986 tax reform act modified this traditional treatment for

taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). For these taxpayers, inclusion of

the appreciation portion of the gift as a tax preference placed a penalty on the gift exactly

equal to the capital gains tax that would have been due had the asset been sold. For a

taxpayer who would have otherwise sold the asset, this penalty was equivalent to reducing the

gift's benefit to that of giving cash.'

        It is important to give attention to gifts of appreciated property for two reasons. First,

this tax treatment ought to be integrated into simulations of the impact of tax reform just as it

has been integrated into empirical studies of the impact of tax policy on contributions.

Accordingjy, the calculations given below calculate the price variable as a weighted average of
                                                                                                  9

the prices of giving cash and appreciated property. Following earlier work, the calculations use
weights based on the proportion of contributions made in the form of cash in the initial year of

observation. The price of giving appreciated property is calculated assuming an asset with a

gain-to-value ratio of 50 percent that would have been sold immediately (Rg* = 0.5). A

second reason for being attentive to gifts of appreciated property is their potential to reveal

another facet of the economic model of giving, If the relative price of making cash and non-

cash gifts vanes over time, the economic model of giving would suggest that the pattern of

giving would also vary accordingly.
       To see what kinds of implications the model would have for tax changes in the 1980s, it

is useful to examine the calculated net price for two specific cases. Since the tax circumstances

of the wealthy were affected most dramatically, I present cases applying to high-income

taxpayers. Table 3 shows the price of giving in three years for a hypothetical couple whose real

AG! remained at $1 million in 1985 dollars over the period. This couple's marginal tax rate

would have been cut sharply as a result of tax reform during the 1980s: from 70 to 50 percent

by the 1981 tax act and down to 28 percent by the 1986 act. The result would have been more

than a doubling in the price of giving cash, from 30 to 72 cents per dollar. For the net cost of

giving an asset which consisted of 50 percent capital gains, the price would almost have tripled.

The second example is based on an actual case which has been cited more than once as an

example of the 1986 act's supposed discouragement of gifts of art. Having inherited Vincent

van Gogh's Irises, valued then at $1.8 million, John Whitney Payson decided to sell the painting

in 1987 rather than giving it, as he had planned, to Westbrook College in Portland, Maine.

The painting sold in November 1987 for a record $53.9 million. Table 4 summarizes the tax

consequences of donating the painting under the previous tax law, the regular tax under the

 1986 law and under the AMT provisions of the 1986 law. As a result of the drop in tax rates,
                                                                                                10

the net cost per dollar of donating the painting under the regular tax increased by almost half

as a result of the 1986 act. But because Mr. Payson would probably have been subject to the

AMT, the price rose even more than that, from 31 to 79 cents per dollar as compared to

selling the painting immediately. Although extreme, this example suggests one implication of

the economic model of giving -- that large gifts in the form of appreciated property would be

particularly discouraged relative to cash and relative to gifts made before the tax act.

       Dynamic elements. The simple model in (1) takes no explicit account of time. Yet it

seems reasonable that individual charitable behavior is unlikely to change overnight in response

to changes in tax law. One model of charitable giving views equations such as (1) as a

representation of the long-run or desired level of contributions. Individuals may not adjust right

away to changes in this desired level, however, due to such factors as habit or established levels

of solicitation that may be based on previous levels of giving. Applying an incomplete

adjustment model to charitable giving behavior yields a model such as



       (4)   G1   / G, = (G I Go)h,


where G is the desired level of contributions and h is a coefficient of adjustment. A value of

h close to one would imply that individuals adjust completely during a time period to changes in

the desired level of contributions; values closer to zero would imply a slower response. For the

calculations made in the present paper, a value for h for a one-year period of 0.37 is used,

based on an estimate given in Clotfelter (1980, p.333). This value implies coefficients of

adjustment of 0.60 for two years and 0.84 for four.7

B. The Nonprofits' Fear of Tax Reform
       Although many of the details of the economic model of charitable giving were not

widely understood, the essence of the price responsiveness argument did find its wayinto the

debate over tax reform. Lobbyists for nonprofit organizations cited econometric models in

warning of possibly harmful consequences of tax changes while proponents of tax reform raised

questions about the models being used. That such a seemingly esoteric piece of economic

reasoning would become part of policy debate may seem surprising, but there were several

factors that worked in its favor. Among these were the amount of attention that had been paid

to tax effects on giving by the prestigious Filer Commission in the 1970s, the prominence of the

economist (Martin Feldstein) who undertook econometric work under the Commission's

sponsorship, the relatively large number of confirmatory studies that followed the first work, and

the easily overlooked fact that the conclusions of the economic studies generally resonated with

the everyday experience of many people. The models served to lend specificity to the vague

worries of nonprofit organizations about how tax reform might affect them.

        Among the features of tax reform plans that were discussed during the 198(, there

were two that most worried leaders of nonprofit organizations. First, any drop in the number

of taxpayers who received a charitable deduction was, understandably, seen as a threat to

contributions. Not only was the nonitemizer deduction subject to a sunset provision after 1986,

but many of the tax reform plans discussed, including the eventual 1986 act, would have

 reduced the number of taxpayers who itemized their deductions. The second source of concern

was a feature common to all of the tax reform plans -- rate reduction. Although few were
 prepared to speak out against rate reduction, it was not hard to believe that the tax incentive

 for giving a gift under a 28 percent marginal tax rate, for example, would be a lot less than

 what existed under the previous 50 percent rate. In terms of the economic model of giving,
                                                                                                  12

both tax rate reduction and restrictions on the deductibility of gifts would raise the net cost of

making gifts, but one did not have to be an economist to guess that the outcome would be

unfavorable for nonprofit institutions. In addition to these two aspects of tax reform, a third

challenge to the nonprofits arose at the eleventh hour of the debate over the 1986 act in the

form of an attack on the tax-free status of capital gains in gifts of appreciated property.

       Representatives of the nonprofit sector were quick to respond to major tax reform

proposals, using economic models of giving to provide specific estimates of likely impacts. In

response to the Treasury's first tax reform plan in 1985, Independent Sector, an umbrella group

representing nonprofit organizations, criticized that plan's elimination of the nonitemizer

deduction and its introduction of a floor for itemized charitable donations, saying that

contributions would drop by 20 percent if the plan were enacted.9 Likewise, spokespersons for

the nonprofit sector criticized President Reagan's May 1985 tax proposal, which also eliminated

the nonitemizer eduction. They publicized estimates that the proposal would cause

contributions from individuals to drop by $10 billion.1° When the details of the tax act itself

were finalized in the summer of 1986, the story was much the same. Nonprofit representatives

quoted research suggesting that the number of itemizers would decline as a percentage of all

taxpayers from 38 to 20 percent under the new law." Given certain caveats, models implied

that contributions under the new law would be on the order of 14 to 16 percent lower than

under the previous law.' Because of its special provisions affecting colleges and universities

and gifts of appreciated property, those who spoke for arts and educational institutions were

especially concerned about the bill's negative impact.'3
                                                                                                   13

HI. A aoser Look at the Models
       Before considering in detail the predicted and apparent effects of tax reform on

charitable giving, it is useful to take a closer look at the economic model and some of its

implications.



A. Using the Economic Model: Simulations, Limitations and Caveats

        When a simplified model is applied to real-world policy analysis, caveats are usually in

order, and this is certainly the case with models of charitable giving. Since behavioral equations

such as (1) do not even purport to capture all of the factors that influence donative behavior,

the analyst is well-advised to be carefuL in applying estimated parameters in simulating the likely

effects of policy changes and modest in describing the validity of projections. Such care and

modesty seldom come naturally, however, and they are furthermore counteracted by the

frequent urge on the part of journalists, policymakers and lobbyists to simplify and dramatize.

In considering the policy applications of the economic modeL of contributions, it is useful to

review the justification for using estimated models to assess likely policy outcomes.

        As has been common practice in a number of applied topics in tax analysis, estimated

models such as (1) have been used to simulate the likely effect of various planned or

contemplated modifications in tax policy, in this case by translating such modifications into

changes in the price and net income terms and using an estimated equation such as (2). What

can such an exercise tell us? At most, it can yield predicted levels of contributions for a

hypothetical and most likely counterfactual situation, one in which none of the other factors

contained in the vector X changes. Needless to say, simulations such as these are rarely

described this way in newspaper stories. Because of their counterfactual nature, such

projections tend to be inherently immune from factual verification: it is always impossible to
                                                                                                   14

eliminate the possibility that "other factors" have changed at the same time that tax policy has

changed, thus confounding any pure tax policy effect. While this may come as a relief to those

who produce such projections, it is cold comfort to analysts and policymakers who are

concerned about the actual impact of actual policies. Fortunately, it is possible to devise

indirect tests of the validity of such simulation models by examining various implications of the

model under some reasonable assumptions. Several tests of this sort are discussed below in

section B.
       Besides their basic counterfactual nature, simulations based on a model such as (1) are

subject to a variety of errors, and a policy of full-disclosure requires that these be aired as well.

These may include statistical error emanating from the imprecise nature of all econometric

estimates, errors associated with predicting such underlying variables as real income or the

proportion of taxpayers who will itemize under different tax rules, and errors arising from

ignorance of the characteristics of appreciated property that are contributed.14

        There are two points on which the simulations are especially vulnerable: changes in

other factors not reflected in estimated equations and dynamic aspects of giving behavior.

"Other" factors motivating giving include personal beliefs and affiliations, aspects on which

economists are by no means expert. Survey data on charitable behavior show, for example, that

the best predictor of contributions are attendance at religious services and involvement in civic

and other organizations." To complicate matters further, it appears that issues within religious

and other organizations may have a shifting effect on giving patterns over time. Contributions

among Catholics, for exampLe, have been found to be influenced by controversy between

liberals and conservatives within the church over issues of faith.1' More generally, donations to

both religious and secular organizations appear to be highly sensitive to perceived social needs

and capable of responding quickly to crises, such as the African famine and the problem of
                                                                                                   15

homelessness in the late 198(.h7 Another entire category of outside influence on contributions

is solicitation by charitable organizations themselves, and these efforts give every evidence of

being responsive to changes in the giving environment, including changes in tax law. For

example, Dartmouth and other universities have sent replicas of stock certificates to alumni as

part of a reminder of the tax advantages of making gifts of appreciated stock. Charitable and
educational institutions of all kinds have increasingly turned to "direct marketing" advisors to

design solicitation campaigns.18 Factors such as these are clearly outside of the realm of tax

policy and are moreover difficult to measure, not to mention that their effects on giving have

not been estimated. That they change over time seems quite probable; that some actually

respond to changes in tax policy is likely. Thus the ceteris paribus assumption presents a

significant complication in the use of simulations.

        The second complication relates to dynamic elements in contributions behavior.

Virtually all simulations of the effect of tax policy on charitable giving have used as their basic

behavioral equation one that refers to long- run or desired levels of giving. While such

behavior is arguably the most important form of the response to tax policy, focusing on the long

run has the drawback of ignoring two potentially important kinds of behavior. First, as noted in

section II, individual giving behavior probably does not respond immediately to changes in the

desired level of giving. Second, since individuals usually have considerable latitude regarding

when they make gifts, they may time their donations so as to minimize their total tax liability.

This kind of timing might show itself, for example, in making donations early so as to have

 them counted for a tax year when the taxpayer faces a comparative high tax rate rather than

 the low tax rate anticipated for the following year. One might also imagine that a floor on the

 deductibiliy of contributions might inspire taxpayers to bunch their gifts, say, in alternating years

 so that a higher portion of their donations would be deductible."
                                                                                                     16

B. Some Implications Regarding Tax Reform
       As noted above, it is impossible to perform a definitive test of the economic model's

predictions, owing to the exclusion of other factors that affect contributions. Not only is it

difficult to predict changes in these factors, they are for the most part not even measured.

However, under a plausible assumption regarding these influences, the model does suggest

several hypotheses concerning the effect of tax reform during the 1980s. One simple hypothesis

suggested by the notion of price responsiveness in the model is that taxpayers would tend to

accelerate their giving when a decline in the tax incentive is announced for the following year.

For taxpayers facing declines in marginal tax rates between 1986 and 1987, for example, one

would expect to observe a surge of contributions in 1986 as people try to take advantage of the

high tax rates. Since there are few estimates relevant to such timing behavior, however, it is

impossible to judge the size of this effect.

       A second set of hypotheses is more useful in assessing the estimated parameters of the

model. If one assumes that other factors have a uniform effect on all donations, unrelated to

changes in tax variables, one can compare patterns of variation in contributions to patterns of

variation in tax parameters and ask whether these patterns are consistent with the model's

predictions. As an illustration, there is little to be learned from observing that an individual's

contributions rose by 5 percent over a period in which income rose by 4 percent and price fell

by 10 percent, for the simple reason that other factors may have changed as well over this

period. If it is assumed, however, that all individuals were affected similarly by other influences

and would have experienced the same percentage increase in giving in the absence of tax

changes, one can sensibly compare differences in the changes in tax variables and in giving.

One can then determine, for example, whether individuals with the biggest price increases also
                                                                                                  17

had the smallest increases in giving, as the model would predict. Specifically, one might expect

to see evidence useful for judging the model by looking for three kinds of effects.

       1. In comparing changes in contributions over time, the model would predict bigger

declines (or smaller increases) in income classes in which the price of giving had increased the

most. In order to examine this implication, the next section presents an examination of data on

average income, price and contributions by income class over time. Since the 1986 tax act (and

the 1981 act as well) cut tax rates the most at upper income levels, the model would predict

that contributions by the wealthy would decline relative to contributions at middle and lower

income levels, holding constant changes in income. But changes in after-tax income would also

be predicted to affect giving. Both effects can be incorporated into the model to yield

predicted changes in giving, and the pattern of predicted changes can be compared to the

pattern of actual changes.
        2. In the aggregate, changes by income class such as these would add up to a

redistribution of contributions between the wealthy and the rest of the taxpaying public. If the

income distribution did not change, the implication of these changes is that the share of total

giving by the rich would decline. If the income distribution did change, one would still expect

that contributions by the rich, relative to their income, would decline as a result of tax reform.

A corollary effect would be that organizations traditionally supported by the rich, such as

cultural and educational institutions, would suffer in comparison to those institutions

traditionally favored by the middle and lower income groups, particularly religious organizations.

These implications assume, again, that other factors affecting contributions had a similar

influence at all income levels and that shifts in the distribution of income did not offset the

pattern of changes in tax incentives.
                                                                                                   18

       3. A third implication of the model applies to one specific provision, the charitable

deduction for nonitemizers. Between 1985 and 1986 that provision changed dramatically,

increasing from a 50 percent deduction to a full deduction. For a nonitemizer facing marginal

tax rate m, this change would have caused the net price of giving to fall from (1-O.5m) to (1-

m), implying an increase in contributions.




IV. Evidence on the Impact of Tax Reform on Contributions

       There is no reliable measure of total charitable contributions by individuals. Tax returns

normally contain information for itemizers only, and estimates based on the receipts of

nonprofit organizations is approximate at best, largely because there is no good information on

giving to religious organizations. This data limitation plus the conceptual difficulties regarding

non-tax effects discussed above make it impossible to devise definitive tests of the efficacy of

economic models of contributions. However, one can gain insight from looking at the

aftermath of the tax reform acts of 1981 and 1986. The current section examines, first,

information from recipient organizations and, second, data from tax returns.



A. Evidence from Donees on Contributions

       Probably the most consistent message contained in articles reporting trends in charitable

giving in recent years is that, despite charities' fears regarding the effects of tax reform,

contributions have continued to increase year after year. The widely quoted Giving USA has

reported increases in aggregate donations each year for the past 37 years, with the total rising

from $80 billion in 1985 to $98 billion in 1987 to $104 billion in 1988, increases well above the

rate of inflation. (Unfortunately, the largest component of these figures, an estimate of the
                                                                                                  19

giving of individuals, is based largely on personal income and incorporates no direct evidence on

charitable giving until several years after the fact.) Corroborating the figures for the most

recent years, articles on individual charities suggest that most had increases in contributions

between 1986 and 1987 and between 1987 and 1988.

For example, a group of 27 Protestant denominations, representing some 30 percent of U.S.

church membership, reported a 3 percent increase in gifts between 1986 and 1987, the first year

following the 1986 tax reform. Similarly, an informal survey of charities the next year showed

that most had modest increases.2' One bellweather, the United Way, reported a 6.6 percent

increase in giving from 1986 to 1987 and a 6.9 percent increase from 1987 to l988.

       Such increase,s were not universal, however. Two groups of institutions that have

traditionally relied on gifts from the wealthy, especially in the form of appreciated property, are

museums and institutions of higher education. In both cases, the 1986 act did appear to have

its predicted impact on appreciated property gifts, although the overall effect of tax reform on

them is still uncertain. For these donees, the economic model would imply two things: a surge

in contributions in 1986 relative to 1987, with a further decline in 1988, owing to the decline in

rates; and a larger dropoff in gifts of appreciated property after 1986, owing to the more

stringent treatment of such gifts in the AMT. Table 5 presents some information for both

types of institutions for years immediately before and after the 1986 act. In the case of

colleges and universities, the findings on total contributions from individuals are mixed.

Between 1986 and 1987 contributions to 16 private universities changed very little in real terms

while gifts to 23 colleges increased. In both cases, total contributions at least kept up with

inflation over the four-year period despite the decline in marginal tax rates. Gifts of

appreciated assets to these educational institutions are a different story, however, with both

groups showing large jumps in 1986, followed by declines in the following years. These declines
                                                                                                  20

are consistent with the economic model, of cqurse, but they could equally well be explained by

the October 1987 stock market crash. Perhaps a purer test of the effect of the effect of the

1986 provisions on gifts of appreciated property is provided by the experience of art museums,

shown at the bottom of Table 5. For a group of 119 such museums, donations of artwork

surged dramatically in 1986 and then fell to a level in 1988 below that achieved in 1985, a

result that is consistent with the act's having a permanent effect on such contributions.



B. Data from Tax Returns
        A tried and true source of data for examining charitable giving is tax returns: all

itemized returns contain the dollar amount of reported contributions. The tax return data

show, for example, that total contributions by itemizers rose from $48.0 billion in 1985 to $54.5

billion in 1986 and then fell to $49.3 billion in 1987 (U. S. Internal Revenue Service, various

years). However, this slight 3 percent increase in contributions between 1985 and 1987 (a

decline of 3 percent in real terms) was accompanied by an 11 percent decrease in the number

 of itemizers. Shifts in the itemizing population thus make it difficult to assess changes in total

 reported contributions. Yet tax return information is very useful for the analysis of giving
 behavior by itemizers. Its ready availability is no doubt one of the reasons that there have

 been relatively many studies on the impact of taxes on contributions. A possible drawback is

 the possibility that taxpayers systematically overstate their contributions, and furthermore that

 the amount of overstatement is positively correlated with marginal tax rates, but these problems

 do not in fact appear to be very severe. Subject therefore to the problem of observing the
 behavior of nonitemizers and to the usual lag in the availability of data, tax return data provide

 a useful source of information for assessing the impact of tax reform. In line with the
                                                                                                21

discussion in section 111, the remainder of this discussion examines three hypotheses derived

from the economic model of contributions.

       Contributions by income class. A major effect of the tax reform acts of 1981 and 1986

was to modify rate structures, thus changing the price of giving, especially in the upper income

classes. By looking at years before and after these large changes, it is possible to compare

income classes experiencing different amounts of change in price in order to see whether the

economic model is a useful guide for predicting donative behavior. For the purpose of

assessing the impact of tax reform in the 1980s, npredictedN and actual changes in contributions

for itemizers, based on changes in income taxes and tax rates, were calculated for two pairs of

years: 1980/1984 and 1985/1987. No allowance was made in these calculations for the

relatively small number of taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Each income

class in the ending year was paired with the income class in the beginning year with the closest

mean AGI in constant dollars. Equations (1) and (4) were used to calculate the predicted

giving in real terms in the ending year, and the percentage change in actual and predicted

giving were then compared. Figures 1 and 2 show this comparison for each pair of years using

the constant elasticity model (price elasticity of

-.27 and income elasticity of 0.78; coefficients of adjustment equal to 0.84 for the 4-year period

and 0.60 for the 2-year period).

        Figure 1 compares actual percentage changes in contributions to "predicted changes

based only on the price and income effects in the constant elasticity model. Although far from

perfect, the model does mimic the overall pattern of actual changes. Especially noteworthy are

the actual and predicted declines in average giving for high-income taxpayers. For most income

classes, contributions increased by more than the model — with its implicit assumption that

"other things" had not changed -- predicted. For every class above $15,000 the predicted
                                                                                                   1')


change   is less than the actual change, sometines by wide margins. Yet there is also a certain

consistency in these errors, with both the predicted and the actual declines being the largest in

the top income classes. It is obvious from looking at the graph that in this case this version of

the economic model of giving would outperform a naive model based on the assumption that

contributions do not change in real terms, or that both income and price elasticities are zero.

But it is not obvious that it would be superior to another, somewhat less naive hypothesis that

giving varies proportionately with net income, that is, the income elasticity is one while the

price elasticity is zero.

         In order to compare the performance of these various assumptions about giving

behavior, I calculated the changes in contributions that each model would imply for the 1980-

1984 period. These calculations are summarized in the top panel of Table 6.' Over this

period the weighted average of itemizers' contributions declined by about 11 percent. Because

the number and distribution of itemizers changes over time, this ligure does not measure the

actual change in contributions for all taxpayers or a specified group of taxpayers; it is rather

one summary measure of the change in contributions over the period. The fourth and fifth

columns in each row show the percentage change due to price and income changes predicted by

each modeU The sixth column shows the average percentage by which each model misses the

mark, which may be thought of as the result of changes in "other" variables unrelated to

changes in income and tax policy. The last column gives the aggregate of all errors, measured

in absolute value, as a percentage of 1984 total giving. For example, the basic constant

elasticity model predicts that changes in the price of giving between 1980 and 1984 would have

decreased total giving by itemizers by about 24 percent and that change in net income would

have been responsible for a 2 percent increase. The net of these two effects -- a "predicted"

decline of 22.2 percent -- and the actual decline in giving of 10.5 percent, can be seen as a
                                                                                               23

general shift in giving at all income levels of 11.7 percent. The remaining errors, added

together without regard to sign, amount to 10.4 percent of total giving, the lowest ratio among

the four models shown. This comparison supports the impression given by Figure 1 that the
pattern of changes in giving in response to the 1981 tax act were consistent with the economic

model: income groups facing the biggest price increases tended to show relative declines in

giving.

          The same kind of comparison was performed by comparing contributions in 1985 and

1987. In order to make income definitions comparable between the two years, the portion of

capital gains income excluded from AG! in 1985 was added in calculating 1985 net incomes.

Actual and predicted changes in contributions are shown in Figure 2. In this case the other-

things-equal economic model predicts very little change in giving for the bulk of the income

classes. At the lower end of the scale, where itemizers are scarcer, contributions were

predicted to rise. At the very top, they were predicted to drop, due to the cut in the top tax

rates. As the figure shows, actual changes in giving at the lower end bounced around a good

deal, reflecting the very small number of itemizers in those income classes, though the changes

did remain positive as predicted. There was little change in giving in the middle ranges of

income. At the top, actual contributions fell by more than the amounts "predicted" by the basic

modeL This latter effect might be explained by one factor that certainly did not remain

constant over this period: the stock market, which experienced its crash in October of the

ending year of this comparison. It might also reflect the less favorable treatment of appreciated

gifts by those taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Again, the simple constant

elasticity model performs better than both naive models, with a gross error of 11.7 percent of

total giving?
                                                                                                  24

        The distribution of contributions. Because the tax rate cuts in the 1980s were

concentrated at upper incomes, the price effects in the economic model imply that the share of

contributions accounted for by the wealthy would decline unless increases in income among the

wealthy overcame this price effect? Because data on nonitemizers are not available for most

years, it is impossible to examine how the whole distribution of giving has changed over time.

In order to confine a comparison to a portion of the taxpaying population that is primarily

composed of itemizers and also to keep a fairly constant population, I examined contributions

among itemizers who fell into the top quintile of taxpayers in terms of income in each of three

years.3° The years chosen were 1980, 1984 and 1987, years before and after the two major tax

reform acts of the 198(k In order to describe the concentration of giving, the cumulative

percentage of charitable contributions was compared to the cumulative percentage of two

variables: the number of itemizing taxpayers and their income. The degree to which

contributions are concentrated or evenly distributed can be summarized using a conventional

index of inequality. This index ranges in value from 0, representing complete equality, to 1,

representing complete concentration.3'
       The first approach -- comparing the distribution of contributions to the distribution of

households -- showed little change in the distribution of giving among the top quintile of

taxpayers. There was a slight increase in the inequality of giving among households, with the

index of inequality increasing from 034 in 1980 to 0.38 in 1984 and 1987? This contrasts with

the decrease in the inequality of giving predicted by the economic models. However, when one

compares contributions against income rather than the number of taxpayers, the distribution is

shown to have become much more equaL On this basis, the calculated index of inequality

decreased from 0.15 in 1980 to 0.13 in 1984 and to 0.08 in 1987. In other words, within the

top quintile of taxpayers, the portion of contributions given by the very wealthiest taxpayers has
                                                                                                 25

been declining. Relative to their incomes, these taxpayers gave less in 1987 than they did in

1980. How can these two results be reconciled? The answer is that the distribution of

adjusted gross income in this top quintile became more unequal over the period, probably
reflecting an underlying redistribution of economic income as well as the inclusion in AGI of all

capital gains. This change in measured income distribution allowed the very richest to give a

smaller percentage of their incomes but still account for approximately the same share of total

giving in the top quintile.33
        The 1981 act and contributions by nonitemizers. A third implication of the economic

model of giving relates to one specific provision of the 1981 act, the special deduction for

nonitemizers. In 1985 and 1986 this deduction applied to all contributions made by

nonitemizers, the only difference being that only 50 cents per dollar of contributions were

eligible in 1985 compared to 100 percent in 1986. This change generally implies a decrease in

the price of giving and thus an increased incentive to give. One might expect to see, then, an

increase in nonitemizer giving between 1985 and 1986, other things equal, as well as increases

in nonitemizer giving versus itemizer giving over that period.

        Figure 3 presents a comparison of "predicted" and actual percentage changes in giving by

nonitemizers between the two years, where predictions are derived using the constant elasticity

model. Comparisons are made in this case between the same income group denoted in nominal

dollars, although income and contributions continue to be expressed in constant dollars.

Because of the small number of high-income nonitemizers, income classes above $75,000 are

not shown. One notable feature of the figure is that the model predicts quite small changes in

giving for all income classes, with most of the predicted changes being positive, owing to the

 increased rate of deductibility. The actual changes show substantial variability, but in general

 the average giving for nonitemizers rises over the period, a result which is again consistentwith
                                                                                                26

the economic model. One alternative explanation for this result is that especially generous

donors switched from itemization to nonitemization status in 1986 because of the special

deduction, having the effect of raising average giving by nonitemizers and lowering it for

itemizers. The validity of this possibility can be assessed only by examining panel data when

they become available. As shown in Table 6, the constant elasticity model again performs

better than the naive models in anticipating the pattern of changes in giving.




V. Implications

       Both everyday experience and econometric analysis suggest that taxpayers' charitable

giving would be sensitive to certain kinds of changes in tax law. The 1980s featured two

significant changes in tax law that, according to the dominant economic model of contributions,

should have had a sizable impact on incentives to contribute. The purpose of this paper is to

evaluate that model by determining whether these anticipated changes actually came to pass.

The analysis yields implications that can be summarized in the form of three major points.

       The first point is a reiteration of one that is made above: the economic model of

charitable giving (summarized by equation (1)) is by no means a complete model of giving.
Important non-tax and non-economic factors are excluded from the model. This fact implies, of

course, that there is more to charitable giving than economic factors. More to the point of the

current application, this fact implies that changes in contributions through time cannot be

predicted. Only if the other excluded factors did not change could the model be used to

predict changes in contributions. The best that the model can offer is a counterfactual

statement, or a conditional prediction, for the hypothetical case in which nothing else changed.

If the coefficients of the model are correctly estimated -- however incomplete the model
                                                                                                    27

itself -- this kind of counterfactual statement can be a useful guide in evaluating the likely

impact of tax changes. Accurate prediction of the future, however, is not a reasonable

expectation.
       A second implication arises from the comparison of simulated and actual effects of tax

reforms. It is that the economic model performs reasonably well, in the sense that the changes

in giving are broadly consistent with the model's implications. This consistency is apparent in

three observations. First of all, the surge in contributions in 1986, particularly at the highest

income levels, is consistent with the tax-sensitive timing of gifts. Second, after both tax acts,

contributions tended to fall in income classes that experienced the largest price increases. More

specifically, the basic model out-performed two naive models incorporating no price response.

A third bit of empirical support for the economic model is the apparent redistribution in

contributions among taxpayers in the highest quintile of income distribution. As predicted by

the economic model, the most affluent gave a smaller share of total contributions -- relative to

their income -- following the two tax acts.

        A third implication arises in turn from these results. Because the results are generally

consistent with the economic model, it follo that the predicted effects of tax reform based on

the economic model are worth paying attention to. In the current policy environment, several

possible changes in tax law are discussed from time to time, ranging from the reinstatementof

the nonitemizer reduction to a floor for the itemized deduction. Since these and other changes

could have large effects on the net cost of giving, they could also have a large impact on

charitable contributions.

asset's basis except for certain kinds of stock; it limited the deductibility of travel costs

associated with charitable deductions; it liberalized the deductibility of gifts out of inventory; it

granted certain exceptions to the unrelated business income tax; it made the income of certain

previously tax exempt nonprofits taxable; it made fellowships and scholarships taxable; it

imposed limits on the ability of colleges and universities to issue tax-exempt bonds; and it

lowered the excise tax on some foundations. For a fuller description of the act's provisions

related to nonprofit organizaitons, see Chiechi et al. (1987).

3.        Because the logarithm of zero is not defined, adding a small amount to reported

contributions allows contributions to be expressed as a logarithm. This amount can be thought

of as unreported contributions.

4.        For example, Glenday et al. (1986), using cross section data for Canada, obtain a price

elasticity of -0.15 for high-income donors and zero for other taxpayers. Other studies, using

first-differences calculated from panel data, also yield estimated coefficients smaller than the

benchmark estimates obtained from cross section studies. See, for example, Clotfelter (1980) or

Broman (forthcoming). There are at least three reasons why equations estimated in first

differences might produce elasticities smaller in absolute value. First, the cross section

equations could be subject to omitted variable bias. If price or income variables are

systematically correlated to personal characteristics important in determining charitable giving,
the estimated price and income coefficients could be overestimated in absolute value. Taking

first differences would mitigate that problem. A second reason why elasticities estimated in

first-difference equations might be smaller is that giving might not respond right away to

changes in price and income. This explanation provides the motivation for developing a

dynamic model of giving such as that described in the text. A third reason why the first

difference model would produce smaller coefficients is errors in variables. Because individuals

seldom know exactly what their tax rate is, particularly in the year in which the income is

earned and contributions made, it is quite likely that donors have at best only an imprecise idea

of the year-to-year change in income or price, making the actual change in those variables an

error-prone estimate of the individual's own expected values, which are the variables more likely

 to be influencing behavior.


 5.     See   Clotfelter (1986) for a discussion of the tax treatment of gifts of appreciated

 property.

 6.     Where the tax rate for the Alternative Minimum Tax was 0.21, the price of giving under

 the AMT was (1 - 0.21 - 0.21 Rg* + 0.21g), where g is the gain-to-value ratio in the year of
 the gift and g is the ratio in the year the asset would have been sold. If the donor would not

 have sold the asset, but rather allowed it to pass into his or her estate, the price would

 approach one as g approached 100 percent, as shown by the example given in the text. See

 Clotfelter (1986, p.203).

         Equation (2) implies in general: lnG = (1-h)t lnG0 + [1-(1-h)t]
                                                                         lnG.

  8.     One frank statement came from arts lobbyist Anne G. Murphy, who was head of the

  American Arts Alliance, in the midst of final debate over the 1986 tax reform act: "I hope it
                                                                       trading two lollipops for a
  breaks up. I hope it (tax reform) goes down the sewer. They're

9.      "Treasury I" was a plan that would have cut rates, ended the nonitemizer deduction and

made the itemized deduction subject to a floor of 2 percent of Adjusted Gross Income. For a

description of the model used to project the 20 percent decline, see Clotfelter (1986, p.l99).

Changes," New York Times, August 20, 1986, pJV-11.

12.    Lindsey (1987, p.6'7) cited a difference of 14 percent in the long run while Clotfelter

(1987, p.14) cited differences of 15 and 16 percent, depending on the model used, comparing

contributions under the old and new tax regimes. An estimate made several years later by

Lankford and Wyckoff (1989) implied a much larger percentage difference in giving for

itemizers only, 26 percent, a prediction not necessarily inconsistent with the smaller figures

applying to all taxpayers.

17.    Africare, an organization specializing in relief operations in Africa, experienced a surge

in donations in 1987. The Salvation Army had much higher increases in donations between

1987 and 1988 than other religious organizations, which was attributed to concern over the

homeless. See Anne Lowrey Bailey, "1988's Gifts Barely Keep Pace with Inflation, but Year-

End Rise Heartens Charities," Chronicle of Philanthropy. January 24, 1989.

19.    The standard deduction could result in similar multi-year timing behavior if contributions

represented the difference in deductions that would make itemization worthwhile. For a

detailed treatment of such behavior in general, see Martin Feldstein and Lawrence Lindsey,

Treatment of Charitable Contributions," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper

trend, population, a stock market index, and an indicator of the party of the incumbent

president. For an explanation of the estimation used, see the Appendix A of Giving USA.

23.    An additional limitation of tax return data on contributions is the existence of upper

limits on the deductibility of contribution. For most types of contributions, the deduction is

limited to 50 percent of AGI; any excess can be carried foward into the following five years.

The limit for gifts of appreciated property is 30 percent of AGI, and for gifts to foundations, 20

percent. Relatively few taxpayers are subject to these limits, however.

24.    See Slemrod (1989).


25.    Comparisons were also made for the 1980/1982 period, with very similar results to those

shown for 1980/1984.


26.    One way of seeing the components of changes in contributions is to rewrite the basic

equation for an individual as



(la)   GI/GC =



where all "other" factors are assumed to enter as one variable logarithmically, and E1 is a

multiplicative error term. The term (Y11Y0yh = A is the predicted effect due to the change in

income, (PfP =       B is the comparable price effect, and the effect of shifts in the intercept

and changes in the "other" variable can be combined as       =   (d1/d0)(X1/X0)th.   The percentage

change in giving can then be decomposed as
(ib) lnG-lnG=lnA+lnB+lflC,+lflEi

If all individuals are assumed to be subject to the same proportional changes in "other"

variables, including the intercept, then ( = C becomes a shift parameter common to all
individuals. The extent to which a model fails to explain differences in behavior between

individuals, or income classes in the case of observations based on income classes, will be

reflected in the error term E1.

         Table 6 shows weighted averages for In A and in B, along with the average value of

in C for each of several models, effectively decomposing the actual percentage change in total

giving. For example, the portion due to price is calculated as

(      .. N G In A4)/( 2        N Ga), where i's refer to income classes.
         A useful measure of the degree to which a model fails to explain all changes in giving is

the sum of absolute errors expressed as a percentage of actual giving in the second period:


(      £. N, G (In E1 )I(         N Ga). The measure is calculated for each model and sample

and is presented in the last column of Table 6.


27.       More precisely, the second column in the table is the weighted average of the log

difference in average real contributions between 1980 and 1984, which is approximately the

percentage change. Analogously, the fourth and fifth columns are weighted averages of the

 logarithm of the implied price and income effects which are also interpreted as percentage

 changes.


 28.      The limitations inherent in the calculations of the weighted total giving figures are worth

 emphasizing. Actual total contributions by itemizers in 1987 were $49.3 billion ($46.4 billion in
1985 dollars). Using the 1987 distribution of itemizers as weights, the changes in actual

contributions between 1985 and 1987 imply a total giving figure of $56.3 billion in 1985,

markedly higher than the actual figure of $48.0 billion for itemizers in that year. The reason

for this discrepancy is the significant increase between 1985 and 1987 in the number of

taxpayers in the upper income classes, the classes experiencing the largest percentage decline in

giving. As noted in the text, this increase in the number of high-income taxpayers is probably

the result of changes in the distribution of economic income and the inclusion of all capital

gains in AG!. As long as data from income classes (as opposed to individual returns) are used

for such comparisons, there will be no entirely satisfactory set of weights to use for this

purpose.

29.    See, for example, Clotfelter and Salamon (1982, pp. 177-180).

30.    For each year, I calculated 20 percent of the total taxpaying population and based my

calculation on that group. The top income classes corresponding to this population were

identified and used for the analysis. In the income class where the top quartile began, I

weighted the class's mean values by the percentage of class members who fell into the top

quartile. The transitional income classes, with the percentage of the class falling into the top

quintile by year were: $25,000-$30,000 in 1980 (68.5 percent), $30,000-35,000 in 1984 (31.8

percent), and $30,000-4O,OOO in 1987 (17.3 percent). Because the ratio of total taxpayers to

total households did not change appreciably over this period, basing the quintile calculations on

the number of households seemed appropriate. Calculations were then based on itemized

contributions, number of itemizers, and AG! for itemizers (the latter was estimated for 1987 as

the total AG! for the class multiplied by the percentage of taxpayers who itemized in each
class). For these income classes, the percentage of itemizers was very high. For example, the

percentage of itemizers in 1987, the year with the lowest rate, was 84 percent.


31.    The index can be defined by reference to a graph with the cumulative percentage of

households (or income) on the x-axis and the cumulative percentage of contributions on the y-

axis. Where A is the area between the diagonal line connecting the 100 percent points and the

curve and B is the area under the curve, the index of inequality is A I (A+B).


32.    All of the indices presented in this section are calculated in the manner of gini

coefficients for Lorenz curves, If A is the area under the curie and T is the area of the

triangle under the diagonal, the index is (T.A),T. For the distribution of AG! versus

contributions, this index could take on a negative value, signifying a curve above the diagonal

and a generally decreasing percentage of income devoted to contributions.


33.    The gini coefficient calculated by comparing AG! and number of itemizers for the top

quintile was 0.22 for 1980, 0.27 for 1984, and 0.31 for 1987.

(a) For each gross income, taxable income was estimated by
       multiplying the ratio of taxable income to adjusted gross
       income (AGI) for the corresponding AGI class in that year by
       the gross income figure. Using that taxable income, marginal
       tax rates were taken from the tax table for joint returns.

(b) Assuming the taxpayer is an itemizer, the price of giving cash

       is 1—rn, where rn is the marginal tax rate. In general, the
       price of giving assets is P=l_m_Rg*n. See text. For this
       table, this price is calculated on the assumption that the
       asset would have been sold immediately had it not been donated
       (R=l) and that the gain—to—value ratio (g=g*) is 0.5.
