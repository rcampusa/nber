The main result of Morris and Shin (2002) (restated in papers by Amato, Morris, and Shin (2002)

and Amato and Shin (2003) and commented upon by Economist (2004)) has been presented and

interpreted as an anti-transparency result: more public information can be bad. However, some

scrutiny of the result shows that it is actually pro transparency: except in very special circumstances,

more public information is good. Furthermore, for a conservative benchmark of equal precision in

public and private information, social welfare is higher than in a situation without public

information.

       The main result of Morris and Shin [8] has been presented and interpreted as an anti-transparency
result: more public information can be bad for social welfare. This result has received considerable
attention. It is emphasized in Amato, Morris, and Shin [1]; Amato and Shin [2]; and Economist
[6]. It has been interpreted as suggesting that central banks should exercise caution in how much
information they reveal. “It’s not always good to talk” is the headline of Economist [6]. However,
some scrutiny of the result shows that it is actually pro transparency: except in very special circum-
stances, more public information is good (see also Svensson [11]). Furthermore, for a conservative
benchmark of equal precision in public and private information, social welfare is higher than in a
situation without public information.1
       Angeletos and Pavan [3], Cornand and Heinemann [5], and Hellwig [7], have recently challenged
the Morris and Shin result by extending Morris and Shin’s model in diﬀerent directions.2 In
contrast, this paper challenges the Morris and Shin result in their original model.
       In Morris and Shin’s [8] elegant model, there is a continuum of economic agents indexed by the
unit interval, [0, 1]. Agent i ∈ [0, 1] chooses an action ai ∈ R.3 Let a denote the action profile over
all agents. Agent i has the utility function

                                ui (a, θ) ≡ − [(1 − r)(ai − θ)2 + r(Li − L̄)],                                 (1)

where r ∈ (0, 1) is a constant, θ is state variable representing the state of the economy (the
                       R1                       R1
“fundamentals”), Li ≡ 0 (aj − ai )2 dj, and L̄ ≡ 0 Lj dj. The first term of (1) corresponds to a
standard fundamentals-related utility component: it is higher the closer the action is to the state
of the economy. The second term corresponds to a zero-sum coordination game of guessing other
agents’ actions, corresponding to Keynes’s beauty-contest example. The constant r is the weight
each agent puts on the beauty contest; 1 − r is the weight on the fundamentals-related utility
component.
       Realized social welfare, W (a, θ), is the average utility of the agents (normalized by 1 − r),
                                               Z 1                 Z 1
                                           1
                            W (a, θ) ≡             ui (a, θ)di = −     (ai − θ)2 di.                  (2)

It depends only on the fundamentals-related utility component.
       Each agent receives the same public signal of θ, y = θ + η, where η, the noise in the public
signal, is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 2η . The variance σ 2η is a measure of

      These authors show that more public information increases welfare when there is increasing returns to scale
(Angeletos and Pavan) or monopolistic competition (Hellwig) or when the public information under certain conditions
is not provided to all agents (Cornand and Heinemann).

      x ∈ [a, b] is equivalent to a ≤ x ≤ b. x ∈ (a, b) is equivalent to a < x < b.

the noise in the public signal. Each agent i also receives an individual private signal, xi = θ + εi ,
where εi , the noise in the private signal, is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 2ε
and is independent of η and εj (j 6= i). The variance σ 2ε is a measure of the noise in the private
signal.
       After each agent has received the signals, each agent chooses the action ai so as to maximize
his/her utility. Morris and Shin show that the unique equilibrium action ai of agent i satisfies

                                                      αy + (1 − r)βxi
                                               ai =                   ,                                           (3)
                                                       α + (1 − r)β

where α ≡ 1/σ 2π denotes the precision of public information, and β ≡ 1/σ 2ε denotes the precision
of private information. Because the public signal is common knowledge, in equilibrium each agent
gives more weight to the public signal and less weight to the private signal than their respective
precisions, as shown by the factor 1 − r multiplying the precision of the private signal.4
       Given (2) and (3), expected social welfare for a given θ, E[W (a, θ)], satisfies

                                                          α + β(1 − r)2
                                    E[W (a, θ)] = −                      ≡ V (α).                                 (4)
                                                         [α + β(1 − r)]2

In the rest of this comment, social welfare refers to expected social welfare, is denoted V (α), and
will be examined as a function of α for given β and r.
       Transparency is here defined as the precision of the public signal, α. That is, more transparency
is identified with higher precision of (less noise in) the public signal. The eﬀect of a marginal increase
in transparency on social welfare is then given by the derivative of social welfare with respect to
the precision of the public information,

                                                            α − f (r)β
                                             V 0 (α) =                   ,                                        (5)
                                                         [α + β(1 − r)]3

where f (r) ≡ (2r − 1)(1 − r). Morris and Shin’s main result [8, p. 1529] then follows directly and
can be summarized as: Social welfare is decreasing in transparency, V 0 (α) < 0, if and only if the
condition
                                                        α
                                                          < f (r)                                                 (6)
                                                        β
is satisfied.

       The standard signal-extraction problem with two signals and independent noise results in the equilibrium action
                                                             αy + βxi
                                                      ai =            .
                                                              α+β

    However, scrutiny of the necessary and suﬃcient condition (6) shows that, under reasonable as-
sumptions, the condition is very likely to be violated. If the condition is violated, more transparency
is good and not bad for social welfare in this model.
    First, we note, as did Morris and Shin, that for condition (6) to hold, the weight r must satisfy
the condition r ∈ ( 12 , 1). Otherwise, if r ∈ [0, 12 ] or r = 1, we have f (r) ≤ 0, and condition (6) is
always violated. Thus, each agent must give more (but not all) weight to the beauty contest than
to the fundamentals-related utility component. If not, social welfare is increasing in transparency.
    Second, we note that f (r) ≤ f ( 34 ) = 18 . That is, f (r) has a maximum equal to                  1
                                                                                                        8   for r = 34 .
Thus, even if condition r ∈ ( 12 , 1) holds, condition (6) is violated, if α/β ≥ 1/8.
                                                                                   1
    Thus, whenever the precision of the public signal is greater than              8   of the precision of the private
signal, social welfare is increasing in transparency. In terms of the noise levels, whenever the amount
of noise in the public signal is less than 8 times the amount of noise in the private signal, social
welfare is increasing in transparency. Furthermore, that factor 8 is the minimum factor, which
arises for r precisely equal to 34 . For instance, if r is not     3
                                                                   4   but   5
                                                                             8   or 78 , the factor is 10 23 and social
welfare is even more likely to be increasing in transparency.
    The private and public signals above are signals of θ, an aggregate state of the economy. Central
banks allocate many more resources to collecting, processing, and analyzing data about the economy
than any private agent. It therefore seems extremely unlikely that the amount of noise in central-
bank information should be more than 8 times that in the private information of an individual
agent. Indeed, Romer and Romer [10] have shown that Federal Reserve Board forecasts are more
accurate than private-sector forecasts. Therefore, a rather conservative benchmark case is when
the precisions of the public and private information are equal, α = β, in which case condition (6)
is violated by a wide margin.5
    Figure 1 corresponds to figure 1 in Morris and Shin [8] and gives a visual impression of the
regions of α and β for which social welfare is increasing or decreasing in transparency. The steeply
sloped dashed ray through the origin is the border between the regions. Social welfare is increasing
in transparency in the large region between the dashed ray and the horizontal axis. It is decreasing
in the narrow region between the dashed ray and the vertical axis. The dashed ray is plotted with
a slope equal to its minimum, 8, which arises when r = 34 . For r 6= 34 , the slope of the ray is even
steeper, the region of increasing social welfare is larger, and the region of decreasing social welfare
   5
     In the realistic case that the relevant information concerns not only the state of the economy but the central
bank’s intentions, the precision of the central bank’s information is even more likely to be higher than that of the
private information of an individual agent.

is smaller. The slope of the ray in Morris and Shin’s figure 1 is misleadingly flat (in the default
case when the scales of the two axes are the same).
   The conservative benchmark of equal precision of the public and private signals, α = β, corre-
sponds in figure 1 to a 45-degree ray from the origin. This ray is inside the region of increasing
social welfare, by a wide margin.
   In figure 2, the solid curve shows social welfare as a function of transparency. More precisely,
social welfare (scaled by β and for convenience shifted up by 1.5) is plotted against the ratio α/β
(alternatively, we can for simplicity consider β held fixed at unity). The weight r is set equal to
r = 34 , so the region of social welfare decreasing in transparency is maximized. Social welfare is
decreasing in transparency for α/β < 1/8, has a minimum for α/β = 1/8 , and is increasing for
α/β > 1/8. The dashed curve shows the derivative of social welfare (scaled by β 2 ) with respect
to α–that is, the marginal social benefit of transparency–plotted against α/β. The marginal
social benefit of transparency is negative for α/β < 1/8, zero for α/β = 1/8, and positive for
α/β > 1/8. If the weight r satisfies r ∈ ( 12 , 1) but is diﬀerent from 34 , the minimum of the social
welfare occurs for α/β < 1/8 and the region of decreasing social welfare is even smaller. The
conservative benchmark of equal precision of the public and private signals, α/β = 1, well into the
region of increasing welfare.
   The above discussion refers to marginal changes in transparency. We may also want to consider

                        Figure 2: Social welfare as a function of transparency

non-marginal changes in transparency. We see in figure 2 that social welfare has a local maximum
for α = 0. Therefore, we may want to ask how large α must be in order to bring higher social
welfare than α = 0. In particular, for the conservative benchmark of equal precision of the public
and private signals, is social welfare higher than for α = 0?
   By (4), we have V (0) = − 1/β. We also see that a global maximum of social welfare occurs for
maximum transparency, infinite precision of the public signal, limα→∞ V (α) = 0. We would like
to find the threshold ᾱ > 0 for which V (ᾱ) = − 1/β. Simple algebra gives

                                          ᾱ = β(2r − 1) < β,                                       (7)

where the inequality follows from r < 1. Hence, for α > ᾱ, we have V (α) > V (0). Furthermore,
since r < 1, we have ā < β. Therefore, for our conservative benchmark of equal precision of the
public and private signals, social welfare is higher than for α = 0. In figure 2, where r = 34 , we have
ᾱ/β = 12 , so for α/β > 12 , social welfare is higher than for α = 0.
   However, note that α = 0 corresponds to a the hypothetical situation of no public information.
In any realistic situation in which changes in central-bank transparency is considered, there is always
some public information, corresponding to α > 0, away from the local maximum at α = 0. It is
never feasible to eliminate all public information. Thus, a realistic case of minimum transparency
with a positive α entails lower social welfare than α = 0, making the corresponding threshold ᾱ
even lower than the one in (7). Furthermore, the minimum level of public information might even
be above the small level βf (r) at which social welfare becomes increasing in transparency, making

                                                    5
social welfare always increasing in transparency.6
    In summary, the obvious conclusion is that, for reasonable parameters, social welfare is increas-
ing in transparency in the Morris and Shin model. Furthermore, a conservative benchmark of equal
precision of the public and private signals leads to higher social welfare than when there is no public
information. The Morris-Shin result has been largely misinterpreted as an anti-transparency result,
but it is actually pro transparency.7
   6
       The above analysis is easily extended to the case when the level of transparency is subject to choice and
increasingly costly to achieve. With a positive marginal cost of increasing transparency, at an optimal level of
transparency, social welfare will always be increasing in transparency (if social welfare net of the cost exceeds social
welfare net of the cost at the minimum level of transparency).
   7
       Morris, Shin, and Tong [9] provide discussion of a more elaborate example, with correlated private and public
signals. The private signal is xi = θ + 12 z + 12 εi , and the central bank receives two signals, θ + ωz and θ + εc , where
z, εi , and εc are normal and iid with zero means and unit variances. For this example, ω = 12 would seem to be a
sensible benchmark case (for instance, if the central bank collects and averages the private signals). Then, the central
                                                         1         ω2
bank disclosing its best estimate of θ, y1 = θ + 1+ω       2 ωz + 1+ω 2 εc , increases social welfare, even though the signals
are correlated.
