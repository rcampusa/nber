                           INSIDER POWER IN WAGE DETERMINATION


                                         ABSTRACT

The paper argues that wage determination is best seen as a kind

of     rent    sharing     in   which    workers'    bargaining      power         is
influenced by conditions in the external labour market.                      It uses
British establishment data              from 1984 to show that pay depends

upon    a     blend   of    insider     pressure    (including    the   employer's

financial      performance and oligopolistic position)               and outsider
pressure      (including external wages and unemployment).                   Lester's
feasible 'range' of wages appears typically to be between 8\ and
22\ of pay.       Estimates of the unemployment elasticity of the wage

lie in a narrow band around -0.1.
