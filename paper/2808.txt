     A DYNAMIC ANALYSTS OF hOUSEhOLD DISSOLUTIONAND LIVING ARRANGEMENT
                       TRANSITIONS BY ELDERLY AMERICANS


                                          ABSTRACT




     This paper exploits        the new non-response     files of the Panel Study of

Tncome Dynamics    in order to study living arrangement transitions of elderly
Americans.     The focus of the paper is an estimate of the probabilityof
household    dissolution,      i.e., the probabilities    of transitions   from living

independently      to living with adult children       or other related or unrelated

persons and the probability         of becoming institutionalized,      and an

investigation      of the factors causing such transitions.
     Our main result is an astounding stability of living arrangements even
after incisive life-events such as death of a spouse, onset of a disability,
or in the years immediatelypreceeding death, in particular the large

proportion of elderly who stay living independently until their deaths.
Almost two thirds of all elderly are living independently in the year of
their deaths.  14.4 percent share at least once housing with relatives or

friends,     3.1 percent experiencea stay in an institution.

     Old age, being male or of low income significantly increases the risk of
institutionalization.  Elderly with a large family and nonwhite elderly are
the groups most likely to share housing.  All this might be expected.  An

important new finding, however,         is the time trend    of these   probabilities.

Holding all other factors constant, the risk of institutionalization
increased substantially between 1968 and 1984 while the likelihood of being
"taken in"    by   relatives    or friends markedly decreased.

        1. Introduction1


          dissolution of an elderly persons independent household
        The                                                           either       ——



to live in another household or to becose institutionalized     is an in-  ——



cisive life—event that has many implications for  the well—being of the

elderly person. Most elderly hold moat or all of their wealth in housing.2
In    most cases,       the dissolution of an elderly persons independent household

implies the sale of the house and therefore a substantial change in the

elderly's wealth position.            In   case of institutionalization,    some   of this
wealth    may   be    used to pay    for   front—loaded fees; in the case of moving to

own    children,      the wealth may be transferred to the next generation by

transferring         headahip    of the family    home.



        The choice    of living arrangements by the elderly is also an important
aspect of       the economics of aging at large because of the side—effects in
the    provision of care and the physical environment           that this choice in'—

plies.     Sharing accommodations,          in   particular with adult children, will not

only provide housing for the elderly but also some degree of medical care

and social support for the elderly.                If the elderly perceive sharing accom-

modations       as an     inferior housing alternative and remain living independent-

ly as long as their physical and economic means allow, this social support

and    a larger amount of         medical care have to be picked up by society at

large rather than the family or close friends. Moving to adult children is
also an important substitute for institutionalization. As the private and
social costs of institutionalization are sky—rooketing, the family may have
to become yet again resort for the elderly. This is not only a guestion of
distribution whether the family or society at large pays an otherwise
                     ——



equal    bill.       One may    also argue that independently living elderly are more
 isolated and incur higher costs fur medical care and social support,        e.g.

because of the psychosomatic      effects of isolation or due to a lower inter-

est in preventive care by elderly living alone.



       Household dissolution decisious also have imçortant consequences          for

 the intergenerational     distribution of housing.   In particular   in times   of
 tight housing market conditions with very high housing prices for newly

developed units, the elderly's willingness to move out of the family hcere

is    an important parameter in the supply of more affordable existing homes.

If elderly households stay in their family homes well into their 80's, the
next generation will have little chance to move into the family homes while
their children (the third generation) are being raised and demand for space
is largest. If    houses    of younger families with children are relatively
more spacious than those      of the elderly, the elderly may become perceived
as being "overhoused"      with the notion of intergenerationalinequity.


       Household dissolution may change the   eligibility for certain govern—          -

ment programs.3  Eligibility and transfer level for the food stamp and the
supplemental social security program is determined by the income of the
household, not by the income of the elderly. Elderly who received sup-

plemental social security incc*se may loose this income once they move to
children with own anccme. This may induce elderly to stay living as an in-
dependent household longer than they sey want to in absence      of these trans-
fer   programs.


     Finally, Schwartz, Danziger and Smolensky (1984) point out a perverse
effect in measured income inequality: if the proportion of independently
living   elderly increases, then, ceteris paribus, income inequality will

rise because there axe more small households with low income than if
                                                                     they
had lived in a joint household with a combined larger income.          The incclse

distribution effect is perverse when it was a slight increase in the elder-

ly's income that produced      the increased proportion of elderly livir in-

dependently.       Of course, the effect is purely statistical and vanishes,

when incase inequality is measured not on the level of households, but          on   a
lower level, e.g., on the level of feafly nuclei.4


       This paper studies the demographic and economic determinants of the

elderly's decision to slay living independently or to dissolve the indepen-
dent household in order to choose some kind of shared accommodations or tic,
move in an institution such as a nursing home or a home for the aged. The

main questions being asked are:


  o What are     typical sequences of living arrangements in old age? How
       often do elderly transit between their home, their children, and an
       institution?


  o    Which events precipitate changes in living arrangements?        What are

       typical living arrangement       sequences  after retirement, after death of
       a spouse,    after onset   of   a disability, and in the years preceding
       death?


  o Are    there cohort or calendar—time effects in the preferences for
       certain living arrangements that can be distinguished from pure age
       effects?     Are the elderly becoming more    isolated in the last years?


  o    How many elderly remain living independently until they die? Who are
       the elderly living independently? Are they younger, are they
       wealthier, are they isolated?
  o Are economic conditions (income housing prices) important

       determinants   for the choice among living independently, sharing accom-

       modations, and living in an institution?       Or is the decision        to give

       up an independent household simply determinedby age and health?



       The paper is one of a triad of papers on household dissolution and

choice of living arrangements of elderly Americans          in this volume.        tt

poses some of the same questions (and arricas at        very   similar answers) as

the paper by Ellwood and Kane, using the same data but a very different

methodology.      The coincidence of all major results yields some confidence

in   the robustness of our results in spite of      many   data   problems.    Whereas
this   and Ellwood and Kane's paper concentrate on the demand for dependent
and independent living arrangements, the triad's third paper by Kotlikoff
and Morris is more interested in the supply side and closes a model of
living arrangement choices by providing a structural model of dependent
living arrangements.

       Economic incentives for household formation and, by implication,

household dissolution have been extensively studied for the general popula-

tion in   the seventies.   A   survey of   this literature can    be found    in   Borsch—

Supan   (1986).   With focus on the elderly, this research has        been    picked up

recently by two papers that employ different data sets in order               to study

determinants of  living arrangements for the aged. Schwartz, Danziger and
Smolensky (1984)  employ the Retirement History Survey (miS) to estimate a
binary choice model between living independently end dependently -— that
is, in another household, most commonly that of their children.  In spite
of the size of this data set, their empirical results were mixed, and
neither health nor income effects could convincingly         be   proven, mostly due
to their econometric methodology and the poor health measures available in
the ailS. Boersch—Supan (1988) estimated a multinomial logit model of
living arrangements      on data from the Annual Housing Survey (Ails) that

distinguishes several dependent living arrangements rather than just one
category. Both papers share two important shortcomings: their data sets
prohibited an analysis      that takes institutionalization into account,        and

neither paper performed a dynamic analysis.           Overcoming these two    short-
comings is in the focus of this paper.


     The probability of institutionalization per se is the focus of many
studies that arm reviewed by Oarber and MaCurdy's paper in this volume. In
contrast to these papers, this paper concentrates on permanent in-
stitutionalization as opposed to the more frequent short—term stays in
nursing homes. Garber and MaCurdy's paper provides some link between short
and long—term institutionalization hy mndogenizing duration of stay.


     The   paper   is organized as follows.       As answers   to the   first three
groups   of                     of questions require panel data, and ans-
              the above enumeration
wers to all questions demand data with a lot of detail about elderly per-
sons and their living arrangements, we will first describe the data, their

novelty and problems, and present the construction of the essential vari-
ables. section 3 provides estimates of transition probabilities for all
elderly in our sample.       Sections 4, 5, and 6 are then devoted to three           sub—

samples, each relating to a particular life—event. We will first analyze
transitions in response to the death of a spouse, investigate transitions
after the onset of a disability in Section 5, and will finally focus on the
last five years of life of those elderly who decease during the sample
period. Sections     3   through 6 are organized as variations on a theme and
have a   common   pattern. First,     we   will categorize observed sequences of
                                              —6—



living arrangements and describe their frequencies.            Second, multinomsal

logit models    are employed in order to estimate the weights of potential
causes    for these sequences or choices of living arrangements. The final
section susesarizes the       results and critically discusses    the papers assump-

tions and data sources.



        2. Data   and Variable Definitions


        An empirical investigation of living arrangement transitions faces

many technical problems.            First, the detection of transitions and an

analysis of living arrangement sequences requires a longitudinal data set

that    covers a long time span.         There are just very few long panels in the

United States, the longest being the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

Second, elderly are particularly prnne to become "non—responses'           in a sur-

vey for systematic reasons: although their geographic mobility is low which
alleviates the problem of locating elderly respondents, they may become in-
stitutionalized or decease. In most surveys, these persons are then lost
in the sample. Third, a study of living arrangements needs information not
only    about   the   iimsediate              of the family of the elderly
                                   household, but also
person who may provide alternative living arrangements. Similarly, for
such a study one needs to know a costhination of economic) demographic, and
health variables that is unusual for most general purpose surveys. Final-
ly, the very old may have difficulties in answering questions precisely,
particularly about their health status, so that the interviewer has to
phrase questions       more carefully and double check    answers, Currently, there
is no    data set fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously.




       our analysis is based on the new complete family—individual based file

of   the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) 1968 to 1984.         This file in—
cludes all persons who have ever been interviewed as member of a PSID fasu—

ly.    In contrast to earlier   P8W   releases, it also includes people who are

classified as non_respondents     in the last available interview year (1984),


e.g., persons, who have died in the course of the panel study.         The data

therefore provides a new opportunity to look at the economic and housing

conditions     of the very old, particularly those who have died, and the

transitions preceding death.



       Main advantage of the PSID is its long time horizon of up to 17 years.

This   enables us to create event histories    and   to detect typical sequeoces
of    living arrangemenis, and to estimate transition probabilities that
depend on age as well as on calendar time. Another important advantage               of
the    PSID   for the  of living arrangement decisions is the collection of
                        study
at least some data at the individual level (rather than household level) in
the so—called family—individual file, and the careful recording of
household composition as it relates to the head of household. This makes
it possible to detect elderly living as subfaisilies or as "secondary in-
dividuals" in households headed by their children or other persons.
Finally, the non—response file keeps records for persons even when they
become institutionalized. This is in contrast to all major cross—sectional

data sources that comprise either the institutionalized or the non—
institutionalized population, as well as in contrast to most longitudinal
data sources that have only one non—responsecategory and do not dis-
tinguish between institutionalization, death, or other reasons for        non—

response.


        In   addition to its extreme unwieldiness,6 the PSID has also several

severe shortcomings that limit the kind of analysis        that would be ap-

propriate for the study of the elderly's living arrangements.         Host   irs-.

portantly, the        P5Th does not contain a             systematic record cf the functional
health status of the elderly.             We    will      depend on age and an              indicator for
disability       status as variables proxying health.                    The PSI!)     does not record

structural       housing   characteristics that could allow for                      a precise defini—

tion   of housing prices corrected for guality differences.                                Unit housing

prices must be assigned from external sources such as the American Housing

Survey.      Another problem are         the many    changes and inconsistencies                  in data

collection procedures and variable definitions during the 17 years in which

the PSI!) has been conducted.             Unfortunately,           this also includes the clas-

sification of persons as           institutionalized         and the procedures to               trace    such

persons.      The    creatiun of   an    internally consistent file                  requires a substan-
tial amount       of data processing, and         it was     not always possible to create                  an

unambiguous and consistent          variable definition for                   all   included time

periods.      Finally, though       some information          (e.g.,         age,   sex,    and income) is

recorded by individual household member, other information about in-

dividuals is either subsumed in a household total or available only for

head and spouse. For example, race, number                    of       own    children and siblings,
and retirement date are recorded only for heads of households and their

spouses.      Hence, these variables can           only     be assigned             to individual sample

members     if they    have been head or spouse at least once during the sample

period.      This excludes     some     kinds   of analyses       and creates a             selectivity
bias   in   other analyses.




       As a   first step preceding the analysis,                 the PSI!) family—individual

file was     therefore     converted into a rectangular                file of elderly in-

dividuals.7         Variable definitions cossnon           for all waves were employed, and

time—invariant data that were collected only for heads                              and spouses were as-

signed to     these individuals in periods in which they were neither head nor

spouse.     As   "elderly"   were defined       individuals        who were aged 60 and above
in 1968.       This includes 1134 observations,                Of those, 956 are in year 1968

in the sample and represent a random sample of the population aged 60 and

above.8        An additional 178 elderly are picked up after 1968, typically,

                                                                  sampling   frame.     This part
when they join a family from the original P510)

of the sample is non—random as its inclusion in the sample depends on the

                                          and   will   only be employed when conditioning           on
choice of living arrangement

the origin of transition removes this choice bias.




      eased      on the household information collected in the P503, the main

be   classified according to          four categories:




      — Independentliving arrangements: the elderly's household does not

contain any other adult person beside the elderly individual and his/her

spouse, if any (living arrangement type



      — Shared       living arrangements:          the elderly's household contains at

least one other         adult person      beside the elderly individual           and   his/her
spouse.        Two   cases    can be distinguished:



      —    —   The   elderly   is   head of     household or spouse     of head of      household

(living arrangement type 2).                In this case, the relationship between the

elderly and all other household members                   is   well documented.




       —   —   The elderly is neither head of household nor spouse of head of

household       (living arrangement         type 3).      In this case, the relationship

between the elderly and             the   other household members cannot be unambiguously

determined.          Most    importantly, the data does not provide a distinction
between an elderly person             living in the household of her/his son—in—law and
 an elderly person living with in the household of an unrelated
                                                                person.10



           —   Institutional              arrangements: This category includes elderly

 who are living on         a   permanent basis in   a   health—care related facility

 (living arrangement           type 4).    Examples are living in a home for the aged or

 in    a   nursing home but not temporary hospital or nursing home stays.11



           This categorization deserves some comments.          First, it   would   have been

 desirable to distinguish between adult children/elderly
                                                                      parent—households
 and   households     in   which elderly share accom!eodations with other      related or
 unrelated persons. This  is impossible because of the head—centered record-
 ing of family relationships. Most but not all shared accosssodations
represent adult children/elderly parent—households. Based on the national
file of the 1983 nnual Mousing Survey, 62.1 percent of all composite
households including an elderly person were children/elderlyparent(s)—
households (including in—laws), in 27.2 pnrcent of these households the
elderly        person shared accommodations with a rclated individual other than
child      (mostly siblings), and in the remaining 10.7 percect at least one un-

related person lived in the composite household
                                                (excluding in—laws).12



        second, it would have been desirable to distinguish between
                                                                    parents
who    live together   their adult children because the children have not
                           with
yet left the household (this is a clear possibility for the younger aged
who raised children late in their lives) and
                                             parents who have been "taken
in" by their children but are legal owner of the
                                                 family home and therefore
head of household. This is impossible in lack of a
                                                    complete life—history
of all household members. On the other hand, we make a point of dis—
tinguishing       headship from being a secondary individual in a composite

household.

       Third, the concentration        on permanent   nursing   home    stays   as   a measure
of institutionalization does not correspond to             many published numbers          that
also    include temporary nursing home stays.          Most nursing home stays are

quite brief (e.g.,           for convalescence) and do not imply that the household

was    dissolved        (e.g., by selling the house or moving out of an apartment).

These temporary nursing home stays are             treated like   hospital stays and        the
person's living arrangement is the living arrangement before and presumably
after the hospital stay. It is important to keep this in mind when inter-
preting the relatively small percentages of institutionalized                   persons in

this paper.13




        3.    A Markov Model of             Arrangient transitions

        will first estimate transition probabilities for the entire random
        We

sample of elderly individuals. In addition to establishing some general
tendencies, these transition probabilities will serve as a yardstick when
we study transition probabilities in special situations such as the years

preceding death, the years after death of a spouse, or the years after
onset of a disability.


        Table      1   provides a survey of what happens in the sample:          it presents
the frequencies of living arrangement sequences             among   the 956 elderly whose
life—history           can be traced from 1968 on.    602 of these elderly deceased

during       the   sample period, and 354   elderly survived    until    1984.       The fre-

quencies are reported once for the entire sample, and once for the sub-
sample    of surviving elderly.

        The   first result is
                         the stability of living arrangements in spite of
the long sample period and the large proportion of elderly who die during
this    time span.    More    than two thirds of the elderly in both samples do not
change    their living arrangements at all.          Most of the elderly stay living

independently      through   the entire   sample period     or until their deaths. 14.4
percent    of all elderly shared at least once         a   household not being head      or

spouse of head1 and 3.1 percent have been in an institution                   at least for

one entire year during the sample period.             Apart from a higher proportion

of multiple changes, there is astoundingly little difference between the

two   subgroups    in the sample, the surviving elderly and         those     who   deceased
before    1984.




        This large proportion     of stayers creates a problem in the specifica-

tion of transition probabilities.          First, with only relatively few transi-

tions, the statistical base for the estimation              of parametric transition

probabilities      is very small.    1    choose not to employ     relatively sophisti-
cated    hazard-models based on continuous time since they are more likely to

generate           results than simple Markovian models. The paper by
              imprecise
Ellwood and Kane included in this volume provides an analysis of living ar—

rangements parallel to this one using the same data but duration models
based on      an exponential hazard.      It is interesting to note that all im—

portant    qualitative conclusions from these two papers coincide in spite                of
the different methodologies.



       Second, the large proportionof stayers suggests             that   a   model of

 demographic   and economic variables.     There are   no   elderly who stay in an

 institution throughout       the entire sample period (S4O).       Two sets of

 estimations   are provided: one for the entire sample, combining stayers who

 died during the sample period and stayers who survived at least until 1984:

 and one set of estimations for the surviving elderly only.

       Most   variables employed in Table 3 are         self—explanatory.      AGK68   is   age

in year   1968.    SINGLE (MARRIED)     is a   dummy   variable denoting that the
elderly   wax   single   (married) during      the entire   sample period.     SPERM   is the
average incoem during the sample period.               NONWHITE   includes black,
Hispanic, Asian, Pacific, and Native American elderly.                KIDS    (5185) denotes

the number of own children (siblings) if reported, NOKIDS (NOSIBS) is a
dummy variable denoting that the elderly has no children (siblings).

Finally, the dummy variables MDKIDS (MDSIBS) indicate missing data on num-
ber of children (siblings).        The variables KIDS and RIBS are only reported

in years when the elderly person was head of household or spouse.18                    Thus

data on own     children   and siblings   is unavailable     whenever an      elderly person

was never head of household or spouse during the entire sample period.
This lack of precise data about potential family support in this case is a

major draw—back of the data. The duimxy variables              MDKIDS   and   MOSIBS   that
indicate these cases eliminate any bias in the              KIDS and NOKIDS     variables
(SIBS and NoBlES, resp.) for those elderly in which this information is

available.




       The positive coefficients of the SINGLE and MARRIED variable indicate

that   the probability of being "mover" increases by experiencing               a marital
status              in almost all cases represent death of a spouse. This
          change which
is of course not surprising, and we will analyze the living arrangement ad-
justments after the death of a spouse in the following section. Male
elderly    are much more    likely to   be movers than female elderly.           Note that

this effect is measured holding marital status constant.                 As we will see,

this effect will       become even more pronounced when we       study the cases in
which a      spouse   deceased. Pace has   a very     strong isçact on the stayer
probabilities.         Being nonwhite decreases      the prohability   uf staying
independent or as        secondary individual, but increases the probability of

heading      a composite household.    There are no      measurable income effects,   nor

does    the elderly's age in     year 1968 affect the scver—stayer proba-

bilities.19




        Although the measurement of the "supply—side"          variables for shared

living arrangements   the numberof own children and siblings —— is marred
                           ——



by the above—mentionedincomplete information on these two variables, we

can ascertain that the probability of being a stayer in the category "In-
dependent Living Arrangements" increases with being childless, just as the
presence of children and siblings increases the probability to be stayer in
the two shared accosssodation categories. These latter two effects are
however very small. We conclude that most shared living arrangements are
of a transitory nature. The probability of staying as secondary individual
is most strongly affected by the MDKIDS and MDSIBS indicator variables.
This    is not surprising because by construction          these variables work essen-

tially    as choice-specific constants         for the choire of living arrangement
type    3.




       There is little significant difference between the two subgroups in

our    sample.    Due to the smaller sample size, the results for the surviving

elderly are less precise.         This is particularly true for the third column

(staying with others as secondary individual).



       We will now turn to the transition probabilities of those             elderly who
changed      their living arrangement at least       once during the sample period.

As is obvious from Table 2, sons of these transition probabilities are very

 low, and it is therefore impossible to separately relate all 16 transition

probabilities      in a meaningful    way         to the above set      of relevant demographic

and economic     variables.     Table     4   provides        some results for the transitions

between living arrangement types              1     interestingly for our
                                                  and 2, and, most

topic household dissolution, the transitions into type 3 (living with
others as secondary individual, in most oases being "taken in" by adult
children) and type 4 (institutionalization). The upper panel describes the
binary choice between staying in either a type 1 or type 2 living arrange-
ment    and a transition to type      2   or      1,    respectively, conditional    on having
been    identified as mover at least at sorts point in time, not necessarily

this time.      Possible transitions to            the other
                                                        categories 3 and 4 are
                                                                 two

being   ignored,   making   usage of the logit functional form and the in-
dependence of irrelevant alternatives. The lower panel pools all origins
in order to gain degrees of freedom in estimating the transition
probabilities into the latter two living arrangement types.

       Most   of the variables have already been introduced in
                                                             Table 2. In ad-
dition,   we now measure some demographic and economic changea that occurred

concurrently with the transition.                 DINCOME     denotes the magnitude of a real
income change,     DMARN   denotes   a change in marital status )1='becoming

married,   O=no change, —1=loss of a spouse, divorce, or separation), and

DLIM indicates a change in limitation status (1=health status worse than

previous year, O=no     change,   —1=health status better than previous year).

        We    will first comment   on   the left part of the upper panel in Table 4

 that     reflects   the choice between a transition from living indepeodently to

 sharing a household as head or spouse of head, and staying independent.

 The loss of a spouse (DMARR),2° change in the severity of a
                                                             disability

 (DuN), and a loss in income (DINCONE) are          the   most important determinants

 that precipitate      this transition.     All other things equal, elderly women
 tend to stay independently whereas elderly men rather tend to share accom-

 modations.      These results correspond to the same effects in the stayer

 population.  Not being married in the first place strongly increases the

 likelihood of a transition, as does the presence of children, of siblings
 (though statistically not significant) , and being nonwhite. Neither age
 nor calendar time     significantly     alters the transition probabilities        between

 living   arrangement types    1   and 2, nor does the level    of   income.


        Not
         surprisingly, the reverse transition     breaking up a composite
                                                       ——


household to become independent, right part of upper panel in Table 4 -— is
essentiallycharacterized by the opposite mechanisms. Some of these
transitions appear to be statistical artifacts, iuch as the marriage with a
person who was already living in the household as an unrelated
                                                               secondary
individual. This may be indicated by the strong coefficient of DMARR.
Note   that nonwhite    as well as male elderly are more       likely to   ohange   living
arrangements, as     was   the case in the reverse transition.


     The lower panel indicates the probabilities of
                                                    being taken in by
others and beooming institutionalized. As is evident, both
                                                            probabilities
increase with age, in particular the risk of
                                              institutionalization. Being
or becoming single and being male also increases these
                                                        probabilities.  The
presence of children or siblings decreases the risk of
                                                        institutionaliza-
tion, and increases the likelihood of being taken in, as is expected.

 Again, the measurement        of this "fasily support-supply effect" suffers       from
 the    large number of observations for which a precise number of ohildren or

 siblings cannot be ascertained        (as indicated by the variables MDKIDS       and
 MDSIBS). Most transitions into institutionalization or subfamily status

 are    from
          living arrangement types 2 through 4, as indicated by the strong
 negative coefficient on the variable ORIGIN1 that denotes transitions from
 living independently, once again reflecting the stability particularly of
 the    independent living arrangement category.        Finally, and this is worth

emphasizing, we observe a strong negative income effect on the likelihood

of     entering   an   institution. Institutions are clearly      viewed as   inferior
living arrangements.

                to the probabilities in the upper panel, the transition
        As opposed

probabilities into institutions and being taken in are non—stationary.
This    is indicated by the effect on the variable YEAR which          measures
calendar time.         probability of institutionalization, controlling for
                         The

all    other factors included in the lower panel, exhibits an increasing
trend, although measured imprecisely.          The   likelihood of being taken   in,
however, decreases between 1968 and 1984, with a large and             statistically
highly    significant coefficient.       This result has   a   strong and isportant im-

plication:       there   appears to be a decreasing inclination of the family or
friends to take care of "their" elderly, and an increasing reliance on              in-
stitutions       such as nursing homes with their related private and social

costs.     The parameter estimate of the risk of institutionalization           is not

measured       statistically   precisely because it is based on relatively few

transitions.        If one anyway takes this estimate as best available guess,

then it translates         to a yearly increase of about 7 percent,    that is, a dou-

bling of the risk of institutionalization within 10 years.21
       It.    !4fln Arrangent Chaeg after Death                of a


       The    analysis in the preceding section suggested that death of                 a   spouse

is the cost important life—event precipitating a change in living arrange-

ments.       The logit regressions in Table 4 related living arrangement adjust-

ments to a concurrent change in marital status.                 This section will take         a

closer    look   at      the dynamics     of what happens after the death of a spouse by
studying not only changes               in the concurrent year but also in consecutive
years.

       In our    sample, 317 elderly experienced the death of their spouses and
survived at      least one further year. Table 5 presents the frequencies with
which    living arrangement transitions              occur in the year     of the spouses
death and in the following years.


       Clearly, the transition probabilities in the year of the spouse's
death (panel        B)    are   quite   different   from what they   are   in the   general
population (panel A, from Table 2). mtarting from living independently,

the transition probability of joining another household as heed of house-
hold becomes twice as large. The transition probabilities to subfamily
status and into an institution increase even more than tenfold (first row
in panel B).          If the elderly couple headed a composite household,               the death

of the spouse also resulted in a much elevated likelihood                     that this common

household is broken up, either leaving the surviving spouse alone in the

family home or as a new independent household (second row in panel B).

Note that the probability of becoming institutionalized                     is very high in the

year   in which the spouse deceases. In               a formal test,   the equality of
panels    A   and   B    is strongly rejected.22

        A   comparison of the panels in Table S                 clearly shows that most living
arrangement adjustment in                 response to death      of a spouse have taken place
already     in   the concurrent year.              Though    panels   C through E        are   still
statistically different from panel A, the size of the chi—squared test
statistic is much lower as compared to the test between panels A and B.
One year after the spouses death, the probabilities of a transition between

shared and independeot living are still elevated, but this is reversed in

the second year.


      Table      6    presents     some    logit   estimation results        for   the    first year
transitions.           They confins the general tendencies detected                      in   Table 4   for
all   movers also        for this     special case of transitions zest               likely      pre-
cipitated by          the death of a spouse.           Unfortunately, the small sample size
prevents a more          detailed analysis, for instance,               a   stratification by living
arrangement          prior   to death of spouse.




                             Please   insert Table      6 about here




      The presence           of   children or siblings increases the probability                   of
being   taken in after the spouse's death.                    Old age, low income to begin

with, or an income loss increase the likelihood of a transition into an in-

stitution.       Female elderly are more likely to stay living in the family

home than widowers.               If a health limitation develops            concurrently with the

death of a spouse, the surviving           elderly is most likely taken in by the

                                                                           Nonwhite elderly
family or by friends rather than being institutionalized.

are less likely to stay independently than white elderly.



      Living arrangement prior to the spouse's death is accounted for by the

variable oRIGINi   (if independent) and,            though indirectly, by the missing

data indicators.     Note that because 1101(109 and MONIES essentially            serve as

indicator variables    for categories        2   and 3, introduction of variables such

as ORIGIN2 and 0510153 would result in almost perfect collinearity with

MOXIDS and MOSIBS.    The negative sign of           01(10151   (the reference case) and

the positive signs of the statistically significant missing data variables
indicate the smaller likelihood of a change as compared to staying in
living arrangements    1   , 2 and 3.


      Stationaric of       these transition probabilities         is clearly rejected:
the results confirm the existence and the direction of the time trends               al-
ready discovered in Table 4, All other determinants equal, institution-
alization is   becoming more       likely,   and being taken in by family       or friends
is becoming less likely       as   tire   proceeds fran 1968     to   1984.


      5. Living Arrangenent Changes after Onset of               a Disability

      The logit estimates for all elderly movers in Table 4 did also confirm
the common sense notion that disability status is an important factor
determining an elderly's living arrangement. This section makes an attempt
to identify oases in which a disability occurs suddenly in order to in-
vestigate the time pattern of living arrangement adjustments precipitated
by this event.
                                                    —23—



       In fact, changes in disability status are quite hard                         to   measure, in

general    and   particularly           in the PSID.       The question in the       survey ("Are you

limited by a         health condition?") provides for four                answers    ("A lot", "Some-

what",    "A   little",    and No         ( that   depend on the subjective self—rating of
the   elderly person. Prior to                1976, only two    categories    were provided

("Yes" and       No(.1l      Not    too surprisingly, limitation histories are                    charac-

terized by      a lot of ups and downs that may partty reflect actual subjective

feelings,      and    partly arbitrariness in the choice             of    categories.       In addi-

tion, many elderly experience a gradual decline in health status with no

clear onset of a disability that could be classified                        as "one event."




       We define the onset of a disability quite conservatively as a

permanent change in disability status: in order                     to    qualify, disability

status must he "No" for at least 5 years, then "Yes", "Somewhat", or "A
lot" for at least another 5 years. With this definition, we count 237
elderly-in our sarrqise who esperience a well defined and sudden change in
health status. Table 7 presents the actual number of transitions that cc—
cur in the year of the health change and in the three years thereafter.
Elderly persons who         are    in    a nursing home are excluded          in this sample be-
cause their limitation status is not recorded.

      Unfortunately, main conclusion from these                   transitions is that            the nor—
bers of actual changes are too small to draw reliable conclusions.                               A

formal    test of whether the            corresponding conditional transition probabili-
ties are   equal to those         predicted in the lower panel of Table 2,                  is   signi—

nificant     one year later, and insignificant       two and   three   years later.        If
a   reliable result can be estracted from Table 7, then it is a larger

probability to stay in living arrangements           type 2 and 3 (i.e., living

together with children, other relatives, or unrelated persons( in response

 to a sudden health change to the worse.          Unfortunately,     the lack of dis-

ability data for institutionalized persons made it inpcssible to deiect

transitions into nursing homes after the death of a spouse.




      It should be noted that these weak results are only apparently in con-

trast to     the strong eignificance of the variable DLIM (change in the

severity of limitation relative to the previous period( in the previous

logit analyses.      This section limits itself to the obviously rare cases of

sudden well—defined unidirectional health changes, whereas the variable

DLIN picks up many small changes.         In fact, the idea of a sudden onset of a

disability     rather   than a gradual change that eventually        islioates living
arrangement     adjustments may be inappropriate, or, if such a thing as a sud-

den onset exists, the measurement of it by a subjective self—rating rather

than a     functional index of ability may be misleading.           Some e'.idenoe   for

the latter explanation can be found in Boersoh—Supan,              Icotlikoff, and Morris

(1988(.      They show that among the health variables available in their data

set functional ability is the one that best explains living arrangement

ohanges,     rather than subjeotiva health indexes or indicators of actual
medical    conditions.




      6.     Living Arrangement Changes in the Years Preceding Death




      This    last section investigates where      the   elderly   spend the   last five
years of their lives.       We   will count   time backwards (measuring something
like negative age) and construct a panel that starts with the year of
each elderlys death for those 602 elderly for whom date of death is ob-
served. of those, 448 elderly have at least five years of complete data.
Table 8 presents the cross—sectional           distribution of living    arrangement

types   by   year before death, and Table 9 displays the frequency of            all
living arrangement        sequenoea observed    in this   sample.




                         Please insert Tables 8 and 9 about here




        The main message from     two tablea is, once again, the stability
                                   these
of living arrangements    even in
                              ——   the years immediately preceding death.
Almost four out of five elderly (79.7 percent) do not change their living

arrangements during        this time.   Note   that this fraction is   even    larger than
in the Alderly population as a whole.            Though one   might expect a decreasing
mobility     with very old age in general,25 there is also an increase in the

necessity to adjust living arrangements in this segment of life, for in-

stance induced by an increasing frailty in the years preceding death.                   ob-

viously, at least in this PSID sample, the first mechanism              is   stronger   than

the second.




        Mere than half (55.4 percent) of the elderly have been living indepen-

dently until their deaths.         Every fifth of all elderly (20.1 percent) has

been taken     inher/his children, relatives, or friends at least once
                    by
through the     last five years before death,
                                          moat of them (15.2 percent) at
least for these five years. Finally, about six percent of the elderly
became institutionalized during this tine period, almost all of whom stay

so until their deaths.

on very weak      feet., Hence, we will recur to cross—sectional analysis in
this section.          Table 10 provides      a cross—sectional analysis of where the
elderly choose to live within             their last five years  of life. The sasple

consists of all observations             with cosplete data.26




                          Please   insert Table 10 about here




        The analysis in Table 10 confirms what we have learned so far and

shows    that   of these effects are particularly pronounced for the very
                sose
old and   rest vulnerable elderly.Female elderly are more likely to live

independently than male elderly. Black or Hispanic elderly have a higher
likelihood of living in shared accommodations, as do elderly with many
children. Being married has the expected strong positive effect on living
independently.          Finally, the variable YEAR that indicates calendar—time

(not tire before         death)   once   again   displays the trend towards institutiona-

lization and away         from composite households.          Note   that in this   sample   of
the   very old    the magnitude of this trend is particularly                pronounced.   This

is a disturbing finding as it appears to indicate a trend towards isolation

of those who are particularly vulnerable.



        A new   variable included        is   denoted by   AGEKID   and measures the age     of
the oldest child. The strong negative coefficient of this variable in the
leftmost column that characterizes               composite households headed by the
elderly   person appears to indicate the presenca of adult children who have

never left home.          As was mentioned already in Section           2,   it would have been

desirable     to separate these cases     from   other     shared   living arrangements.
However,     the   lack of complete   life—histories of all household            mesthers makes

this   impossible.



       Two economio     variables are included. The elderly person s incomehas
                                                                             •




a   measurable effect only on the probability to become               institutionalized,
the negative       sign shows the inferiority of this alternative —— a familiar

result by now.       The newly introduced variable          HBURDEN is the proportion of

income which the household cost spend on housing; actual gross housing

costs (either rent or user costs of homeownership               plus utilities) are

divided     by household income. For    institutionalized persons, it measures
the last housing burden       before institutionalization. For elderly heads, a
large burden is a small but significant incentive to share housing.                     A

large housing burden appears also to be a factor that increases the
likelihood     of entering an institution.



       7.    Suary and Conclusions

       We   employed the newly—available non—response file            of the Panel     Study

of    Income Dynamics    to study the    living arrangements        of elderly Americans.

In spits    of being a    general purpose study that contains all some 1100

                                                                                        suited
elderly aged 60 and above, this file is on first sight particularly

to study the elderly's living arrangements since it includes long histories

of living arrangements and       their    demographic and      economic   determinants and

since it keeps the elderly in the sample when they decease during the

sample period or, most importantly, become institutionalized.                     No other

representative data set combines euth            a   long time horizon as the P510 with

a complete recording of non—responses due to death or institutionalization.

Co the other hand, problesm with the data              —   being only partly individual—

oriented   with an incosplete recording of family relationshipat onro

secondary individuals are    living in a composite     household      mountttenr.tes
in the treatment of   institutionalization and a       sample size ton small       for
the few observed transitions   substantially inhibited the possihte kinds
                                  ——



of longitudinal analyses. A longitudinal study specifically for the elder-
ly is still highly desirable      for dynamic analyses of the elderly's living

arrangement transitions.



     Main result of the paper is the stability of living arrangements.

Even after incisive life—events such as death of a spouse or onset ot a

disability, and even within the last five years before death often as-

sociated with a guick deterioration of health, only very few             elderly   adjust

their living arrangement, say, in order to move into the household of their

children or to live in an institution.




     This stability, however, puts the analyst         in    position as
                                                            an awkward

the resulting small absolute                    in the PSID creates a
                                  number of changers

problem for the dynastic analysis. It is cur opinion that there are just
ton few people to support a rich dynamic analysis. A gobe example for thi
point is the analysis in the preceding chapter. A well—suited statiatio.ol
model would have been a fixed effects nodel that accounts for time-
invariant but unobserved differences ("heterogeneity") among the elderly,
such as frailty.27     However,   the conditioning on fised effects necessary

for consistent parameter estimation also removes all other time—invariant

determinants because these are collinear with the fised effects.              To put it

simply,    only time variation identifies the dynamics of a dynamic model.
Little time variation in the remaining variables and           few   transitions   ob-
served in the sample render the resulting fixed effects model completely
unsatisfactory.28
        therefore employed very simple models, hoping that simplicity will
       S'Je


ansure robustness. daselne transition probabilities were estimated using
a   mover—stayer model that accounts in the most simple way for unobserved

hetercgeneitv and the transition probabilities                         in   the three special cases

investigated         were parametrized       mm   parsimoniously as          possible.     S4a   think
this strategy is         more   appropriate than employing continuous—time hazard
models.       (Is   one hand,   the   data   appears to     be   too   weak    to allow for proper
identification of heterogeneity and state dependence that could provide the
rich dynamics hazard models mre able to generatc. Ignoring state
dependence          and unobserved hatarogeneity, however,                  say render hazard models

inappropriate when important             variables such as health are              unobserved.


       In     spite of all these       problems, we arrived            at quite a    few   results that
appear to be robust and are important for the assessment of where the
elderly chome to live and what implications this choice has for the elder-
ly's   well—being.        These results are        robust    am   they can      be drawn    not only
from   the different models in this paper but also from Ellwood and Kane's

(1989) analysis based on a simple exponential hazard model.                           They are im-

portant as they indicate where, if at all, public policy could improve the

well—being of the elderly: there appear to be only a fme intervention

points —— most importantly death of a spouse —— when                          active decisions about
living arrangements         are being made.

   o Loss    of a   spouse is the most important event that       precipitates living
       arrangement    transitions.    Almost all of these transitions        take place

       in the same    year   as the spouse's death.




   o   Living in an institution is clearly an inferior living arrangement                   In

       terms nf income, even in the years immediately          preceding death when

       medical   attention is    most valued.


   o Male elderly are rore       likely to live    with   others or to    become    in-
       stitutionalized than female elderly who most likely stay living in-
       dependently until their deaths. This is holding all other
       determinants, particularly marital status, constant.


   o There is a pronounced difference in the choice of living arrangements
     between white and nonwhite elderly. Nonwhite elderly are much more

       likely to live    with others in a composite household.


   o In    spite 0± the perceived inferiority of institutions, the risk of in-
       stitutionalization has substantially risen fran 1968 to 1984, while
       the likelihood of being "taken in" by relatives or friends has fallen

       dramatically.


This   disturbing tendency towards isolation of the elderly           —   particularly
pronounced   ameng the very old who are also the most vulnerable ——                is the
most   important    message of this paper.      As pointed out   n   the introduction,
this growing isolation of the elderly has downstream consequences in terms
of medical expenses and social support that are rather costly for society
at large and that have to be borne by a decreasing proportion of younger

people —— not        mentionirs the psychological         and physical   problems for the

elderly themselves caused by growing isolation.

   between the coeffioients in the ta subgroups  which not the case.   is

      spouses but there        are

21.    The parameter estimate of the risk of being taken in implies a yearly
      decrease of over 26 percent at sample average. This percentage change
      —— this is a relative change, not a change in absolute percentage points
      —— is too
                large to be moaningfully extrapolated for 1 0 years because in
      the highly nonlinear logit model the effect of a change depends on the
      magnitudes of the choice probabilities.
22. The    fast is constructed as a joint test of the             16   conditional transi-
      tion probabilities. Because only the rows, not       the columns in each
      table are adding up, the thi—squared statistics      have 12 degrees of
      freedom.       At 99 percent confidence, the critical value is 26.22.

   Feinstein and McFadden (1988) report increasing mobility rates for
   elderly aged 75 and above based on BOlD data, but do not investigate the

      bias  and panel bias. Both appear innocent in this case. The way in
      which data on children and siblings is imputed implies that elderly who
      live as secondary individuals in a composite household and in-
      stitutionalized elderly have a larger than proportional share of missing
      data.   However, the resulting sample selectivity is innocent due to in-
      clusion of constants and the logit functional form (McFadden 1978). The
      pooling of cross—sections in this nonlinear model may result also in
      biased coefficients.   The bias appears to be of no quantitative im-
