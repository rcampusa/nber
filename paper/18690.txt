Comparing the Happiness Effects of Real and On-line Friends

                                            ABSTRACT

A recent large Canadian survey permits us to compare real-time and on-line social networks as sources
of subjective well-being. The sample of 5,000 is drawn randomly from an on-line pool of respondents,
a group well placed to have and value on-line friendships. We find three key results. First, the number
of real-life friends is positively correlated with subjective well-being (SWB) even after controlling
for income, demographic variables and personality differences. Doubling the number of friends in
real life has an equivalent effect on well-being as a 50% increase in income. Second, the size of online
networks is largely uncorrelated with subjective well-being. Third, we find that real-life friends are
much more important for people who are single, divorced, separated or widowed than they are for
people who are married or living with a partner. Findings from large international surveys (the European
Social Surveys 2002-2008) are used to confirm the importance of real-life social networks to SWB;
they also indicate a significantly smaller value of social networks to married or partnered couples.

1    Introduction
There are constant changes in the types of activities that people engage in, and in
the technologies they use to establish and enjoy their social connections. For exam-
ple, Robert Putnam (2000)’s analysis of movements in social capital in the United
States over the 20th century showed that memberships in most US organizations, the
frequency of dinner parties, league bowling, and many other types of social connec-
tion grew for the first 70 years of the 20th century and declined thereafter. Some
commentators and researchers argued that there were new types of social connection,
possibly more effective in nature, that were growing and possibly offsetting the ef-
fects of declines elsewhere. One of the key examples offered was the substitution of
on-line for face-to-face friendships. The internet could thereby be seen as providing
ways of enhancing or replacing face-to-face friends through the availability of on-line
social networks. How can the effects of these differing trends be compared? To judge
the importance and value of differing forms of friendship requires a common basis
for valuation. The broadening availability of data for subjective well-being offers one
possible solution to this valuation problem. If it were possible to measure each in-
dividual’s network of on-line and real-life friends, then their respective contributions
to subjective well-being could provide a way of comparing their values, and hence to
judge whether the quality of social networks as a whole was growing or shrinking.
Only very recently has there been a survey that provided comparable measures of
networks of real-life and on-line friends, set in the context of a well-being survey of
sufficient size and scope to permit comparable assessments of the two types of friends.


2    Literature Review
Friends and family are a long-established support for subjective well-being. Friends
matter to happiness both for just being there, and for the pleasures from time spent
together, whether at work, at play, or in activities for the benefit of others. Data from
the Gallup World Poll suggest that having someone to call on in times of trouble is
associated with a life evaluation that is higher, on a 0 to 10 scale, by almost half a
point (Helliwell et al., 2009, page 298). This is more than the equivalent of increasing
household incomes by 150%. There is also a dose-response relationship, so that having
more friends is better than having fewer. Evidence from the Canadian General Social
Survey shows that, compared to respondents having no close friends, to have 3 to
5 close friends is associated with life satisfaction 0.24 points higher on a 10-point


                                           1
scale, an amount that rises to .32 for those with 6 to 10 close friends, and to 0.43
points for those with more than 20 close friends (Helliwell and Wang, 2011, 67).
Also notable is that happiness depends not just on the number of close friends, but
also the frequency with which they are seen.1 Other US and Canadian surveys also
reveal a strong relations between subjective well-being and the frequency of seeing
friends, with those seeing friends most frequently having subjective well-being higher
by 0.5 points on a ten-point scale (Helliwell and Putnam, 2004, Table 1). All of these
results are based on fully specified models with many other control variables, although
there is no doubt likely to be some remaining element of mutual causality between
subjective well-being and the frequency of seeing friends. For example, those who are
at the bottom end of the subjective well-being scale, and especially those who are
clinically depressed, often reduce the extent to which they reach out to friends.2 Thus
some of the strong positive linkages between friends and happiness may reflect causal
influences running in both directions. This is likely to apply for both real-life and
on-line friends, and hence should not affect our comparisons in this paper between
these two types of friends.
   There are fewer studies of the linkages between on-line friendships and subjective
well-being. Kim and Lee (2011) find a positive relation between subjective well-being
and number of facebook friends among a sample of 391 college-age subjects. Another
study of college-age respondents in the United States, while not directly investigating
the links between facebook usage and subjective well-being, did find evidence that
facebook usage was correlated with proxy measures of social capital, but only for
those with relatively low levels of satisfaction with campus life (Ellison et al., 2007).
An earlier study of social capital and internet usage in a sample of US adolescents
(Gross et al., 2002) found no significant relation between subjective well-being and
time spent on-line. Those who spent more time messaging with close real-life friends
were happier. Conversely, the relation between on-line time and subjective well-being
was negative for those in contact with strangers or purely on-line friends. A recent
study of Egyptian students found no significant relation between life satisfaction and
   1
      See van der Horst and Coffé (2012) and Helliwell and Wang (2011). The same survey also asks
about the number of close relatives, and the frequency with which they are seen. An interesting
difference appears between friends and family. The number of close family matters more than the
number of close friends, about twice as much up to 15 in number, with no gain thereafter, while
frequency of seeing family contributes only half as much as the frequency of seeing close friends
(Helliwell and Wang, 2011, 68). A similar result is found in US and other Canadian data analyzed
by Helliwell and Putnam (2004) (see Table 1), where it is shown that the frequency of seeing friends
adds twice as much to subjective well-being as does the frequency of seeing family.

3     Data and Summary Statistics
The primary dataset for the paper is the 2011 Happiness Monitor survey sponsored
by Coca-Cola and conducted in Canada between January 20 and 31, 2011 by Leger
Marketing, using their online panel LegerWeb. The sample include 5,025 Canadian
residents, aged 16 and over, drawn from all ten Canadian provinces. The survey
focuses on subjective well-being, and has questions that cover self-evaluation of life
and other questions that can be used to construct alternative measures of well-being.
It also has questions on people’s opinions about how various elements in life contribute
to happiness. A section called Canadiana has occasionally light-hearted questions
such as what is the happiest job in Canada, with a list that includes Zamboni driver
and lumberjack.
   From our perspective, the most interesting questions (other than the ones on
well-being) are those on the size of social networks, separately for real-life friends and
online friends. This presents an opportunity for us to examine potential differences
between these two types of networks, specifically in their contributions to subjective
well-being.
   We use regression analysis to relate measures of subjective well-being to the sizes of
social networks, as well as income and demographic controls. We will also use control
variables to pick up differences in personalities; such variables include self-reported
stress, time spent exercising and contributions to charitable causes.
    The survey’s primary measure of subjective well-being is an 11-point (from 0 to
10) life ladder, based on the question “Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered
from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the
best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible
life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you
stand at this time?” This question, also known as Cantril’s Self-Anchoring Ladder, is
frequently used in well-being studies, including the recent World Happiness Report
(Helliwell et al., 2012) and many studies cited therein. We plot the distribution of
sample responses in the first panel of Figure 1. The mode is “7” with a quarter of the
respondents. The next greatest concentration is “8” with about 20% of the response.
The sample mean is 6.8, significantly lower than for the Canadian ladder responses
in the Gallup World Poll, as shown in figure 2.3 of the World Happiness Report.
    It is possible to construct two other measures of well-being from the survey. One

                                            3
is life satisfaction, based on the four-point responses to the question “To what extent
do you agree with each of the following statements” that include a statement “I am
satisfied with my life”. The four points are “strongly agree”, “somewhat agree”,
“somewhat disagree” and “strongly disagree”. The second panel of Figure 1 shows
the distribution. The mode, covering more than 50% of the responses, is “somewhat
agree”. Another potential measure is the response to the question “How happy are
you at the beginning of 2011? Very happy, somewhat happy, somewhat unhappy,
very unhappy.” The distribution of happiness is similar to that of life satisfaction:
the third step “somewhat happy” has more than 50% of the sample. We will use
these two measures of well-being for robustness tests.
    There is also a question on the level of stress, specifically the response to the ques-
tion “How would you rate your average daily stress levels? Very low, Low, Medium,
High, Very high.” Its distribution is shown in the last panel of Figure 1. The response
of “Medium” has the greatest share of responses at 40%.
    We now move on to the two questions on social networks. The first question con-
cerns real-life friends. The exact wording is “How big is your real-life social network
of friends?” The permitted responses, unless the respondents refuse to answer, include
“Less than 10 friends”, “Between 10 and 20 friends”, “Between 20 and 30 friends”,
“Between 30 and 50 friends”, and “More than 50 friends”. The distribution of the
network size is shown in the upper panel of Figure 2. A large majority of the sample,
almost 80%, is in the first two categories (i.e., with fewer than 20 friends).
   The immediately next question in the survey concerns online friends: “How big is
your online social network?” The responses include “I don’t have an online social net-
work”, “Less than 100”, “Between 100-300”, “Between 300-500”, “Between 500-700”
and “Greater than 700”. The distribution is shown on the lower panel of Figure 2. A
large majority of the sample either has no online friends (about 25%) or have fewer
than 100 of them (about 50%).
   The two network questions have different numbers of steps, and both have some
steps with sparse responses (see Figure 2). We correct for these problems by combin-
ing the top two categories of real-life network into one single category with 11% of the
sample, and the top three categories of online network into one category with 9% of
the sample. This way, we turn the two network sizes into a comparable scale of four
steps. In the case of real-life network, the four categories are “less than 10”, “10-20”,
“20-30” and “30 or more”, with 44%, 34% 11% and 11% of the sample, respectively.
The size of online network falls into “0”, “1-100”, “100-300”, “300 or more”, with
23%, 50.8%, 17.6% and 8.6% of the sample, respectively.

   Table 1 presents summary statistics of other variables. The average age is 45.
Forty-five percent (45%) of the sample are married; 15% in common-law relation,
5% dating, 23% single; the remaining 12% are divorced, separated, widowed or are
unknown. The income information is based on categorical responses of income inter-
vals. We estimate the midpoint of each interval under the assumption that income
follows a log-normal distribution. We then assign respondents in each interval the
corresponding midpoint estimate.3 About 15% of the sample did not provide income
information. We use a dummy variable to indicate such a status in the regression
analysis. Among those that have valid income information, the sample mean is $51
thousand. The average time spent on moderate to high intensity exercising is 1.78
hours per week. Close to 60% of survey respondents indicated that they currently
volunteer or give time or money to charitable causes.
   A second dataset that we use is the European Social Survey (ESS), a biennial
cross-sectional survey of residents aged 15 and over within private households that is
“designed to chart and explain the interaction between Europe’s changing institutions
and the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of its diverse populations” (The
European Social Survey project). We use the cumulative file for rounds 1-4 (2002,
2004, 2006, 2008) that has 34 participating countries in total.4 The ESS does not
have information relating to online social network. Instead, it has information on
survey respondents’ frequency of socially meeting with friends, relatives or colleagues.
Figure 3 plots the distribution of the frequency, in the categories of “Never”, “Less
than once a month”, “Once a month”, “Several times a month”, “Once a week”,
“Several times a week” and “Every day”.
   The ESS has two alternative measures of SWB, happiness and life satisfaction.
The two underlying questions are “Taking all things together, how happy would you
say you are?” and “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a
whole nowadays?”. Both SWB measures are on a 11-point ascending scale from 0
to 10, with 0 indicating extremely unhappy/dissatisfied and 10 indicating extremely
happy/satisfied. Figure 4 plots the distributions. Table 2 presents summary statistics
of other variables.

     The categories for the income variables are “$20,000 and below”, “$20,001 to $35,000”, “$35,001
to $50,000”, “$50,001 to $75,000”, “$75,001 and $110,000” and “more than $110,000”. The estimated
midpoint for each of these categories are $13,605, $27,073, $41,895, $60,345, $87,895 and $136,849
respectively.

4     Regression Analysis
Our regression analysis estimates the following equation

                      W Bi = α + Xi γ + β1 RLNi + β2 OLNi + ui                        (1)

where the dependent variable W Bi is the measure of well-being for respondent i. The
right-hand side includes an intercept α, a vector of control variables in Xi , as well
as RLNi , the size of real-life network of friends, and OLNi , the size of online net-
work. The control vector includes age, gender and marital status, education, income
and unemployment status. To help remove possible effects of unmeasured personality
differences, we also include the time spent on exercise, whether the respondent vol-
unteers or contributes to charitable causes and self-reported daily stress level. These
variables are likely to be influenced by individual personality differences, as are the
size of networks of friends. If our key results for the effects of friend hold whether
or not our equations include these other variables, they we are more confident in
concluding that our results are not being driven by personality differences.
     The measure of life ladder is ordinal; but as commonly found in the literature,
little is lost if we treat it as cardinal. For example, Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters
(2004) reported that the choice between probit regressions, which treats dependent
variables as ordinal, and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which treats dependent
variables as cardinal, makes virtually no difference to the estimated relationships
between happiness and important explanatory variables. In this paper, we will present
results from the method of OLS; Ordered Probit estimations yield qualitatively similar
findings. In terms of quantitative evaluations, our discussions will be based largely
on the concept of compensating differentials: we will compare the estimated effects
of social networks to the estimated effects of income. The ratios of coefficients are
almost invariant to the choice of regression methods, as switching between OLS and
Ordered Probit affects estimated coefficients almost proportionally (see Helliwell and
Huang (2009) for an example).
  The variables of interest on the right-hand side are the sizes of social networks in
real life and on-line. In both cases, the size information is based on categorical choices
from a set of intervals (the distributions are shown in Figure 2). We enter the size
information into the regression in two different ways. The first approach uses a set of
dummy variables to indicate the intervals. This avoids making assumptions regarding
the functional form of the relationships between network sizes and subjective well-
being. The second approach imposes an assumption that the relationship is log-linear.

                                            6
To implement the log-linear approach, we turn the intervals into continuous values
by assigning the midpoint of an interval to observations in that interval.5
   Table 3 shows the regression output. In all columns, the dependent variable is
the 0-10 point life ladder. In the first column, we enter the network sizes as a set
of categorical variables. In the second column, the network sizes are in (logged)
continuous values. Other columns of the table report robustness tests.
   Before we focus on the variables the size of social networks, we first discuss the
control variables. As commonly found in the literature, there is a positive and sta-
tistically significant income effect. The estimates of the effect are largely invariant
across specifications, and suggest that doubling income (i.e., an increase of logged
income by 0.7 unit) increases the life ladder by about 0.3. Later we will use this esti-
mate as a benchmark to evaluate the quantitative importance of social networks. In
term of genders, male respondents tend to report a lower evaluation of life. There is a
U-shape relationship between age and life ladder: the life ladder falls as age rises but
makes a U-turn in the 40s. In terms of marital status, the happiest respondents are
those who are in a relationship (married, common-law, or dating). The least happy
group, which we use as the reference group, includes those who are divorced, widowed
or separated. The group of non-dating singles lies in between. The difference between
singles and the in-relationship groups is substantial, equivalent to the impact of in-
creasing logged income by an entire unit. There is a strong negative effect associated
with being unemployed, a positive effect associated with exercising and volunteering
time or money for charitable causes. The estimated coefficients on the educational
variables turn out largely insignificant, likely because the control variables already
include measure of household income and social-context variables that are correlated
with education.
    We now move on to social networks. The size of network enters the first column
in Table 3 as categorical variables of intervals. The reference groups that are left out
are those that have the smallest networks, specifically “less than 10” in the case of
real-life friends and zero in the case of online friends. The estimated effects of real-life
friends are all statistically significant and quantitatively substantial. Compared to the
group that has fewer than 10 friends, having 10-20 friends increases the life ladder by
   5
    In the case of real-life friends, the category “Less than 10 friends” is assigned a value of 5, the
category “Between 10 and 20 friends” receives a value of 15, and so on. The top category “More
than 50 friends” is assigned a value of 60. Similarly, we assign continuous values to the size of online
network by assigning zero to the category “I don’t have an online social network”, the value of 50
to “Less than 100”, the value of 200 to “Between 100-300”, and so on. The top category “Greater
than 700” receives a value of 800.



                                                   7
0.29 point, equivalent to the improvement associated with a 0.7 unit of logged income
(or 100% increase of income). Compared to the same reference group, having 20-30
friends increases the ladder by 0.32 points, while having more than 30 friends increases
the evaluation by 0.36. The estimates thus suggest a substantial non-linearity in the
relationship between network sizes and well-being. The most substantial increase in
well-being occurs when moving from the group of “less than 10” to the group of “10
to 20”. The marginal contribution beyond that is quite small. The second column,
which treats network sizes as continuous values, also reports a positive and significant
coefficient. The variable of network size is expressed in logarithms. The coefficient
estimate is 0.19, equivalent to the well-being gain from a 0.44 rise increase in logged
income. Doubling the number of real-life friends is equivalent to increasing income
by more than one-half.
   The findings for on-line networks are strikingly different from those for real-life
friends. Compared to the reference group that has no on-line network at all, hav-
ing a greater number of on-line friends is not associated with a higher level of life
ladder. If anything, the correlation is negative, although two of the three estimates
are statistically insignificant at the 5% confidence interval. The second column uses
logged continuous values to express the size of networks. In such a specification, the
estimated effect from the online network is negative and significant, although it is
quantitatively small (doubling the number of online friends has the equivalent effect
of reducing income by 10%).
   The regressions described above estimate the effect of the online social network
while controlling for the size of real life network. Given the positive correlations
between online network and real-life network (the correlation coefficient is 0.25), we
expect the coefficients on online network to become more positive if we remove the
variables of real-life network from the regressions. The next two columns perform the
tests. The coefficients on online network indeed become less negative, but they still
maintain a negative sign throughout (though none of them has statistical significance
at the 5% level).
    The next two columns of the table add to the right-hand side of the regressions
an extra variable: the self-reported level of daily stress. The inclusion of the stress
variable increases the r-squared substantially (from 17% to 24%), but has little impact
on the estimated effects of network sizes; nor does it change the contrast between the
two types of network. The findings reinforce our earlier point that omitted variables,
including those correlated with personality, will not put our conclusions at risk as long
as their inclusion does not alter the key coefficients, and especially the relative impact


                                            8
of on-line and real-life friends. The equations adding stress thus provide additional
evidence of the robustness of our results.
    The next table uses the four-step life satisfaction and happiness answers as alter-
native dependent variables. For better comparability with the 0-10 point life ladder,
we rescale the two variables so that they, too, have zero for the lowest level of sat-
isfaction/happiness and 10 for the highest level. The estimates are similar to those
from the estimations based on the life ladder. Real-life networks are important to
satisfaction and happiness, while online networks are largely irrelevant. The biggest
difference is that the estimated effect of real-life friendship is even greater for happi-
ness and life satisfaction than for the life ladder. In the case of life ladder in Table 3,
doubling the number of real-life friends has the same effect as increasing income by
more than one-half (exp .44=1.55). For life satisfaction, doubling the number of
friends is equivalent to a doubling of income (exp .69=1.99), while for happiness it
has the same effect as a trebling of income (exp 1.12=3.06).
   Next, we split the sample into two subgroups: one includes respondents who are
married or in a common-law relationship; the other includes the rest of the sample.
This is to compare the importance of friendship and social networks in the two seg-
ments of the population. Our earlier results have already shown that both marriage
and real-life friends contribute importantly to subjective well-being, and by somewhat
comparable amounts. Our results also show that those who are single but dating are
almost as happy as those who are living together, once again suggesting the impor-
tance of the social aspects of co-habitation. Verbakel (2012) shows that differences in
the size of the happiness effects of marriage, cohabitation and dating across European
countries depend on the social acceptability of alternatives to marriage. Partners in
successful marriages often describe their spouses as their best friends. This suggests
the possibility that human social needs and desires can be met to some extent either
by spouses or by other friends, which in turn might suggest that those who are mar-
ried might have less need for large networks of other friends. Perhaps they may also
have less time available to build and maintain networks of other friends. Some combi-
nation of lower need and scarcer time is suggested by the new Canadian data for the
number of friends. When the size of networks of friends is put on a scale ranging from
zero to 1.0, its average value for the married and other cohabiting respondents is .36,
significantly below the mean of .47 for all other respondents (p < .001). European
Social Survey (ESS) data suggest that married respondents spend only two-thirds as
much time with friends as do those who are not married (p < .001). The Canadian
General Social Survey, which also asks about the frequency of seeing friends, shows


                                            9
that time spent with friends is 30% less for married than unmarried respondents
(from GSS 17, p < .001). Table 5 presents the estimates. Its first two columns use
the life ladder as the dependent variable, while the other four apply to life satisfac-
tion and happiness, respectively. For each of the alternative dependent variables, one
column shows estimates from the married/partnered sample; the other shows esti-
mates from the rest of the sample. The findings regarding social networks are similar
across the measures of SWB. The sizes of on-line networks are largely statistically
insignificant for both subgroups. The real-life networks, in contrast, have positive
and generally significant effects on SWB; but there is a stark contrast between the
married/partnered respondents and the rest of the sample. Real-life networks have
greater effects for people who are not married/partnered. The estimated differences
are substantial. In the case of life ladder, the estimated contribution of having more
than more than 30 friends is 0.72 in the un-married/partnered sample; the standard
error is 0.18. In contrast, the estimated contribution is only 0.14 for people who are
married or in a common-law partnership; the standard error is 0.14. There is thus
no overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two estimates. Regressions using
the alternative measures of SWB show a similar pattern of difference, with real-life
networks being significantly more valuable for people who are not married or in a
common-law partnership.
   We also split the sample by gender (male and female) and by age group (16-34,
35-49, 50-64 and 65 and up). Table A.1 presents the estimates. By and large, the
estimated effects of on-line networks are mostly insignificant across the board, or have
signs indicating negative contributions to SWB. Real-life friends, on the other hand,
have positive and mostly significant estimates. The biggest exception concerns the
age group 35 to 49, for which none of the network variables (online or real) have
any positive and significant effects. In fact, the highest size of on-line network is
negatively associated with life ladder, with strong statistical significance.
   Finally, we split the sample along the interactive gender*age groups: young (16-34)
males and females, middle-aged (34-50) males and females, elder (50 and up) males
and females. Table A.2 presents the estimates. Many of the estimated effects of the
real-life network become insignificant, likely due to the drop in sample size. But they
retain their positive sign with very few exceptions. It is worth noting that, among
middle-aged females, having the largest size of online network (300 online friends
or more) has a large, negative and significant association with SWB. The estimated
effect is so large that it exceeds that of being unemployed by a substantial margin.
One possible explanation for this association is reverse causality, with unhappy people


                                          10
resorting to greater intensity of online activity.


5     Findings from the ESS
The previous section makes three empirical observations: 1) the size of real-life social
networks contributes positively to SWB; 2) the size of on-line social networks does
not contribute to SWB; 3) the real-life social network is more valuable for respondents
who are not married or in a common-law relationship. We can test the robustness
of the first and the third observations using the European Social Survey (ESS), a
large international survey whose first four rounds (2002-2008) include more than
180,000 individual respondents in 34 countries. The ESS does not, unfortunately,
have information about on-line social networks.
   We will use the ESS data to estimate equations similar to equ(1), but without the
variable for on-line networks. There are two alternative measures of SWB from the
survey, happiness and life satisfaction, both on the same 11-point scale from 0 to 10
as is used for the Cantril ladder in the Canadian survey. The variable of interest on
the right-hand side is the response to the question “how often do you meet socially
with friends, relatives or work colleagues?” This measure of social interactions is
originally recorded in seven categories: “Never”, “Less than once a month”, “Once a
month”, “Several times a month”, “Once a week”, “Several times a week” and “Every
day”. To construct categorical indicators with sufficient sample sizes, we collapse the
survey responses into five categories: “less than once a month including never” (with
a combined mass of 11%), “once a month” (9%), “several times a month including
once a week” (36%), “several times a week” (27%) and “every day” (17%). We then
include the categorical indicators on the right-hand side of our estimations to explain
SWB.
  Our regressions also include a conventional set of control variables in SWB analy-
sis: age, age squared, educational attainment, marital status, labour force status and
income. We also control for country fixed effects and wave fixed effects (The wave 1
ESS was conducted in 2002, wave 2 in 2004, wave 3 in 2006 and wave 4 in 2008). The
country fixed effects remove cross-country differences in per capita income as well as
the potentially different interpretations regarding the scale of satisfaction and happi-
ness. We also use general level of trust (the response to the question whether “most
people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people”), the
frequency of attending religious services outside special occasions, and self-reported
health status to control for the differences in social and religious attitudes, subjective

                                           11
health, as well as possible personality differences. We use Ordinary Least Squares,
clustering errors at the country level.
    Tables 6 and 7 present the results. The findings for the control variables are sim-
ilar to those reported in the previous section. Males tend to report lower happiness
and satisfaction. There is a U-shape relation between age and SWB; those in the 40s
report the lowest happiness and life satisfaction. Compared to the divorced, sepa-
rated or the widowed, being married or in a civil partnership is associated with higher
SWB. The same is true for being never married, but to a lesser extent. Higher income
is associated with higher SWB. We find positive income-SWB relation throughout the
income distribution. The relation flattens out at middle and higher income, but the
marginal contribution of income to well-being never falls to zero or becomes negative.
In terms of labour force status, there is no significant difference between being em-
ployed and not participating. Being unemployed, however, is a significant negative
factor with a large estimated effect. The SWB difference between unemployment
and non-participation is similar to the difference arising from moving an individual
from the lowest income decile to the 7th decile in the case of happiness, or to the
8th decile in the case of life satisfaction. General trust, the frequency of attending
religious services and self-reported health status are all positive contributing factors
to happiness and to life satisfaction.
    Our variable of special interest on the right-hand side is the frequency of socially
meeting with friends, relatives and colleagues. The estimated coefficients on this
variable are all positive. A higher frequency is associated with greater happiness and
satisfaction. For happiness, the greatest improvement occurs when moving away from
the bottom (less than once a month) to the category of “once a month”; the happiness
increment is 0.4 point. There is a further gain of 0.25 when moving to “several times
a month”, then a further 0.16 gain to “several time a week”, then a further 0.17 gain
to “every day”. For life satisfaction, the marginal improvements associated with the
same step-by-step moves are 0.31, 0.26, 0.17 and 0.09, respectively in the same order.
These contributions, especially those arising from a move from the bottom (less than
once a month) to the next level (once a month), are very substantial, more than the
SWB gain due to a jump from the 5th income decile to the top decile in the case of
happiness, and equivalent to a jump from the 5th decile to the 8th decile in the case
of life satisfaction. But it is important to realize that there is only about 10% of the
population whose frequency of social interactions is at the bottom with less than once
a month; so we are talking about moving away from a small minority that has a very
low frequency of social interactions. If we focus on the move from “several times a


                                          12
month” to “several times a week”, the marginal contribution is more moderate. The
income equivalent is a move from the 5th decile to the 8th in the case of happiness,
and from the 5th to the 7th in the case of life satisfaction.
  We now examine the difference between married couples/civil partners and those
who are not in such relations. The findings from the Canadian survey indicate that the
importance of real-life networks to SWB is greater for those who are not in a marriage
or a common-law partnership. The ESS yields qualitatively similar observations. The
second and the third columns of Tables 6 present estimates from the spilt-sample
estimation, with happiness as the dependent variable. Table 7 has the same split-
sample estimations with life satisfaction as the dependent variable. For both SWB
measures, the estimated effects of social interactions are lower for married/partnered
couples than for the rest of the population. In most cases, the differences between
point estimates are greater than two standard errors of individual estimates.
    The findings from the ESS thus confirm that real-life social networks (captured
as the frequency of social interactions in the ESS) are positive and substantial con-
tributing factors to SWB, with an importance that is greater for people who are not
married or in a civil partnership.


6    Conclusion
We have used data from a large new Canadian survey to estimate the subjective well-
being benefits of comparably measured networks of real-life and on-line friends. We
have three main results. First, we confirm many earlier studies showing the impor-
tance of real-life friends to subjective well-being. Second, we find that comparably
measured networks of on-line friends have zero or negative correlations with subjec-
tive well-being, whether or not allowance is made for the influence of other factors.
Third, we confirm the importance of marriage as a source of friendship, as shown by
two separate pieces of evidence. First, we find that the estimated well-being impact
of the number of friends is much smaller for those who are married or living together,
suggesting that friends and spouses provide some similar happiness benefits. The
second piece of evidence is that single people who are dating have subjective well-
being significantly higher than those who are not. The effect is almost as high as for
living together, which in turn is nearly as high as being married. These results also
suggest that the company and friendship of marriage that matter as much as the le-
gal institution. Comparative evidence from other countries confirms that the relative
importance of the formal institution is much higher in societies where common-law

                                         13
arrangements are less socially acceptable than they are in Canada. Our Canadian
results on the well-being value of networks of real-life friends are confirmed also for
large samples of data from the European Social Survey. We also confirm from the
ESS the greater value of friends for those who are not married.
  Our results on the relative values of real-life and on-line friends are likely to be
specific to generations, countries, and demographic groups, and to change as social
and technological changes alter the possibilities for these two types of social connection
to be either mutually supportive or inconsistent in their consequences for well-being.
The overall importance of friendship to the maintenance of subjective well-being
would seem to support more widespread collection of comparable data on the size
and quality of friendships of different types, whether real-life or on-line, or on or off
the job.
