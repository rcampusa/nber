                                         ABSTRACT

We examine whether greater Medicaid generosity encourages mobility towards riskier but better
jobs in higher paid occupations and industries. We use Current Population Survey Data and
exploit variation in Medicaid thresholds across states and over time through the 1990s and 2000s.
We find that moving from a state in the 10th to the 90th percentile in terms of Medicaid income
thresholds increases occupational and industrial mobility by 7.6% and 7.8%. We also find that
higher income Medicaid thresholds increase mobility towards occupations and industries with
greater wage spreads and higher separation probabilities, but with higher wages and higher
educational requirements.

1. Introduction

       Most countries provide some form of government health insurance, with

many countries providing nationalized health insurance that covers the entire

population. There are moral as well as economic arguments for the provision of

public health insurance. On the economic side, adverse selection in insurance

markets is an important reason why the provision of health insurance is thought to

improve efficiency. Moreover, in the past few decades, new evidence has shown

that employer-provided health insurance, which has been the predominant form of

accessing health care in the U.S., may reduce labor mobility and generate both ‘job

lock’ and ‘employment lock’, i.e., the phenomena of not changing jobs and staying

employed simply to be able to retain health benefits. The introduction of the

Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the U.S. has expanded health insurance to about 18

million individuals, who were not previously covered. Relying on previous work,

one may expect increased job separations and decreased labor force participation

following the ACA.


       In this paper, we examine another effect of public health insurance on labor

mobility beyond the ‘job lock’ and ‘employment lock’ phenomena. We focus on

the insurance role of public health benefits in allowing individuals to undertake

risky decisions they would otherwise not make. In particular, we focus on

individuals’ decisions to move to riskier but higher paid occupations and industries.

Changing occupations and industries are investment decisions that are inherently




                                         2
risky, since a worker moving to a new occupation/industry will generally have to

invest in new skills and the returns to these skills will be uncertain. Indeed, a recent

study by Hoynes and Luttmer (2011) found that individuals derive both

redistributive and insurance value from public insurance programs, including

Medicaid and SCHIP, and that the insurance value has increased over time. In this

paper, we focus on the insurance value of Medicaid/SCHIP and test whether greater

generosity in Medicaid/SCHIP encourages individuals to change occupations and

industries. Moreover, we examine if individuals move to riskier occupations and

industries and if these occupations and industries are higher paying and have higher

educational requirements.


        For our analysis, we use the Current Populations Survey’s (CPS) Merged

Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files and exploit variation in Medicaid/SCHIP

across states and over time through the 1990s and 2000s to study the impact of

Medicaid/SCHIP on occupational and industrial mobility. We measure the

generosity of public health insurance provided through Medicaid/SCHIP 2 using

income and age thresholds prescribed by state legislation to determine whether

children qualify for the program in each state at each point in time. Occupational

and industrial mobility are measured as year-to-year changes in 3-level digit

occupations and industries. Mobility towards riskier occupations and industries are


2 We will not differentiate between the two programs but rather refer to both programs as simply

Medicaid.




                                               3
measured as yearly transitions to a 3-level digit occupation/industry that has higher

variance of wages or higher separation rates over the entire period of analysis. In

addition, we measure whether workers transition towards occupations with higher

median earnings and requiring the same or higher educational credentials compared

to their previous jobs.


       The identification strategy we use is essentially a difference-in-difference

strategy comparing occupational and industrial mobility in states with minimal

Medicaid benefits and states with more generous Medicaid benefits before and after

the changes. The key identifying assumption is, thus, that before the policy change

labor mobility levels or trends for those in less and more generous states were

similar. We control for state- and time-effects, as well as region-specific trends to

address this. A potential concern with our identification strategy is that there may

be other policies introduced at the same time as the increased Medicaid generosity,

which may be driving the increase in labor mobility. Therefore, we control for other

policies that may have changed across states over this time period. In particular, we

include the progressivity of the tax system as the differential in tax liabilities faced

by individuals in the 75th and 25th percentiles; the median tax liabilities, and the

generosity of TANF as controls. Another possible concern is that changes in

Medicaid generosity may have themselves been the result of poor economic

conditions or changes in the composition of populations that require health benefits.

To address this concern, we regress the Medicaid income and age thresholds on the




                                           4
state unemployment rate, gross state product and characteristics of the state

population in the state. We do not find any evidence that these factors explain

income or age thresholds, thus allaying concerns of the potential endogeneity of

such policies.


        Our results show that increased access to health insurance for the poor

increases occupational and industrial mobility. The results show that moving from

a state in the 10th percentile to a state in the 90th percentile in terms of the generosity

of the Medicaid income threshold increases the probability of moving to another

occupation by 0.036 or by 7.6%. The results also show that moving from a state in

the 10th to the 90th percentile in its Medicaid income threshold generosity increases

the probability of moving to another industry by 0.037 or by 7.8%. Moreover, we

find that the effects on occupational and industrial mobility are greater for women.

For example, moving from a state in the 10th to the 90th percentile in terms of

Medicaid income threshold generosity increases the probability that women change

industries by 10.2%. In addition, we do a falsification test by examining the impacts

of Medicaid for those close and far away from the thresholds, since those far away

from the thresholds should not be affected. We find that the impacts of increased

Medicaid income threshold generosity on occupational and industrial mobility are

positive, large and significant for those in the lowest quintile of the income

distribution and, as one would expect, they are all insignificant (and mostly

negative) for those in the higher quintiles of the income distribution.




                                            5
       The premise is that Medicaid generosity increases occupational and

industrial mobility because public health insurance allows workers to make risky

decisions that have a higher payoff. Thus, we estimate the likelihood that workers

will move to occupations and industries with a higher variance of wages and with

higher average separation rates. We find that moving from a state in the 10th to the

90th percentile in terms of generosity of Medicaid income thresholds increases the

likelihood of moving to occupations and industries with a greater wage spread by

14.3% and 10.6%, respectively. We also find that increasing the generosity of

Medicaid increases the likelihood that workers move towards sectors with higher

average separation rates. Moreover, we find that these workers are not transitioning

towards worse jobs, but rather towards occupations and industries with higher

median wages. Furthermore, increased Medicaid generosity in terms of both

income and age thresholds increases the likelihood that workers move towards jobs

with the same or higher educational requirements than those in their previous jobs.

Thus, increased Medicaid generosity encourages workers to move up the job ladder.


       Finally, we exploit a reverse natural experiment that occurred in Tennessee,

where Medicaid generosity declined substantially, to examine if occupational and

industrial mobility fell in this state. We find that after the fall in Medicaid

generosity in Tennessee in 2000, occupational and industrial transitions fell and

that workers moved towards occupations and industries with smaller wage spreads

and lower likelihood of separations. Moreover, the fall in Medicaid generosity




                                         6
increased worker transitions towards lower paid occupations and industries and

towards jobs with lower educational requirements. Thus, this reverse experiment

shows that lower generosity not only decreased occupational and industrial

mobility, but also increased mobility towards less risky and less desirable jobs.


       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a

review of the literature and highlight the contribution of our paper. In Section 3, we

describe the MORG data and the construction of the various variables used in our

analysis. In Section 4, we describe our identification strategy. In Section 5, we

present the results of Medicaid generosity on occupational and industrial mobility.

Section 6 concludes.


2. Literature Review and Medicaid Changes after the 1990s


a. Literature on Relation between Public Health Insurance and Mobility


       The effect of health insurance on labor mobility has been an active area of

research for the last two decades. Health insurance can affect labor market

outcomes directly through its effect on health of the individual or it can affect labor

market outcomes indirectly by altering the payoff structures, modifying labor

supply patterns and affecting labor market churn. The indirect effects of health

insurance provision on labor market outcomes are mostly relevant in the case of the

United States labor market, where health insurance has been provided mostly by




                                          7
employers until the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Currie and Madrian (1999)

provide an excellent review of the institutional details of the U.S. health insurance

system and how it interacts with the labor market decisions of individuals.


       The literature that has focused on the effects of health insurance on labor

mobility, and that is most relevant to our paper, falls under two strands. One strand

of the literature has focused on the effects of public health insurance on labor

supply. Lack of health insurance from sources other than the employer may force

individuals to stay employed just to receive employer-provided health insurance.

Moreover, Medicaid may discourage labor force participation since receipt depends

on income thresholds. The earlier empirical literature, using variation in qualifying

conditions for Medicaid and Medicare, has generally found that the availability of

alternative sources of health insurance depresses labor supply (see Yelowitz (1995),

Currie and Madrian (1999) and Gruber (2000) for reviews of this literature). Two

recent papers relying on policy changes in Tennessee and Oregon examine whether

there is ‘employment lock’, the phenomenon of staying employed instead of non-

employed just to be able to keep health insurance. Garthwaite et al. (2014) find

evidence that labor supply and consequently employment of workers increased

following a large public health disenrollment that occurred in Tennessee in 2005

compared to other Southern states. By contrast, Baicker et al. (2013) find that

access to Medicaid has no impact on employment or earnings analyzing data from




                                         8
the Oregon health insurance randomized experiment, perhaps because the

experiment took place in 2008 in the midst of the Great Recession.


       The second branch of the literature focusing on the relation between health

insurance on labor mobility has focused on the aforementioned ‘job lock’

hypothesis. There has been a divide in the literature about the existence and the

magnitude of the ‘job lock’ hypothesis, i.e., the phenomenon of not separating from

a job, even if the job is a bad match, simply to keep health benefits. The literature

on ‘job lock’ has relied on three identification strategies. First, a number of papers

exploit variation on whether the worker has health insurance through a source other

than his/her employer. Second, a number of other papers use worker’s valuation of

health benefits as a source of variation. Finally, only three papers use policy

variation to examine the existence of ‘job lock’.


       The majority of papers relying on access to alternative sources of health

insurance compare male workers who have access to health insurance through their

spouse. Several studies, including Madrian (1994), Cooper and Monheit (1993),

Buchmueller and Valletta (1996), Gruber and Madrian (1994) and Anderson (1997)

have found that employer-provided health insurance depresses job turnover. The

results of the impact of health insurance from a spouse on reduced job separations

range between 25%-50%. Holtz-Eakin (1994) is the only paper using this strategy,




                                          9
which finds no evidence of ‘job lock’, perhaps because of the use of PSID data

(known to generate measurement error in job changes).


       The papers relying on the differential valuation of benefits by individuals

also provide evidence on ‘job lock’. Madrian (1994) shows evidence of ‘job lock’

for married men with employer provided-health insurance who had a pregnant wife.

Stroupe et al. (2001) instead finds evidence of ‘job lock’ for those with chronic

health conditions, or family members with chronic health conditions, who relied on

employer-provided health insurance. By contrast, Kapur (1998) finds no evidence

using a similar strategy. A problem with this and the previous approach is that those

with pregnant spouses, chronic health conditions, and insured spouses are likely to

be different from the comparison groups used in these studies.


       There are only three papers in the ‘job lock’ literature that rely on policy

changes as a source of exogenous variation in health insurance access during

periods of non-employment. Gruber and Madrian (1994) analyzed an exogenous

change in law across states that allowed unemployed workers to have health

insurance coverage from their past employer until they found a new job through the

Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). They find that job

separations increased by 12-15%, non-employment spells increased by 15% and

reemployment earnings doubled one year after the introduction of COBRA. Bansak

and Raphael (2008) instead rely on the expansion of State Children’s Health




                                         10
Insurance Programs over the 1990s and find that separations increased by 5-6%

after the introduction of these state programs for fathers whose children qualified

for SCHIP and whose spouses did not have employer-provided health insurance. A

paper by Hamersma and Kim (2009) finds evidence that parental Medicaid

expansions led to increases in job mobility of unmarried women, but not for married

women or men.


       Our analysis is closest to the studies just described and to recent studies

examining the impact of public health insurance on labor supply.


b. Medicaid/SCHIP Threshold Changes in the 1990s and 2000s


       In our analysis, we rely on the increased generosity of Medicaid over the

1990s and 2000s. Medicaid was introduced in the U.S. following the Social

Security Amendment of 1965 to provide health insurance to low-income

individuals. From 1965 to 1985, only cash aid recipients of Aid to Families with

Dependent Children (AFDC) were eligible for Medicaid. Starting in 1985, many

states expanded eligibility of Medicaid to children and pregnant mothers with

income thresholds above the AFDC income eligibility limits and with children

below a certain age limit. We use the state income and age thresholds for children

to capture the generosity of states in terms of public health insurance. The higher

the state income and age limits, the more individuals and families are likely to

benefit from Medicaid in a state.




                                        11
        During the late 1990s and the 2000s, many states chose to increase the

income threshold, which determine the level of income as a percentage of the

poverty line at which children within households qualify for Medicaid. Similarly,

during this period several states chose to increase the age threshold, the maximum

age that allows children in households under the income threshold to qualify for

Medicaid. Figures 1 and 2 show the evolution of the Medicaid income and age

thresholds over time for the lowest 10th percentile of states in terms of generosity

as well as for the 50th and 90th percentiles.3 Figure 1 shows that there is substantial

variation in Medicaid income thresholds. Back in 1997, the income threshold

relative to the poverty line was 133% for the lowest 10th percentile of states, but

185% for states in the median and 200% for states in the 90th percentile. Moreover,

the generosity of Medicaid has increased substantially, particularly in the top 90th

percentile of states. The generosity has increased from 200% in 1997 to 235% in

2005 and to 300% in 2011. By contrast, states in the lowest 10th percent have

remained with an income threshold of 133% in the past decade and a half. States in

the bottom in terms of their generosity have remained fairly constant – Alabama,

Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Utah, Virginia and

Wyoming were all in this group in 1997 and remain in this group in 2011. However,

obtaining data from http://ccf.georgetown.edu/.




                                              12
some states have moved out of this group including Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio and

South Dakota. Moreover, the states in the top group have changed substantially,

with only Hawaii and Vermont remaining in the top 90th percentile in terms of

Medicaid income thresholds. Arkansas, California, Minnesota, Rhode Island,

Tennessee and Washington all moved out of this group and the District of

Columbia, Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire and Wisconsin moved into the group

of most generous states. At the bottom, age thresholds were zero for the least

generous states and 18 for the most generous and there have been some increases

from 5 to 6 years at the median (see Figure 2). Our identification strategy is, thus,

essentially a difference-in-difference strategy, which compares the changes in

outcomes before and after the changes in income and age thresholds among less

and more generous states.


         The novelty of our paper is not only to exploit policy changes to examine

the impact of public health benefits, but to go beyond the effects of public health

insurance on job separations and to examine the incentives it generates in terms of

increased risk taking. 4 In this paper, we analyze the impacts of public health

not only riskier but also higher paying and have higher educational requirements.


3. Data Description


           We use the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files of the Current

Population Survey and merge these with the March CPS files to conduct this

analysis. Households in the CPS are interviewed for four months, then let go for

eight months, and are then interviewed again for another four months. Every month

about one eighth of the households enter the sample and about one eighth leave the

sample. The fourth and eighth interviews include information on wage income and

hours worked and are called the outgoing rotations. The MORG files allow one to

match households and individuals from one year to the next by matching the

information from the 4th interview and the 8th interview. We merged the 4th to the

8th interview in the months of March that had unique household and individual

identifiers. Then, we checked that individuals had the same gender and race. If they

did not, we discarded them. We also checked that the absolute difference in age

from one year to the next was either one or two and deleted those who had

differences in age that were greater or smaller than two.5 Finally, we merged these

panels with the March supplements.




5
    We lose around 3% to 4% in each pair of years from mismatches in age, gender, and race.




                                                14
        In the MORG sample, we have access to extensive demographic and labor

market information, including information on the industry and the occupation of

the worker. We are, thus, able to control for education, age, the number of children,

gender, race, ethnicity and country of birth in all our regressions.


        We use the March CPS supplement because it asks a series of questions on

different income sources. This allows us to construct the tax liabilities and TANF

benefits variables, which are important control variables since state taxes and

TANF benefits changed during this time period. We construct state income tax

liabilities using the TAXSIM software from the National Bureau of Economic

Research (NBER) at the 75th and 25th percentiles of the national income distribution

to construct a measure of tax progressivity, and at the 50th percentile of the national

income distribution to construct the median income. The benefits under TANF are

constructed using information on maximum benefits, benefit-reduction rates and

flat earnings disregards which vary over time and across states,6 as well as using

earned and unearned income for the 25th percentile of the national income

distribution by year from the March CPS.7




6
   We are grateful to Hilary Hoynes for providing the information on maximum benefits, reduction
rates and earnings disregards through 2007. We obtained the information on maximum benefits,
benefit reduction rate and earnings disregards for 2008-2012 from the Welfare Rules Database
(http://anfdata.urban.org/wrd/WRDWelcome.cfm) to allow us to update the TANF variable until
2012.
7
  See Appendix for a detailed description of the construction of these variables.




                                              15
        Our dependent variables include indicators of whether a person changed 3-

digit occupations and 3-digit industries from one year to the next. Since occupation

and industry codes have changed over time, we use crosswalks to make sure that

occupation and industry codes are consistent over time. 8 Then, we construct

transition   probabilities   of   whether       the   person   moved    to   a    riskier

occupation/industry from one year to the next. We measure riskiness of occupations

and industries in two ways. First, we measure the variance of wages in each 3-digit

occupation and industry over the entire period of our analysis. Then, we define a

variable measuring transitions towards riskier occupation/industry, which takes the

value of one if the current occupation/industry has a greater variance of wages than

the previous occupation/industry and zero otherwise. Hence, whenever there is no

change in occupation/industry, this variable also takes the value of zero. We also

measure riskiness in an occupation/industry by looking at separation rates within

occupations/industries. The second variable measuring transition to a riskier

occupation/industry takes the value of 1 if a person moved towards a 3-digit

occupation/industry with a higher average separation rate than the one in which

they were working at before. This variable can only take a value of 1 if there is an

industry or occupation switch by the worker.




8
  We use the crosswalks developed by Autor and Dorn (2013) for occupations and we use the
IPUMS crosswalk for industries.




                                           16
       Our final set of dependent variables measure whether workers make

transitions towards better jobs. We measure the quality of jobs in two ways. First,

we measure transitions towards 3-digit occupations/industries with higher median

wages than the previous job. Median wages are calculated for each 3-digit

occupation/industry over the entire period of analysis. Second, we measure whether

workers move towards occupations in which the educational requirement is the

same or higher than the educational requirement in their previous occupation. This

is a measure of whether the workers moved towards a job that is better or higher up

in the job ladder. We construct this measure by using data from the U.S. Labor

Department’s O*NET database, which identifies the educational requirements for

jobs in different occupations. The O*NET program collects data on entry

requirements, work styles and task content within occupations by surveying each

occupation’s working population. For educational requirements, we rely on the

following question asked of current employees: “If someone was being hired to

perform this job, indicate the level of education that would be required.” The survey

respondents are reminded that this does not refer to the level of education that an

incumbent or current employee has achieved. Respondents are given the following

options: less than high school, high school, some college, associate’s degree,

bachelor's degree, and graduate degree. To assign a required level of education to

each occupation, we use the distribution of responses of the incumbents and use the

mode of the responses as the required level of education for each occupation. This




                                         17
way of measuring education requirements is consistent with the approaches taken

in the over-education literature.9


        Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis

for the period from 1996 to 2012. In the sample, almost half of the individuals are

women, 80% are married, have on average almost one child, are on average 43.5

years old and have on average 13.5 years of education, 84.4% of the individuals are

white, 9.8% African American and 8.7% Hispanic. Only 13.1% are union members

and 14.9% are foreign-born. A substantial fraction of those who change jobs

experience occupational and industry changes from year to year – 47.6%

experience occupational changes and 33.4% industry changes. These numbers are

in line with previous numbers documented in the literature measuring occupational

and industrial mobility using CPS data. 10 Moreover, the likelihood of moving

towards an occupation with greater variance of wages and higher average

separation rates are 21.7% and 23%, while the likelihood of moving towards a

riskier industry as measured in terms of a greater variance of wages and higher

separation rates are 16% and 16.3%. Finally, the likelihood of transitioning to a

measure annual mobility without matching individuals present in two consecutive years. When they
match individuals present in two consecutive years and measure occupational and industrial
mobility, their number is close to ours.




                                              18
higher paying occupation and industry are 21.5% and 16%. The likelihood of

moving to a better-matched occupation is 33.1%.


        The Medicaid income threshold, as described in the previous section, is the

maximum income relative to the poverty line that allows children within a

household to qualify for Medicaid. The average income threshold is 191% of the

Federal Poverty Line (FPL) over the entire period. The Medicaid age threshold is

the maximum age of the children who can qualify for Medicaid given that they live

in households with income below the aforementioned Medicaid income threshold.

The average age threshold is 4.7 years over the entire period of analysis. The

thresholds are statutory and, thus, determined by law. They are the source of

variation that we use to determine public health insurance generosity in our

analysis. Thus, we might expect the occupation and industry change outcomes to

differ between more and less generous states if Medicaid, indeed, changes the

behavior of workers in terms of their willingness to move occupations or industry.

Occupational and industry changes are higher in states with Medicaid income

thresholds above the mean, although only industry changes are significantly

different between those above and below the mean. Moreover, movement towards

riskier industries in terms of the variance of wages and separations is significantly

greater in states where the Medicaid income threshold is above the mean. Finally,

the transitions toward higher paying industries are significantly greater in states that

are above average in terms of Medicaid generosity. By contrast, average transitions




                                          19
towards riskier occupations and better matches are about the same in states with

above average and below average Medicaid thresholds when not controlling for

anything else.


       However, Table 1 also shows that worker characteristics in more and less

generous states also vary. More generous Medicaid states have older workers, more

dependent children, more foreign-born workers, higher unionization rates and more

Hispanics and less whites and African-American workers. Thus, these differences

highlight the importance of controlling for different worker characteristics in the

analysis. Table 1 also shows that the difference in mean taxes at the 75th and 25th

percentile of the distribution over the period of analysis is 49.6% and the average

median tax is 11%. While the tax progressivity is higher in states that are more

generous in their provision of Medicaid benefits, the median tax rate is actually

lower in these states. TANF income threshold was 239.6% of the FPL in states that

also offered more generous Medicaid and 106.2% of the FPL in states that offered

less generous Medicaid. Differences in tax structure and transfer programs, thus,

highlight the need to control for these policy variables in our analysis.


4. Identification Strategy


       Our approach to establish a causal relation between labor mobility and

public health insurance relies on statutory Medicaid program qualification rules, as

opposed to the actual benefits received by an individual. As shown above, there




                                         20
were a number of states that remained constant at the low threshold of 133% of the

FPL and the minimum child age, thus keeping the 1987 rules. However, many other

states did increase their generosity by raising the income threshold beyond the

AFDC threshold at the time, and by allowing older children to also qualify for

Medicaid. Thus, we compare those states that became more generous to those that

did not in terms of qualification for Medicaid. This is essentially a difference-in-

difference approach with several before and after periods and several treatments.


       We estimate the following regression of occupation/industry mobility on

the Medicaid income and age thresholds, other policy changes, individual

characteristics, state and time fixed effects, and region-specific trends:



   Yisrt = + φ × Medicaid Income Thresholdst + ψ × Medicaid Age Thresholdst

       + δ × Tax Progressivityst + + π × Median Taxst + ρ × TANF Benefitsst

       + βXisrt + κs + τt + Ωrt + εisrt



where the Medicaid Income Thresholdst is maximum income relative to the poverty

line that allows children within a household to qualify for health insurance through

Medicaid in state s at time t; Medicaid Age Thresholdst is the maximum age of a

child who can qualify for Medicaid in state s at time t; the Tax Progressivityst is the

difference in the average overall tax rate between the top and bottom quartile of the

income distribution; Median Taxst is the average tax at the 50th percentile of the




                                          21
income distribution; and TANF Benefitsst are as described in the previous section.

In addition, the X’s include controls for age, education, number of children, gender,

and indicators for foreign-born, union member, marital status, Hispanics, and

African Americans. We control for state and time effects, κs and τt , to contrast

states with more and less generous thresholds before and after the statutory changes.

To allow for potential differential trends in states with more and less generous

Medicaid, we include, Ωrt, region-specific time trends that allow the time trend to

vary in each of the large nine regions of the country as defined by the Census

Bureau (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central,

South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, and Pacific).

       While we control for other potential confounders that may have changed at

the same time as the Medicaid statutory changes, a potential problem is that the

statutory changes may had responded to underlying economic conditions or

conditions in the labor market. We check for this possibility by estimating

regressions of the Medicaid income and age thresholds on the unemployment rate,

real gross state product, the percentage of the labor force in goods producing

industries, and the percentage of the population that is white, male, and married as

well as the average education level in the state. Table 2 shows results of these

regressions for the income and age thresholds, respectively. Columns (1)-(5) show

that none of these variables are significant in predicting Medicaid income threshold.

Columns (6)-(10) show no effects of the variables on the Medicaid age thresholds




                                         22
either. The only exception is the average education level, which is marginally

significant in Columns (5) and (10) for both the Medicaid income and age

thresholds in the specification with lagged GDP. Thus, there is little evidence that

economic, labor market and demographic factors are behind the adoption of more

generous Medicaid policies.



5. Impacts of Taxes and Transfers on Occupational and Industrial Mobility

a.              Occupational and Industrial Mobility

        A key element of a healthy labor market is the ability for workers to move

across occupations and industries over their working lives. As people find out what

their talents are and observe how their experiences evolve in the labor market, they

may realize that their skills and characteristics do not fit well in a particular

occupation or industry but that their skills may be better suited for another

occupation or industry. Thus, people may consider moving to a new occupation or

utilize their talents in a different industry, yet they may be reluctant to do so because

there is uncertainty about the quality of their match with a new occupation or

industry. Employer-provided health insurance, however, stops many from changing

jobs and may restrain many from leaving a job to retrain or to even move to another

job with health insurance coverage but which may be risky because it is in a new

area of expertise. Public health insurance may encourage individuals to undertake

the risky investments necessary to change occupations or industries.




                                           23
       Table 3 shows that increased Medicaid generosity, indeed, induces

individuals to change occupations more often than they would otherwise. Columns

(1)-(3) show the results with basic demographic controls and adding state, time and

region-specific trends, respectively. Columns (4) and (5) add policy controls

including tax progressivity, the median tax and TANF benefits. The results become

slightly smaller as more controls are added, but they are robust to all these controls

and show a consistent picture. An increase in the Medicaid income threshold

increases the likelihood that an individual changes occupations. By contrast,

increasing Medicaid generosity by increasing the age threshold does not impact

occupational change. The effect with the full set of demographic and policy controls

in Column (5) shows that moving from a state with the lowest income threshold,

133% of the FPL, to a state in the 90th percentile in terms of the income threshold,

or moving from Alabama to Vermont (if they were the same in every other respect),

increases the propensity to change occupations by 7.6%. This is almost equivalent

to increasing the income threshold by 2 standard deviations, which increases

occupational mobility by 6.9%. In the last column of Table 3, we interact the

thresholds with an indicator for women, to check if the effects vary by gender, but

find no difference between women and men in terms of the effects of Medicaid

generosity on their occupational mobility.


       Table 4 shows the effect of Medicaid generosity on industrial mobility. The

results show that an increase in the Medicaid income threshold also increases




                                         24
industrial mobility. The results are robust to the inclusion of demographic and

policy controls. The result in column (5) with the full set of controls shows that

moving from a state with the most basic Medicaid protection, as was present in all

states in 1965, to a state with the 90th percentile in terms of Medicaid income

thresholds, increases industrial mobility by 7.8%. Moreover, column (6) shows that

the effect of Medicaid on industrial mobility is greater for women. For women,

living in a state in the 10th instead of the 90th percentile in Medicaid income

thresholds would increase their mobility by 0.05 or 10.2%. As for occupational

mobility, however, increased generosity in terms of age thresholds has no impact

on mobility.


         Since the thresholds should be most important for those who are close to

the threshold and likely to benefit, we examine differential effects of the income

threshold for those at different quintiles of the income distribution. We begin by

interacting the Medicaid income threshold variable with the quintiles of the income

distribution. Then, we compare the marginal effect of the Medicaid income

threshold at different quintiles relative to the highest quintile. This serves as a

falsification test since we should not expect to find effects in the higher quintiles.11




11
   Note that those in the lowest quintile earn $20,703 or less in 1999 dollars and the poverty line for
a married couple with one child in 1999 was $13,410. Thus, to qualify for Medicaid such family
would have to earn less than $17,835.30 in the least generous states and $25,210.80 in the median
state. This means that those at the lowest quintile are, indeed, more likely to be exposed to Medicaid
over this time period.




                                                  25
Figure 3 shows the results of the impact of income thresholds on occupational

mobility at various quintiles of the income distribution. It clearly shows a markedly

higher impact for those at the lowest quintile than for those at higher quintiles. The

marginal effect of the Medicaid income threshold on the probability to change

occupations is about 1 percentage point higher for people in the lowest quintile

compared to those in the highest quintile. By contrast, the effects for quintiles

higher than the lowest quintile relative to the highest quintile are negative but close

to zero and the relative effects at the second and fourth quintiles are not

distinguishable from zero. Figure 4 shows similarly the impact of the Medicaid

income threshold on industrial mobility by quintile. As before, the marginal effect

of the Medicaid income threshold on the likelihood of moving industries is highest

for the lowest quintile. Workers in the lowest quintile are 2.3 percentage points

more likely to change industries due to more generous Medicaid income thresholds

than those in the highest quintile. By contrast, the relative effects for those in the

higher quintiles is close to zero. These results confirm that the effect of Medicaid

generosity on industrial and occupational mobility is mostly driven by the changes

in threshold levels and not by other things affecting all individuals with high and

low income in generous states.


       In the Appendix Tables, we also examine whether the effects were larger

for women than men; for married or not married individuals, and for those with and

without children. The results in Appendix Table 1 show that the effects on




                                          26
occupational mobility are greater for women than men, when estimating a fully

saturated model allowing other factors to affect women and men differently.

Appendix Table 1 also shows bigger effects of the Medicaid income thresholds on

occupational mobility of married than non-married workers, although the latter

effects are not significant. Moreover, this table shows bigger effects of Medicaid

on occupational mobility for those with children than for those without children.

The results in Appendix Table 2 similarly show that the results on industrial

mobility are bigger for women than men, but that the results are bigger for those

who are not married and without children although these differences are not

significant.


b.      Moving to Riskier and Better Jobs?


        If the insurance value of Medicaid is indeed driving individuals to undertake

riskier decisions by moving them toward new occupations and industries, they

should be moving towards riskier occupations and industries but also towards those

that are more desirable.


        Table 5 shows transition probabilities towards riskier occupations and

industries. Columns (1) and (2) show results where the dependent variable takes the

value of 1 if the person moved to an occupation with a higher variance of wages

and if the person moved to an occupation with higher separation rates. The results

show that both higher Medicaid and age thresholds increase the likelihood that a




                                         27
person will move towards an occupation with a wider wage spread. The effects are

such that moving from the lowest 10th to the highest 90th percentile in terms of

income and age thresholds increases the likelihood of moving towards riskier

occupations by 14.2% and 3.4% respectively.12 By contrast, the thresholds have no

impact on the likelihood of moving to occupations with higher separation rates.

Columns (3) and (4) show the results for the likelihood of moving towards

industries with higher variance of wages and higher separation rates. The results

show that higher income thresholds increase transitions towards riskier industries

defined both in terms of wages and separations. There is, however, a small negative

impact of the age threshold on the likelihood of moving to industries with bigger

wage spreads. These results are largely indicative of mobility towards riskier

occupations and industries when Medicaid is more generous.


        Since another possible interpretation is that people are just pushed towards

low quality jobs, we also test if these are not just riskier jobs but actually better

jobs. Columns (5)-(9) in Table 5 shows results of the impacts of Medicaid on the

likelihood of transitioning towards more desirable jobs. Columns (5) and (6) in

Table 5 show results for transitions towards occupations and industries that have

higher median wages on average. The results show, indeed, that moving from the


12
   Some examples of such transitions in our data are janitors becoming truck drivers or carpenters
or construction workers; cashiers becoming salespersons or housekeepers; and maids becoming
health and nursing aides.




                                               28
10th to the 90th percentile in terms of the Medicaid income threshold increases

transitions towards higher median pay occupations and industries by 11.7% and

8.1%, respectively.13 Another good measure of job quality is whether the job is a

good fit in terms of someone’s skills. Therefore, we look at transitions to

occupations that have similar or higher educational requirements compared to the

educational requirements in the previous job held by the worker. Columns (7)-(9)

in Table 5 show the results for the likelihood of moving towards occupations in

which the educational requirements of the job are above or equal to the education

requirements at the previous job.14 We find that increasing Medicaid generosity

increases the likelihood that the worker moves to a job in which s/he is using the

same or possibly higher level of skills compared to her/his previous job. Columns

(8) and (9) show this effects separately for non-college and college graduates. The

effects are slightly bigger for non-college graduates.


         Overall, the evidence indicates that workers are moving towards riskier

occupations, with higher wages and which are presumably better matches for them.




13
   Some examples of such transitions in our data are health and nursing aides becoming medical
technicians or secretaries and receptionists; child care workers becoming teachers; waiters and
waitresses becoming retail salespersons; or cashiers becoming salespersons.
14
   Note that workers can still be over- or under- qualified in their current and past jobs. We do not
take a stand on whether over- or under- qualification is a bad/good outcome.




                                                 29
c.      The Tennessee Experiment: A Sharp Reduction of Medicaid


        While many states increased their Medicaid income thresholds during the

late 1990s and 2000s, as discussed above some states actually reduced their

Medicaid generosity. Tennessee was the state with the biggest changes in its

Medicaid income threshold. The income threshold in Tennessee was at 400% of the

FPL in the late 1990’s but it fell to 200% of the FPL in 2000 and fell additionally

to 185% of the FPL in 2002, staying at that level from then on.15 Thus, contrary to

many states in which the generosity of public health insurance increased during the

past few decades, we should expect for occupational and industrial mobility to fall

in Tennessee.


        Table 6 shows difference-in-difference results of the Tennessee experiment,

using data from 1997 onwards, where the specification includes a Tennessee

indicator, a post-2000 indicator and an interaction of these two, as well as all the

demographic and policy controls included in the previous analysis. In this

experiment, we compare Tennessee only against the control states that did not

change their Medicaid income thresholds during the entire period of analysis, which




15
   Note that this change in Medicaid is different from the one examined by Garthwaite et al. (2014)
who examine the disenrollment of all adults from Medicaid in 2005. We also tested the effects of
the adult disenrollment on our outcome variables and found similar results to our experiment above.




                                                30
includes the following 10 states: Arizona, California, Kansas, Mississippi, North

Dakota, Rhode Island, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.


       The results in Table 6 are consistent with the reduction in occupational and

industrial mobility after the much less generous Medicaid system in Tennessee after

2000. Columns (1) and (2) show a reduction in occupational and industrial mobility

by 6.9% and 10.3%, respectively, in Tennessee after 2000. We also find that

workers moved away from riskier occupations and industries in Tennessee after

2000. In particular, columns (3) and (4) show that workers were 8.6% and 3.9%

less likely to move towards occupations with greater wage spreads and higher

separation rates in Tennessee after 2000, although the latter effect is not significant.

Columns (5) and (6) show that workers in Tennessee were 7.9% and 5.6% less

likely to move towards industries with high wage spreads and high separation rates

after 2000. Finally, columns (7)-(9) show that workers are also less likely to move

towards better jobs. Workers are 3.8% and 5.1% less likely to move towards

occupations and industries with higher median wages in Tennessee after 2000 (see

columns (7) and (8)). Column (9) also shows that workers in Tennessee are 9.3%

less likely to move towards jobs that have the same or higher educational

requirements after 2000, an indication that workers are moving down the job ladder

as Medicaid becomes less generous. Overall, this experiment shows that a sharp

reduction in the generosity of Medicaid decreases occupational and industrial

mobility and increases mobility towards safer and less desirable jobs.




                                          31
6. Conclusion


       In this paper, we go beyond the positive impacts of Medicaid in terms of

reducing ‘job lock’ and ‘employment lock’, and examine the role of Medicaid in

increasing occupational and industrial mobility. While occupational and industrial

mobility helps to reduce mismatches and is crucial for the healthy working of the

labor market, changing occupations and industries is risky and requires workers to

undertake investments that workers are not always willing to make.


       Here, we examined whether increased generosity of public health insurance

in the form of Medicaid incentivizes individuals to undertake risk and change

occupations and industries. The paper uses statutory changes in Medicaid income

and age thresholds during the 1990s and 2000s to examine how the generosity of

health insurance affects occupational and industrial mobility. We are careful to

control for other policy changes that were happening during this time period and

we check whether Medicaid income and age threshold changes were driven by

demographic factors, or by economic or labor market conditions. We find that these

factors cannot explain these statutory changes.


       We find substantial effects of an increase in income thresholds on

occupational and industrial mobility of 7.6% and 7.8%, respectively, when income

thresholds are increased from the level in states at the 10th to level in states at the

90th percentile of Medicaid income threshold generosity. We also do a falsification




                                          32
test by checking that those farther away from the threshold are not affected by

Medicaid changes. We find big effects for workers in the lowest income quintile

and, thus, close to the threshold, but no effects for those with much higher incomes

relative to the threshold. We also find bigger effects for women and for those with

children.


       Importantly, the increases in Medicaid eligibility also increase movement

towards jobs in occupations and industries that are riskier but also better. We find

that increased Medicaid income thresholds increase mobility towards occupations

and industries that are riskier in terms of having a higher variance of wages and

higher separation rates. Moreover, when Medicaid generosity rises, workers not

only move to riskier occupations and industries but towards better jobs. We find

that an increase in the Medicaid income threshold increases movement towards

occupations and industries with higher median wages. Also, while it has been

argued that public health insurance can improve the quality of matches, there is

little evidence of this except for Gruber and Madrian (1994) who found that access

to COBRA increases subsequent wages. In this paper, we actually measure match

quality by comparing the educational requirements in the occupation the person

moves to and the educational requirements in the previous occupation. We find that

an increase in Medicaid income thresholds increases the likelihood that a worker

will move to an occupation that has educational requirements that coincide or

exceed the educational requirements in the previous occupation. Thus, we find




                                        33
evidence that increased generosity of Medicaid helps workers move up the

occupation ladder.


       Moreover, we examine a natural experiment due to a large reduction in

Medicaid generosity in Tennessee, as the Medicaid income threshold fell from

400% to 200% of the FPL. We find that the reversal in generosity in Medicaid in

Tennessee after 2000, not only decreased occupational and industrial mobility but

it also decreased transitions towards riskier and better jobs. Thus, denying public

health insurance benefits to more households in Tennessee reduced labor mobility

and moved people towards safer jobs down the job ladder.


       This analysis indicates that decreased uncertainty in the form of public

health insurance should help encourage occupational and industrial mobility and

greater flexibility in the labor market, but also allow workers to move towards

riskier, better paid jobs and better matches.

Medicaid income threshold is the most generous income threshold for receiving Medicaid benefits in each state (units: % of poverty line).
Medicaid age threshold is the age at which the most generous income threshold expires for each state. TANF benefits are calculated for a
family of 3 using the following formula. TANF Benefit = Maximum Benefit-t(Earnings-D)-Unearned Income. Average tax rates at
different income percentiles are calculated using data from the March CPS ASEC supplement and using NBER’s taxsim software.
We construct two measures of transitions to risky occupations, transitions to occupations with higher separation rates (Transition to
Risky Occ-Wage) and transitions to occupations with higher wage variance (Transition to Risky Occ-Wage). We construct similar
measures for transitions across industries. We construct two measures of quality of matches. The first is based on median wages paid in the
occupation or industry and we construct at transitions to higher paying occupations and industries (Transition to Better Occ-Median Wage and
Transition to Better Ind-Median Wage). The second measure is only at the occupation level and looks at the education requirements of each
occupation using the Labor Department’s ONET database. A transition to a better match in terms of education requirement occurs if a worker
moves to an occupation with a similar or higher education requirement as his/her previous occupation. This variable is labelled as Transition
to Better Match-Education.

            Appendix: Construction of Tax and Transfer Variables


Since tax systems were changing during the time period of analysis, we construct
measures of tax progressivity and median taxes. To construct a measure of tax
progressivity, we start by constructing state income tax liabilities using the
TAXSIM software from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
jointly with the information from the March Supplement of the Current Population
Survey (CPS) to calculate the earned income, assets, pensions, disability, etc. for
those at the 75th and 25th percentile of the total income distribution. The average tax
rate is then obtained by dividing the tax liabilities by the average income at the 75th
and 25th percentile. We construct tax liabilities for those at the 75th and 25th
percentile of the national income distribution to hold constant the characteristics of
the population for all states and capture solely on the differences in tax rates, credits
and exemptions across states. To construct the tax liabilities, we assume that the
person is married and with one child and we use the averages for those at the 75th
and 25th percentiles of the national income distribution of the following variables:
wage and salary income of taxpayer, wage and salary income of spouse, dividend
income, interest income, rent income, alimony income, fellowships, taxable IRA
distributions, taxable pensions, gross social security benefits, other taxable transfer
income, child care expenses, and unemployment compensation. Similarly, we
measure the average tax rate for those at the median of the national income
distribution, assuming the person is married with one child and using the various
income variables to construct the tax rate for those at the 50th percentile of the
income distribution.
        We also construct measures of cash transfers since these were also changing
importantly during the period of study. We construct a measure of Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. TANF provides cash assistance to
low-income families with children. When TANF was introduced in 1996 to replace
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the system was
reformed by the legislation but also through state waivers introducing work
requirements, lifetime time limits, financial sanctions and enhanced-earnings
disregards. The benefits under TANF are constructed using information on
maximum benefits, benefit-reduction rates and flat earnings disregards which vary
over time and across states, as well as using earned and unearned income for the
25th percentile by year from the March CPS. In particular, we estimate TANF
benefits using the following formula from Hoynes and Luttmer (2011):
      TANF Benefitst = Max. Benefitst – τst × (Earningst25th – Dst) – Unearned
                                 Incomet25th,
where Max. Benefitst is the maximum benefit in state s at time t, τst is the benefit-
reduction rate in state s at time t and Dst is the flat earnings disregard in state s at
time t. We construct these Benefits for the average individual at the lowest 25th
percentile of the income distribution, so the earnings and unearned income are for
the average individual in the 25th percentile of the national income distribution.
