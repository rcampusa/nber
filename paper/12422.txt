                                           ABSTRACT


        Using Japanese firm-level data for the period from 1994-2002, this paper examines whether
a firm is chosen as an acquisition target based on its productivity level, profitability and other
characteristics and whether the performance of Japanese firms that were acquired by foreign firms
improves after the acquisition. In our previous study for the Japanese manufacturing sector, we found
that M&As by foreigners brought a larger and quicker improvement in total factor productivity (TFP)
and profit rates than M&As by domestic firms. However, it may argued that firms acquired by
foreign firms showed better performance simply because foreign investors acquired more promising
Japanese firms than Japanese investors did. In order to address this potential problem of selection
bias problem, in this study we combine a difference-in-differences approach with propensity score
matching. The basic idea of matching is that we look for firms that were not acquired by foreign
firms but had similar characteristics to firms that were acquired by foreigners. Using these firms as
control subjects and comparing the acquired firms and the control subjects, we examine whether
firms acquired by foreigners show a greater improvement in performance than firms not acquired
by foreigners. Both results from unmatched samples and matched samples show that foreign
acquisitions improved target firms’ productivity and profitability significantly more and quicker than
acquisitions by domestic firms.
        Moreover, we find that there is no positive impact on target firms’ profitability in the case
of both within-group in-in acquisitions and in-in acquisitions by domestic outsiders. In fact, in the
manufacturing sector, the return on assets even deteriorated one year and two years after
within-group in-in acquisition, while the TFP growth rate was higher after within-group in-in
acquisitions than after in-in acquisitions by outsiders. Our results imply that in the case of
within-group in-in acquisitions, parent firms may be trying to quickly restructure acquired firms even
at the cost of deteriorating profitability.

1. Introduction

      The flow of inward foreign direct investments (FDI) to Japan has increased dramatically

since the latter half of the 1990s. According to Japan’s international-investment-position statistics,

the stock of inward FDI in Japan rose 3.4-fold to 10.1 trillion yen during the six years from 1998

to 2004. Although Japan’s inward FDI stock/GDP ratio (2.0% in 2004) is only about one seventh

of the corresponding value of the U.S. (14.1% in 2003), employment in foreign affiliates as a

share of total employment is 2.75%, which is equivalent to about half of the corresponding value,

5.61%, for the U.S. (Table 1.1).




                                          Insert Table 1.1




      Despite the importance of the subject, there are few meaningful empirical studies on the

implications of the increase in inward FDI for the Japanese economy. In fact, some observers

have argued that Japan does not need more FDI. Like FDI in other developed economies, the

largest part of recent inflows to Japan took the form of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The

critics fear that inward M&As are dominated by “vulture” funds seeking to reap quick profits by

taking advantage of troubled firms (Nihon Keizai Shinbun 2003). Another argument is that some

inward M&As are in fact aimed at acquiring advanced technologies (Werner 2003) rather than at

transferring and employing intangible assets in Japan.

      According to quantitative studies on corporate performance in Japan, such as Kimura and

Kiyota (2004) and Fukao and Murakami (2005), foreign-owned firms tend to show higher

productivity than domestically-owned firms. However, the positive correlation between foreign

ownership and productivity does not necessarily mean that Japanese firms that were acquired by

foreign firms receive new technologies and management skills from their foreign owners and that




                                                 2
this transfer of intangible assets is responsible for their higher TFP (the technology-transfer

effect). There is another possible theoretical explanation for the positive correlation:

Foreign-owned firms enjoy greater productivity because foreign firms choose firms with higher

TFP as their M&A targets (the selection effect).

      In order to determine which one of the two effects is responsible for the positive

correlation between foreign ownership and productivity, in a previous study (Fukao, Ito and

Kwon, 2005), we conducted two empirical tests using firm-level data for Japan’s manufacturing

industry. In that study, we first estimated a Probit model explaining whether a firm is chosen as

an M&A target based on its TFP level and other characteristics. Second, we tested whether the

TFP of Japanese firms that were acquired by foreign firms improved after the investment.1

Estimating a Probit model, we found that foreign firms acquired Japanese firms enjoyed higher

TFP levels and higher profit rates. In contrast, in-in M&As seemed to have the characteristics of

rescue missions as they tended to target small firms with a higher total liability/total asset ratio.

Estimating the dynamic effects of M&As on target firms, we found that out-in M&As improved

target firms’ TFP level and current profit/sales ratio. Compared with in-in M&As, out-in M&As

brought a larger and quicker improvement in TFP and profit rates but no increase in target firms’

employment two years after the acquisition. Based on these results, we concluded that both the

selection effect and the technology-transfer effect play a role in explaining the positive

correlation between foreign ownership and productivity.

      Our previous study has several limitations, which this paper seeks to overcome. First,

although our study found that in-in M&As had the characteristics of rescue missions, this result


1
   Although the majority of FDI in developed economies has taken the form of cross-border
acquisitions, to our knowledge, there are only two empirical studies on this issue, Conyon et al.
(2002) and Fukao, Ito and Kwon (2005). Conyon et al. (2002) conducted an empirical analysis
on the impact of foreign ownership on productivity in the United Kingdom for the period
1989-1994. By observing productivity before and after the event of acquisition, they showed that
firms that were acquired by foreign firms exhibited an increase in labor productivity of 13%.


                                                   3
may have been influenced by the fact that some in-in M&As are conducted within groups of

related firms. In the case of M&As within firm groups, acquisitions are conducted as part of a

restructuring of the firm group and will indeed have the characteristics of rescue missions. On

the other hand, in-in M&As involving outsiders of firm groups may have similar effects as out-in

M&As. In this paper, using data on Japanese firm groups compiled by Toyo Keizai Shinposha,

we distinguish in-in M&As within firm groups and in-in M&As involving outsiders.

      Second, although 72 percent of FDI during the 1997-2002 period went into

non-manufacturing sectors, such as the finance & insurance, telecommunications, service, and

retail/wholesale sectors, which experienced deregulation, Fukao, Ito and Kwon (2005) only

examined M&As in Japan’s manufacturing industry. In this paper, we look at M&As not only in

the manufacturing sector but also in the wholesale and retail industry.

      Third, estimation results on the dynamic effects of M&As on target firms may suffer from

a selection bias problem. Suppose that foreign investors somehow acquire more promising

Japanese firms than Japanese investors do. Then the ex-post improvement of out-in M&A target

firms’ performance should not be regarded as evidence of technology-transfer from foreign

investors to acquired firms. In order to solve this selection bias problem, following Arnold and

Javorcik (2005), we combine a difference-in-differences approach with propensity score

matching. We employ the propensity score matching technique proposed by Rosenbaum and

Rubin (1983). The basic idea is that we first look for firms that were not acquired by foreign

firms but had similar characteristics to firms that were acquired by foreigners. Using these firms

as control subjects and comparing the treated (out-in M&A targets) and the control subjects, we

examine whether firms acquired by foreigners show a greater improvement in performance than

firms not acquired by foreigners.

      Fourth, using data for the period from 1994 to 2001, Fukao, Ito and Kwon (2005)




                                                 4
investigated the performance of target firms for only two years after each M&A. By adding data

of one more year, 2002, we now study dynamic effects of M&A with a longer time span.

      The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview

of out-in M&As in Japan. Section 3 then presents an outline of our data and reports our empirical

results. Section 4 summarizes our results.




2. An Overview of M&As in Japan

      Probably the most comprehensive data on M&As in Japan are published by the private

information service company RECOF. In this section, using these data, we provide an overview

of M&A activity in Japan. Figure 2.1 shows the number of out-in and in-in M&A cases in Japan

by year. Both out-in and in-in M&A cases have dramatically increased since the end of the

1990s.




                                        Insert Figure 2.1




      Several factors seem to have contributed to the increase in M&A cases during this period.

Firstly, in order to speed up the restructuring of Japanese firms, Japan’s corporate law was

amended at the end of the 1990s to facilitate M&As. Secondly, advances in information and

communication technology as well as deregulation during the 1990s mean that the optimal size

and optimal scope of firms in many sectors, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals,

telecommunication, finance, insurance, and commerce may have changed. Thirdly, deregulation

in Japan has removed barriers to inward FDI in some industries, such as broadcasting,

telecommunication, finance, and insurance. Fourthly, there was a world-wide boom in M&As

during this period and foreign investors, including private equity funds, and foreign agents of




                                               5
M&A, including investment banks, brought their M&A techniques and the M&A boom to Japan.

Fifthly, as a result of the prolonged recession and the financial crisis in 1998, Japanese stock

prices plunged and financially distressed firms and banks were forced to unwind their

cross-shareholdings, creating a “fire sale” situation that allowed foreign firms to acquire

Japanese companies.

      Probably as a result of the last three of these factors, the rapid increase in out-in M&As

preceded the boom in in-in M&As (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.2 shows the number of out-in M&A

cases by source region and by year. U.S. and European firms were the major investors. One

interesting new trend is that since 2000, investments from Asian countries have also been

increasing. Among the total of 97 out-in M&As involving firms from Asia in 1994-2002, 36

involved firms from China, 24 from Korea, 19 from Taiwan, and 8 from Singapore.




                                       Insert Figure 2.2




      An interesting question is whether there are any differences in the industry distribution of

target firms between M&A investments from Western countries and from Asia. Table 2.1 shows

the industry distribution of out-in M&A target firms by source region. Compared with

investments from Western countries, M&A investments from Asia tend to be concentrated in

electrical machinery, communication and broadcasting, and software. One possible explanation

regarding these differences is that Asian firms conduct M&A investments in Japan in order to

gain access to the technology of Japanese high-tech firms.

                                                6
      Another issue concerns the extent to which the out-in M&A boom in Japan was dominated

by private equity funds (“vulture funds”). Table 2.1, which shows the number of out-in

acquisitions by purchasers’ industry and by target firms’ industry, provides a clue. The table

shows that out-in M&As in the same industry are much more common than cross-industry out-in

M&As. There were only seven acquisitions of Japanese manufacturing firms by foreign investors

from the financial sector, which includes M&As by private equity funds. It is also interesting to

note that in the case of out-in M&As in the commerce sector, the majority of purchasers were

manufacturing firms. This is probably because manufacturers of differentiated products, such as

automobiles and electronic machinery, usually try to integrate the overseas sales of their products

in order to control and promote their exports.

3. Research Approach, Empirical Model and Results

      Attempts to provide a theoretical explanation for changes in ownership and the causes and

consequences of acquisitions have produced two different hypotheses: the synergy hypothesis

and the managerial-discipline hypothesis.2 The synergy hypothesis claims that acquisitions take

place when the value of the combined new hierarchical firm group to be created by the

acquisition is expected to be greater than the sum of the values of the independent firms. As

Nguyen and Ollinger (2002) have pointed out, if an acquisition is motivated by this synergy

effect, acquiring firms tend to target only productive and efficient firms. After a merger,



2
  Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987) and McGuckin and Nguyen (1995) tested these hypotheses
using U.S. plant level data. Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987) found that firms with low productivity
were chosen and productivity increased after the acquisition. McGuckin and Nguyen (1995)
found a positive relationship between changes in ownership and both initial productivity and
productivity growth after the acquisition.


                                                 7
synergies between the firms are expected to improve the performance of the acquired firm. In

contrast, the managerial-discipline hypothesis claims that acquisitions are driven by the intention

to strengthen managerial control over entrenched managers, who try to maximize their own

benefits rather than owners’ wealth. Therefore, takeover targets are likely to be inefficient firms

and their performance, especially the rate of return on capital, is expected to improve after the

acquisition (Jensen, 1988).

      In our previous study, Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005), we examined the characteristics of

firms acquired by in-in and out-in M&As by estimating Probit models and also estimated the

dynamic effects of M&As on target firms by regressing changes in performance on a set of

control variables and dummy variables which represent firms acquired by in-in or out-in M&As.

Through these estimations, we found that foreign firms acquired better performing Japanese

firms with higher TFP levels and higher profit rates. Moreover, out-in M&As improved target

firms’ TFP level and current profit-sales ratio, and compared with in-in M&As, out-in M&As

brought a larger and quicker improvement in the performance of acquired firms. Therefore, we

concluded that the motivation for out-in M&As tended to be to achieve synergy effects while the

motivation for in-in M&As tended to be to improve managerial efficiency. The analysis in Fukao,

Ito, and Kwon (2005) was based on the firm-level data for the period from 1994 to 2001

underlying the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities and the analysis

focused on the manufacturing sector. In this paper, we extend the sample period until 2002 and

include the data on non-manufacturing industries. The survey covers many non-manufacturing

industries: wholesale and retail trade, electricity and gas, information and communication

services, credit and finance business, restaurants, private education services, and other services

such as amusement and recreation, business services, and personal services. In the 2003 survey,

27,545 firms answered the survey. Of these, 12,946 firms are classified in the manufacturing




                                                8
sector (47 percent of the total number of responding firms). In this paper, using the new dataset,

we analyze the effect of out-in M&As on target firms’ performance for both the manufacturing

sector and the non-manufacturing sector following the methodology employed by Fukao, Ito, and

Kwon (2005). We examine whether the effects of M&As are temporary or long-lasting by

analyzing the dynamic effects using a longer time span. Moreover, we investigate whether there

are any differences between the effects of in-in M&As within a corporate group and those of

in-in M&As by outsiders.

      However, one possible concern is that firms acquired by foreign firms show better

performance simply because foreign firms acquired better performing firms or firms that would

potentially perform well even under local ownership.3 As Arnold and Javorcik (2005: 6) point

out, “plants acquired by foreign investors are unlikely to be a random sample from the

populations. To the extent that the acquisition targets differ systematically from other plants, a

problem of simultaneity between ownership status and other performance-relevant variables will

arise and bias the estimate of the productivity advantage.” In order to control for this selection

bias, we apply a matching technique in this paper. Using this technique, we identify for each firm

acquired by a foreign firm a suitable firm under continued domestic ownership for comparison.4

In other words, we find firms that were not acquired by foreign firms but had similar

characteristics as firms that were acquired by foreigners. Comparing the treated group (out-in

M&A targets) and the control group, we examine whether firms acquired by foreigners show a

3
   Many FDI-related studies show that compared with domestically-owned firms, foreign-owned
firms tend to be larger in size, more capital- and skill-intensive, and show better business
performance in terms of, for instance, productivity and profitability. See, for example, Doms and
Jensen (1998) for the United States, Griffith and Simpson (2001) for the United Kingdom,
Ramstetter (1999), Takii (2004), and Ito (2004) for Asian countries. Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005)
also compared differences in performance and other characteristics of local and foreign-owned
firms in Japanese manufacturing and found that foreign-owned firms showed a better
performance.
4
   Arnold and Javorcik (2005), using plant-level data on the Indonesian manufacturing sector,
apply the matching technique and compare TFP levels and other performance measures of
domestic plants and plants acquired by foreign firms.


                                                9
greater or faster improvement in performance than firms not acquired by foreigners.

      In order to examine this issue, we compare the growth rates of performance measures of

acquired firms with those of firms remaining under domestic ownership using a

difference-in-differences (DID) technique. The difference-in-differences technique compares the

difference in average outcome before and after the treatment for the treated group with the

difference in average outcome during the same period for the comparison group.5 However,

before applying the difference-in-differences technique, we need to overcome or at least reduce

the problem of sample selection bias. Following Arnold and Javorcik (2005), we combine the

difference-in-differences approach with propensity score matching.6 We employ the propensity

score matching technique proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). In studies evaluating the

effects of economic policy interventions, etc., data often come from (non-randomized)

observational studies and the estimation of the effect of treatment may be biased by the existence

of confounding factors. The propensity score matching method provides a way to reduce the bias

of the estimation of treatment effects controlling for the existence of the confounding effect by

comparing treated and control subjects that are as similar as possible. Since matching subjects on

an n-dimensional vector of characteristics is typically unfeasible for large n, the propensity score

matching method summarizes the pre-treatment characteristics of each subject into a single-index

variable (i.e., the propensity score) which makes the matching feasible.7




3.1 The Propensity Score Matching and the Difference-in-Differences Estimator

5
  The DID estimator assumes that unobserved macro-economic shocks affect the treatment and
the control group in the same way (“common trends assumption”).
6
  This type of strategy is often employed in studies in the field of labor economics such as
Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997) and Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998).
Moreover, the matching estimator has become increasingly popular in international economics
and other areas of economics. See, for example, Girma, Greenaway, and Kneller (2004), Barba
Navaretti, Castellani, and Disdier (2006) and Hijzen, Jean, and Mayer (2006).
7
  For details on the method and an explanation of the Stata program for the method, see Becker
and Ichino (2002).


                                                10
      The propensity score is defined by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) as the conditional

probability of assignment to a particular treatment given the pre-treatment characteristics:

               p ( x ) ≡ Pr{z = 1 | x} = E{z | x}                                            (1)

where z = {0, 1} is the indicator of receiving the treatment and x is a vector of observed

pretreatment characteristics. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that if the recipient of the

treatment is randomly chosen within cells defined by x, it is also random within cells defined by

the values of the single-index variable p(x). Therefore, for each treatment case i, if the propensity

score p(xi) is known, the Average effect of Treatment on the Treated (ATT) can be estimated as

follows:

              αˆ ATT = E{y1i − y 0i | zi = 1}                                                 (2)

                     = E{E{y1i − y 0i | zi = 1, p ( xi )}}

                     = E {E{y1i | zi = 1, p ( xi )} − E{y 0i | zi = 0, p ( xi )} | zi = 1}

where y1 and y0 denote the potential outcomes in the two counterfactual situations of treatment

and no treatment, respectively. Therefore, according to the last line of equation (2), the ATT can

be estimated as the average difference between the outcome of recipients and non-recipients of

the treatment whose propensity scores p(xi) are identical.

      In the case of this study, we focus on the difference in ex post performance between

acquired firms and non-acquired firms. Therefore, in our case, z denotes whether a firm is

acquired or not, x is a vector of various characteristics of a firm such as firm size, length of

business experience, ex ante performance, etc. At the first stage, by estimating a probit model, we

investigate important determinants of acquisitions and compute the propensity score (i.e., the

probability of a firm being acquired by another firm) for each firm. Making use of this result, we

conduct propensity score matching and compare the performance of firms within the pairs of

observations matched on the propensity score. In our matching process, firms are matched




                                                    11
separately for each year and industry using one-to-one nearest matching with replacement.8

        In the second stage, we estimate a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator to evaluate

the causal effect of acquisition on a set of performance variables of interest. Once matched, the

only difference between acquired and non-acquired firms is their acquisition status. Therefore,

we focus on the Average effect of Treatment on the Treated (ATT). The ATT can be estimated as

equation (2) above, which, in the case of this study, is equivalent to the following equation:

      α̂ ATT =
                 n  1
                      (

3.2    Data Source

         Our analysis on the effects of acquisitions is based on the firm-level data of the Kigyo

Katsudo Kihon Chosa (Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities) compiled by

the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI).9 Our data cover the period from 1994 to



8
  Our matching procedure is implemented in Stata 9 using a modified version of the procedure
provided by Leuven and Sianesi (2001). As we match firms separately for each year and industry
(13 manufacturing industries and 9 non-manufacturing industries), we had to modify the
program.

  The survey covers all firms with at least 50 employees or 30 million yen of paid-in capital in
the Japanese manufacturing, mining, commerce, and several other service sectors.


                                                                12
2002.10 We define out-in M&As as cases where a firm that did not have a parent firm abroad

with majority ownership at time t–1 comes to have a foreign parent firm with majority

ownership at time t. Similarly, we define in-in M&As as cases where a firm that did not have a

parent firm with majority ownership at time t–1 comes to have a domestic parent firm with

majority ownership at time t. Therefore, if a firm is sold from a domestic parent firm to another

domestic parent firm, such cases are not counted as in-in M&As in our above definition.

      Tables 3.1 and 3.2 show the number of out-in and in-in M&A cases in our dataset. We

have 156 cases of out-in M&As and 3,132 cases of in-in M&As for the period from 1994 to 2002.

As shown in Table 3.2, our unbalanced panel consists of 186,080 observations, out of which 53

percent fall into the manufacturing sector. More than 80 percent of the non-manufacturing

observations fall into the wholesale and retail trade sector. Table 3.2 also shows that out-in

M&As are heavily concentrated in a relatively small number of industries, which include

chemicals, machinery, and wholesale and retail trade.11 Although in-in M&As also tend to be

concentrated in these industries, they are more widely dispersed, covering all industries except

agriculture, forestry and fishing.

      Data on sales, purchases, total assets, profits, total liabilities, firm age, the number of

mainly use newly constructed industry-level deflators which were taken from the JIP (Japan

deflate firms’ sales and intermediate inputs, respectively. Exports and R&D expenditure are

deflated by the export price index compiled by Bank of Japan and the R&D price index

compiled by the Science and Technology Agency and reported in Kagaku Gijutsu Yoran 2003,

respectively. Advertising expenditure is deflated by the corporate services price index provided

by the Bank of Japan. ROA is defined as the ratio of after-tax profits inclusive of interest

payments to total assets. Table 3.3 provides a description of the variables used in our

econometric analysis. The summary statistics for the variables are shown in Appendix Table 1

3.3   Are Acquisition Targets Better Than the Rest? A Probit Estimation

      Using our panel data for 1994-2002, we estimate probit models designed to test whether a

firm is chosen as an M&A target based on its productivity or profitability level or whether other

characteristics are more important.

      The dependent variables are the out-in M&A dummy (Out-in) and the in-in M&A dummy

(In-in).13 Each dummy variable takes value one when an acquisition occurs. As explanatory

   The JIP Database 2006 was compiled as part of the RIETI (Research Institute of Economy,
Trade and Industry) research project “Development of a RIETI Manufacturing Database and
Study of Productivity by Industry” for fiscal 2004-05. The JIP 2006 contains sector-level
information on 108 sectors from 1970 to 2002 that can be used for total factor productivity
analyses. These sectors cover the whole Japanese economy. A preliminary version of the JIP
database is available from the RIETI website <http://www.rieti.go.jp/jp/database/d04.html>.

   We were also interested in the difference between determinants of out-in M&As by Asian
firms and by Western firms and the difference between the outcomes for these two types of out-in
M&As. However, the number of observations for M&A cases by Asian firms is very small and
almost no observations were left after we screened the data. Therefore, we gave up investigating
the characteristics or outcomes of out-in M&As by Asian firms in this study. Nonetheless, as
mentioned in Section 2, the number of out-in M&A cases by Asian firms has been increasing in
recent years and M&As by Asian firms are an issue that deserves further investigation in future
studies.


                                               14
variables, we use the logarithm of TFP, ROA (return on assets), the logarithm of employment to

represent firm size, firm age, the share of the number of non-production workers in the total

number of workers as an indicator of human capital, R&D intensity, advertising intensity, export

intensity, and the debt-asset ratio.14 All the explanatory variables are values in year t-1, i.e., the

year preceding the year of acquisition, t. The model also includes a full set of industry and year

dummies.

      The results from the probit estimation are presented in Table 3.4. The determinants of

acquisition are quite different for out-in acquisitions and in-in acquisitions. In the case of out-in

acquisitions, consistent with the preceding results of Fukao, Ito and Kwon (2005) and Conyon et

al. (2002), we find that firms with higher TFP, a higher profit rate, a higher share of

non-production workers, a higher export intensity, and of larger size are chosen as targets in the

manufacturing sector (equation (1) of Table 3.4). As for the non-manufacturing sector, firms with

a higher profit rate and higher advertising and export intensities tend to be chosen as out-in M&A

targets (equation (2) of Table 3.4). This result implies that foreign firms acquire well-performing

Japanese firms. In contrast, in the case of in-in acquisitions, many of these performance measures

are not significant determinants of acquisitions, although we can see that in the manufacturing

sector, firms with higher TFP are more likely to be acquired (equation (3) of Table 3.4).

Moreover in the case of in-in acquisitions in the non-manufacturing sector, firms with a higher

profit rate and export intensity are less likely to be acquired, which is conspicuously different


14
   In the case of the non-manufacturing sector, the share of the number of non-production
workers in the total number of workers, R&D intensity, and export intensity are excluded from
the explanatory variables. We define “production workers” as the workers who are working in
manufacturing plants and consequently, our definition of the share of non-production is not
appropriate as a proxy for human capital or skilled labor in the case of the non-manufacturing
sector. The data on R&D expenditure are not very reliable for many firms in the
non-manufacturing sector in our dataset. As for exports, most of exporting firms are trading
companies and there are very few firms who export their products or services in other
non-manufacturing industries. Therefore, we think these variables are not appropriate
explanatory variables in the case of non-manufacturing sector.

from the case of out-in acquisitions (equation (4) of Table 3.4). Another important difference

between out-in and in-in acquisitions is that firms with a higher debt-asset ratio are chosen as

targets in the case of in-in acquisitions while firms with a lower debt-asset ratio are chosen as

targets in the case of out-in acquisitions. This result implies that in-in acquisitions may have the

characteristics of rescue missions. As discussed in Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005), in-in

acquisitions in Japan may be mainly conducted within vertical and horizontal keiretsu networks

or within a corporate group, and financially distressed firms are salvaged by other member firms

or parent firms through M&As. We will return to this issue in the next subsection.

                                          Insert Table 3.4




      The results from the probit estimation generally indicate that foreign firms tend to target

firms that are more productive and have a higher ROA while Japanese firms target firms with

low profitability. There are two potential explanations for these revealed preferences of foreign

firms. One is the synergy hypothesis. Foreign firms seek synergy effects when they purchase

Japanese firms. In order to make sure they reap synergy effects, foreign firms prefer excellent

Japanese firms. The other explanation, which is not necessarily inconsistent with the first, is an

asymmetric information problem. Foreign firms are disadvantaged in gathering information on

small Japanese firms. It is a very difficult task for foreign firms to correctly evaluate whether

they can restructure a small Japanese firm teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and negotiate

from their home country debt rescheduling with the Japanese main bank of such a firm. Because

of this problem, foreign firms might prefer better Japanese firms as their target.

      In the case of cross-border portfolio investment, it is well known that investors tend to

prefer stocks of excellent and large manufacturing firms with high export intensity. Probably in

the case of out-in M&As, the problem of asymmetric information causes a similar phenomenon.




                                                 16
After establishing a beachhead by purchasing an excellent Japanese firm, foreign firms probably

can gather more information on smaller and inferior Japanese firms and then start purchasing

such firms. But if this new purchase is conducted by the beachhead Japanese affiliate, our data on

out-in M&As do not cover such cases.

      In the case of in-in M&As, we found that Japanese firms tend to target inefficient firms

with low profits or with a high debt-asset ratio. This finding is consistent with the

managerial-discipline hypothesis.




3.4 Do Acquisitions Improve the Performance of Target Firms?                        – An Analysis of the

Dynamic Effects Based on the Unmatched Sample

      In this subsection, we examine how the performance of targeted firms changes after the

acquisition. First, following Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005), we estimate the following model of

the dynamic effects of an acquisition in order to see whether the improvement in performance is

significantly faster for acquired firms than for non-acquired firms:



       y f , t + s − y f , t −1 = α + β1Outin f , t + β 2 Inin f ,t + x f , t −1φ
              + ∑ λτ YearDummy(t ,τ ) + ∑ δ j IndustryDummy (i , j ) + ε f , t                   (4)
                  τ                                    j


         s = {1, 2, 3, 4}

where yf,t denotes the performance of firm f in year t and xf,t-1 is a vector of various firm

characteristics which are expected to affect the performance of firm f in year t-1. As variables to

measure targeted firms’ performance we use the logarithm of TFP and the return on assets (ROA)

ratio. It likely takes several years for the performance improving effects of an acquisition to

materialize. In order to take this time lag into account, we examine whether the performance of

acquired firms has improved s (=1, 2, 3, 4) years after the acquisition compared with the




                                                            17
performance in the year prior to the acquisition. As explanatory variables, we use out-in and in-in

acquisition dummies (Out-in and In-in) which take 1 for an acquired firm in year t when the

acquisition occurs, the lagged values of the two performance variables (the TFP level and the

ROA), the lagged logarithm of the number of employees in year t-1, and several additional firm

characteristics, such as the length of business experience (Age), the ratio of the number of

non-production workers to the number of total workers, R&D intensity, advertising intensity,

export intensity, and the debt-asset ratio.15 A full set of industry and year dummies is also

included. λτ and δj denote the coefficients of the year and industry dummies, respectively. By

looking at the coefficients on the Out-in and In-in dummy variables, β1 and β2, we will evaluate

whether the performance of acquired firms improved faster than that of non-acquired firms once

other characteristics are controlled for.




                                      Insert Tables 3.5 and 3.6




      The estimation results for the manufacturing sector on the effects of the acquisition are

reported in Tables 3.5 and 3.6. Table 3.5 presents the effect of the acquisition on the TFP growth

rate, while Table 3.6 shows the effect of the acquisition on the ROA ratio. The results in Table

3.5 suggest that compared with non-acquired firms, both firms acquired by foreigners and firms

acquired by another domestic firm show a significantly higher TFP growth rate during the four-

year-period from the year prior to the acquisition to three years after the acquisition. The

coefficient on the out-in dummy variable is much larger than that on the in-in dummy in the

cases of the 3-year window (equation (2) of Table 3.5) and the 4-year window (equation (3) of


15
   In the case of the non-manufacturing sector, we exclude the share of non-production workers,
R&D intensity, and export intensity for the same reasons as in the probit estimation in the
previous subsection.


                                                18
Table 3.5), which implies that out-in acquisitions may have a larger positive effect on TFP

growth. In the case of the 5-year window (equation (4) of Table 3.5), however, the coefficient on

the out-in dummy becomes insignificant while the coefficient on the in-in dummy remains

positive and significant. Therefore, regarding the effects of acquisitions on the TFP growth rate,

the results in Table 3.5 suggest that out-in acquisitions tend to bring a larger productivity

improvement than in-in acquisitions three years after the acquisition, but the productivity

improvements from out-in acquisitions do not last long.

      On the other hand, the results in Table 3.6 indicate that out-in acquisitions lead to a

significant improvement in target firms’ profitability (measured as ROA) three and four years

after the acquisition. Although no immediate improvement in profitability can be observed after

out-in acquisitions, the results clearly indicate that out-in acquisitions contribute to higher

profitability while in-in acquisitions do not have any impact on target firms’ profitability.

      In the case of the non-manufacturing sector, the impact of out-in acquisitions on target

firms’ performance differs more sharply from that of in-in acquisitions (Tables 3.7 and 3.8).

Out-in acquisitions result in higher TFP growth for target firms three years after the acquisition,

while the TFP improvement effect of in-in acquisitions is very small or even negative and not

statistically significant (Table 3.7). As for ROA, out-in acquisitions have a significant positive

effect beginning immediately after the acquisition, while the effects of in-in acquisitions are

negative but insignificant in all equations except one in Table 3.8.




                                     Insert Tables 3.7 and 3.8




      Overall, we find some evidence that out-in acquisitions lead to an improvement in target

firms’ ROA both in the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing sector. Moreover, out-in




                                                 19
acquisitions also lead to a TFP improvement three years after the acquisition both in the

manufacturing and the non-manufacturing sector. These results regarding out-in acquisitions are

consistent with the synergy hypotheses. On the other hand, in the case of in-in acquisitions, the

result that there is no significant improvement in ROA does not provide much support for the

managerial-discipline hypotheses.

      Although our results do not seem to support the managerial-discipline hypotheses, in the

case of in-in acquisitions, firms with a lower profit rate (for the non-manufacturing sector) and a

higher debt-asset ratio (for both the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing sectors) are, as

discussed in Section 3.3, more likely to be acquired. This result implies that in-in acquisitions

may have the characteristics of rescue missions, which may be one reason why there is no

conspicuous improvement in performance after an in-in acquisition. As mentioned above, many

cases of in-in acquisitions in Japan are conducted within vertical and horizontal keiretsu

networks or within a corporate group. In the case of within-group acquisitions, since workers

and managers of acquired firms expect further support by group firms, it may be difficult to

accomplish drastic restructuring. On the other hand, in-in acquisitions involving outsiders may

have a positive effect on performance after the acquisition in a way that is similar to out-in

acquisitions. In order to test this hypothesis, we examine the dynamic effects of in-in

acquisitions within firm groups and of in-in acquisitions involving outsiders.

      For information on firm groups, we use the Kankei Kaisha database (subsidiary firms

database) compiled by Toyo Keizai Shinposha. We define acquisitions as conducted within a

group if, prior to the acquisition, between 20 and 50 percent of the paid-in capital of the acquired

firm was held by a related company. It is important to note, however, that if firm A was partly

owned by related firm B, but the majority of firm A’s equity is newly acquired by another firm C,

which did not have a close relationship with firm A before the acquisition, such a case is




                                                20
incorrectly included in our sample as a “within-group acquisitions.” Using the Toyo Keizai

information, we find 518 within-group in-in acquisition cases in our dataset for the period from

1994 to 2002, which is approximately one-sixth of the total of in-in acquisition cases (refer to

Table 3.1). The estimation results including the within-group in-in acquisition dummy variable

and the dummy for in-in acquisitions by outsiders are reported in Tables 3.9 to 3.12.




                                    Insert Tables 3.9 and 3.10




      Tables 3.9 and 3.10 show the results for the manufacturing sector. Contrary to our

expectation, target firms of within-group in-in acquisitions tend to show a higher TFP growth

rate than target firms of in-in acquisitions by outsiders. The TFP growth rate during the period

from a year prior to the acquisition to three years after the acquisition is significantly higher for

firms acquired by a group firm than for firms acquired by a domestic outsider firm. As for ROA

performance, however, within-group in-in acquisitions tend to have a significant negative impact,

while acquisitions by domestic outsiders did not have any significant effects. These results imply

that again, the managerial-discipline hypothesis does not seem to apply in the case of in-in

acquisitions in Japan. Rather, the results may be interpreted as follows: In the case of

within-group in-in acquisitions, parent firms may try to quickly restructure acquired firms, which

temporarily worsens their profitability. However, after the business restructuring is completed,

the acquired firms may be able to enjoy higher productivity by effectively utilizing managerial

and technological resources within the corporate group.




                                   Insert Tables 3.11 and 3.12




                                                 21
      According to the results for the non-manufacturing sector shown in Tables 3.11 and 3.12,

we can see a significant positive impact of within-group in-in acquisitions on the TFP growth

rate only in the case of the 5-year window (equation (4) of Table 3.11). In all the other cases, the

coefficients for within-group in-in acquisitions and in-in acquisitions by outsiders are not

statistically significant. Although out-in acquisitions positively affect the return on assets in the

case of the non-manufacturing sector, neither type of in-in acquisitions has a positive impact on

ROA. In the case of the non-manufacturing sector, our results suggest that there is no

conspicuous difference between the effects of within-group in-in acquisitions and in-in

acquisitions by outsiders. That is, in the non-manufacturing sector, even acquisitions by domestic

outsiders do not lead to an improvement in the acquired firms’ performance.

      Thus, we find that there is no positive impact on target firms’ ROA both in the case of

within-group in-in acquisitions and in-in acquisitions by outsiders, implying that the

managerial-discipline hypothesis is not supported.




3.5   Do M&As Improve the Performance of Target Firms? – Analysis Based on

Difference-in-Differences Estimates from the Matched Sample

      Our estimation results on the dynamic effects of out-in and in-in acquisitions in the

previous subsection indicate that both in the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing sectors

out-in acquisitions lead to improvements in target firms’ TFP and ROA. These results are

consistent with those in Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005), although the results of that study indicated

that out-in acquisitions improve target firms’ performance more quickly. 16 However, as


16
   The difference between the results of that study and the present one is probably due to the fact
that (1) the data for this study cover the period 1994-2002, which is one year longer than the
observation period in Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005); (2) this study uses newly compiled and
detailed industry-level deflators taken from the JIP database 2006; and (3) the explanatory
variables employed in the regression analyses are not exactly the same as those in Fukao, Ito, and
Kwon (2005).


                                                 22
described at the beginning of Section 3, the Fukao, Ito, and Kwon (2005) study does not address

the selection bias problem and therefore suffers from the problem of simultaneity between

ownership status and other performance variables because out-in acquisition targets differ

systematically from other firms as indicated by the results of probit analysis. The analysis in this

study so far also has not addressed the simultaneity problem yet. Therefore, we now employ the

propensity score matching and the difference-in-differences (DID) techniques described in

Section 3.1 and examine whether we still find that out-in acquisitions lead to an improvement in

acquired firms’ performance even after the simultaneity problem has been overcome or at least

reduced. What we are interested in is the causal effect of acquisition on target firms’ performance.

However, changes in performance following an acquisition are not exclusively the result of the

acquisition but also depend on other factors. Applying the DID technique, the change in

performance before and after the acquisition therefore is further differenced with respect to

changes in performance of the control group of non-acquired firms. Therefore, the DID estimator

removes the effects of common shocks and more accurately measures the causal effect of the

acquisition.

      Using the probit estimation results shown in Table 3.4, we first identify the probability of

acquisition (or “propensity score”) for all firms in our dataset.17 Our probit estimation model in

Table 3.4 assumes that the propensity of firms to be acquired by other firms is a function of the


17
   In order to verify whether the balancing condition is satisfied in our matched sample, we
conduct two tests, following Hijzen, Jean, and Mayer (2006). First, we examine the standardized
bias for variables included in the propensity score estimation before and after matching (see
Smith and Todd, 2005). Rosenbaum and Rubin (1985) assume that a standardized bias in excess
of 20 percent is large, although there is no formal criterion to assess the bias. Second, for each
variable in the propensity score estimation, we perform standard t-tests for equality of means of
each variable between the treated group and the non-treated group before and after matching.
The results of these two tests are presented in Appendix Tables 2 and 3. The standardized bias
and t-test for equality of means before and after matching indicate that the balancing property is
satisfied for most of our variables. However, the debt-asset ratio in the case of manufacturing and
the ROA ratio in the case of non-manufacturing are less likely to satisfy the balancing property.
Further investigation and improvement in matching accuracy may be necessary.


                                                23
TFP level, firm size, the number of years since establishment, the share of the number of

non-production workers, R&D intensity, advertisement intensity, export intensity, and the

debt-asset ratio.18 A non-acquired firm which is “closest” in terms of its propensity score to an

acquired firm is selected as a match for an actually acquired firm using the one-to-one nearest

neighbor matching method. One-to-one nearest neighbor matching means that we can use data

only from a subset of the sample. In the case of out-in acquisitions, our matched sample contains

132 firms not acquired by foreigners as a match for the 132 firms acquired by foreigners (60

firms in manufacturing and 72 firms in non-manufacturing). In the case of in-in acquisitions, our

matched sample contains 2,820 firms not acquired by domestic firms as a match for the 2,820

firms acquired by domestic firms (1,385 firms in manufacturing and 1,435 firms in

non-manufacturing).

      Using the subsets of the sample, we estimate a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator,

which in our case, is equivalent to calculating the Average effect of Treatment on the Treated

(ATT) based on equation (3) in Section 3.1. The calculated effects of out-in and in-in acquisitions

are presented in Tables 3.13 and 3.14. In the case of the manufacturing sector (Table 3.13), a

foreign acquisition leads to an additional 5 percentage-point productivity growth in the firms

acquired by foreigners three years after the acquisition. The result also shows that firms acquired

by foreign firms enjoy an ROA advantage over the control group equivalent to 4

percentage-points at the end of the third year of foreign ownership and 2.5 percentage-points at

the end of the fourth year of foreign ownership. Although we find a TFP improvement effect four

years after in-in acquisitions, the results in Table 3.13 generally show that performance

improvements are likely to be larger in the case of foreign acquisition. Table 3.14 shows that

foreign ownership improved the TFP and ROA of acquired firms also in the non-manufacturing

18
  In the case of the non-manufacturing sector, we exclude the share of non-production workers,
R&D intensity, and export intensity.

sector at the end of the third year of foreign acquisition. On the other hand, in-in acquisitions do

not have any significant impact on the performance of acquired firms. Moreover, the magnitude

of the ATT tends to be much larger for out-in acquisitions in the non-manufacturing sector

compared with that for out-in acquisitions in the manufacturing sector, although in many cases

the ATT is not statistically significant.

      The results from the matched sample indicate that foreign acquisitions improve target

firms’ productivity and profitability while acquisitions by domestic firms hardly have any

positive impact on performance. However, the significant positive effect of foreign acquisitions

shows up only three years after acquisition, implying that the realization of synergy effects from

acquisitions or the restructuring of acquired firms take at least three years. Moreover, according

to the results, improvements experienced by firms acquired by foreigners are likely to be a

temporary phenomenon. Although the matching results provide only weak evidence that

acquisition by a foreign firm improves the performance of acquired firms, they do confirm that

such a positive effect exists, even when the sample selection bias is removed. Furthermore, the

matching result that performance improvements are likely to be realized three years after

acquisition are consistent with the estimation results from the unmatched samples in the previous

subsection.

4. Conclusion

      In recent years, the Japanese government has been actively promoting inward foreign

direct investment with the aim of accelerating structural adjustment and achieving a full-scale

economic recovery. In order to examine whether the entry of foreign firms indeed does provide a

stimulus to the Japanese economy and contribute to a better performance of Japanese firms, we




                                                 25
investigated the effects of out-in M&As on target firms’ performance in a previous study (Fukao,

Ito, and Kwon, 2005). Although that study found some evidence that out-in M&As brought

larger and quicker improvements in TFP and the profit-to-sales ratio than in-in M&As, the study

had several limitations. This paper sought to overcome these limitations by conducting (1) a

much more careful investigation of the effect of in-in acquisitions by distinguishing within-group

in-in acquisitions and in-in acquisitions by outsiders; (2) an analysis on firms in the

non-manufacturing sector; (3) a more rigorous analysis by employing propensity score matching

and the difference-in-differences technique; and (4) an analysis using a new dataset which

contains the most recent data available.

      The results of this paper were generally consistent with those in Fukao, Ito, and Kwon

(2005). But the present study also produced several new findings. First, we found that there was

no positive impact on target firms’ ROA in the case of both within-group in-in acquisitions and

in-in acquisitions by domestic outsiders. In fact, in the manufacturing sector, the return on assets

even deteriorated one year and two years after within-group in-in acquisitions. The results thus

did not support the managerial-discipline hypothesis which suggests that acquisitions are

intended to strengthen managerial control over entrenched managers who are more interested in

their own benefit than the wealth of the firm’s owners, and which therefore predicts that the

profitability of acquired firms improves after the acquisition. Rather, our results imply that in the

case of within-group in-in acquisitions, parent firms may be trying to quickly restructure

acquired firms even at the cost of deteriorating profitability. Our results also showed that

within-group in-in acquisitions brought a larger and quicker improvement in TFP compared with

in-in acquisitions by domestic outsiders both in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing

sectors.

      Second, we found that foreign acquisitions improved target firms’ productivity and




                                                 26
profitability significantly more and quicker than acquisitions by domestic firms. We confirmed

these results by employing a methodology that combines propensity score matching and

difference-in-differences techniques. The methodology enabled us to ensure that the

characteristics of acquired firms and non-acquired firms are as close as possible and to isolate

causal effects that can be reliably attributed to acquisitions.

      One potential concern is that our results from the matched sample may not be very strong

and robust. A possible reason for our somewhat weak results may be the accuracy of the

matching. As mentioned in Girma, Greenaway, and Kneller (2004), the importance of appropriate

matching cannot be overemphasized. If acquired firms experience a surge in productivity just

before the acquisition, their productivity is likely to grow more slowly in subsequent periods. In

such a case, a difference-in-differences estimator based on randomly matched firms is likely to

underestimate the performance impact of acquisitions. There may be room for further

improvement of the matching methodology in future studies.

      Another possible concern is that the reliability of the difference-in-differences

methodology is dependent on the assumption that acquired and non-acquired firms are similarly

affected by macroeconomic factors. However, the bias arising from this assumption is mitigated

as much as possible in this study because firms are matched in the same industry and year in our

matching process.

      Although we found some positive effects of foreign acquisitions on target firms’

performance, the magnitude of the positive effects is much smaller than that observed in Arnold

and Javorcik’s (2005) study for Indonesia. This is not surprising because the difference in

technological and managerial capabilities between domestic and foreign firms is much larger in

Indonesia than in Japan and technology transfer effects from foreign firms to domestic firms

should be less relevant in Japan. However, our results in this study imply that even in Japan,




                                                  27
where many domestic firms are closer to the technology frontier, performance improvement

effects from foreign acquisitions are present. Moreover, we find that the positive effects of

foreign acquisitions tend to be much larger in the case of the non-manufacturing sector than in

the case of the manufacturing sector. It is often argued anecdotally that the productivity of

Japanese non-manufacturing firms is relatively low compared with firms in other developed

countries. If this is true, the positive effect of foreign acquisitions in the non-manufacturing

sector may have very important policy implications: Foreign acquisitions possibly contribute to a

better performance of target firms in the non-manufacturing sector by transferring advanced

technology or managerial know-how. However, in our dataset, most out-in acquisitions in the

non-manufacturing sector occur in the wholesale and retail trade industries. The majority of

out-in acquisitions in these industries consist of acquisitions by manufacturing firms, suggesting

that foreign manufacturing firms often acquire Japanese wholesalers or retailers in order to

obtain their own distribution channels. Although technology and managerial know-how transfer

effects may not be relevant, such cases possibly contribute to the streamlining of distribution

networks in the Japanese commerce sector. A more detailed investigation of technology transfer

effects particularly in the non-manufacturing sector is an issue warranting of further

investigation.

Appendix: Construction of the Multilateral Index
  The dataset employed in this paper was obtained from Kigyo Katsudo Kihon Chosa (Basic
Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities), which is conducted annually by the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).
  We define the productivity level of firm i in year t in a certain industry in comparison with the
productivity level of a hypothetical representative firm in base year 0 in that industry.
  The TFP level is defined as follows:

                                          n 1
          lnTFPi,t = (lnQi,t − lnQt ) − ∑f =1 (S f ,i,t + S f ,t )(lnX f ,i,t − ln X f ,t )
                                             2
                                                                                                     (A1)
                                             n 1
          + ∑s=1(lnQs − lnQs−1) − ∑s=1∑f =1 (S f ,s + S f ,s−1)(ln X f ,s − ln X f ,s−1)]
              t                         t

                                               2


where Qi, t, Sf, i, t, and Xf, i, t denote the output of firm i in year t, the cost share of factor f for firm i
in year t, and firm i’s input of factor f in year t, respectively. Variables with an upper bar denote
the industry average of that variable.


Output: Except for the commerce sector, gross output is defined as firms’ total sales. For the
commerce sector, gross output is measured as sales minus expenses for purchased materials.
Gross output is deflated by the output deflator derived from the JIP 2006.


Intermediate inputs: For the commerce sector, intermediate inputs are calculated as (Cost of
sales + Operating costs) – (Wages + Depreciation costs + Expenses for purchased materials). The
intermediate inputs of other sectors are defined as (Cost of sales + Operating costs) – (Wages +
Depreciation costs). Intermediate inputs are deflated by the intermediate input deflator provided
in the JIP 2006.


Labor input: As labor input, we used each firm’s total number of workers multiplied by the
sectoral working hours from the JIP 2006.


Capital Stock: For capital stock, the only data available are the nominal book values of tangible
fixed assets. Using these data, we calculated the net capital stock of firm i in industry j in
constant 1995 prices as follows:


                                      K it = BVit ∗ ( INK jt / IBV jt )

where BVit represents the book value of firm i’s tangible fixed capital in year t, INKjt stands for



                                                      29
the net capital stock of industry j in constant 1995 prices, and IBVjt denotes the book value of
industry j’s capital. INKjt was calculated as follows. First, as a benchmark, we took the data on
the book value of tangible fixed assets in 1975 from the Financial Statements Statistics of
Corporations published by MOF. We then converted the book value of year 1975 into the real
value in constant 1995 prices using the investment deflator provided in the JIP 2006. Second, the
net capital stock of industry j, INKjt, for succeeding years was calculated using the perpetual
inventory method. We used the investment deflator in the JIP 2006. The sectoral depreciation
rate used is taken from the JIP 2006.

Cost Shares: Total cost of labor is measured as total wages. We used nominal intermediate input
as the intermediate input cost. Capital cost was calculated by multiplying the real net capital
stock with the user cost of capital. The latter was estimated as follows:


        1− z                                     p&
 ck =        pk {λr + (1 − u )(1 − λ )i + δ i − ( k )}
        1− u                                     pk


where    pk , i, δ , u , λ and z are the price of investment goods, the interest rate, the
depreciation rate, the corporate tax rate, the equity ratio, and the present value of depreciation
deduction on a unit of nominal investment, respectively. Data on investment goods prices,
interest rates, and corporate tax rates were taken from the JIP 2006, the Bank of Japan’s website,
and the Ministry of Finance Statistics Monthly, respectively. The depreciation rate for each sector
was taken from the JIP 2006. We calculated the cost shares of each factor by dividing the cost of
each factor by total costs, which consist of the sum of labor costs, intermediate inputs costs, and
capital costs.
