                                             ABSTRACT

Brazil, Mexico and a few other Latin American republics enjoyed faster industrialization after 1870
than did the rest of Latin America and even faster than the rest of the poor periphery (except East Asia).
How much of this economic performance was due to more accommodating institutions and greater
political stability, changes that would have facilitated greater technology transfer and accumulation?
That is, how much to changing fundamentals? How much instead to a cessation in the secular rise
in the net barter terms of trade which reversed de-industrialization forces, thus favoring manufacturing?
How much instead to cheaper foodstuffs coming from more open commercial policies ('grain invasions'),
and from railroad-induced integration of domestic grain markets, serving to keep urban grain prices
and thus nominal wages in industry low, helping to maintain competitiveness? How much instead
to more pro-industrial real exchange rate and tariff policy? Which of these forces contributed most
to industrialization among the Latin American leaders, long before their mid 20th century adoption
of ISI policies? Changing fundamentals, changing market conditions, or changing policies?

             1. On Being Misled: Prebisch, Singer and the Terms of Trade Debate

         Debate over trends in the terms of trade between primary products and manufactures,

their causes and their impact has dominated the growth and development literature for almost two

centuries. Classical economists claimed that the relative price of primary products should

improve over time, since land and other natural resources were in inelastic supply while capital

and labor were not. The experience over the half century or so before the 1870s proved them

right: the relative price of manufactures underwent a spectacular decline, while that of primary

products soared (Figure 5). In the early 1950s, however, Raúl Prebisch (1950) and Hans Singer

(1950) challenged the classical view, asserting that the terms of trade of the primary-product-

producing Third World had deteriorated since the late 19th century. Indeed, Prebisch calculated

that only 63 percent of the finished manufactures which could be bought with a given quantity of

primary products in the 1860s could be purchased in the 1930s. Prebisch and Singer also

predicted that it would continue to deteriorate across the late 20th century as long as the Third

World specialized in primary products. It turned out that their prediction was not confirmed,1 but

our interest lies instead with the years from about 1870 to World War I, an era in which W.

Arthur Lewis’ (1978) new world economic order – the rich core specializing in manufactures and

the poor periphery in primary products -- was being challenged in some parts of the periphery.

         This important part of the development literature has its shortcomings.2 While the pre-

1870s secular upswing of the terms of trade in the periphery clearly caused de-industrialization

there (Williamson 2006a, 2006b, 2008), Prebisch, Singer and their followers ignored a symmetric

corollary: on the downside following the 1870s, the secular terms of trade deterioration implied a

long run stimulus to import-competing industry in the periphery. Prebisch and Singer ignored this



1
  The relative price of primary products did not deteriorate over the late 20th century (Grilli and Yang 1988;
Blattman, Hwang and Williamson 2006), and by the end of the century most of the Third World exported
labor-intensive manufactures (Martin 2003; Williamson 2006b).

  Although now more than 15 years old, a paper by Roberto Cortés Conde (1992) is still one of the best
surveys of export-led growth and dependency paradigms as applied to Latin America for this period.

possibility,3 and stressed instead the short run economic damage to a periphery specializing in

primary products. The literature generated by Prebisch and Singer has another weakness:

typically, it deals with the relative price of primary products in world markets, not with the terms

of trade facing any given primary-product exporting country. Prebisch, Singer and the literature

that followed never assessed the economic impact on the poor periphery of the secular fall, or of a

cessation of the rise, in its terms of trade. Rather, they assumed it.

         We try to do better when assessing Latin American industrialization experience after

1870, those critical decades before the interwar economic disaster, and before the introduction of

anti-global ISI policies between the 1930s and 1970s. Furthermore, our interest is in the relative

industrial performance around Latin America. In addition, we try to assess the relative

contribution of world prices on Latin American performance compared with other domestic

forces. Section 2 establishes the timing and pace of Latin American industrialization, with

primary focus on the leaders – especially Brazil and Mexico. Industrialization was fast in some of

those places, especially when compared with the rest of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.

Section 3 lists the leading explanations, not necessarily competing, for this impressive

industrialization performance – changing world prices, changing productivity, changing policy

and changing wage competitiveness. Section 4 explores the first, a dramatic change in net barter

terms of trade (PX/PM) trends in much of Latin America, especially compared with the rest of the

periphery. We argue that if, as the conventional literature asserts, a rise in the net barter terms of

trade caused de-industrialization in the periphery prior to 1870 (through Dutch disease effects),

then its stability or fall thereafter must have helped cause what might be called re-

industrialization. Section 5 explores a part of the second explanation -- an acceleration in total

factor productivity growth in the export sector, especially mining. The latter should have raised


3
 Not entirely, since at one point in his famous 1950 paper Singer noted that if the post-1950 relative price
of primary products ever did improve, it would reduce industrialization incentives in the periphery (Singer
1950: 482, italics added). However, Singer never elaborated on this statement, either in the 1950 paper or
elsewhere. Nor did Prebisch. Nor did their followers.


                                                     4
the income terms of trade (PXX/PM), and, as Edward Beatty (2000) has argued so persuasively for

Mexico, it should have contributed to export-led industrialization. We ask whether Mexican

experience was exceptional, or whether it was repeated in other Latin American industrial

leaders. Section 6 searches for other sources of Latin America’s increasing industrial

competitiveness in their own markets – like cheaper food keeping the nominal industrial wage

low. Section 7 explores the impact of real exchange rate depreciation, a force that would have

improved local manufacturing competitiveness against foreign imports. Section 8 concludes with

an agenda and a tentative judgment about the relative importance of changes in prices, policies

and fundamentals.



                    2. Measuring the Industrial Liftoff Across Latin America

        We are not the first to argue that industrialization started long before the 1930s in Latin

America, indeed, even before World War I. Ezequiel Gallo (1970) made the case for Argentina

back when dependency theory and export-led growth were the dominant paradigms. Warren Dean

(1969) did the same for Brazil about the same time. Two decades later, Steve Haber (1989, 1990)

made the same case for Mexico. While impressive, what is missing from this pioneering literature

is an explicit comparative assessment of the timing and the pace of industrialization in Latin

America, and a comprehensive assessment of its causes. We begin to fill that gap here.

        Whether measured by employment, output or value added, textile production dominated

manufacturing in the late 19th century, so we start there. Imports satisfied a significant part of

Latin American total textile demand in the 1870s. In a previous paper (Dobado, Gomez and

Williamson 2006), we reported that Mexico imported 40 million square meters of cloth in 1879,

compared with 60 million square meters produced domestically. Thus, foreigners supplied 40%

of the domestic market. Yet, these same data imply that domestic producers were able to claim

60% of the local market, a fairly big number for a country that had been flooded with cheap,

factory-made European textiles for almost a century. Indeed, compare Mexican experience with


                                                  5
that of other parts of the periphery: The share of the domestic market supplied by India’s textiles

fell from 95% in 1833 to 35-42% in 1887,4 the latter much lower than Mexico’s 60% in 1879.

The de-industrialization forces were even more powerful in the Ottoman Empire where local

industry’s market share of domestic demand fell from 97% in the early 1820s to only 11-38% in

the early 1870s.5 Thus, despite the importance of foreign imports, the Mexican textile industry

was doing fairly well by the 1870s,6 at least compared with the rest of the periphery. While we do

not have the data to prove it, we doubt that the rest of Latin America was doing as well as Mexico

was by the 1870s, but it appears that some parts of Latin America may have started at a higher

base in 1870s than was true of the rest of the poor periphery.

        Table 1 offers more evidence of the prior de-industrialization experience, where Paul

Bairoch’s (1991) estimates of Brazilian and Mexican industrialization levels are compared with

those of Europe and Asia. Between 1800 and 1880, de-industrialization took place throughout

what we now call the Third World. While Bairoch’s estimates imply that de-industrialization

continued up to 1913 in Asia, Brazil and Mexico showed strong signs of recovery, or what we are

calling here re-industrialization. Table 2 offers 1910 industrial production per capita figures for

cotton yarn, steel, pig iron and cement, again from Bairoch (1991). While these figures confirm

that Latin America was well behind the industrial leaders in the European core and their

offshoots, only Japan out-performed Mexico in the poor periphery. The number two contender,

Brazil, exceeded Mexico in one category, cotton yarn production, but was behind in the other

three. Still, Brazil exceeded China, Egypt, the Ottoman Empire and India. There were also some

modest signs of industrial success in Chile, at least in per capita cement production. According to

Bairoch’s estimates, the rest of Latin America was far behind, still conforming to the new

international economic order by specializing in primary products. Table 3 offers another index of

  The 1833 estimate and the smaller of the two 1887 estimates are from Roy (2000: 126). The larger 1887
estimate comes from Tomlinson (1993: Table 3.3, 107).

yarn imports. Both are far lower than Mexico, however.

industrial performance at the end of the period, net exports (+) or imports (-) of cotton textile

manufactures per capita in 1910, an index that includes yarn, thread and cloth of all sorts. Mexico

had a cotton textile net import balance of close to zero, US$0.24 per capita, compared with the

net export position of the United Kingdom of US$11.25 per capita. No Latin American country

did better than Mexico, the closest competitor being Brazil (net imports of US$1.04 per capita),

and most did far worse. Indeed, Argentina (net imports of US$5.47) joined Australia (US$8.70)

in recording the highest dependence on imported cotton textile manufactures in the periphery.

        As one additional piece of evidence to identify how the Latin American industrial leaders

were doing early in the 20th century, the first panel of Table 4 reports estimates of the share of the

home textile goods market supplied by domestic industry. Two facts leap out of the table. First,

by the early 20th century, Brazil’s domestic textile industry had carved out an impressive share of

its local market, 65.3 percent, but that share was considerably smaller than that of Mexico, 77.9

percent. By this gauge alone, Mexico was more successful industrially than was Brazil.

Argentina, on the other hand, could report very little industrial success by 1913, local industry

claiming only 15.5 to 17.5 percent of the home textile market. So much for light industry. The

second panel of Table 4 reports smaller market shares for heavy industrial product groups.

Although they are harder to document, what data we do have reports significant domestic shares

on the rise for Mexico: its domestic producers’ share of the local iron and steel market rose from

6 to 28 percent between 1903 and 1911, while that for coke rose from 17 to 47 percent. The 1913

figure for metals and machinery in Argentina was only 12 percent. Second, Mexico increased

significantly its share of the home textile market between early Porfiriato and the Revolution,

from 60 to 77.9 percent between 1879 and 1906-1908, an increase of almost 20 percentage points.

Table 5 reports the share of the labor force employed in manufacturing between 1895 and 1910.

The figures for Argentina and Chile are surprisingly high, 19-25 percent, given that the rapidly

industrializing United States had ‘only’ reached 19-20 percent between 1870 and 1890. Great

Britain, however, had reached 29 percent by 1801 and 33 percent in 1910. Oddly enough, the


                                                  7
figures for Mexico (11-12 percent) seem very low, perhaps because the source excluded or

understated small scale manufacturing without mechanical power.

        These facts offer strong support for the view that the Latin American industrial leaders

did indeed experience a lift off before 1913, and certainly long before the 1930s and its early ISI

policies. There must have been rapid industrialization in Brazil and Mexico during the four

decades after 1870. The question, however, is when the lift off happened.

        Stephen Haber (2002) has argued that the true liftoff of Mexican industry came towards

the last third of the 19th century. Haber dates the beginning of the liftoff in the late 1880s. Almost

half a century after Mexico’s initial mechanization efforts, the 1888 industry was, according to

Haber, still small and unproductive (although bigger and more productive than almost anywhere

else in the poor periphery). But in the decade that followed, “the industry more than doubled in

size. By 1911, the industry had grown an additional 50 percent. Estimates of total factor

productivity (TFP) growth … indicate increases of between 1.5 percent (lower bound) and 3.3

percent (upper bound) per year. Labor productivity grew even faster … between 3.0 and 4.7

percent per year” (Haber 2002: 7-8). Such growth rates meant that Mexican textile producers had

displaced most imported cloth by 1914 (Haber 2002: 11). Tables 3 and 4 confirmed Haber’s

inference: the first showed that Mexican net imports of cotton manufactures per capita were

almost zero in 1910, and the second showed that local producers claimed more than three-

quarters of the domestic market for all textiles in 1906-08. The only foreign textiles still being

imported were high quality, fine-weave cloth. Table 4 suggests a modification to Haber’s dating

of the Mexican liftoff; the trade data suggest it got a somewhat earlier start than 1888.

        In an effort to better identify Latin American industrial leaders and the timing of their

industrialization experience in the decades before World War I, Table 6, Table 7 and Figures 1-3

report evidence based on exports to Latin America from the United States and the United

Kingdom. These were the main suppliers of industrial intermediates, energy sources and capital

goods used in Latin American industry, so we assume that manufacturing machinery, iron and


                                                  8
steel, and coal imports (in constant US dollars) are good proxies for relative industrial growth.

Tables 6-7 and Figures 1-3 allow us to compare industrialization progress 1870-1914 between

Latin American countries. Others have used similar data before (Suzigan 1986; Kuntz 2007), but

not comparatively as we do here. Recently Xavier Tafunell, Albert Carreras and César Yañez

have used data documenting capital goods exports to Latin America to assess gross capital

formation levels in twenty Latin American countries between 1890 and 1930 (Yañez, Rubio and

Carreras 2006; Tafunell 2007a; Tafunell 2007b; Tafunell and Carreras 2008). Their work has

shown that these data are reliable, and that most machinery exports to Latin America came from

just three nations: the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany (for eight Latin American

countries in 1913, 86.5% of total machinery exports to the region).

        Here we consider only the machinery and iron and steel products that were used by

manufacturing, that is, following Wilson Suzigan, we exclude all agricultural and railroad related

machinery. We aggregate imports from the United States and United Kingdom only, which

accounted for 63.3% of machinery imports by eight Latin American countries in 1913.7 Since we

wish to compare trends and not the levels of machinery imports across Latin America, we do not

think our exclusion of German and other country machinery exports to Latin America is a

problem.

        Figure 1 plots the import time series for the combination of manufacturing machinery

(hereafter machinery), iron and steel (hereafter iron) and coal from 1870 to 1914 (1900=100).

According to this proxy, all four of these Latin American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Chile,

and Mexico – exhibited impressive growth over the four decades. True, three of them underwent

high volatility: Argentina, Brazil and Chile all recorded big booms in the late 1880s-early 1890s

  Tafunell (2007). According to Carreras and Tafunell (2008), the UK+US machinery import shares in total
Latin American machinery imports were the following: Argentina 60.6%, Brazil 56.6% Chile 56.3%, and
Mexico 85.2%. However, the comparison of our Brazilian data with Suzingan’s (which includes UK, US
and Germany) indicates that 1913 was the year when our data (which includes UK and US) was the lowest
relative to Suzigan’s (57.3%). As an average over 1870-1914, our series was 99.3% of Suzigan’s and both
series have exactly the same trend.


                                                   9
and again in the run up to WWI, as well as a big bust in the 1890s. Mexico did not undergo this

volatility before 1900, but, of course, it did undergo a secular slow down up to and during the

Revolution. Figure 2 breaks out machinery imports separately, but the series shows pretty much

the same trends. Figure 3 plots the combination of machinery, iron and coal as a share of Gross

Domestic Product (in 1990 US dollars). The volatility is still there for Argentina, Brazil and

Chile, but the growth seen in Figure 1 has disappeared from the three: between 1870-1874 and

1900-1904, the share of those combined imports in GDP fell for both Argentina and Chile, and it

rose hardly at all for Brazil. In contrast, before the run up to the Revolution, Mexico’s share

increased seven times!

        Now consider Tables 6 and 7, where we report the growth rates of both proxies (in US

dollars). Table 6 documents growth rates of the combined import package: the volatility of

Argentina, Brazil and Chile is revealed once more, and so is Mexico’s dominant industrialization

(at least according to this proxy). Between 1871 and 1901, Mexico grew almost twice as fast as

the average (10.89 versus 5.68 percent per annum), and it grew faster even when the run up to

and including the Revolution is included (1871-1911, 7.44 versus 5.65 percent per annum). In

addition, the table shows that the lift off was during the first two decades, not later as Haber

suggested. That is, the average growth rate of the four was 6.97 percent per annum before 1891

and 4.37 after. Some of this slow down can, of course, be attributed to Mexico’s special political

problems, but the same slow down is apparent for Argentina and Brazil. The growth of

manufacturing machinery itself reported in Table 7 repeats the findings of Table 6: prior to 1891,

Mexican growth rates exceed the average, 10.95 versus 7.30 percent per annum, and the growth

rates before 1891 (10.42 percent) exceed those afterwards (3.75 percent).

        To summarize, we have documented the following: industrialization of the economic

leaders in Latin America was very impressive between 1870 and 1913, especially compared with

the rest of the poor periphery; Mexico underwent the most impressive industrialization

performance; and the lift off occurred well before 1890, not after.

    3. Some Leading Non-Competing Explanations for the Latin American Industrial Liftoff

           What explains the timing and the pace of the Latin American industrial lift off? It seems

to us that there are five likely candidates, candidates that we hope future research will be able to

assess more precisely than we are able to do here.

           First, it has been shown that Latin America was far more protectionist than anywhere else

in the late 19th century (Coatsworth and Williamson 2004). Figure 4 shows that Latin America

had the highest tariffs in the world from the late 1880s onwards (Argentina, Brazil, Chile,

Columbia, Peru and Mexico among the most protectionist),8 and that before the late 1880s only

the United States had higher average tariff rates. Furthermore, these average tariff rates were on

the rise between 1865 and 1890, and they were maintained at that high level until just prior to

World War I. Perhaps more to the point, Mexico adopted far more coherent and consistent pro-

industrial tariff policies under the Porfiriato regime. Latin American policy-makers in the late 19th

century Latin America were certainly aware of infant industry arguments (Bulmer-Thomas 1994:

p.140), but tariffs were not used specifically and consciously to foster industry in Mexico until

the early 1890s. Edward Beatty (2001) and Graciela Márquez (2002) have argued persuasively

that the 1880s and 1890s saw the introduction of a modern pro-industrial policy in Mexico,

including a rational structure of protection. This policy was followed with a lag elsewhere in

Latin America, Brazil and Chile a little later in the 1890s, and Colombia in the early 1900s

(Coatsworth and Williamson 2004a; 2004b). Haber agrees with Márquez and Beatty: “In 1891

Mexico was using tariffs to protect the cotton textile industry” which perhaps would have

otherwise been uncompetitive. “This meant high tariffs on competing goods and low tariffs on

inputs. The tariff on imported cloth tended to be twice that of the tariff on imported raw cotton.

The result was an effective rate of protection that varied from 39 to 78 percent” (Haber 2002:




8
    The tariff rates would, of course, be even higher if we looked only at manufacturers.


                                                       11
16).9 This explanation is especially appealing since we want to account for the fast Mexican

industrial liftoff compared with the rest of the periphery. Most of Asia and the Middle East did

not have the autonomy to pursue pro-industrial policies, and we also know that pro-industrial

Mexican policy led the rest of the autonomous Latin American republics by a decade or two.

        We do not deny that the more rational protectionist policy increased its support for local

industry. However, this paper will explore the additional impact of four other influences. The first

is world prices and the net barter terms of trade. We will show below that there was a big secular

change in world relative prices facing the Mexican economy after the 1870s, a change that no

longer penalized local manufacturing, and textiles in particular. Elsewhere, we have shown that a

good part of the exceptionally modest Mexican de-industrialization experience in the century

before 1870 was due to an exceptionally modest terms of trade shock compared to the rest of

Latin America, Asia and the Middle East (Williamson 2006a, 2006b; Dobado, Gómez and

Williamson 2006). We think the same was true of the half century after 1870, but in the opposite

direction: as we show below, Latin America’s terms of trade fell earlier and faster than anywhere

else in the periphery, especially for Mexico. Second, there was also an acceleration in total factor

productivity growth in one key export activity in Latin America, mining. This served to

contribute to the fall in the net barter terms of trade, but, given a price elastic demand facing

silver, copper and other metals, it also served to raise the income terms of trade. It appears that

these productivity events were unusual for the poor periphery at that time, including much of

Latin America itself. Third, there is some evidence supporting the view that, compared with the

rest of the periphery, Latin American industry may have been kept more competitive since it

faced weaker upward pressure on the nominal wage, forces induced by weaker upward pressure

on food prices. The latter can be explained by policy towards food imports and domestic market

integration by the railroads. Finally, there is the impact of the depreciation of local currencies to


9
 By 1960, Mexico had much lower tariffs on capital goods and industrial raw materials than did Argentina
or Brazil (Taylor 1998; Haber 2006: Table 13.8, p. 574).


                                                   12
consider. As we shall see, the biggest real exchange rate depreciation between 1870 and 1913

took place in Brazil and Mexico, especially the latter, forces which must have contributed to their

impressive industrialization performance.


                                  4. No More Dutch Disease?
              The Big Change in Latin American Net Barter Terms of Trade Trends

           Did Latin America face a big secular change in world relative price trends, a change that

no longer penalized local manufacturing, and textiles in particular? If so, was the secular change

bigger than elsewhere in the poor periphery, especially among the Latin American industrial

leaders?

           Figure 5 suggests the answer is most definitely yes. There we see that after the net barter

terms of trade for Latin America reached a secular peak in the mid-late 1870s, it leveled off up to

the early-mid 1890s, after which it also fell far more dramatically up to the early 1900s than

elsewhere in the periphery. It never recovered even a third of the previous peaks by 1913.

Between 1870-74 and 1909-13, the terms of trade in Latin America fell by 10% (Table 8), this

after rising by 174% over the seven decades between 1800-04 and 1870-74 (Williamson 2008)!

In contrast, the rest of the periphery underwent no net fall over the four decades: the Middle East

and Southeast Asia underwent a continuous terms of trade improvement from the mid-1870s

onwards, while South Asia and East Asia underwent no change either way. Figure 6 shows which

parts of Latin America underwent the biggest changes in terms of trade trend. In contrast with

Argentina and Chile, Mexico underwent a big fall in its terms of trade after the early-mid 1890s:

the Mexican terms of trade was cut in half between 1890 and 1902,10 twice as big as the rest of

Latin America (see also Salvucci 2006: Table 7.6, p. 283). Furthermore, while the primary

product boom in the decade or so before 1913 is reflected in a rise in terms of trade everywhere in

the poor periphery, the rise was very modest in Mexico, and that rise did not come close to


10
   The real exchange rate also depreciated by about 50% just between 1885 and 1892 (Catão 1998: 74), and
it never recovered. We return to this in Section 7 below.


                                                   13
recovering the secular peak in the late 1870s and early 1880s. Indeed, the Mexican terms of trade

fell by 37.2% between 1870-74 and 1910-13 (Table 8), while it rose by 11% in the rest of Latin

America.11 While Mexico was exceptional compared with the Latin American average, there are

other deviants also plotted with thick solid lines in Figure 6 and reported in Table 8, namely,

Cuba (-21.7%) and Peru (-27.5%). Brazil and Venezuela underwent hardly any change at all in

their terms of trade over the four decades, but even this stability represented a marked change in

world economic conditions after 70 years of rising terms of trade and thus falling relative prices

of manufactures. Brazil and Venezuela also underwent a huge fall in their terms of trade between

the early 1890s and World War I. So did Columbia, but in that case the run up to the 1890s offset

the post-1890s collapse.

        In summary, a fall (or no rise) in the net barter terms of trade implied a rise (or no fall) in

the relative price of imported manufactures, an event which favored (or no longer penalized)

domestic industry. If a rising terms of trade caused de-industrialization in the six or seven decades

before the 1870s (Dobado, Gómez and Williamson 2006; Williamson 2008), it follows that a

falling or stable terms of trade after 1870 should have helped cause a good share of Mexican,

Brazilian and even Venezuelan industrialization experience up to 1913.



        5. Productivity Growth, the Income Terms of Trade, and Export-Led Growth
                                      in Latin America

        So far, we have assumed that the Latin American republics had no influence over their

export or import prices, and thus that their terms of trade was determined exogenously in world

markets. While this was certainly true of those countries in Table 8 whose commodity exports

were only a small share of world exports of that commodity – like Argentina (maize, wheat),

Columbia (coffee, gold), Cuba (sugar, tobacco), Peru (copper), Uruguay (wool, meat), and

Venezuela (coffee, cacao), it certainly was not true of the others in Table 8 – Chile (nitrates,

11
  This is based on a 1870 population weighted average of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Peru
and Uruguay, all reported in Table 5.


                                                  14
copper), Mexico (silver), and Brazil (coffee, rubber). Indeed, Edward Beatty (2000) has argued

persuasively that Mexican mineral supplies to the world market, especially silver, did indeed help

precipitate the big decline in its net barter terms of trade: by flooding the market with silver,

Mexico lowered the world price of silver and worsened its terms of trade. Beatty also argues that

it was rapid productivity advance in Mexican mining that produced that result, but since the

demand for minerals was price elastic, total export values and foreign exchange earnings boomed,

creating export-led growth.


        Figure 7 describes the two hypotheses. In case 7B, the country takes its export prices as

exogenous: export prices fall in world markets (from P to P’), but domestic supply expands

sufficiently fast (S to S’) to offset the price decline, augmenting total export revenue. One can

imagine an even greater domestic supply shift (to S”) which would have produced more exports

and more foreign exchange earnings. Clearly, whatever economic success one observed in this

case would be attributed unambiguously to the domestic export supply growth, rather than to

changing conditions in world markets. In any case, the fall in its net barter terms of trade (PX/PM)

could not have been a powerful industrialization stimulus in this case since the improved relative

price of industrial output must have been at least partially offset by the improved productivity in

the commodity export sector that pushed S to S’ or S’’.12 This case seems to apply to Cuba, Peru

and Venezuela, countries in Table 8 which experienced a decline in their net barter terms of trade

and only a very modest improvement in their income terms of trade. Now consider the case in 7B

where export prices rise (from P to P”), a case which appears to apply to Argentina and

Colombia, both of which underwent a big increase in their net barter and their income terms of

trade. No stimulus to industrialization in this case either, but rather de-industrial penalties.

Although we do not have income terms of trade estimates for Uruguay, we suspect the same

would apply to it as well.

12
 Unless, of course, productivity growth was faster in manufacturing where prices were fixed by world
market conditions.


                                                  15
        Now consider Beatty’s hypothesis in Case 7A. Here, the same export supply expansion

(S to S’) lowers the country’s export price since it’s a big player in world markets. But given a

price elastic demand, and given an additional outward shift in demand (D to D’), export revenues

and foreign exchange earnings expand: the bigger the outward supply shift (and productivity

advance in the export sector), the bigger the fall in the net barter terms of trade and the rise in the

income terms of trade. Mexico appears to be the exception which proves Beatty’s rule: a very big

decline in the net barter terms of trade (after a long secular boom) was consistent with a very big

increase in the income terms of trade. If Beatty’s evidence of rapid productivity growth in

Mexican mining holds up, we have an explanation for Mexico’s income terms of trade rising and

its net barter terms of trade falling. While Table 9 confirms this prediction (a result Beatty found

with other data), Beatty’s supply side argument cannot apply to mineral-producing Chile, since its

net barter terms of trade did not fall, but rather rose. Table 9 also suggests that the hypothesis gets

ambiguous support at best for Brazil: in this case, the net barter terms of trade was stable after the

long and spectacular pre-1870 boom while the income terms of trade underwent only a modest

increase.


                            6. Keeping the Lid on Wages?
            The Own Wage and Industrial Competitiveness in the Latin American

        Table 5 documents that the share of the 1895 labor force in manufacturing ranged from a

quarter in Argentina and Chile to an eighth in Mexico. These employment shares imply that real

wages – nominal wages divided by the cost of living (w/Pc) -- were determined by labor

productivity elsewhere in the economy – mining, construction, agriculture and services – not in

manufacturing itself. Slow-growing labor productivity in the rest of the economy would have

given Latin American manufacturing the advantage of modest upward pressure on per unit wage

costs, making it more competitive with North America and western Europe, where the upwards

pressures were much stronger. It was, of course, the own-wage that mattered to employers in

manufacturing, the nominal wage divided by the price of manufactures (w/Pm). If the price of


                                                  16
foodstuffs (Pa) was the central determinant of the cost of living in Latin America, and if Pa/Pm

was falling, we would have another reason to expect local manufactures in Latin America to have

undergone increasing wage competitiveness compared with foreign firms. Is there any reason to

think that Pa/Pm should have fallen? Yes, and for two reasons: first, to the extent that the post-

1870s grain invasion flooded Latin American markets in grain importing regions; and second, to

the extent that railroads brought cheaper grain in to urban interior markets where manufacturing

was located (Dobado and Marrero 2005). The issue is how much?

        Table 10 reports Pa/Pm for three countries which offer the necessary times series data --

Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay. Mexico recorded the biggest Pa/Pm decline from 1874-1878 to

1913, 34 percent; Brazil the second, 21 percent; and Uruguay the third, 11 percent. Thus, the

grain-invasion-cum-railroads prediction is confirmed, and, furthermore, the two fastest

industrializing countries recorded the biggest fall in Pa/Pm.

        But did cheaper grains necessarily mean lower nominal wages and thus greater wage

competitiveness of local manufacturing? Table 11 reports the own-wage facing manufacturing

firms (w/Pm) for four countries which offer the necessary time series data -- Brazil, Chile,

Mexico and Uruguay. Based on this evidence, it appears that Brazil and Uruguay had the

industrial advantage on this score since the upward pressure on the own-wage in manufacturing

was much greater in Chile and Mexico. Indeed, over the period 1870-1913 as a whole, the own-

wage in Brazil grew no faster than it did in the United States, the former remaining competitive

with the latter on that score at least. By the same criteria, wage competitiveness in Chile

deteriorated relative to the United States, as did that of Mexico (but not as much as Chile). Of

course, there were other forces determining competitiveness, but if we are looking for

explanations for precocious industrialization in Brazil and Mexico, better wage competitiveness

was not one of them, although the former did better on this score than did the latter.

          7. Did Real Currency Depreciation Increase Manufacturing Profitability?

        Depreciation of the domestic currency favors local manufacturing since it makes

imported manufactures more expensive in the local market. Currency appreciation does the

opposite. When trading partners have different rates of inflation, the nominal exchange rate must

be adjusted to take account of the differential inflation rates, yielding a real exchange rate. The

real exchange rate (RER) is yet another force which could have helped account for the timing and

pace of industrialization in Latin America before 1913.

        Figure 8 plots the RER for four Latin American republics – Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and

Mexico. The figure makes it quite clear that manufacturing in Chile must have been greatly

disadvantaged by real exchange rate trends, since it underwent significant real currency

appreciation. Although its RER trends are not plotted in Figure 8, this was even truer of Colombia

which underwent a 20 percent real currency appreciation 1881-1899 (Meisel and López 1990), an

even more spectacular appreciation during the inflation 1899-1905, and then stability 1905-1913

(GRECO 2002). The appreciation of the RER must have slowed down the first symptoms of

modern industrial development in Colombia during the late 19th century, delaying that process

until the beginning of the 20th century (Ocampo 1984, 192). Argentina underwent no secular

change in its real exchange rate between 1884 and 1913, so it could not have offered any stimulus

to import-competing manufacturing there. However, the real exchange rate did undergo secular

depreciation in Brazil and Mexico, and the magnitudes appear to have been big: Mexico

underwent a real currency depreciation of 82 percent between the mid 1870s and 1913 and Brazil

underwent a real currency depreciation of 36 percent between the early 1870s and 1913.

        In short, some part of the industrial lift off in Brazil and Mexico can indeed be explained

by a real exchange rate depreciation up to 1913. This was not true of Argentina, Chile or

Colombia.

     8. A Future Research Agenda: Decomposing the Sources of the Industrial Lift Off

        This paper does not offer any explicit empirical decomposition of the sources of the

industrial liftoff in Latin America between 1870 and World War I, although we certainly hope

that future research will do so. At this point, we do not believe that the evidence is sufficient for

that demanding task. Thus, we have been content to lay out the contending explanations, to offer

what we hope is some plausible support for them, and to set out an agenda. Still, when future

research offers an explicit empirical decomposition of the industrial lift off, this paper will have

shown how those decompositions are likely to have differed across countries, and which are

likely to have been the major actors.

        Our prior is that changing fundamentals will end up playing a much more modest role in

contributing to the industrial lift off than the current neo-institutional literature supposes. We

stress the word changing, since it had to have been changing fundamentals raising productivity in

manufacturing, or changing external terms of trade or domestic wage competitiveness improving

profitability in manufacturing, or changing tariff and real exchange rates improving profitability

in manufacturing that accounted for the lift off, not levels of any of the three.

        Changing external terms of trade must have played a big role, as the immense pre-1870

boom in the external terms of trade – a pre-1870 fall in the relative price of imported

manufactures, switched to a post-1870 bust in the external terms of trade – a post-1870 rise in the

relative price of imported manufactures. What had been a sickly Dutch disease before 1870

became a healthy Dutch revival after 1870. Furthermore, Mexico underwent the biggest reversal

in its secular terms of trade trends, followed by Brazil and Venezuela. Thus, industrialization was

favored in these three republics compared to the rest of Latin America. These forces were strong

and it is time for the literature to pay more attention to them.

        Changing tariff and real exchange rate policy also must have played a big role. Tariff

rates on manufactures rose in Latin America over these four decades, and the effective rate of

protection rose even more as the tariff structure was rationalized. Since Mexico led the way, it


                                                  19
had the first strike advantage of effective pro-industrial policy, and this long before the early-ISI

protectionist policies of the 1930s. In addition, the real exchange rate depreciated for both Brazil

and Mexico, offering more benefits to import-competing industry. Since the other major Latin

American republics did not undergo the same real currency depreciation, the two leaders enjoyed

a first strike pro-industrial advantage – this long before the well-known real currency

depreciations of the 1930s.

        We doubt that improved wage competitiveness played a role, since the effects, though

positive, were too small to matter much.

        It is important to get more precise answers to the sources-of-the–lift-off question. We

have been able to document impressive industrialization rates among the Latin America leaders –

Brazil and Mexico – between 1870 and 1913. We will understand much better the impact of Latin

American ISI policies between the 1930s and 1970s, let alone the free trade policies that followed

in the late 20th century, when they are linked more closely to the industrialization lift off before

1913, and the policies and prices that produced it.

Sources: The NBTT data is taken from the sources underlying Figure 3, and Latin America is a
1870 population weighted average. The export (X) volume data are taken from Maddison
(1989: p. 140) and (1995: p. 236). The INCTT = (NBTT)(X) or XPx/Pm, where Px is the export
price and Pm the import price. The table uses the first equation.
