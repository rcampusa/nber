The Smuggling of Art, and the Art of Smuggling: Uncovering the Illicit Trade in Cultural
Property and Antiques

                                              ABSTRACT

We empirically analyze the illicit trade in cultural property and antiques, taking advantage of different
reporting incentives between source and destination countries. We thus generate a measure of illicit
trafficking in these goods based on the difference between imports recorded in United States' customs
data and the (purportedly identical) trade as recorded by customs authorities in exporting countries.
We find that this reporting gap is highly correlated with the corruption level of the exporting country
as measured by commonly used survey-based indicies, and that this correlation is stronger for artifact-rich
countries. As a placebo test, we do not observe any such pattern for U.S. imports of toys from these
same exporters. We report similar results for four other Western country markets. Our analysis provides
a useful framework for studying trade in illicit goods. Further, our results provide empirical confirmation
that survey-based corruption indicies are informative, as they are correlated with an objective measure
of illicit activity.

1. Introduction


The smuggling of antiques and cultural property is thought to be big business. All countries
impose restrictions on the export of various classes of cultural property and antiques,1 ranging
from archeological objects to coins to older art works.2 Hence their sale abroad often requires their
illegal export from the country of origin. As with other activities of questionable legality, however,
it has been difficult to put a precise figure on the full extent of trafficking in cultural goods. For
trade in antiquities (unearthed ancient objects), which makes up only one component of the total
illegal trade in cultural objects, estimates ranging from $300 million up to $6 billion per year
(Atwood, 2004). According to Interpol’s estimates, the antiquities trade on its own ranks behind
only drugs and arms in its scale of illegal trafficking (Toner, 1999). Collectively, these illicit
activities represent the darker side of globalization – smuggling requires extra-legal activities that
may abet corruption, impose a strain on international relations, and potentially dampen the gains
from legitimate international trade.3 Thus, illicit trade is an important element of political economy
and international trade. Unfortunately, we have little systematic knowledge of the dynamics of
illicit trade, as data on illegal activities are by their very nature difficult to obtain.
         In this paper, we analyze the illicit trade in cultural objects by taking advantage of a unique
aspect of their trade relative to other forms of smuggling: The stark difference in the legality and
legal enforcement of a particular shipment between exporting and importing countries. In
particular, the exportation of broad classes of cultural objects is prohibited by most countries
without a special permit. However, once these (illegally) exported goods have left the country of
origin, they are not generally regarded as contraband when imported into their destination, absent
additional agreements that we discuss below (Gerstenblith, 2008). In the United States specifically,
there is actually a strong incentive to report accurately on the importation of cultural objects: Any
goods entering the United States that are not properly declared are subject to customs seizure;
further, the zero tariff rate on antiques and cultural objects entering the country removes any
incentive to misdeclare valuation (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2006). Even in cases
1
  Henceforth referred to simply as cultural objects or antiques. Throughout this paper we will be considering those
products that, by international trade classification, belong to Harmonized System (HS) Product Code 9706 – Antiques
of an age exceeding one hundred years.
2
  The specific classes of objects that are restricted from export as well as the rules for gaining permission to export
restricted objects differ across countries. The rules defy simple categorization or measurement of restrictiveness. See
Prott and O’Keefe (1988) for the most recent comprehensive description of these laws worldwide.

  See Andreas (1998) for an overview of these issues.

where importation is of questionable legality, differences in the burden of proof between exporting
countries and the U.S. generally allow for the relatively easy import of goods whose export would
not have been permitted by the source country.
          As a result of these asymmetric reporting incentives, reported imports of cultural objects
into the United States provide a plausible measure of the ‘true’ level of trade in these goods that
we may compare with the export levels reported by cultural object-rich countries. The difference
between these two trade figures provides a credible measure of illegal exports.
          What allows for the illicit export of cultural objects from the source country? Not
surprisingly, when smugglers are apprehended and their operations exposed, their activities are
often found to be facilitated through the bribing of customs officials to look the other way (Brody
et al, 2000). Hence, the illegal and unreported export of cultural objects is relatively easy in
countries with corrupt bureaucracies that allow for this type of transaction. Hence, if cross-country
survey-based measures of corruption do indeed reflect underlying corruption realities, these
measures should be good predictors of patterns of global trafficking in cultural objects. In this
sense, we may use our measure that is derived from objectively measured trade data to assess the
validity of these corruption indices that are often based on subjective perceptions.
          In this paper, we present an objective measure of smuggling in cultural objects based on
this reporting gap between recorded exports on an exporter’s side and the recorded imports by U.S.
Customs. Without smuggling (and measurement error), the reporting gap should be zero. If the gap
were pure measurement error, it should not be correlated with country-level attributes. However,
we find that our smuggling measure is very highly correlated (with correlation coefficient =0.52)
with standard cross-country survey-based corruption indices, thus providing compelling and
objective validation of these indices. This pattern is robust to the inclusion of region effects and
controls for countries’ endowment of desirable/collectible cultural objects. Interestingly, our
smuggling variable is uncorrelated with the log of income per capita once the exporter’s corruption
level is controlled for, so it is unlikely that we are simply picking up the effects of country-level
wealth.
          Several additional tests lend further support to our interpretation of the results. First, the
corruption-smuggling gap relationship is stronger for object-rich countries. Second, we run a
placebo regression using data on the reporting gap in the U.S imports of toys between the
exporter’s and US customs (U.S. reported imports of toys from a country, minus that country’s
                                                         4

reported exports of toys to the U.S. in the same year). Similar to imports of cultural objects into the
United States, toy imports also have a zero tariff rate on the U.S. side. In this case, we observe no
correlation between an exporter’s corruption level and the customs reporting gap, suggesting that
cultural objects do indeed present a special case. Finally, we report results for four other countries
– Canada, Germany, Great Britain, and Switzerland – all with zero tariffs on cultural objects that
are also reported to have a significant trade in these goods; we find a positive relationship between
corruption and the ‘smuggling gap’ for all four countries.
        Our paper thus makes two primary contributions: Most importantly, we provide a first
empirical analysis of the trade in restricted goods, and further provide comparable cross-country
estimates on the smuggling of contraband. 4 We thus contribute to the growing literature on
measuring underground activities using differential reporting incentives (see, for example, Fisman
and Wei, 2004; Yang, 2007; Mishra et al, 2007). However, we highlight two key departures from
the prior literature: First, earlier studies have largely focused on a single exporting country;
second, previous research has focused on tariff evasion rather than the trafficking of illegal objects.
By contrast, cultural objects imports face no tariffs in the U.S. and other major markets (hence
tariff evasion is not the motivation) but are often subject to export controls in the country of origin.
Second, we provide a clear validation of subjective corruption indices based on objective trade
data.
        The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short background on
laws governing the trade in antiques and cultural goods. Section 3 provides a description of the
data, and Section 4 presents our results. Section 5 concludes.


2. Legal background on international trade in cultural property and antiques5


Goods that have been illegally exported from one country are not generally regarded as contraband
when imported into the United States, absent some further agreement.6 In the case of cultural

  Another related paper is Fisman and Miguel (2006), who using parking violations of U.N. diplomats in New York as
a cross-country measure of corruption norms. Relative to that study, our method has the advantage of focusing on
customs, a much larger (and often notoriously corrupt) branch of the civil service in many countries.

  In fact, the Department of Homeland Securities guidance to importers makes this point explicitly. See

objects there are some limited, albeit important, statutes that do provide some constraints on the
importation of some classes of goods. However, as we discuss below, these constraints are
generally quite limited.
         Trade in cultural property is covered in the United States by the Convention on Cultural
Property Implementation Act (CPIA). In the CPIA, cultural property is defined as objects,
collections, specimens, structures, or sites identified as having artistic, historic, scientific,
religious, or social significance.7 The CPIA is the result of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the
Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of
Cultural Property, an international agreement intended to control trade in cultural property. This
agreement required that signatories take steps to make illegal the importation and/or sale of
cultural objects that were removed illegally from any country that was party to the Convention. It
was ratified by the United States in 1972, but required further action by the Congress before its
statutes became law. This was done in a very limited form through the CPIA, resulted in the
implementation of just two sections of the UNESCO convention.
         First, the CPIA prohibits the import into the United States of stolen objects that had been
documented in the inventory of a public or secular institution in countries that are signatories to the
Convention. Second, the CPIA grants the President the authority to impose further import
restrictions on specific types of objects through bilateral agreements with other countries. The
other nation must request such an agreement. The United States has signed twelve agreements, and
in eight cases there is variation during 1996-2005.8 However, the existing agreements have mostly
addressed trade only for a narrow range of objects (e.g., Pre-Columbian artifacts from the Petén in
Guatemala and Pre-Classical and Classical archaeological objects in Cyprus). Further, the CPIA
provides only for civil forfeiture of the products in questions and has no criminal penalties. Thus,
overall, the CPIA has very limited coverage and weak punishment.
         The U.S. National Stolen Property Act (NSPA) criminalizes the knowing transport, receipt,
and possession of stolen property worth more than 5,000 dollars across international (or state)

  We did examine whether the gap between reported exports and imports of antiques and cultural property was affected
by the signing of these agreements. Our specifications generally produced coefficients that were consistent with a
decreased gap in response to a treaty. However, the results were generally not significant and very sensitive to
specification and classification of initial year of treaty and emergency agreements. This is not surprising given the very
narrow focus on archaeological objects, the small sample size and the noise in the data. Given the difficulties in
interpreting these results, we do not focus on them in this paper.

boundaries. The NSPA provides harsher penalties than the CPIA. An individual who knowingly
engages in this conduct can be criminally prosecuted. This effectively allows for the prosecution
for trafficking in objects that can be proven to have come from known collections in a foreign
country. More substantially, the NSPA has been applied in recent years in prosecuting antiquities
smugglers. This derives from laws enacted in most countries with antiquities endowments that
assign ownership of unearthed antiquities to the government. These ownership laws apply to any
objects discovered or excavated after the effective date of the statute. If an object is excavated (or
looted) after this date and removed from the country without permission, then the object is
considered stolen from the government and retains its status as stolen even after it is brought to the
United States. However, we expect this to have a very limited impact on our measure of
smuggling, since antiquities represent only a fraction of the overall of trade in cultural objects.9
Further, it has been difficult in practice for cases to be brought to court under the NSPA: Many
antiquities in the United States were excavated illegally and without the knowledge of the
exporting country’s authorities, and thus lack sufficient documentation to make a case of guilt, and
because the burden of proving that an object has an illegal background falls on the exporting
country’s government or claimant, the proof may be inadequate in a U.S. court to establish that an
undocumented antiquity is an illegally excavated or traded one. If imported cultural objects do not
show up in a U.S. museum (as most do not), the exporter’s government may not be aware of such
trade.
         On the other hand, there exists some positive incentive to report truthfully upon entry into
the United States, as improper declaration of the goods upon entry (e.g. lying about the value or
the country of origin) may result in forfeiture. Combined with the zero tariff rate on imports of
cultural objects, there is incentive to report honestly the import of cultural objects.
         By contrast, laws on the books in ‘object-rich’ countries generally shift the burden of proof
to the would-be exporter – many nations follow a licensing scheme where permission is required
for export, and others apply their national ownership laws proactively where documentation is
required for export. However, as noted in the introduction, corruption is thought to be rife in many
such countries, and hence exported objects may circumvent legal channels.

 Personal communication with Professor Patty Gerstenblith. Since trade statistics do not disaggregate antiques into its
constituent parts, it is difficult to know the proportion of cultural property and antiques that are antiquities.

        In summary, there is a stark asymmetry in the reporting imperatives between exporting
nations and the United States. In exporting nations, traders may either not declare cultural objects
to their customs at all or obscure an object’s true value (e.g., label it as a cheap tourist souvenir).
On the importing side, the incentives to provide misleading information are limited, and given the
potential for seizure by the U.S. government for false declaration, there exist some strong
incentives for truthful revelation.


3. Data


Our import and export data come from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database,
which in turn gets its trade statistics from the United Nations' Comtrade database. These data are
collected by the United Nations Statistical Division from individual countries' trade records, and
include information on imports and exports for each country, recorded according to the 6-digit
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS). We use data for all years for which
data are available on imports and exports which results in an unbalanced panel for 1996-2005. We
will also report results below from the balanced panel.
        Most export-restricted objects are classified as having HS code 9706 (antiques of an age
exceeding one hundred years).10 Some products in this category are not subject to export controls,
and some products that are subject to restrictions take other classifications. We will also report
results based on an aggregation to the two-digit HS code level (97 – Works of art. Collectors’
pieces, antiques). This is more comprehensive but also potentially incorporates greater noise due to
the inclusion of non-controlled objects. All products in HS code 97 enter the United States tariff
free.
        Our primary outcome variable is given by:


     (1) Antiques_Gapcy = log(1 + US_Importscy) – log(1 + Exports_to_UScy)

where c indexes country, y indexes year, US_Importscy is the imports reported by the United States
from country c, and Exports_to_UScy is the exports reported by country c destined for the United
States. The industry subscript is suppressed, and is HS Code 9706 unless otherwise noted.
        Our primary measure of corruption (Corruptioncy) is from the World Bank Institute
(Kaufman et al, 2006), which generates a composite corruption rating that is essentially the first
principal component of all other available (mostly subjective) corruption indices of country c in
year y. To avoid confusion, we use the negative of the values presented in Kaufman et al so that
values of Corruptioncy are increasing in the level of corruption. This variable is available for 1996,
1998, 2000, 2002-2005. Since virtually all variation is cross-sectional, we use the lagged value of
Corruptioncy for 1997, 1999, and 2001.
        It may be useful to account for countries’ endowment of cultural objects, especially those
considered desirable in the major buyer’s markets. Our proxy for this is premised on the
assumption that a country’s endowment of such objects is highly correlated with (or proportional
to) the holdings of that country’s cultural objects by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) in
New York City. The Met’s collection affords a number of advantages in generating a measure for
the potential supply of desirable cultural objects. First, most of its holdings were acquired prior to
the advent of international agreements to control the global flow of cultural property. Second, its
collection is vast, and its mission provides a very general mandate to “collect, preserve, study,
exhibit, and stimulate appreciation for and advance knowledge of works of art that collectively
represent the broadest spectrum of human achievement.” Hence, its collections are not focused on
any particular country or region. An inventory of the Met’s full collection has not yet been put in
digital form. We utilize the listing of the museum’s highlights available on the Met’s webpage,
restricting our attention to pre-19th century non-U.S. collections that would be affected by export
restrictions in the source countries.11
        We generate a simple count variable (MetHoldingsc) based on 493 (pre-19th century)
objects listed, reflecting the number of objects in the highlights collection from each country c. In
almost all cases a single country is listed as the object’s origin. Where multiple countries are listed,
we assign partial points equally to all countries. Finally, for 23 objects, ancient regions are listed;


11
  http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection.asp?HomePageLink=permanentcollection_l (downloaded on
April 19, 2007). The specific categories that we use are Ancient Near Eastern; Arts of Africa, Oceania & the
Americas; Greek & Roman Art; Asian Art; Egyptian Art; Islamic Art; European Paintings; pre-19th century European
Sculptures.
                                                    9

we assign partial points equally to all countries that overlap geographically with the ancient region.
For example, for the three objects from the Levant, we assign 0.2 points each to Israel, Syria,
Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan. Given the high dispersion in MetHoldingsc, we will employ an
indicator variable, MetDummyc that denotes whether MetHoldingsc is positive, and also log(1 +
MetHoldingsc) in our analyses.
       We use GDP per capita in 2000 U.S. dollars (GDPPCUScy), taken from the World
Development Indicators database, as a control for the overall level of economic development. As
an additional control we use the distance between two countries weighted by the location of their
populations (Distancec), from Mayer and Zignago (2005), which may be reflective of transport
costs. Finally, we will allow for region-year fixed effects, where the regions are North America
and the Caribbean; Latin America; Europe; Africa; Asia; Oceania; and the Middle East.
       We restrict our attention for the sample with data available on GDPPCUS cy, Corruption cy,
and Antiques_Gapcy, yielding a final unbalanced sample of 1193 country-year observations for HS
Code 9706 covering 162 countries (the sample will differ slightly when we broaden our sample to
include all trade data for HS Code 97). We present summary statistics in Table 1 for the full
sample, and also the sample split based on countries’ median values of Antiques_Gapcy. Strikingly,
the difference in Corruptioncy between the two groups is 1.14, which is a very large number given
Corruptioncy’s standard deviation of 1.07. However, this may be somewhat confounded by the
correlation with income that is also evident in Table 1. There is also a significant difference in
log(1+MetHoldingsc) and also MetDummyc for the two groups. Finally, we note that there are
many more observations per country for the high Antiques_Gapcy subgroup – this is unsurprising,
as these are countries for which there is a steadier trade in this HS code.


4. Results


We present the raw relationship between Corruptionc and Antiques_Gapcy for the year 2000 in
Figure 1. There is a clear positive relationship (with a correlation coefficient ρ = 0.52) – more
corrupt countries are more likely to under-report in their customs data some of the exports to the
United States relative to the U.S. customs import data. It is interesting to note that many countries
that are well-endowed in ancient objects – Egypt, Syria, Iran, Greece – are well above the
regression line. The reason for this is intuitive – as noted in Section 2, illegal exports constitute
                                                   10

only a component of HS 9706, and it is plausible that this component is higher for such countries.
In fact, for MetDummyc=0 countries, the average value of Antiques_Gapcy is 2.90; for
MetDummyc=1 countries, the average value of Antiques_Gapcy is 4.98. This suggests the
importance of controlling for a country’s stock of desirable objects, which we do now in a
regression framework.
       Our baseline specification is as follows:


   (2) Antiques_Gapcy = α + β1*Corruptioncy + β2*MetDummycy
                                + Controlscy + Region-Year Fixed Effects + εcy


While we present results using country-year observations, almost all variation is cross-sectional, so
we allow for clustering at the country level, and also present results using a cross-section with
country-level median values.
       We present our main results in Table 2. In column (1) we include only year effects as
controls. As suggested by the pattern in Figure 1, the correlation is highly significant and positive
– the reporting gap in cultural objects is wider for more corrupt countries. In column (2) we
present the results with log of exporter’s income level, log(GDPPCUScy), and year effects only.
There is a negative and significant relationship between the reporting gap and exporter’s income
level, though it is somewhat weaker than that for corruption in column (1). When we include both
income and corruption measures in column (3), however, we find that the point estimate on
Corruptioncy actually increases, while income loses its significance entirely. That is, income
matters only insofar as it is correlated with corruption. Adding Region*Year effects in column (4)
yields very similar results. The magnitude, in the range of 1.5, implies that the rate of smuggling of
cultural objects for relatively high corruption countries such as Mexico or Egypt (Corruptioncy of
about 0.4 in 2005) is more than double that of more moderately corrupt countries such as Italy and
Greece (Corruptioncy of about -0.4 in 2005). This is in part due to some outlying values of
Antiques_Gapcy; however, even when we omit the top and bottom five percent of observations on
Antiques_Gapcy, the significance of the Corruptioncy is largely unchanged and its value is still
above 1.2. We also experimented with specifications that included a variety controls such as
geographic distance, English as primary language, and legal origin; none of these substantively
affected our results and we suppress them to save space.
                                                          11

        Some of the outlying observations in Figure 1 also suggest the importance of controlling
for countries’ stocks of desirable cultural property – for countries with many desirable objects that
are export restricted, we expect a larger rate of under-reporting for HS 9706 goods. In column (5)
we include MetDummyc and find that it is highly significant and quantitatively large, implying that
Antiques_Gapcy is more than double for countries with objects in the Met’s collection highlights;
the inclusion of MetDummyc has very little effect on the coefficient on Corruptioncy. We also
expect that the marginal impact of corruption to be greater for countries with larger stocks of
cultural objects: In the absence of such objects, the reporting gap should be largely noise, and
hence uncorrelated with corruption; we expect a larger effect of corruption as the potential for
smuggling increases. We report these results in column (6) and find that the interaction term is
highly significant with a magnitude of about 0.5.12 In columns (7) and (8) we repeat our analyses
using log(1+MetHoldingsc) in place of MetDummyc; the implied magnitudes are very similar for
both measures.
        We present results for four additional countries that are potential destination markets for
cultural objects. Three of these – Switzerland, Great Britain, and Germany – are noteworthy in that
none ratified the 1970 UNESCO Convention until very recently (Germany is still not a signatory to
the Convention). By contrast, our fourth country – Canada – ratified the UNESCO Convention and
passed the Cultural Property Export and Import Act in 1978 that provides stringent controls on
importing cultural objects that were illegally exported. However, by many accounts enforcement
has been spotty, and only five cases of illegal imports have been resolved since 1992 (Department
of Canadian Heritage, 2003, 2005). We present results using our preferred specification that
includes Region*Year dummies in Table 3. In all cases, the coefficient on Corruptioncy is
significant at the one percent level. In all cases, the coefficient is in the range of 0.5 – 1.13 This is
both surprising and interesting given the range of legal statutes across the four markets:
Switzerland has a reputation as a haven for laundering the provenance of ancient art, whereas
Canada has potentially strong legal sanction against trafficking in cultural property.
        Finally, in Table 4 we present a range of robustness tests. In Column (1) we report results
using exporter-level medians to take away the time-series element of our variation. The coefficient


12
   If we include log(GDPPCUScy)*MetDummyc as a control, we find it to be insignificant, and the coefficient on
Corruptoncy*MetDummyc is unaffected.

   Perhaps surprisingly, the coefficient on MetDummyc does not take on any consistent sign across specifications. This
may reflect different tastes for artifacts across countries, as our measure is U.S.-based.

on Corruptioncy is 1.30, marginally lower than the coefficients reported in Table 2. Column (2)
presents results for imports and exports for HS Code 97 (Works of art. Collectors’ pieces,
antiques), since some cultural property may be classified in other 4-digit classes, such as paintings
(9701) or sculpture (9703). We obtain similar, though somewhat weaker, results than those
reported in Table 2. As previously noted, this may result from the fact that products in HS 97 but
outside of HS 9706 would be expected to contain a smaller proportion of export-restricted objects.
In Column (3) we show our results with exporting country fixed effects included. While the
coefficient on Corruptioncy is still positive, it is no longer significant. This is not surprising, given
that most of the variation in Corruptioncy is cross-sectional. Finally, we include results using HS
Code 9503 (Toys, scale models etc, puzzles, parts), by far the largest component of the 2-digit HS
Code 95; we also report results using the entire HS 95 industry. As a placebo regression this
industry has the advantages of having had a zero tariff rate since 1994 (and hence no incentive for
importers to lie to the US customs). We report results for HS 9503 and HS 95 in columns (4) and
(5) respectively. In both cases, the coefficient on Corruptioncy is indistinguishable from zero. This
suggests that the positive association between exporter’s corruption and the reporting gap for the
imports of cultural objects to the U.S. is unlikely due to some missing factors that are common
across product lines.


5. Conclusions


Exploring different reporting incentives in the trade in cultural objects and antiques between the
exporter (e.g., Egypt) and the importer (e.g., the United States) sides, this paper provides a gauge
for illicit trade in cultural goods. We find strong and robust evidence that the percentage under-
recording of exports of cultural objects is highly correlated the exporting country’s level of
corruption as measured by a commonly used subjective index. Furthermore, the association
between the two is stronger for countries that are particularly well-endowed in export-restricted
objects that are considered to be desirable in the major markets.
        We provide a number of contributions. First, we present a simple methodology that can be
applied to generate cross-country estimates of illicit trade. This has become feasible only in recent
years when large and highly-disaggregated trade data from both importing and exporting countries
                                                        13

have been made available.14 While some additional creativity will be required to apply this method
to other types of illicit trade, we believe that the approach will prove to be useful. For example,
some legal inputs are required in the production of illegal drugs: potassium permanganate is used
to produce crack cocaine, but also many other products. As a result, it is a controlled substance in
some countries, such as Colombia, but much less tightly regulated in others. This type of legal
asymmetry may similarly lead to different reporting incentives which could be utilized in tracking
other illicit trade.
        Second, we provide an important contribution to the literature on measuring corruption.
Since mid-1990s, there has been an explosion in the use of corruption indices in empirical
research.. Because corruption is illegal in most countries, almost all available measures are
subjective indices based on surveys of citizens, experts, or firms. By finding a clear association
between smuggling in cultural objects based on objectively collected trade data and a commonly
used subjective corruption ranking, this paper provides valuable and independent confirmation that
the survey-based corruption indices contain useful information.
        While it is tempting to try to use our results to calibrate the total volume of trafficking in
cultural objects into the United States and worldwide, it is not possible to generate any meaningful
measure based on our analyses. First, the ‘trade gap’ between reported imports and reported
exports is generally positive for all goods – we are interested in the correlates of this gap rather
than the level of the gap itself. Further, if we wish to use our regression results for such
calculations, the numbers we produce will be highly sensitive to our assumptions of the extent of
trafficking from very low corruption source countries. Given that our results are expressed in terms
of elasticities, any change in this assumption will naturally generate a proportionate increase in our
final measure of the total level of trafficking. We will leave this type of exercise for future work.




14
  As a practical implication for law enforcement communities, real-time cross-checking of export and import
declarations may provide an extra tool to capture smuggling.

Notes: Antiques_Gap is defined as log(1+US_Imports) - log(1+Exports_to_US),
where US_Imports are imports reported by the United States for HS Code 9706 from
country c, and Exports_to_US are exports destined for the United States for HS Code
9706 from country c. Corruption is (the negative of) the Kaufman et al (2006) measure
of corruption. GDPPCUS is per capita income for country c in constant 2000 US
dollars. MetDummy denotes that country c is reported as the country of origin for at
least one item in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's highlights collection. MetHoldings
is the number of pre-19th Century items in the Metropolitan Museum's highlights
collection. Corruption and GDPPCUS are country-year level observations;
MetDummy and MetHoldings are country-level observations. Please see section 2 of
the text for further information and sources.
