This chapter reviews the empirical economics literature on the impact of trade liberalization on
firms' innovation-related outcomes. We define and examine four types of shocks to trade flows:
import competition, export opportunities, access to imported intermediates, and foreign input
competition. Our review reveals interesting heterogeneities at the country and firm levels. In
emerging countries, trade liberalization appears to spur productivity and innovation. In developed
countries, export opportunities and access to imported intermediates tend to encourage
innovation, but the evidence on import competition is mixed, especially for firms in the United
States. At the firm level, the positive effects of trade on innovation are more pronounced at the
initially more productive firms while the negative effects are more pronounced at the initially less
productive firms.

1     Introduction

For the better part of the past several decades, international trade has risen steadily; as a share of world GDP,

trade grew from 24 percent to 61 percent between 1960 and 2008 (see Figure 1). Since the onset of the Great

Recession in 2008, however, trade activities have slowed; meanwhile, uneasiness about the implications

of trade liberalization for local economies has spread in developed economies like the U.S. and the U.K.1

Although economists have long argued that trade is overall welfare-enhancing, recent events indicate an

increasingly cautious view of trade and globalization among policy makers and the general public.

     How does trade liberalization affect domestic firms’ incentives and capabilities to innovate? This ques-

tion is central to trade policy: innovation is a fundamental driver of economic growth (Romer, 1990; Jones,

2005). A simple Ricardian model would predict that a country gains from trade by specializing in its com-

parative advantage with respect to productivity. However, trade may also lead to an endogenous change

in innovation (and consequently in productivity), which in turn could decrease or increase the gains from
   1 In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted to withdraw from the European Union. In April 2018, the White House announced new

tariffs on more than 1,300 imported goods from China in response to an investigation of China’s “unreasonable or discriminatory”
trade practices (USTR, 2018). China retaliated by imposing tariffs on some U.S. exports shortly thereafter.



                                                                                                       2

revived economists’ interest in examining the impact of trade liberalization on innovation. This chapter will

survey some of the recent empirical literature, introduce a simple framework to categorize the findings by

the trade shocks examined, and summarize the broad patterns that have emerged.

                Trade liberalization affects the environment in which firms operate in a range of ways. From the perspec-

tive of a focal domestic firm, trade liberalization could bring an influx of foreign competitors into domestic

markets; it could also provide access to foreign markets. Either the increased competition or the increased

access could affect the output market (where the focal firm operates as a seller) and/or the input market

(where the focal firm operates as a buyer). We thus define four trade shocks by direction and by target

market, as illustrated in Table 1’s 2-by-2 matrix.

                                                                           Direction

                                      Increased competition in domestic market         Increased access to foreign market
Target market




                    Output market               Import competition                          Export opportunities



                     Input market           Foreign input competition                  Access to imported intermediates




                The output market is where the focal domestic firm sells its final goods and/or services. Import com-

petition obliges the firm to face the entry of a foreign firm into the domestic output market. Export oppor-

tunities allow the domestic firm to enter a foreign output market to compete with existing foreign firms.

Figure 2, Panel A, plots the growth of U.S. imports and that of U.S. exports between 1990 and 2016 (in 2016

dollars). During this period, U.S. imports increased nearly eightfold, from $281 billion to $2,248 billion; U.S.

exports increased more than sevenfold, from $204 billion to $1,450 billion. China is a top contributor to the

growth of both U.S. imports and U.S. exports.

    The input market is where the focal domestic firm purchases intermediate goods used as inputs into

its production. Access to imported intermediates allows the focal firm to purchase intermediate goods

from a foreign supplier. Foreign input competition occurs when a foreign firm purchases its inputs from

the domestic focal firm’s domestic upstream suppliers, thus increasing demand for those inputs. Figure

2, Panel B, shows that intermediate goods have consistently been a large part of U.S. imports and of U.S.


                                                                                                  4
exports. Though their shares of total trade have declined recently, intermediate goods still accounted for 40

percent of the value of U.S. imports and 48 percent of that of U.S. exports in 2016. It is important to note

that imported intermediate goods not only provide access to foreign inputs (when the focal domestic firm

imports the goods), they can also generate import competition (when the focal domestic firm and the foreign

suppliers of intermediate goods compete to sell to the same downstream domestic customers). Similarly,

exported intermediate goods can also provide export opportunities (when the focal domestic firm export the

goods) in addition to generating foreign input competition (when the focal domestic firm and the foreign

purchasers of intermediate goods compete to buy from the same upstream domestic suppliers).

    The focal firm could enter into a foreign market in three ways: it could purchase or sell goods and/or

services from an unaffiliated foreign firm where there is no linkage of ownership (i.e., entry via only trade

flows); it could purchase or sell goods and/or services from an affiliated foreign firm (i.e., entry via both

trade flows and foreign direct investment); or it could establish an affiliated foreign firm with which it does

not trade (i.e., entry via only FDI). For the purpose of this review, we focus on understanding the effects of

trade flows in the first two scenarios without distinguishing between the two. That is, we do not examine

the third scenario or the effects of FDI in the second scenario. Trade flows and FDI have different effects

theoretically and empirically, and it would have been impractical for this chapter to cover both in depth.

    We use the 2-by-2 framework to organize our review of the empirical literature. In surveying the litera-

ture, we focus mainly on reduced-form studies that use trade-liberalization episodes as natural experiments

to examine the effects of shocks to trade flows on productivity and innovation outcomes at the firm level.

We focus on trade-induced changes within a firm and do not evaluate aggregate productivity changes due

to reallocation across firms (Pavcnik, 2002; Melitz, 2003). There are, of course, many more papers on the top-

ics of trade and innovation than our review could possibly cover.2 The goal of this chapter is not to perform

an exhaustive survey, but to identify a representative set of empirical studies and extract key takeaways

using our simple framework. We complement the summaries of empirical studies with discussions of the

underlying theoretical mechanisms emphasizing the intuition.

    We consider both direct and indirect measures of innovation. The direct measures of innovation we

consider consist of R&D spending (input into innovation), patents (output of innovation), product mix (e.g.,

number of products, product quality, and product differentiation), and survey responses on adoption of
    2 In addition to the literature on FDI and firm innovation (e.g., Guadalupe et al., 2012; Fons-Rosen et al., 2018), we also exclude the

related literature on technology diffusion (Grossman & Helpman, 1991a), which Keller (2004) summarizes; more recent contributions
to this literature include Smarzynska Javorcik (2004); Branstetter et al. (2006); Griffith et al. (2006); Bloom et al. (2013); Keller & Yeaple
(2013); Bilir & Morales (2018); Gumpert (2018). Another literature we exclude is the macro trade literature (e.g., Costantini & Melitz,
2008; Atkeson & Burstein, 2010; Perla et al., 2015; Sampson, 2016; Buera & Oberfield, 2016).




                                                                      5
new technologies, new management practices, or product or process innovations. The indirect measures

of innovation we consider are labor productivity and residual total factor productivity (TFP). We include

studies on firm productivity since productivity and innovation are closely related: productivity captures the

efficiency of the production process and innovation generates changes in efficiency. Although innovation

does not always lead to productivity gains, it is a key determinant of productivity (Hall, 2011; Syverson,

2011). We thus include both types of outcomes to gain a better understanding of how trade liberalization

affects firm innovation and the consequences of innovation.

    Section 2 examines the impact of import competition on firm productivity and innovation. On the one

hand, import competition may decrease a firm’s incentives to innovate by reducing the rents that it could

capture from innovating. On the other hand, a firm may innovate more in response to increased import

competition as a way to “escape competition”. In addition, import competition may reduce managerial

slack or redeploy factors within the firm, both of which could lead to increased innovation. The current

literature finds mixed evidence on the impact of import competition, and the findings differ by region and

by firm. There is strong evidence that import competition spurs productivity and innovation for firms in

emerging economies and Europe. The evidence is more negative for firms in the U.S. and Canada. Within

a country, the impact of import competition tends to be more positive (or less negative) at firms that were

initially more productive.

    Sections 3 and 4 examine the impact of export opportunities and that of access to imported intermediates,

respectively. Unlike import competition, export opportunities and access to imported intermediates are

generally found to have positive effects on firm productivity and innovation across different countries.

Export opportunities increase the returns to innovating by expanding the output market to which a firm

has access, and access to imported intermediates improves the production process. In addition, both trade

shocks could induce learning. The positive effects of these two shocks also tend to be more pronounced at

firms that were initially more productive.

    Since there is little empirical evidence on the impact of foreign input competition, Section 5 discusses the

potential mechanisms and empirical designs to measure their relevance. Section 6 concludes.



2    Impact of Import Competition on Firm Productivity and Innovation

When foreign firms enter the domestic output market of the focal firm, they generate import competi-

tion. A large literature in industrial organization has studied how competition in general—not just import



                                                       6
competition—affects firms’ incentives to innovate (Gilbert, 2006; Cohen, 2010); the key mechanisms that it

has established serve as a useful foundation for understanding the impact of import competition. On the

one hand, competition could reduce the potential rents that a firm could capture from innovating (Schum-

peter, 1942). We label this mechanism the “Schumpeterian effect”, which predicts that import competition

has a negative impact on firm innovation. On the other hand, competition could also increase incentives to

innovate by reducing the pre-innovation rents, i.e., the rents a firm can capture without innovating (Arrow,

1962). We label this mechanism the “escape-competition effect”, which predicts that import competition has

a positive impact on firm innovation. Aghion et al. (2005) show in a model that the escape-competition effect

dominates when competing firms are neck-and-neck in their levels of technological advancement, whereas

the Schumpeterian effect dominates for the laggards who are far behind the leaders at the technological

frontier and have a low chance of catching up.3

    The agency literature introduces another interesting angle for thinking about the impact of competition,

which we label the “preference effect”. Managers responsible for choosing how much to innovate may

not make the choice that maximizes their firms’ profits when they draw private benefits simply from their

firm’s continued existence (Hart, 1983; Schmidt, 1997; Vives, 2008; Raith, 2003). When increased competition

threatens the existence of their business and job, they may exert more effort and innovate to avoid losing

the private benefits. A related literature on X-efficiency shows that competitive pressure reduces manage-

rial slack in firms (Leibenstein, 1978; Martin, 1978; Martin & Page, 1983; Holmes & Schmitz Jr, 2001). The

preference effect implies that import competition has a positive impact on firm innovation.

    Although the escape-competition effect and the preference effect both imply a positive innovation re-

sponse to import competition, the former effect is increasing in a firm’s initial productivity, whereas the

latter effect is decreasing in a firm’s initial productivity (Aghion et al., 2001; Bombardini et al., 2017; Chen

& Steinwender, 2017). Initially more productive firms are closer to the technological frontier and thus have

stronger incentives to escape competition. They also face lower bankruptcy risk, so the preference effect is

less likely to activate.
   3 The Schumpeterian explanation focuses on changed incentives to innovate. An alternative way to explain why laggards innovate

less in response to import competition is that they become more constrained (e.g., credit constrained; Hombert & Matray, 2017).

   Table 2 summarizes the recent empirical evidence on the impact of import competition on firm produc-

tivity and innovation (published or written after 2000). Several interesting patterns emerge. First, much of

the pre-2013 literature use data on Latin American firms, since those countries had experienced arguably

exogenous trade-liberalization episodes in the 1980s and 1990s (Pavcnik, 2002; Muendler, 2004; Schor, 2004;

Fernandes, 2007; Teshima, 2009; Bas & Ledezma, 2010; Iacovone et al., 2011; Iacovone, 2012; Fernandes &

Paunov, 2013). These studies generally find positive effects of import competition on productivity, espe-

cially at large firms (Muendler, 2004; Schor, 2004; Fernandes, 2007; Fernandes & Paunov, 2013) and at the

most technologically advanced firms (Iacovone et al., 2011; Iacovone, 2012). There is also positive evidence

from studies on firms in Asia (Amiti & Konings, 2007 for Indonesia; Topalova & Khandelwal, 2011 for India)

and from cross-country studies (Gorodnichenko et al., 2010; Amiti & Khandelwal, 2013). Overall, the pre-

2013 literature provides ample support for the escape-competition effect at firms in developing countries.

   Evidence on firms in developed countries is more nuanced. In Northern America (i.e., the United States

and Canada), the findings from the pre-2013 literature are split between being positive (Schmitz Jr, 2005;

Bernard et al., 2006b; Dunne et al., 2010) and being positive but insignificant (Trefler, 2004; Bernard et al.,

2006a). In Europe, De Loecker (2011) finds positive but insignificant effects for Belgium. Interestingly,

Aghion et al. (2005) show that the relationship between import competition and innovation at firms in UK

follows an inverted-U pattern: competition increases innovation in industries that are not very competitive,

where firms tend to be neck-and-neck in their levels of technological advancement; in contrast, in industries

that are already highly competitive and have large technological gaps, competition decreases innovation.

   More recent studies have taken advantage of China’s drastic and unexpected rise as the world’s leading

exporter.4 Again, there are regional differences in the findings on the impact of Chinese import competition

on firm productivity and innovation. Chinese import competition is found to increase innovation for firms

in Europe (Bloom et al., 2016b, 2018), China (Bombardini et al., 2017; Brandt et al., 2017), South Korea (Ahn

et al., 2018), and Peru (Medina, 2018). Bloom et al. (2018) propose an alternative mechanism to the escape-

competition and preference effects that could also explain the positive findings: import competition may

lower the returns to factors that are “trapped” inside of a firm due to firm-specific moving costs, thereby

reducing the opportunity cost of using these factors to innovate. Similarly, Medina (2018) argues that import

competition could lead to product upgrading by forcing firms to reallocate idle factors that are too costly to

eliminate.
  4 See   Autor et al. (2016) for a description of the rise of Chinese manufacturing exports.



                                                                     10
    For firms in Northern America, there is a mixture of findings. Chinese import competition has a negative

effect on the R&D spending of U.S. firms, which is driven by those with relatively weak initial performances

(Autor et al., 2017; Xu & Gong, 2017). It also has a negative effect on the self-reported product and process

innovations of Canadian firms (Kueng et al., 2017). At the same time, Chinese import competition has a

positive effect on the product differentiation of U.S. firms with large R&D stocks (Hombert & Matray, 2017).

Autor et al. (2017) and Chakravorty et al. (2017) report conflicting findings on the impact of Chinese import

competition on U.S. firms’ patenting. Using data on U.S. patents granted between 1990 and 2006, Chakra-

vorty et al. (2017) find insignificant effects of Chinese import competition on patent count and positive effects

on citation-weight patents. Autor et al. (2017) find negative effects on both measures using patents granted

between 1975 and 2013. Autor et al. (2017) show that the estimated effects of Chinese import competition on

patents are sensitive to the inclusion of controls for differential time trends across sectors, since there exist

confounding pre-trends in technology creation. Taken together, the results from Northern America provide

support for both the Schumpeterian and escape-competition effects; the former is more pronounced at the

initially less productive firms and the latter is more pronounced at the initially more productive firms.

    In summary, the studies in our review find overwhelmingly positive evidence in developing economies,

largely positive evidence in Europe, and mixed evidence in Northern America. To our best knowledge, no

studies have empirically examined the drivers of these cross-regional differences in the innovation response

to import competition.5 We propose three potential explanations. First, the initial levels of competitiveness

of industries might be the lowest in developing countries and the highest in Northern America; Europe

would be somewhere in between. In the framework of Aghion et al. (2005), developing countries and Europe

would thus be on the left side of the inverted-U curve, where more competition would lead to increased

innovation; Northern America would be on the right side of the curve with the opposite impact. Second,

managerial slack—and hence the preference effect—might be the largest in developing countries and the

smallest in Northern America.6 Third, frictions in the markets might be the highest in developing countries

and the lowest in Northern America. As a result, factors are the most likely to be “trapped” at firms in

developing countries. We believe that empirically testing these potential explanations would be a valuable

contribution to the trade and innovation literature.
    5 Autor et al. (2017), Akcigit et al. (2017), and Bloom et al. (2018) provide informal discussions that focus on reconciling the differential

findings between Europe and Northern America.
    6 Using data on Spanish firms, Chen & Steinwender (2017) provide support for the preference effect by showing that import compe-

tition has a positive effect only on initially unproductive family firms and not on professionally managed firms.

3     Impact of Export Opportunities on Firm Productivity and Innovation

Export opportunities provide domestic firms access to new foreign output markets. From the perspective

of the focal domestic firm, there are two important differences between export opportunities and import

competition. First, import competition does not change the size of the focal firm’s potential output market,

whereas export opportunities do; import competition only reduces the effective market size, i.e., the share of

the market that the firm is able to capture. The increased size of the potential market increases the rents that

a firm could capture from innovating, resulting in a positive impact of export opportunities on innovation

(we label this the “market-size effect”). However, a potential indirect effect of having access to a larger

market is that entry becomes more attractive, leading to more intensive competition in the domestic output

market (Aghion et al., 2017).7

    The second difference is that import competition affects all domestic firms (though some may be affected

more than others), whereas the market-size effect is only relevant to those that choose to export (or have the

potential to do so). Standard trade models with heterogeneous firms (e.g., Melitz, 2003) emphasize that only

sufficiently productive firms with low marginal cost would export; for others, the fixed and variable cost of

exporting would be too high. The induced-competition effect of export opportunities, on the other hand,

affects both exporters and non-exporters.

    Table 3 summarizes the recent empirical findings on the effects of export opportunities on firm produc-

tivity and innovation (published or written after 2000). The first group of studies examines the effects of

access to export markets. Most of them find positive effects—at least at some firms (Verhoogen, 2008; Bas

& Ledezma, 2010; Lileeva & Trefler, 2010; Aw et al., 2011; Bernard et al., 2011; Bustos, 2011; Iacovone, 2012;

Mayer et al., 2016; Aghion et al., 2017; Manova & Yu, 2017; Ahn et al., 2018; Coelli et al., 2018; Munch &

Schaur, 2018). Consistent with the market-size effect, the initially most productive and the technologically

most advanced firms respond the most favorably to increased access to export markets (Lileeva & Trefler,

2010; Bustos, 2011; Iacovone, 2012; Mayer et al., 2016; Aghion et al., 2017; Ahn et al., 2018). There is also some

evidence that the induced competition from export opportunities lead to the Schumpeterian effect (i.e., neg-

ative effect on innovation) for non-exporters and the initially least productive firms (Baldwin & Gu, 2009;

Aghion et al., 2017).
   7 Note that the indirect competition effect is present even in a unilateral trade liberalization. Import competition may also interact

with export opportunities and generate competition against the focal domestic firm in the foreign markets that it exports to. Medina
(2018) considers the differential effects of import competition in domestic versus foreign markets and finds no significant effects of
import competition in foreign markets.

    The second group of studies focuses on a related channel known as “learning by exporting”. Learning-

by-exporting, like the market-size effect, generates a positive effect on firm productivity and innovation, but

the two channels have some conceptual differences. In learning-by-exporting, a firm receives knowledge

without necessarily investing in innovation-related activities. The market-size effect by contrast would

prompt a firm to intentionally increase innovation in order to reap the benefits of access to an enlarged

market. Moreover, in learning-by-exporting, innovation occurs after exporting; in the market-size effect,

firms may innovate or plan to innovate before export opportunities are realized. We thus categorize the

learning-by-doing studies separately. Interestingly, learning-by-exporting happens predominantly at firms

exporting to more developed economies (van Biesebroeck, 2005; De Loecker, 2007; Atkin et al., 2017), likely

due to such economies offering more scope for firms to learn from technologically advanced buyers.8



4     Impact of Access to Imported Intermediates on Firm Productivity and

      Innovation

Access to imported intermediates allows the focal domestic firm to purchase intermediate goods from for-

eign suppliers. While this also generates import competition for the focal firm’s domestic upstream suppli-

ers, in this section we consider the effect on the outcomes of the focal firm. Since we focus on trade flows,

we do not consider the case—often casually labeled “outsourcing” or “offshoring”—where the focal firm

delegates the entire production process to a foreign firm (affiliated or unaffiliated) with which it does not

trade.9
   8 One earlier study, Bernard & Jensen (1999), finds no evidence of learning-by-exporting at U.S. firms, who may have a narrower

scope for learning.
   9 On the impact of moving production offshore on firm innovation, see Fuchs & Kirchain (2010); Pisano & Shih (2012) for interesting

case studies and Andersen (2016), Bena & Simintzi (2017), and Branstetter et al. (2017) for recent empirical evidence.

    Access to imported intermediates may lower input costs, increase the quality of inputs, and/or improve

the efficiency of the production process (Halpern et al., 2015; Bøler et al., 2015). As a result, the focal firm

may produce new and/or higher quality output (Goldberg et al., 2010; Bas & Strauss-Kahn, 2015; Fieler et al.,

2018); it may also innovate more due to increased profit margins or more opportunities to learn about new

product design, new production processes, new materials or technologies, and even new organizational

methods (Ethier, 1982; Markusen, 1989; Grossman & Helpman, 1991b; Rivera-Batiz & Romer, 1991; Coe &

Helpman, 1995). At the same time, access to imported intermediates may decrease innovation by reducing

the need for process-improving technologies.

    Table 4 summarizes the recent empirical findings on the impact of access to imported intermediates on

firm productivity and innovation. Except for two studies that find insignificant effects (Muendler, 2004;

Teshima, 2009), all other studies report positive and significant results. The vast majority of these studies

focuses on estimating the impact on TFP, an indirect measure of innovation (Schor, 2004; Amiti & Konings,

2007; Kasahara & Rodrigue, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2010; Lileeva & Trefler, 2010; Topalova & Khandelwal,

2011; Iacovone, 2012; Halpern et al., 2015; Bloom et al., 2016b; Brandt et al., 2017; Fieler & Harrison, 2018).

There is also evidence of positive effects on R&D (Goldberg et al., 2010; Bøler et al., 2015), patenting (Bloom

et al., 2016b), product innovation (Goldberg et al., 2010; Bas & Paunov, 2018), and technology adoption (Bas

& Berthou, 2017; Juhász & Steinwender, 2018; Bloom et al., 2016b).10

    Most of the studies focus on firms in developing countries. For these firms, the effects of access to im-

ported intermediates may differ for firms with and without foreign ownership. Topalova & Khandelwal

(2011) find that foreign-owned firms in India experience less positive effects than their domestic counter-

parts, while Halpern et al. (2015) find the opposite results in Hungary. Interestingly, Amiti & Konings (2007)

find that non-importers can also gain from importers’ access to imported intermediates, though the esti-

mated spillover effects for non-importers are smaller than the estimated direct effects for importers.

    Fewer studies focus on firms in developed countries. Although they also find positive effects of access to

imported intermediates, there are interesting differences in the underlying mechanism: firms in developing

economies tend to import high-quality inputs from firms in developed economies (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2010;

Bas & Strauss-Kahn, 2015; Fieler et al., 2018), whereas firms in developed countries tend to import cheaper

and low-quality inputs (Bloom et al., 2016b). The differential effects of accessing different types of inputs on

firm productivity and innovation warrant future research.
  10 Interestingly, Goldberg et al. (2010) find that for Indian firms, access to new inputs matters more than access to cheaper existing

inputs for driving product innovation. Bas & Paunov (2018), however, find the opposite for Ecuador.


                                                                  16
    Two studies use tariff changes to compare the impact of import competition and that of access to im-

ported intermediates (Amiti & Konings, 2007; Topalova & Khandelwal, 2011). The same tariff could affect

the import competition faced by a firm or the access to imported inputs enjoyed by its downstream cus-

tomers. In other words, the focal firm’s import competition depends on the tariffs imposed in its own in-

dustry, and its access to imported intermediates depends on the tariffs imposed in its suppliers’ industries.

Both studies find that access to imported intermediates has a more positive effect than import competition.



5    Impact of Foreign Input Competition on Firm Productivity and Inno-

     vation

Foreign input competition means that foreign firms enter the domestic input market as buyers and com-

pete against the focal domestic firm for the same inputs produced by its domestic suppliers. Foreign input

competition is thus generated by the increased export opportunities for the focal firms’ domestic suppli-

ers. To our knowledge, only one study—Kee (2015)—provides relevant evidence on the impact of for-

eign input competition by showing that domestic firms in the Bangladeshi garment sector enjoy positive

spillovers from sharing the same local suppliers with foreign-owned firms. When a trade policy shock (EU’s

Everything-But-Arms Initiative) led to an exogenous increase in the demand for local inputs by foreign-

owned firms, local suppliers improved their efficiency, product quality and product variety, which in turn

increased the productivity and product scope of the domestic firms who were purchasing from the same

suppliers. Although Kee (2015) examines foreign entry via FDI, the same mechanism could also apply to

entry via trading goods. In other words, foreign input competition could have a positive impact on a fo-

cal firm’s productivity and innovation when the firm’s suppliers start exporting more and consequently

improve the attributes of the inputs they supply.

    In theory, foreign input competition could also have a negative impact on the focal firm’s productivity

and innovation by raising the costs of its inputs and reducing its profit margins. To empirically examine the

effects of foreign input competition on a firm’s outcomes, researchers would need exogenous variations in

the export opportunities of its upstream suppliers. The trade-liberalization episodes examined by studies

in Section 3 provide a good starting point: instead of calculating changes in the export opportunities of

the focal firm, one would use an input-output table to calculate those of its upstream suppliers. Given the

importance of intermediate goods as exports (Figure 2), we believe that addressing this gap in the empirical

literature is a promising avenue for future work.

6     Conclusion

This chapter reviews the recent empirical evidence on the effects of trade liberalization on firm productivity

and innovation. We consider the effects of four shocks to trade flows: import competition, export opportu-

nities, access to imported intermediates, and foreign input competition. Overall, the studies in our review

find that import competition has mixed effects on firm productivity and innovation while export opportu-

nities and access to imported intermediates have generally positive effects. There is little evidence on the

impact of foreign input competition.

    Our review points to interesting differences across regions. In emerging economies, such as Latin Amer-

ican countries, most of the evidence shows that trade has positive effects on firm productivity and innova-

tion, especially for the largest and most productive firms. Due to data limitations, however, these studies

tend to focus on medium-sized and large firms in the formal economy. Since there is important heterogene-

ity across firms in their responses to trade shocks, the existing findings may not extend to smaller firms in

the informal sector, which play a large role in developing economies.11 Thus, examining the impact of trade

on the outcomes of smaller firms (e.g., entrepreneurship) would be a valuable contribution to the literature.

    There are fewer studies on firms in developed economies. Studies on European firms also find positive

(but sometimes insignificant) effects of trade liberalization on firm productivity and innovation. In the

United States, most of the existing evidence concerns the impact of import competition and finds mixed

effects. There is a striking lack of studies on the impact of the other three trade shocks on U.S. firms’

innovation-related outcomes.12 Addressing this gap in the literature is an important area for future research.

    Another broad pattern emerging from our review is that larger and more productive firms tend to gain

more from trade liberalization in terms of increased productivity and innovation. Standard trade models

with heterogeneous firms (e.g., Melitz, 2003) have shown that when each firm’s productivity is fixed, aggre-

gate productivity gains from trade are generated by the most productive firms entering a market or the least

productive firms exiting it. Our review suggests that there is an additional complementary mechanism of

reallocation due to endogenous within-firm changes in productivity and innovation.

    Although it is tempting to justify protectionism using the negative evidence on the impact of import

competition on firm innovation, our review shows that trade policies have complicated consequences. Tar-

iffs on imports may insulate some domestic firms from import competition, but they may also restrict the
  11 An exception is Nataraj (2011), who shows that import competition caused the average productivity of informal firms in India

(which accounts for 80% of employment) to increase, but due to a lack of panel data is not able to attribute this fully to within firm
productivity changes.
  12 To the best of our knowledge, Bernard et al. (2011) is the only study that uses U.S. data to examine the impact of export opportunities

on firm innovation. We found no studies on the effects of access to imported intermediates or foreign input competition.



                                                                    18
access to intermediate goods for other domestic firms. Moreover, foreign countries may retaliate by limiting

domestic firms’ access to export markets. Since a reduction in access to foreign inputs and/or export op-

portunities is likely to hurt domestic innovation, protectionist policies have clear risks. Akcigit et al. (2017)

show in a model that import tariffs generate at best short-term gains at the expense of long-term losses,

whereas policies that encourage innovations directly (e.g., R&D subsidies) generate substantial long-term

gains.

    In interpreting the empirical evidence, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of the current

literature. First, productivity and innovation are inherently difficult to observe, and the measures we have

are imperfect.13 Second, a trade shock to a domestic firm may generate interesting technological spillovers

to other firms, e.g., through vertical linkages, and more empirical evidence on this channel would improve

our understanding of its overall impact on productivity and innovation.14 Finally, most of the studies in

this review examine the impact of each trade shock individually. There is more to learn about how the four

shocks considered here interact with each other in driving changes in productivity and innovation. While

we have made substantial progress of understanding the impact of trade on innovation, there remain many

unanswered questions and fruitful areas for future research.
