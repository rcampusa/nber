        This paper investigates the use of trimmed means as high-frequency estimators of inflation.

The known characteristics of price change distributions, specifically the observation that they

generally exhibit high levels of kurtosis, imply that simple averages of price data are unlikely to

produce efficient estimates of inflation. Trimmed means produce superior estimates of ‘core

inflation,’ which we define as a long-run centered moving average of CPI and PPI inflation, We find

that trimming 9% from each tail of the CPI price-change distribution, or 45% from the tails of the

PPI price-change distribution, yields an efficient estimator of core inflation for these two series,

although lesser trims also produce substantial efficiency gains. Historically, the optimal trimmed

estimators are found to be nearly 23% more efficient (in terms of root-mean-square error) than the

standard mean CPI, and 45% more efficient than the mean PPI. Moreover, the efficient estimators

are robust to sample period and to the definition of the presumed underlying long-run trend in

inflation.

1 Introduction

     How should we interpret, mont,h-to-month changes in t,he measured Consumer Price
Index? Over the years, t#his question has led to the construction of several measures of
what, has come to be called ‘core’ inflation. Common measures of core inflation regularly
remove certain components from the construction of the CPI. In t,he U.S., ‘volatile’ food
and energy price movements, are often ignored, and core inflation is synonymous wit,h t,he
CPI that excludes food and energy. ’ But, is it truly the case that food and energy price
changes never contain information about, trend inflation? Or, for that matter, is it, only
the volatile food and energy components that, distort, attempts to measure the underlying
inflation trend? Surely not. This leads us to consider how we might, develop a syst,ematic,
statistical methodology for reducing the transitory noise in measured inflation indices.
    This paper follows our recent work, largely beginning with Bryan and Cecchetti (1994),
where we investigate the estimation of aggregate consumer price inflation using t,rimmed
means of the distribution of price changes. These are estimators that are robust to t,he
distributional anomalies common to price statistics. They are order stat,istics that, are
computed by trimming a percentage from the tails of a histogram, and averaging what
is left. For example, the sample mean trims zero percent, while the median t,rims fifty
percent, from each tail of the distribution of price changes.
    Every student, in introductory statistics learns that, when data are drawn from a
normal distribution, the sample mean is the minimum variance estimator of the first
moment.       But price changes are not normally distributed. In fact, as we discuss in
Bryan and Cecchetti (1996), the cross-sect,ional distribution of inflation has very fat, tails,
with a sample kurtosis that is often substantially above ten. Underlying leptokurtotic
distributions create inferential difficulties, as they routinely produce skewed samples. In
our earlier papers, we discuss how these problems lead to transitory movements in the
sample mean, causing it, to have a high small-sample variance.
    Given what we know about, the distribution of price changes, what) is the most, efficient,

estimator of the first moment of the price change distribution? How can we produce a
reduced-noise estimate of aggregate inflation at high frequencies? Our answer is to trim
the price change distribution, not by removing food and energy prices every time, but by
ignoring some percent(age of the highest and lowest price changes each mont,h.
    We study monthly changes in both consumer and producer prices in the U.S.             Data
availability dictate that we examine 36 components of the CPI from 1967 to 1996 and 29
components of the PPI over the same period. Throughout, we take as our benchmark
the thirty-six month centered moving average of actual inflation. We evaluate the ability
of candidate estimators to track the movements in the benchmark. Our conclusions are
that the most efficient estimate of inflation at the consumer level comes from trimming
9% from each tail, while efficient estimation of producer prices trims 45%. By trimming
a cumulative 18% of the consumer price distribution we are able to reduce the root-
mean-square-error (RMSE) of aggregate inflation by nearly one-quarter. For the PPI,
the improvement is even more dramatic, as the RMSE declines by over 45 percent!
    The remainder of the paper is composed of five sections. Section 2 reports descriptive
statistics for the distribution of CPI and PPI price changes. Section 3 discusses the
stat,istical problems we attempt to overcome. Section 4 follows with by a discussion of
the Monte Carlo results that guide our choice of the optimal trimmed estimat,or. We
provide various robustness checks in Section 5.              These include examining changes in
sample period, changes in the degree of disaggregation of CPI data, and changes in the
benchmark. Sect ion 6 concludes.



2      Characteristics of Price Change Distributions

     By how much would the monthly measure of the consumer price index have to deviate
from its recent trend for us to be relatively certain that the trend has changed? This is
the question that is in most people’s minds when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases
the price statistics each month. 2 Figure 1 plots the monthly changes in consumer and
producer prices, at an annual rate, together with a three-year centered moving average,

    ZCecclictti (forthcoming) suggests a preliminary answer to exactly this qucstiori.

both for the period 1967:02 to 1997:04.”
   As is evident from the figure, the monthly changes in both of these price indices
contain substantial high-frequency noise. By this we mean that, deviations of the monthly
changes from the trend are quite large and often reversed. In fact, the standard deviation

BLS. These data arc all available continuously, monthly, since 1967:Ol. The housing scrvicc component
is based on the rental equivalcncc mcasure of owner occupied housing, and so prior to 1982, the series is
essentially the experimental CPI-Xl. The producer price is based on the PPI for commodities, and uses a
set of between 29 and 31 components. All data arc seasonally ad.justed using the ARIMA X-11 procedures

of the difference between the monthly and the moving average aggregate price change
is 6.92 percentage points for the PPI and 2.50 percentage points for the CPI (bot,h at
annual rates). A look at the actual distributions shows that a 90% confidence interval for
the CPI is from -3.92 to +3.76 percentage points, while for the PPI it, is from -10.35 to
+8.97 percentage points. In other words, since 1967, monthly changes in producer prices
have been either more than 10 percentage points below or 8 percentage points above the
thirty-six month moving average one in every ten months!
    The common method of excluding food and energy simply does not, help much. In
fact, the standard deviation of the difference between the CPI ex food and energy and the
thirty-six month average CPI is 2.31 percentage points, and the 90% confidence interval
shrinks slightly to [-3.73,+3.76] p ercentage points. By contrast, for the PPI, excluding
food and energy improves things, as the standard deviation of difference between the PPI
excluding food and energy and the 36 month centered moving average of the actual PPI
drops by about, 40% to 4.14, and the 90% confidence interval shrinks by about t,he same
amount to [-5.94,+4.76].
    In an effort to better understand the nature of the transitory fluctuations in high-
frequency inflation measurement, we begin by examining the characteristics of the price
change distributions. It is useful to pause at this stage to introduce some notation. We
define the inflation in an individual component price over an horizon k: as




where pit is the index level for component i at time t. From this, we define the mean
inflation in each time period, over horizon k, as




where the rit’s are relative importances that are allowed to change each mont,h to reflect,
the fact that the actual index is an arithmetic average.4

   Table 1 reports numerous descriptive statistics for the cross-sectional distribution of
monthly price changes at overlapping horizons of one to thirty-six months. Among the
noteworthy characteristics is that the distributions are often skewed. The mean absolute
value of the skewness, the mean of Si, in monthly CPI changes is 0.20 and in PPI changes
it is 0.04, suggesting that the distributions are nearly symmetrical on average. there is
little skewness in the distributions on average. But the standard deviation of Si is 2.35
for the CPI and 2.36 for the PPI, implying that distributions of one-month changes are
often highly skewed. This standard deviation falls off as the horizon increases, implying
that the distribution of longer-run changes are much less likely to exhibit, skewness.5
    The price change distributions also have very fat tails. The average kurtosis of
monthly changes, the average value of Icj, is 11.24 for the CPI and 10.35 for the PPI. In
fact, the weighted kurtosis of monthly price changes is in excess of 20 about ten percent
of the time. See Figure 2.
    These facts allow us to identify a potentially important source of high frequency noise
in the measurement of inflation. In a given month, there is a high probability of observing
some subset, of prices change by a substantial amount, - generating the skewness and
kurtosis that we see. But, over time, these extreme changes are balanced out, reducing

changes in the components, whcrc the weights change to reflect changes in relative prices. Defining the
aggregate price lcvcl P+ = C wipit, then Tit = wi(pit/pt-1).
   ‘For example the 5th and 95th pcrccntilcs of Si for the CPI arc [-X52,4.26]. Bnt the same percentiles
for S,“” arc [-2.X3,1.93].

the observed skewness.
   One economic int,erpretation of these distributional characteristics is that if price
change is costly, we will not observe the distribution of desired price changes each month.
If the size and t,iming of price changes are based on two-sided state-dependent, rules, as
in Caballero and Engel (1991), or Caplin and Leahy (1991)) what, we observe will depend
on the rule used by the price-setter and the history of the shocks to desired prices. As
a result, we will rarely see prices that exactly equal the price that would be set, in the
absence of any price-adjustment costs. The amount of noise decreases over longer periods,
when each price has changed numerous times. But for high frequencies of one quarter or
one month, the problem can be a serious one.6
   However, one need not, necessarily attach oneself to a particular model of price-set,ting
behavior in order to accept our conclusions. It, is well known that a mixture of random
draws from normal dist,ribut,ions with differing variances will produce a leptokurtic sam-
ple. As a statistical matter, then, we can show that the mean price-change statistic is
unlikely to provide the efficient estimate of inflation, regardless of the price setting model
that is assumed.
   We can t,hink of two possible approaches to handling the problem. One would be to
actually model price-setting explicitly using the theory as it, has been worked out. But
this has substantial drawbacks, as it, requires that, we actually estimate the time-varying
price change rules themselves. Alternatively, we can treat the complication presented
by state-dependent price change rules as a statistical sampling problem. We view the
monthly, skewed distributions as small-sample draws from the longer-horizon (roughly)
symmetrical populat,ion distribution. The fact that the population has such high kurtosis
leads   ILS   to consider a family of estimators that are robust to the presence of fat, tails, a
topic to which we now t,urn.

    6An alternative intcrprctation is irnplictl b y Balkc ant1 Wymc (1%X), who show that a multi-sector,
dynamic gemral equilibrium model with Inoncy and flexible prices can product: similar characteristics in
an cnvironrnent of asyrnmctric supply shocks. A distinguishing fcaturc of this rrloclcl is that the ‘n&c’
in the estimator rioctl riot significantly diminish at lower frcqnencies.




                                                    8
3 Robust Estimation

    We begin by assuming that we have available a sequence of samples from a symmetric
distribution wit,h an unknown, and possibly changing, mean. At issue is the efficient,
est,imation of the mean. We consider a set, of est,imators called trimmed means, that
average centered portions of the sample. The method of averaging is to order the sample,
trim the tails of the sample distribution, and average what remains.
    To calculate the (weighted) a-trimmed mean, we begin by ordering the sample,

{ 21 , “‘7 x,}, and the associated weights, (201, . . . . wn}.        Next, we define Wi as the cu-
mulative weight from 1 to i; that is,         W,: s $, wj.      From this we can determine t,he set,
of observations to be averaged for the calculation: the i’s such t,hat G < Wi                 <    (1 - $).
We call this 1,. This allows us to compute the weighted a-trimmed mean as




There are two obvious special cases. The first is the sample mean, .%a, and the second is
the sample median, 250.~
    The efficient estimator of the mean, in the class of trimmed sample means, will depend
on the charact,eristics of the data-generating process. 8 If, for example, the data are drawn
from a normal distribution, then we know that the sample mean is the most, efficient
estimator. That is, t,he sample mean is the estimator that has the smallest, small-sample
variance.
    But when the data are drawn from leptokurtic distributions - distributions with
much fatter tails t,han the normal - the sample mean will no longer be t,he most, efficient
estimator of t,he population mean, even in t,he class of trimmed sample means. It, is
relatively easy t,o see why this is so. With a fat-tailed distribution, one is more likely
to obtain a draw from one of the tails of the distribution that is not, balanced by an

cicncy of the sample mean and the sample median. But we know of no general results concerning the
relative cfficicncy of trimmed-mean estimators.

equally extreme observation in the opposite tail. That is to say, as t,he kurtosis of t,he
data-generating process increases, samples have a higher probability of being skewed.g
   The impact, of kurtosis on the efficiency of trimmed-mean estimators is straightforward
to demonstrate. To do so we construct, a simple experiment, in which we draw a series of
samples from distributions with varying kurtosis and compute the efficiency of the entire
class of trimmed-mean estimators, including the mean and the median.
   In all of our experiments, the data-generating process is characterized by a two pa-
rameter distribution that, is a mixture of two normals, one with unit variance, and one
with changing variance. We consider a random variable Z, such t#hat

In each of our experiments, we construct, 10,000 replications of 250 draws each. We

   Figure 3 plots the RMSE, and the MAD, for experiments based on distributions with
varying kurtosis,   K(A,   p). To adjust for the fact that the variance of the distribution also
changes with    A   and p, we have normalized RMSEo and MAD0 to one for each case. The
results clearly show t#hat the efficient trim - the trim that minimizes either t,he RMSE or
the MAD - increases with the kurtosis of the data generating process. As the kurtosis
increases from 3 to 30, the efficient trim goes from 0 to 16%.
   We caution that* the results from these experiments are illustrative and apply only
to the specific distributions we examine. We know of no general analytic result deriving
the optimal trimmed mean estimator as a function of the moments of the underlying
distribution and the size of the sample.



4 Efficient Estimation of Inflation: Preliminaries

   We have now established one property of price data and a related statistical fact.
First, the cross-sectional distribution of price changes, both in the CPI and the PPI, is
fat-tailed. Second, trimmed-means are the efficient estimator of the mean of a leptokurtic
distribution.   We now combine these two insights and ask what is the most, efficient
estimator of inflation?
   We begin with a preliminary examination of the data using a simple Monte Carlo
experiment based on actual price data. In order to judge efficiency, we need to have a
measure of the population mean we are trying to estimate. Following Cecchet,ti (forth-
coming): we choose the thirty-six month centered moving average of actual inflation.
This is an approximation of the long-term trend in inflation that, is likely to he what

people have in mind when they attempt, to construct measures they label core inflation.
   To proceed, we take the deviation of monthly component, price changes from this
thirty-six month centered moving average of inflation. For the CPI, we use 36 components
of the CPI-U over the period 1967.02 to 1997.04, with its 1985 weight,s. To simplify the
experiments, we set, the relative importances (rit) equal to the 1985 weights (wi), and
leave them fixed throughout.     For the PPI, we use a reduced set of 27 components
also available over the 1967.02 to 1997.04 sample and their fixed 1982 weights. After
subtracting each price change from the thirty-six month moving average change in the
appropriate index, we have two matrices of relative price changes.
   In each experiment, we randomly draw a series of samples by t,aking one observation
for each of the component, time-series - one draw from each column in the relative-price-
change matrix. This is a bootstrap procedure from which we generate 10,000 samples,
each with 36 relative price changes for CPI data, or 29 relative price changes for PPI
data. We then comput,e the two measures of efficiency - the root-mean-squared error
(RMSE) and the mean absolute deviation (MAD).
   The results are reported in Figures 4 and 5. The weighted means are found to be the
least efficient of all of the estimators. The efficiency of the inflation estimates greatly

improves with even very small trims from the sample. For example, in the case of the
CPI, trimming as little as 3% from each tail of cross-sectional distribution improves the
efficiency of the estimator by over 15%. The most efficient estimator for monthly CPI
data was the 7% trimmed mean where the efficiency gain is approximately 20%, although
trims in the neighborhood of this estimator perform nearly as we11.l’
    For the PPI, however, much larger trims of the sample distribution are necessary to
achieve the efficient estimator. The optimal trim, which occurs in the range of 40%, has
an RMSE that, is only one-third that of the sample mean!

   ‘OThc technique WC suggest here is appropriate for cases in which the price-change distributions arc
symmetrical on avcragc. WC know of instances where this is not the cast. For example, Roger’s (1007)
examination of New Zealand price data rcvcals a pcrsistcnt, positive skcwncss in the price change tlistri-
bution that, products a bias in the trimmctl estimators of the mean. Roger constrlds trimmed estimators
ccntcrcd on the mean pcrcciitilc, or the pcrcentilc of the distribution corresponding to the inC~aii of the
distribution. That is, for New Zealand price data, Roger trims the tails of the distribution asymmdri-
tally, centering on the 57th pcrcentilc. In this way, the trimmed estimator is an unbiased estimate of
the CPI trend in New Zealand. Roger’s insight implies a proccdurc in which the trim and c~cnteriug
parameter arc chosen jointly to minimize cithcr the RMSE or MAD criterion, subject to the cstimatol
being unbiased in the sample.

5 Efficient Inflation Estimation: Historical Data
   We now move to a more complete examination of the actual data. Here we will
compare the relative efficiency of trimmed estimators using the historical time series,
taking account of the changes in the relative importances [the rit’s in equation (2)] over
time. That, is to say, we will compute the weighted distributions of inflation each month,
where the weight,s vary based on changes in relative prices as well as the periodic rebating
done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics roughly once per decade.
   In Section 5.1, we look for the optimal trimmed mean estimator using the entire 1967
to 1997 sample currently available.        Are the results of the previous section robust to
several obvious changes in methods.? We examine three cases. In the first, reported in
Section 5.2, we study more disaggregated CPI data over a shorter sample period. In
Section 5.3, we look at the implications of changing t,he measurement, benchmark from
the thirty-six month centered moving average of actual inflation to moving averages of
from twenty-four to sixty months. Finally, in Section 5.4, we st,udy estimator stability
by looking at optimal trims over varying sample periods. We conclude this section with
a summary and comparison of the trimmed means with the inflation measures t,hat
arbitrarily exclude food and energy.


5.1 The Baseline Case

   In this section we consider the time-series characteristics of the trimmed-mean estima-
tors. We calculate the RMSE and the MAD for each trimmed estimator using monthly
historical component price data.        That is, we compute the trimmed-mean estimators
of inflation month-by-month, and compare their deviations from the centered thirty-six
month moving average. The results, reproduced in Figure 6 for the CPI, and Figure 7
for the PPI, are virtually identical to those in the Monte Carlo experiments shown in
Figures 4 and 5.11
   It is easy to see how much inflation measures are stabilized by trimming. Figure 8

plots the mean, the thirty-six month centered moving average, and the efficient t,rimmed
estimator for mont,hly CPI and PPI data for the January 1990 to December 1996 period.
    Table 2 compares t,he properties of a number of commonly used estimators for con-
sumer and producer price inflation. Focusing first on the CPI, we note that, exchlding
food and energy produces little improvement in efficiency. The CPI excluding food and
energy is only slight,ly more efficient than the CPI-U itself, reducing the RMSE from 2.50
to 2.31. But trimming clearly helps. Trimming 9% of the cross-sectional distribution of
consumer prices reduces the RMSE by just under 23 percent.12
    For producer prices, the improvements are even more dramatic. Using the long sample
period, we find that, trimming 40% of the distribution from each tail improves the RMSE
by over 45 percent,. Excluding food and energy from the PPI reduces the RMSE by less
than 40 percent.13

   12Brydcn and Carlson (1994) also note that this trim products the minimum time-series variance of
any trimmed-mean estimator over the 1967 to 1994 period.
   13A common tcchniquc for reducing the noise in the high frequency inflation cstimatcs uses timc-
series averages. We have conducted experiments that combine trimming with time-averaging. We note
that averaging the component price change data prior to trimming, or pm-trim meraging, tlrcrcases
the amount of trimming necessary to produce a minimum RMSE estirrdor of the inflation trcntl. For
example, using three-mouth avcragc price changes of component CPI data, the minimum RMSE of the
inflation trend is found ly trimming 6% from the tails of the price change distribution, compared to the
9% trims rquircd of monthly data. Similar results were found for post-trim avemges, where WC average
the monthly trimmctl moans. That is, if we calculate the trimmed estimators, and compute a 3-month
average of that, result, the minimlun RMSE estimate of the inflation trend is fount1 by trimming 6% from

5.2 More Disaggregated Data

   The price statistics are collected at a much more disaggregated level than what, we
have used thus far. Does the optimal trim change wit,h the level of aggregation? The
experiments in Section 3 suggest that, the answer to this question will depend on what,
happens to the kurtosis of the cross-section distribut,ion of price changes as we vary t,he
level of aggregation.
   To examine this issue, we assembled a data set, composed of between 142 and 175
components of t,he CPI-U from 1978 to 1996. The number of series (and the relat,ive
importance of each series) varies each mont,h depending on availability. The weighted
kurtosis of these data is much higher than that for the 36 component dataset examined
in the previous section. For monthly changes, for example, Table 1 reports that, inflation
in the 36 components of t,he CPI-U has median kurtosis of 9.68. By contrast, t,he kurtosis
in the more disaggregated data set, has a median of 43.1!
   As in Section 5.1, we construct, using historical data, the RMSE and MAD for each
of the trimmed estimators, from a = 0 to 50. These provide a gauge of the efficiency
gains from t,rimming the outlying tails of the price-change distribution. The results in
Figure 9 confirm that, in the case of consumer prices, the efficient, estimation of inflation
requires more trimming when more disaggregated data are used. In this experiment,: the
optimal trim is 16%, at which point the RMSE is cut, nearly in half. But again, virt,llally
any trimming helps. For example, trimming 9% from each t,ail - the optimal amount,
for the 36 component, data set, - reduces the RMSE by about 40%.
    The practical implications of this exercise are fairly important. We have found t,hat
since the kurtosis of the price-change distributions depends on the level of disaggrega-
tion, so does the optimal trim. As a result, implement#ation of these techniques for the
production of a core inflation index will depend critically on the exact, dataset llsed.

each tail of the price change distribution. Even at, relatively low frequencies, some amount of trimming
of the price change distribution seems warranted. For cxamplc, using a 6-month componcrlt price changr
and a 6-month avcragc of the trimmed estimators, the minimum RMSE estimator of the CPI trend is
obtained by trimming 55% from each tail of the price change distribution. These alternative smoothing
techniques address a somewhat different question from the one posed in this paper: How much new
information dots a monthly price report contain? Wc leave the investigation of this important area for
future rcscarch.

5.3 Changes in the Benchmark

   As we noted at the outset of the previous section, in order to assess efficiency, we must
specify a goal: What is it we would ideally like to measure? Our second robustness check
involves deviating from the thirty-six month centered moving average as the benchmark.
   Table 3 reports optimal trims as a function of the length of the moving average
specified for the benchmark, similar to those in Sections 4 and 5.1 for the opt,imal trim.
Included are the optimal trims using the Monte Carlo methods, as well as those for the
historical data. The table also reports an informal confidence interval construct,ed as the
set of trims with RMSE or MAD within five percent, of the minimum. For example, using
the historical data in the case of the 36 components CPI data and the thirty-six month
centered moving average benchmark, the minimum RMSE of 1.93 occurs at, a trim of 9%
(see Table 2). Th eI fourth line in the first bottom panel of Table 3 reports that, all of the
trims between 5% and 48% have an RMSE below 1.93*l.05=2.03.i4
    Several patterns emerge from these results. First, the ‘point estimate’ of the optimal
trim does not vary as we change the benchmark. But the approximate confidence intervals

  14Note that thcrc is n o reason for the approximate confidenc~c intervals to be either symrr~ctrical or
continuous. Tllc ones reported in Table 3 all happen to be continuous.

Numbers in parentheses are trims with RMSE or MAD within 5% of the value at the minimum. Monte Carlo experiments

use 10,000 replications.

have a tendency to grow as the degree of the moving average increases. Second, for the
PPI, there is little difference bet,ween the ‘optimal trim’ and the median. In all cases but
one, the RMSE and MAD of the median are well wit,hin the 5% st,andard. Finally, for
CPI at both levels of aggregation there is a large benefit, to trimming a small amount.


5.4 Variations in the Sample Period

    Next, we examine the sensitivity of the results to the sample period. This is analogous
to asking whether the underlying distributional characteristics of the data are st,able. To
do t,his, we perform a series of Mont,e Carlo experiments comparable to those in Section 4,
but, instead of using the full sample from which to draw, we use rolling t,en year samples.
For example, in the case of the CPI we compute the optimal trim based on dat,a from
1967 to 1976, then from 1968 to 1977, moving forward twelve months at a time.
   Figures 10 and 11 report the results of these experiments. Each figure has a horizontal
line at the optimal trim calculated using the full sample, together with a second line
plot,ting the optimal trim based on each of the ten year samples. The horizontal axis
shows the final date of the sample. To give some sense of precision, the X’s in t#he figures
represent the approximate confidence intervals construct,ed as all of the t,rims such t,hat

                                             22

                  Efficiency of Trimmed Estimators, Changing Sample




the criterion, RMSE or MAD, is within 5 percent of the minimum.
   The RMSE and MAD of the optimal full-sample trim are nearly always within 5
percent, of the minimum value for the 10 year sub-samples. In fact, for the CPI, using
the mean absolute deviation (MAD) criteria, the optimal trim is never outside of this
rough confidence bound. For the PPI, there are thirty-six 10 year sub-periods. Using the
RMSE criteria, the optimal full sample trim of 40 percent is within the confidence band
in 33 of the 36 cases.


5.5 Summary and Comparisons

   Given that the “CPI excluding food and energy” is the measure of core inflation in
common use, it is useful to compare this measure of core inflation to ours. We do t,his is
two ways. First, we ask which components we are trimming. And second, we look at a
closer comparison of various candidate measures based on the RMSE criteria used above.
   Table 4 examines which components we are trimming. For each month, we counted the
frequency at which some portion of the weight of each component, was trimmed using the
optimal trim - 9% for the CPI and 40% for the PPI. We also note which components are
systematically excluded by the ‘ex food and energy’ measures (highlighted in bold-faced

type). The results show that we often trim some of the food and energy prices. Indeed,
for the CPI, food and energy components are trimmed from the efficient estimator nearly
40% of the time - nearly one and one-half times as frequently as the average component,.
Still, some food and energy goods, notably food away from home, appear to provide an
efficient, signal of core inflation as we define it, here. In fact, of the 36 CPI components
considered, food away from home was the least likely to be trimmed. Moreover, many
non-food, non-energy goods appear to provide little information about t,he economy’s
inflation trend. Notable among these are used cars and infant, and t,oddler apparel t,hat
are likely to be trimmed out, of the efficient estimator nearly twice as frequently as the
average good (the average component is trimmed out of the 9% trimmed mean in 27%
of the months in the sample).
   The components most likely to be included in the calculation of t,he efficient CPI
estimator include a wide variety of services and the shelter component, which, despite its
hugh average relative importance of 25.24, is likely t#o be on one of the trimmed tails of
the price change distribution only about 13% of the time.
    Similarly for the PPI, food and energy goods tend to be trimmed from the efficient,
estimator a disproportionately large share of the time. But, some food component,s, such
as beverages and beverage materials and miscellaneous processed foods, are t,rimmed at
the same frequency as the average component. The least frequently trimmed component,
metalworking machinery and equipment, is still trimmed about, two-thirds of t,he time.
This is a relatively low proportion when one considers that, for any given month, 80% of
the price change distribution is trimmed to produce an efficient estimat,or for PPI core
inflation.
    Finally, in Figure 12 we plot the ratio of the RMSE of various measures to the RMSE
of the CPI-U and PPI themselves over different, sample periods. For example, for the
ten-year period ending July 1995, the RMSE for the CPI ‘ex food and energy’ was 57.8%
than of the CPI-U itself - about the same as t,hat of the median. But, the RMSE of the
9% trim was 42.5% of the RMSE of the CPI-U. The main result, is t,hat, for the CPI, the
9% trim is always more efficient that t#he CPI excluding food and energy. But, for the
optimally trimmed PPI and the PPI ‘ex food and energy’ are very close.

6 Conclusion

   In this paper we challenge the conventional wisdom that core inflation can be mea-
sured by simply excluding food and energy from monthly price data. We show that,
price change distributions are highly leptokurtic, or ‘fat-t,ailed,’ and so commonly used
measures, such as t,he sample-mean, are inefficient, estimators of the populat,ion mean of
interest. We demonstrate that trimmed-mean estimators significantly improve the effi-
ciency of inflation estimates. Furthermore, we are able to show that as the kurtosis of
the distribution increases, efficiency dictates trimming an increasing percentage of the
sample.
   We proceed to apply these insights to inflation data. For consumer prices beginning
in 1967, we find that trimming 9% from each tail of the cross-sectional price-change
distribution produces the minimum root-mean-square error and minimum mean-absolute
deviation estimate of monthly inflation. This estimator provides efficiency improvements
on the order of 23 percent relative to the mean. By contra&, the CPI excluding food
and energy provides virtually no efficiency improvement at all.
   More disaggregated data amplify the difficulties, as the kurtosis of the distributions



                                            27
increases. Moving from a dataset composed of 36 components of the CPI to one with
185 components beginning in 1978, we show that the optimal trim nearly doubles to
16%. Here we find an efficiency gain of nearly 50 percent (although t,he sample period
is substantially shorter).   For producer prices beginning in 1947, where price-change
distributions are more leptokurtic, trimming 40% to 50% from each tail produces t,he
most efficient estimate of monthly aggregate price movements and improves efficiency by
over 40 percent, relative to the mean.
