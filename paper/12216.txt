Measuring and Explaining Management Practices Across Firms and Countries

                                           ABSTRACT

We use an innovative survey tool to collect management practice data from 732 medium sized
manufacturing firms in the US, France, Germany and the UK. These measures of managerial practice
are strongly associated with firm-level productivity, profitability, Tobin’s Q, sales growth and
survival rates. Management practices also display significant cross-country differences with US firms
on average better managed than European firms, and significant within-country differences with a
long tail of extremely badly managed firms. We find that poor management practices are more
prevalent when (a) product market competition is weak and/or when (b) family-owned firms pass
management control down to the eldest sons (primo geniture). European firms report lower levels
of competition, while French and British firms also report substantially higher levels of primo
geniture due to the influence of Norman legal origin and generous estate duty for family firms. We
calculate that product market competition and family firms account for about half of the long tail of
badly managed firms and up to two thirds of the American advantage over Europe in management
practices.

Economists have long speculated on why such astounding differences in the productivity performance

exist between firms and plants within countries, even within narrowly defined sectors. For example,

labor productivity varies dramatically even with the same five digit industry and these differences are

often highly persistent over time1.



The focus of much applied economic research has been in “chipping away” at these productivity

differences through better measures of inputs (capital, materials, skills, etc.). Some parts of the

literature have attempted to see how much of the residual can be accounted for by explicit measures of

technology such as Research and Development or Information and Communication Technologies2.

But technology is only one part of the story and a substantial unexplained productivity differential still

remains, which panel data econometricians often label as the fixed effects of “managerial quality”

(e.g. Mundlak, 1961).



While the popular press and Business Schools have long-stressed the importance of good

management, empirical economists had relatively little to say about management practices. A major

problem has been the absence of high quality data that is measured in a consistent way across

countries and firms. One of the purposes of this paper is to present a survey instrument for the

measurement of managerial practices. We collect original data using this survey instrument on a

sample of 732 medium sized manufacturing firms in the US, UK, France and Germany.

                                                       3
We start by evaluating the quality of this survey data. We first conduct internal validation by re-

surveying firms to interview different managers in different plants using different interviewers in the

same firms, and find a strong correlation between these two independently collected measures. We

then conduct external validation by matching the data with information on firm accounts and stock

market values to investigate the association between our measure of managerial practices and firm

performance. We find that “better” management practices are significantly associated with higher

productivity, profitability, Tobin’s Q, sales growth rates and firm-survival rates. This is true in both

our English-speaking countries (the UK and the US) and the Continental European countries (France

and Germany), which suggests that our characterization of “good” management is not specific to

Anglo-Saxon cultures.



We then turn to analyzing the raw survey data and observe a surprisingly large spread in management

practices across firms (see Figure 1). Most notably, we see a large number of firms who appear to be

extremely badly managed with ineffective monitoring, targets and incentives. We also observe

significant variations in management practices across our sample of countries, with US firms on

average better managed than European firms.



                                     [FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]



This raises an important question – what could rationalize such variations in management practices?

We start by considering two pure classes of theories: the “optimal choice of management practices”

whereby management practices are a choice variable determined by the firm; and the “managerial



                                                   4
inefficiency” model whereby management simply reflects differences in efficiency with “worse”

management practices predicted to be associated with lower profitability. We find some evidence for

both models.



We then investigate what determines the variation in these management practices across firms and

countries. The two factors that appear to play an important role are product market competition and

family firms. First, higher levels of competition (measured using a variety of different proxies such as

trade openness) are strongly and robustly associated with better management practices. This

competition effect could arise through a number of channels, including the more rapid exit of badly

managed firms and/or the inducement of greater managerial effort.3 Secondly, family-owned firms in

which the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is chosen by primo geniture (the eldest male child) tend to

be very badly managed. Family ownership could have beneficial effects from the concentration of

ownership as this may overcome some of the principal-agent problems associated with dispersed

ownership. In our data, we find family ownership combined with professional management (i.e. where

the CEO is not a family member) has a mildly positive association with good managerial practices.

The impact of family ownership and management is more ambiguous, however, with positive effects

from reducing the principal-agent problem but negative effects due to more limited selection into

managerial positions as well as the “Carnegie effect”.4 We find that companies who select the CEO

from all family members are no worse managed than other firms, but those who select the CEO based

on primo geniture are very poorly managed.


3
  Other possible mechanisms include the learning effect, whereby higher competition involving more firms within the
same industry allows firms to learn superior management practices more quickly.
4
  The “Carnegie effect” is named after the great philanthropist Andrew Carnegie who claimed, “The parent who leaves his
son enormous wealth generally deadens the talents and energies of the son, and tempts him to lead a less useful and less
worthy life than he otherwise would”. See also Holtz-Eakin et al. (1993).



                                                           5
The impact of competition and family firms is quantitatively important. Low competition and primo

geniture family firms account for about half of the tail of poorly performing firms. Across countries

competition and family firms also play a large role, accounting for as much as two- thirds of the gap

in management practices between the US and France and one third of the gap between the US and the

UK. One reason is that European competition levels are lower than in the US. Another reason is that

primo geniture is much more common in France and the UK due to their Norman heritage, in which

primo geniture was legally enforced to preserve concentrated land-holdings for military support. More

recently, Britain and other European countries have also provided generous estate tax exemptions for

family firms.



Our work relates to a number of strands in the literature. First, our findings are consistent with recent

econometric work looking at the importance of product market competition in increasing

productivity.5 It has often been speculated that these productivity-enhancing effects of competition

work through improving average management practices and our study provides support for this view.

Second, economic historians such as Landes (1969) and Chandler (1994) have claimed that the

relative industrial decline of the UK and France in the early Twentieth Century was driven by their

emphasis on family management, compared to the German and American approach of employing

professional managers.6 Our results suggest this phenomenon is still important almost a century later.

A third related strand is the work on the impact of Human Resource Management (HRM)7 that also

finds that these management practices are linked to firm performance. Finally, there is the recent

contribution of Bertrand and Schoar (2003), who focus on the impact of changing CEOs and CFOs in

very large quoted US firms. This will tend to reflect the impact of management styles and strategies,

complementing our work emphasizing the practices of middle management.8 We see management

practices as more than the attributes of the top managers: they are part of the organizational structure

and behavior of the firm, typically evolving slowly over time even as CEOs and CFOs come and go.



The layout of the paper is as follows. Section II discussed why management practices could vary,

section III discusses measuring management practices the management data, and section IV details the

empirical model and the results. In section V, we discuss the distribution of management practices and

offer evidence on the causes for the variations in management. In section VI, we pull this all together

to try to explain management practices across firms and countries. Finally, some concluding

comments are offered in section VII. More details of the data, models and results can be found in the

Appendices.




                   II. MODELS OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

We consider two classes of theories of why good management practices will vary across firms. We

will later show evidence that both appear important, but consider the pure form of each theory to

generate clear predictions we can take to the data. We characterize the first set of models as the

“optimal choice of management practices” and the second set of models as “managerial inefficiency”.


8
  In a sub-sample of 59 companies we piloted questions on the hierarchical structure of the firm and found the average
number of levels to the shop floor was 5.03 for the CEO versus 2.78 for the plant managers (our target management group)
placing them centrally within the organization.



                                                           7
IIA. Optimal choice of management practices

A conventional economic approach is to consider management as a choice variable for the firm.

Improving management practices may be a costly activity and the firm will weigh these costs against

the future expected benefits. There is nothing inefficient about “worse” management practices: firms

have simply chosen the optimal level. For example, middle managers may prefer to trade-off lower

levels of effort and monitoring by the corporate head quarters in return for a lower compensation

package. This perspective covers a large range of models from those where firms can perfectly control

managerial inputs just as surely as any other factor of production to models where firms can influence

managerial effort indirectly through contract choice.



Consider a basic parameterization of this type of model. Define M as an indicator of overall

management practices which is an increasing function of two individual practices, M = h(M1,M2),

where M1 and M2 could be thought of respectively as human capital management (performance based

promotions etc.) and fixed capital management (shop floor operations etc.). For simplicity we ignore

all other factors of production. We then write the production function in the following CES form:

                                                                          σ
                                              σ −1                σ −1
                                      (B1 M )        + (B 2 M    )
                                                                         σ −1
                                 Y=         1
                                               σ                2
                                                                   σ                                 (1)


where   is the elasticity of substitution is (which we assume is greater than unity) and B1 >0 and

B2 >0 are parameters. Profits are written as:

                            Π = PY − W 'X − ρ 1 M 1 − ρ 2 M 2                                        (2)




                                                       8
where P is the price of output, W is the unit cost vector for inputs X and ρ j is the unit cost of

managerial practice M j .



The first order conditions for management practice j are then

                                                                         ρj
                         ln M j = (σ − 1) ln(ϕ ( X ) ) + ln(Y ) − σ ln        + (σ − 1) ln B j        (3)
                                                                         P

From (3) we can see that each individual practice is also decreasing in the cost of the practice and

increasing in the technological parameter ( B j ). Combining the first order conditions for the two types

of management practices gives the relative demand for management practices:

                             M1         ρ              B
                        ln      = −σ ln 1 + (σ − 1) ln 1                                              (4)
                             M2        ρ2             B2

Unsurprisingly, the relative demand for the practices is decreasing in the relative costs and increasing

in the relative benefits. Prices and technologies of the management practices are not observable but

are likely to be systematically different by industry. For example, if M 1 represents a human capital

focused practices and M 2 represents a fixed capital practices we would expect B1/B2 to be larger in

the more highly skilled sectors. This is something that we examine empirically correlating the relative

use of different types of management practices with proxies for the relative importance of skills.



II.B Managerial inefficiency

An alternative view of the variation in management practices is that it simply reflects differences in

efficiency. A representation of this process is that there are exogenous differences in management

quality between firms and these are not openly traded on markets – examples include Lucas (1978)




                                                       9
and Mundlak’s (1961) fixed effects. In this set-up, we could consider a production function of the

form:

                                           Y = A( M ) F ( X )                                           (5)

where A(M) represents total factor productivity which is increasing in management and the X are a

vector of conventional inputs such as labour, capital and materials with F(.) is increasing in X. As

with the previous model, an obvious empirical implication of (5) is the productivity is increasing in

the quality of management practices.



The associated profits are:

                                    Π = PA( M ) F ( X ) − W 'X                                          (6)

A possible distinction between the two pure forms of the models is the relationship between

management practices and profits: if poor management were purely an optimal choice with no

exogenous efficiency differences between firms, then badly managed firms should be no less

profitable than well-managed firms. If instead poor management causes lower efficiency (A), then

better management should be associated with higher profitability. Accounting profits may differ from

true economic profits, however, so we also consider the relationship between stock market values and

management. In a dynamic setting, under the managerial efficiency view firms with bad management

should also be more likely to exit the market and to grow more slowly. We also examine these

predictions, paying attention to the issue of the endogeneity.




                                                    10
II.C Management and Product Market Competition

Both optimal choice and efficiency models also have implications for the relationship between

product market competition and management.



The most obvious effect of competition on management is through a Darwinian selection process in

the “management inefficiency” model. Higher product market competition will drive inefficient firms

out of the market and allocate greater market share to the more efficient firms. Syverson (2004a,b)

focuses on productivity and offers supportive evidence of these predictions in his analysis of the US

cement industry, finding that tougher competition is associated with a higher average level of

productivity with a lower dispersion of productivity as the less efficient tail of firms have been

selected out.9 Therefore, we expect a better average level and more compressed spread of

management practices in environments that are more competitive.



Natural variation in management practices will arise in equilibrium if entrepreneurs found firms with

distinctive cultures that are deeply embedded and hard to change. They do not know exactly how well

their firm will perform until they enter a market and compete with other firms. Over time, they learn

about the quality and suitability of their management practices and decide whether to continue

operating in the market (Jovanovic, 1982). A more general model would allow best management

practice to be stochastically evolving over time with firms continually innovating, generating a spread

even across long-lived incumbents (e.g. Klette and Kortum, 2004).




9
 An alternative specification is perfect competition between incumbents within markets but a fixed cost of entry, such at
Hopenhayn (1992). In his specification lower costs of entry also supports a higher average level and a lower dispersion of
productivity.



                                                           11
Under the “optimal choice” approach there are models where higher competition could increase the

incentives to provide greater managerial effort (or higher investments in quality). This could be done

in a simple Bertrand differentiated product model to show some of the forces at play. Firms choose

contracts with managers after they have entered the market, but before their marginal costs are

revealed. Marginal costs are an outcome of managers’ (unobservable) efforts and a cost shock.

“Investing in managerial effort” is essentially choosing a higher-powered incentive contract that will

elicit more effort (better managerial practices) but at the cost of giving away more of the firm’s profits

to the manager. For a given number of firms an increase in competition has an ambiguous effect on

managerial effort. On the one hand, higher competition should increase firm incentives to promote

managerial effort because any unit cost reduction will have a larger effect on market share. On the

other hand, rents are lower when competition is higher, so the profit increase from any increase in

market share is less valuable. However, when we allow entry to be endogenous there is fall in the

number of firms who choose to enter the market because profits are lower. In a free entry long-run

equilibrium firms will be larger on average. This means they have a greater desire to cut marginal

costs through higher managerial effort. In the context of this type of model (which follows Raith,

2003), allowing for endogenous market structure an increase in product market competition

unambiguously increases management effort10.



The result that increased product market competition should improve incentives for managerial

practices are reasonably robust, but not completely general. Vives (2005) shows that providing the

market for varieties does not shrink the result goes through under the Bertrand competition for a wide
10
  Schmidt (1997) allows bankruptcy costs in a principal agent model with Cournot competition. With risk neutrality, but a
wealth-constrained manager the fear of bankruptcy will increase the incentive of the manager to supply effort.
Nevertheless, the rent reducing effect of competition will still exist and this could be large enough to completely offset the
fear of bankruptcy. It is allowing the endogeneity of entry that makes a substantial difference to the comparative statics.



                                                             12
number of assumptions over the form of consumer utility. The conditions for Cournot are more

exacting, but will hold so long as output reaction functions are downward sloping, which is the

standard case.



The empirical prediction that we take to the data is that tougher competition should clearly be related

to better management in the managerial inefficiency model. The relationship is more ambiguous in

some optimal choice models, but is also likely to be positive.



II.D Family ownership and family management

The managerial inefficiency model has implications for the relationship between management and

family firms, since these provide a potential rationale for the continued existence of badly managed

firms. Family ownership can shield inefficient firms from competition if the owners are prepared to

accept a below market rate of return to capital because of the amenity value attached to having the

family’s name associated with the company.



There has been much recent work on the efficiency of family firms. Family firms are the typical form

of ownership and management in the developing world and much of the developed world11. As Table

1 shows in our sample of medium-sized manufacturing firms (see section III for details) family

involvement is common. In around thirty per cent of European firms and ten per cent of American

firms the largest shareholding block is a family (defined as the second generation or beyond from the

company’s founder). This is similar in broad magnitude to the findings of La Porta et al. (1999), who

report about forty per cent of medium sized firms were family-owned in Europe and about ten per cent

11
     La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer (1999) and Morck, Wolfenzon and Yeung (2005).



                                                           13
were family-owned in the US.12 Interestingly, we see in the second row that many of these firms have

a family member as CEO, suggesting families are reluctant to let professional managers run their

firms. In the third row, we see in the UK and France around two thirds of these CEOs are chosen by

primo geniture (succession to the eldest son) representing around fifteen per cent of the total sample.

In Germany and the US this only occurs in about one third of the family firms representing only three

per cent of the sample. In rows 4 and 5, we look at founder firms – those companies where the largest

current shareholder is the individual who founded the firm. We see that founder firms are also

common in the UK and France, as well as in the US, although much less so in Germany.



                                             [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]



One rationale for these differences in types of family involvement across countries is the historical

traditions of Feudalism, particularly in the Norman societies of the UK and France. This appears to

have persisted long after the Norman kingdoms collapsed, with primo geniture obligatory under

English law until the Statute of Wills of 1540 and de facto in France until the introduction of the

Napoleonic code in the early 1800s.13 German traditions were based more on the Teutonic principle of

gavelkind (equal division amongst all sons); while in the US, primo geniture was abolished after the

Revolution with equal treatment by birth order and gender by the middle of the 20th century (Menchik,



12
   La Porta et al. (1999) define family “ownership” as controlling 20% or more of the equity, “medium sized” as those
with common equity of just above $500m; and “family” as including founder owned firms. Including “founder” firms in
our definition would increase “family” ownership to about 45% in Europe and 25% in the US, higher then their numbers,
although our “medium sized” firms are smaller. The main points to note is that family firms are common in the OECD,
particularly so in Continental Europe.
13
   While Napoleonic inheritance code enforced the equal division of property, it was more flexible with companies. In fact,
a common route to pass property on to a single heir in France is to place this within a company. In England primo geniture
is also still common, with for example, the 2005 Oxford English Dictionary stating that it is “still prevailing in most places
in a modified form”.



                                                             14
1980). A second potential rationale for these differences is the structure of estate taxation, which for a

typical medium sized firm worth $10m or more, contains no substantial family firm exemptions in the

US, but gives about a 33%, 50% and 100% exemption in France, Germany and the UK respectively.14



The theoretical implications of family ownership depend on the extent of involvement in

management. Family ownership per se may have advantages over dispersed ownership because the

(concentrated) ownership structure may lead to closer monitoring of managers (e.g. Berle and Means,

1932)15. Under imperfect capital markets, founders will find it difficult to sell off the firm to outside

investors (Caselli and Gennaioli, 2002). Furthermore, when minority investor rights are not well

protected, it may be difficult to diversify ownership.



Even though a firm is family owned, outside professional managers can be appointed to run the firm

as is common in the US and Germany. Combining family ownership with family management has

several potential costs. Selecting managers from among the pool of family members will lower the

average human capital of the managerial cadre, as there is less competition for senior positions.

Furthermore, the knowledge that family members will receive management positions in future may

generate a “Carnegie effect” of reducing their investment in human capital earlier in life. These

selection and Carnegie effects are likely to be much more negative for primo geniture family firms in

which the eldest son is destined to control the firm from birth. On the other hand, principal-agent

   For political economy reasons these generous estate taxes could have arisen endogenously from the power blocs of
politically connected family firms. Of course, estate tax can be reduced by tax planning, but this usually involves advanced
planning, financial costs and some loss of control.
15
   Bennedsen et al. (2005) list a range of additional potential benefits (and costs) of family ownership, although these are
likely to be less important than those discussed in the main text. The benefits include working harder due to higher levels
of shame from failure, trust and loyalty of key stakeholders, and business knowledge from having grown up close to the
firm. The costs include potential conflicts between business norms and family traditions.

problems may be mitigated from combining ownership and control. There may also be investment in

firm-specific human capital if the owners’ children expect to inherit the family firm. So ultimately, the

impact of family firms on management practices is an empirical matter.



Of course, family-owned firms should have strong incentives to optimally balance off these factors

before deciding on using family or external managers. However, family-owned firms may choose

family management even though this is sub-optimal for company performance because family

members receive “amenity potential” from managing the family firm, which often bears the family

name and has been managed by several previous generations (Bukhart et al, 1998). In this case, the

family may accept lower economic returns from their management in return for the private utility of

managerial control. Indeed, the desire to retain family management may also be a reason for the

refusal of family owners to sell equity stakes in the company to outsiders.



The evidence on inherited family firms suggests that family ownership has a mixed effect on firm

profitability, but family management has a substantially negative effect16. Our approach in this paper

is to examine directly the impact of family firms on management practices rather than only look at

firm performance measures. Although there may be some endogeneity problems with the family firms

“effect” on management, these selection effects seem to cause OLS estimates to underestimate the

damage of family involvement in management. This is because empirically family firms are more




16
     See for example Perez-Gonzalez (2005), and Villalonga and Amit (2005).



                                                           16
likely to involve professional managers when the firm has suffered a negative shock (see Bennedsen

et al. 2005).17



Family firms can account for why “exogenously inefficient” firms can persist even in competitive

markets: family owners are prepared to take a below market return on capital because of the amenity

value of having the family name attached to the company. It is hard to understand why there should be

any systematic relationship between family firms and managerial practices under the pure “optimal

choice” model.18




                  III. MEASURING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

To investigate these issues we first have to construct a robust measure of management practices

overcoming three hurdles: scoring management practices, collecting accurate responses, and obtaining

interviews with managers. We discuss these issues in turn.



III.A Scoring Management Practices

To measure management requires codifying the concept of “good” and “bad” management into a

measure applicable to different firms across the manufacturing sector. This is a hard task as good

management is tough to define, and is often contingent on a firm’s environment. Our initial hypothesis

17
   Bennedsen et al (2005) construct a dataset of 6,000 Danish firms, including information on the gender of the first born
child, which they use to instrumental firms remaining under family management after a succession.
18
   One version of the optimal choice hypothesis is that firms could offer contracts with lower wages and worse
management (e.g. less risk of firing, lower effort). This compensating differential would vary depending on the firm’s
technology and environment. Possibly, primo geniture firms may prefer offering these types of contracts, although it is
hard to see why firms in the same industry, same size and age would differ dramatically in this respect purely because of
their family status.




                                                           17
was that while some management practices are too contingent to be evaluated as “good” to “bad”,

others can potentially be defined in these terms, and it is these practices we tried to focus on in the

survey.



To do this we used a practice evaluation tool developed by a leading international management

consultancy firm. In order to prevent any perception of bias with our study we chose to receive no

financial support from this firm.



The practice evaluation tool defines and scores from one (worst practice) to five (best practice) across

eighteen key management practices used by industrial firms. In Appendix A (Table A1) we detail the

practices and the questions in the same order as they appeared in the survey, describe the scoring

system and provide three anonymous responses per question. These practices can be grouped into four

areas: operations (3 practices), monitoring (5 practices), targets (5 practices) and incentives (5

practices). The operations management section focuses on the introduction of lean manufacturing

techniques, the documentation of processes improvements and the rationale behind introductions of

improvements. The monitoring section focuses on the tracking of performance of individuals,

reviewing performance (e.g. through regular appraisals and job plans), and consequence management

(e.g. making sure that plans are kept and appropriate sanctions and rewards are in place). The targets

section examines the type of targets (whether goals are simply financial or operational or more

holistic), the realism of the targets (stretching, unrealistic or non-binding), the transparency of targets

(simple or complex) and the range and interconnection of targets (e.g. whether they are given

consistently throughout the organization). Finally, the incentives section includes promotion criteria

(e.g. purely tenure based or including an element linked to individual performance), pay and bonuses,



                                                    18
and fixing or firing bad performers, where best practice is deemed the approach that gives strong

rewards for those with both ability and effort. A subset of the practices has similarities with those used

in studies on HRM practices.



Since the scaling may vary across practices in the econometric estimation, we convert the scores

(from the 1 to 5 scale) to z-scores by normalizing by practice to mean zero and standard deviation one.

In our main econometric specifications, we take the unweighted average across all z-scores as our

primary measure of overall managerial practice, but we also experiment with other weightings

schemes based on factor analytic approaches.



There is scope for legitimate disagreement over whether all of these measures really constitute “good

practice”. Therefore, an important way to examine the externality validity of the measures is to

examine whether they are correlated with data on firm performance constructed from company

accounts and the stock market. We also examine whether the relationship between management

practices and productivity is weaker in the Continental European nations to check for any “Anglo-

Saxon” bias in our management scores.



III.B Collecting Accurate Responses

With this evaluation tool we can, in principle, provide some quantification of firms’ management

practices. However, an important issue is the extent to which we can obtain unbiased responses to our

questions from firms. In particular, will respondents provide accurate responses? As is well known in

the surveying literature (see, for example, Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001) a respondent’s answer to

survey questions is typically biased by the scoring grid, anchored towards those answers that they



                                                   19
expect the interviewer thinks is “correct”. In addition, interviewers may themselves have pre-

conceptions about the performance of the firms they are interviewing and bias their scores based on

their ex-ante perceptions. More generally, a range of background characteristics, potentially correlated

with good and bad managers, may generate some kinds of systematic bias in the survey data.



To try to address these issues we took a range of steps to obtain accurate data when we administered

the survey in the summer of 2004.



First, the survey was conducted by telephone without telling the managers they were being scored.19

This enabled scoring to be based on the interviewer’s evaluation of the firm’s actual practices, rather

than their aspirations, the manager’s perceptions or the interviewer’s impressions.20 To run this

“blind” scoring we used open questions (i.e. “can you tell me how you promote your employees”),

rather than closed questions (i.e. “do you promote your employees on tenure [yes/no]?”). These

questions target actual practices and examples, with the discussion continuing until the interviewer

can make an accurate assessment of the firm’s typical practices. For each dimension, the first question

is broad with detailed follow-up questions to fine-tune the scoring. For example, in dimension (1)

Modern manufacturing introduction the initial question is “Can you tell me about your manufacturing

process” and is followed up by questions like “How do you manage your inventory levels”.21




19
    This survey tool has been passed by Stanford’s Human Subjects Committee. The deception involved was deemed
acceptable because it is: (i) necessary to get unbiased responses; (ii) minimized to the management practice questions and
is temporary (we send managers debriefing packs afterwards); and (iii) presents no risk as the data is confidential.
20
   If an interviewer could not score a question it was left blank, with the firm average taken over the remaining questions.
The average number of un-scored questions per firm was 1.3%, with no firm included in the sample if more than three
questions were un-scored.
21
   Minimizing inventory levels is one of the key components of modern manufacturing.



                                                            20
Second, the interviewers did not know anything about the firm’s financial information or performance

in advance of the interview. This was achieved by selecting medium sized manufacturing firms and by

providing only firm names and contact details to the interviewers (but no financial details). These

smaller firms (the median size was 700 employees) would not be known by name and are rarely

reported in the business media. The interviewers were specially trained graduate students from top

European and US business schools, with a median age of twenty-eight and five years prior business

experience in the manufacturing sector22. All interviews were conducted in the manager’s native

language.



Third, each interviewer ran over 50 interviews on average, allowing us to remove interviewer fixed

effects from all empirical specifications. This helps to address concerns over inconsistent

interpretation of categorical responses (see Manski, 2004), standardizing the scoring system.



Fourth, the survey instrument was targeted at plant managers, who are typically senior enough to have

an overview of management practices but not so senior as to be detached from day-to-day operations

of the enterprise.



Fifth, we collected a detailed set of information on the interview process itself (number and type of

prior contacts before obtaining the interviews, duration, local time-of-day, date and day-of-the week),

on the manager (gender, seniority, nationality, company and job tenure, internal and external

employment experience, and location), and on the interviewer (we can include individual interviewer-

fixed effects, time-of-day and subjective reliability score). Some of these survey controls are

significantly informative about the management score (see Appendix C and Table C1)23, and when we

use these as controls for interview noise in our econometric evaluations the coefficient on the

management score typically increased.



III.C Obtaining Interviews with Managers

The interview process took about fifty minutes on average, and was run from the London School of

Economics. Overall, we obtained a relatively high response rate of 54%, which was achieved through

four steps. First, the interview was introduced as “a piece of work”24 without discussion of the firm’s

financial position or its company accounts, making it relatively uncontroversial for managers to

participate. Interviewers did not discuss financials in the interviews, both to maximize the

participation of firms and to ensure our interviewers were truly “blind” on the firm’s financial

position. Second, questions were ordered to lead with the least controversial (shop-floor operations

management) and finish with the most controversial (pay, promotions and firings). Third,

interviewers’ performance was monitored, as was the proportion of interviews achieved, so they were

persistent in chasing firms (the median number of contacts each interviewer made in setting up the

interview was 6.4). The questions are also about practices within the firm so any plant managers can

respond, so there are potentially several managers per firm who could be contacted25. Fourth, the



23
   In particular, we found the scores were significantly higher for senior managers, when interviews were conducted later
in the week and/or earlier in the day. That is to say, scores were highest, on average, for senior managers on a Friday
morning and lowest for junior managers on a Monday afternoon. By including information on these characteristics in our
analysis, we explicitly controlled for these types of interview bias.
24
   Words like “survey” or “research” should be avoided as these are used by switchboards to block market research calls.
25
    We found no significant correlation between the number, type and time-span of contacts before an interview is
conducted and the management score. This suggests while different managers may respond differently to the interview
proposition this does not appear to be directly correlated with their responses or the average management practices of the
firm.



                                                           22
written endorsement of the Bundesbank (in Germany) and the Treasury (in the UK), and a scheduled

presentation to the Banque de France, helped demonstrate to managers this was an important exercise

with official support.



III.D Sampling Frame and Additional Data

Since our aim is to compare across countries we decided to focus on the manufacturing sector where

productivity is easier to measure than in the non-manufacturing sector. We also focused on medium

sized firms selecting a sample where employment ranged between 50 and 10,000 workers (with a

median of 700). Very small firms have little publicly available data. Very large firms are likely to be

more heterogeneous across plants, and so it would be more difficult to get a picture of managerial

performance in the firm as a whole from one or two plant interviews. We drew a sampling frame from

each country to be representative of medium sized manufacturing firms and then randomly chose the

order of which firms to contact (see Appendix B for details). We also excluded any clients of our

partnering consultancy firm from our sampling frame26.



In addition to the standard information on management practices, we also ran two other surveys. First,

we collected information from a separate telephone survey on the Human Resource department on the

average characteristics of workers and managers in the firm such as gender, age, proportion with a

college degree, average hours, holidays, sickness, occupational breakdown and a range of questions

on the organizational structure of the firm and the work-life balance. The details of this questionnaire

are provided in Appendix A3. Second, we collected information from public data sources and another

telephone survey in summer 2005 on family ownership, management and succession procedures,

26
     This removed 33 firms out of our sampling frame of 1,353 firms



                                                            23
typically answered by the CEO or his office. The details of this questionnaire are provided in

Appendix A4.



Quantitative information on firm sales, employment, capital, materials etc. came from the company

accounts and proxy statements, while industry level data came from the OECD. The details are

provided in Appendix B.



Comparing the responding firms with those in the sampling frame, we found no evidence that the

responders were systematically different on any of the performance measures to the non-responders.

They were also statistically similar on all the other observables in our dataset. The only exception was

on size where our firms were slightly larger than average than those in the sampling frame.



III.E Evaluating and Controlling for Measurement Error

The data potentially suffers from several types of measurement error that are likely to bias the

association of firm performance with management towards zero. First, we could have measurement

error in the management practice scores obtained using our survey tool. To quantify this we

performed repeat interviews on 64 firms, contacting different managers in the firm, typically at

different plants, using different interviewers. To the extent that our management measure is truly

picking up general company-wide management practices these two scores should be correlated, while

to the extent the measure is driven by noise the measures should be independent.



Figure 2 plots the average firm level scores from the first interview against the second interviews,

from which we can see they are highly correlated (correlation 0.734 with p-value 0.000). Furthermore,



                                                  24
there is no obvious (or statistically significant) relationship between the degree of measurement error

and the absolute score. That is to say, high and low scores appear to be as well measured as average

scores, and firms that have high (or low) scores on the first interview tend to have high (or low) scores

on the second interview. Thus, firms that score below two or above four appear to be genuinely badly

or well managed rather than extreme draws of sampling measurement error.



                                     [FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]



Analyzing the measurement error in more detail (see Appendix C), we find that the question level

measures are noisier, with 42% of the variation in the scores due to measurement error, compared to

the average firm’s scores with 25% of the variation due to measurement error. This improved signal-

noise ratio in the firm level measure – which is our primary management proxy - is due to the partial

averaging out of measurement errors across questions.



The second type of measurement error concerns the fact that our management practices cover only a

subset of all management practices that drive performance. For example, our interviews did not

contain any questions on management strategy (such as merger and acquisition strategy). However, so

long as firms’ capabilities across all management practices are positively correlated - which they are

significantly within the eighteen practices examined - then our measure based on a subset of practices

will provide a proxy of the firm’s true management capabilities. Again, however, this suggests that the

coefficients we estimate on management in the production function are probably biased towards zero

due to attenuation bias.




                                                   25
     IV. MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND FIRM PERFORMANCE

Before we investigate the reasons for the spread of management practices across firms it is worth

evaluating whether these practices are correlated with firm performance. The purpose of this exercise

is not to directly identify a causal relationship between our management practice measures and firm

performance. It is rather an external validity test of the survey measurement tool to check that the

scores are not just “cheap talk” but are actually correlated with quantitative measures of firm

performance from independent data sources on company accounts, survival rates and market value.



IV.A Econometric Modeling

Consider the basic firm production function

                  yitc = α lc l itc + α kc k itc + α nc nitc + β c M ic + γ c 'z itc + u itc                     (7)

where Y = deflated sales, L = labor, K = capital and N = intermediate inputs (materials) of firm i at

time t in country c (note that we generally allow country specific parameters on the inputs) and lower

case letters denote natural logarithms y = ln(Y), etc. The z’s are a number of other controls that will

affect productivity such as workforce characteristics27 (the proportion of workers with a degree, the

proportion with MBAs and the average hours worked), firm characteristics (firm age, whether the firm

is listed), a complete set of three digit industry dummies and country dummies.



The crucial variable for us is management practices denoted M. Our basic measure takes z-scores of

each of the eighteen individual management questions and then averages over the variables to get M.



27
  We experimented with a wide range of workforce characteristics such as gender, worker age and unionization. We only
found human capital to be statistically significant after controlling for firm characteristics.



                                                                        26
We experimented with a number of other approaches including using the primary factor from factor-

analysis and using the raw average management scores and found very similar results.



The most straightforward approach to estimating equation (7) is to simply run OLS in the cross

section (or on the panel with standard errors clustered by company) and assume that all the correlated

heterogeneity is captured by the control variables. Since we have panel data, however, an alternative

is to implement a two-step method where we estimate the production function in stage one and then

estimate the “permanent” component of total factor productivity (i.e. the fixed effect of TFP). We then

project the permanent component of productivity on the management scores in a separate second step.

This is the approach Black and Lynch (2001) followed in a similar two-step analysis of workplace

practices and productivity. We estimate the production function in a variety of ways. The simplest

method is within groups – i.e. including a full set of firm dummies. We compare this to “System

GMM” (see Blundell and Bond, 2000) approach that also allows for the endogeneity of the time

varying inputs (capital, labor and materials). Finally, we implement the Olley Pakes (1996)

estimator.28 This allows the unobserved firm-specific efficiency effect to follow a first-order Markov

process. Again, using these estimates of the production function parameters we construct firm specific

efficiency/TFP measures that we then relate in a second stage to management practices and other time

invariant firm characteristics.

IV.B Econometric Results

Table 2 investigates the association between firm performance and management practices. Column (1)

simply reports a levels OLS specification including only labor, country and time dummies as

additional controls. The management score is strongly positively and significantly associated with

higher labor productivity. The second column includes capital and materials, and this almost halves

the management coefficient29. In column (3), we include our general controls of industry dummies,

average hours worked, education, firm age, and listing status. This reduces the management

coefficient slightly more, but it remains significant. Finally, in column (4) we include a set of

interview “noise controls” to mitigate biases across interviewers and types of interviewees.30 This

actually increases the management coefficient, as we would expect if we were stripping out some of

the measurement error in the management score. Overall, the first four columns suggest that the

average management score is positively and significantly correlated with total factor productivity.



                                            [TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]



In Appendix D, we present more econometrically sophisticated production function estimates based

on the “two step” method discussed above where we recover the long-run component of TFP and

project this on the management score and other covariates.31 We estimate the permanent component

either by within groups, System GMM or Olley-Pakes. The results are as strong, if not stronger, than

29
   If one of the mechanisms through which better management improves productivity is by increasing investment in
capital, we may be being too conservative by conditioning on capital.
30
   In Table C1 in the Appendix, we detail these noise controls with column (1) reporting the results from regressing
management on the full set of noise controls and column (2) the results from regressing management on our selected set of
(informative) noise controls that we use in our main regressions.
31
   The exact number of observations depends on estimation technique. For Olley-Pakes, we need at least one period for
lags and must drop all observations with non-positive values of investment. For System GMM we lose two lags to
construct instruments and include dynamics. We condition on firms having at least four continuous years of data.



                                                           28
those presented here for the simple OLS regressions. Whether estimated by GMM, Olley-Pakes or

within groups, management practices are always positively and significantly associated with the

longer run component of TFP.



We were concerned that the definition of “good management” may be biased towards an Anglo-Saxon

view of the management world. Some may regard such business practices as suitable for the ‘free

markets’ of Britain and America, but less suitable for Continental Europe. We empirically tested this

by including interactions of the management term with country dummies – we could not reject that the

hypothesis that the coefficients on management were equal across countries32.



In addition to the overall management score, we looked at the role that individual questions play. Re-

running column (4) of Table 2 we find that twelve of the question z-scores are individually significant

at the five per cent level, two are individually significant at the 10% level and four appear

insignificant33. The average question-level point estimate is 0.018 – less than half the pooled average

of 0.042 - reflecting the higher question level measurement error (see Appendix C). We also

calculated the average score separately for the four groups of management practices and entered them

one at a time into the production function. The point estimates (standard errors) were as follows:




32
   For example, we generated a dummy for the two Continental European countries and interacting this with the
management score. When entered as an additional variable in the column (4) specification the coefficient was 0.024 with a
standard error of 0.028. In Table D the final two columns split the sample into different regions (Continental Europe and
Anglo-American). We find that the coefficients on management are, if anything, larger in France and Germany than in the
UK or US (although this difference is not statistically significant).
33
   This suggests that not all eighteen of the individual management practices are associated with better performance. We
could of course construct a “refined” management measure by averaging over the individually significant questions, but
this becomes too close to crude data mining.



                                                           29
operations 0.032 (0.011), monitoring 0.025 (0.011), targets 0.033 (0.011) and incentives 0.036

(0.013).34



We also considered whether the management measure was simply proxying for better technology in

the firm. Although technology measures such as Research and Development (R&D) and computer use

are only available for sub-samples of the dataset, we did not find that the management coefficient fell

by very much in the production function when we include explicit measures of technology, as these

are not strongly correlated with good management35.



The final four columns of Table 2 examine four other measures of firm performance. In column (5)

we use an alternative performance measure which is return on capital employed (ROCE), a

profitability measure used by financial analysts and managers to benchmark firm performance (see

Bertrand and Schoar, 2003). The significant and positive coefficient in the ROCE equation, which

also includes the same set of controls as in column (4), confirms the basic productivity results. In

column (6), we estimate a Tobin’s Q specification (the ratio of the market value of the firm to its book

value), which again includes the same set of controls as in the production function. We also find a

significant and positive coefficient on management. In column (7), we estimate the relationship

between exit in the twelve months after the survey and management practices. Over this period, eight


34
   Details of the regressions appear in Appendix Table A2. We also examined specifications with multiple questions or
different groupings, but statistically the simple average was the best representation of the data. Part of the problem is that it
is hard to reliably identify clusters of practices in the presence of measurement error. We show how sub-sets of
management practices vary systematically in sub-section IV.C below.
35
   In the context of the specification in Table 2 column (4) for the 219 firms where we observe PCs per employee the
management coefficient is 0.069 with standard error of 0.041 (the coefficient on PCs was 0.051 with a standard error of
0.024). This compares to a management coefficient of 0.073 with a standard error of 0.042 on the same sample when PCs
are not included. For the sample of 216 firms where we have R&D information the coefficient on management is 0.046
with a standard error of 0.017 in the specification with R&D and 0.050 with a standard error of 0.017 in the specification
without R&D.



                                                              30
firms went bankrupt, for whom the implied marginal effects of management in the probit equation are

large and statistically significant. In column (8), we estimate the relationship between the average

annual growth rate of sales and management practices and find a positive and significant coefficient

on management.



Overall then, there is substantial external validation that the measures of management we use are

positively and significantly associated with better firm performance. Interestingly, the association is

not simply with productivity but also with profitability (and market value, survival and growth). This

would be naturally predicted by the managerial inefficiency model, but is not predicted from the pure

“optimal choice of management model”. We must be cautious in interpreting this as strong positive

support for the former model, however, as Table 2 simply presents associations and there are

endogeneity issues (see sub-section V.E below). Nevertheless, at the very least these results offer

some external validation of the survey tool implying that we are not simply measuring statistical

noise.



IV.C Contingent management

In this sub-section we examine some of the empirical predictions of the “optimal choice” model of

management and produce some supportive evidence. In this model, the importance of different

practices for firm performance will be contingent on a firm’s environment. For example, firms in a

high-skill industry may find good human-capital management practices relatively more important than

those in a low-skill industry36.



36
     See also Athey and Stern (1998)



                                                  31
First, we investigated the impact of the weighting across individual questions through factor analysis.

There appeared to be one dominant factor that loaded heavily on all our questions – which could be

labeled “good management” – which accounted for 49% of the variation37. The only other notable

factor, which accounted for a further 7% of the variation, could be labeled as “human capital relative

to fixed capital”, which had a positive loading on most of the human capital oriented questions and a

negative loading on the fixed capital/operations type questions. This factor was uncorrelated with any

productivity measures, although interestingly it was significantly positively correlated with our skills

measures (e.g. the proportion of employees with college degrees) and the level of organizational

devolvement38, suggesting a slightly different pattern of relative management practices across firms

with different levels of human capital.



We examine this issue more explicitly in Table 3 where we find robust evidence that firms and

industries with higher skills – as proxied by college degrees or average wages – have significantly

better relative human-capital management practices. Column (1) regresses the average score of the

three explicitly human-capital (“HC”) focused questions (13, 17 and 18) on the percentage of

employees with a degree (in logs), and finds a large positive coefficient of 0.220. By comparison,

column (2) runs the same regression but uses the average score of the three most fixed capital (“FC”)

focused questions (1, 2 and 4) as the dependent variable. In this column we also find a significantly

positive association but with a much smaller coefficient of 0.100. Column (3) uses the difference

between the human capital focused and fixed capital focused management practices as the dependent

variable and shows that this measure of “relative intensity of human-capital management practices”
37
   Re-estimating the production functions of Table 2 column (4), we found that this “good management” factor score had a
coefficient of 0.029 with a standard error of 0.009.
38
   In the survey we also collected two questions on organizational structure (see Appendix Table A3) taken from
Bresnahan et al. (2002).



                                                          32
(“HC-FC”) is significantly higher in highly skilled firms. Column (4) includes the general controls

that weaken the correlation but it remains significant at the 10 per cent level. Hence, while higher

skilled firms have better overall management practices, they are particularly good at the most human-

capital focused management practices. Columns (5) to (8) run similar regressions on firm average

wages (rather than college degrees) as a measure of skills. We find a similar pattern of more human-

capital focused management practices in higher waged firms. Finally, column (9) uses a three-digit

industry level measure of skills instead of a firm-specific measure, the proportion of employees with a

college degree in the US. We also find that this is positively correlated with the relative intensity of

human-capital management practices. Overall, this table is consistent with the “optimal choice model

of management practices” in which firms tailor their practices to their competitive environment.



                                            [TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]



IV.D Firm performance-related measurement bias

A criticism of our “external validity” test of looking at production functions is that for psychological

reasons managers will respond “optimistically” in firms who are doing well even if the true state of

management practices is poor39. We call this firm performance-related measurement bias. Note that

this is different from the reverse causality issue that states that management practices genuinely

improve in response to a shock that raises productivity (see section V.E below for a discussion of this

issues and an instrumentation strategy that attempts to deal with it).




39
     We thank Bengt Holmstrom for emphasizing this issue.



                                                            33
There are several considerations mitigating the problem of firm performance-related measurement

bias in our study. First, the survey is deliberately designed to try to avoid this kind of bias by using a

“double-blind” methodology based on open questions, with the managers unaware they are being

scored. So to the extent that managers talk about actual practices in their firms this should help to

reduce this measurement bias.



Second, as we shall show below in section V.B, firms in more competitive industries – defined in

terms of lower historical average rents – are on average better managed. Therefore, at the industry

level the correlation between management practices and historic average profitability goes in the

reverse direction to that implied by this measurement bias story.



Third, psychological evidence (e.g., Schwarz and Strack, 1999) suggests that recent improvements in

a subject’s condition are more likely to have an impact on survey responses than the absolute level of

a condition. Therefore, if there were a large performance-related bias in the management scores we

would expect this to show up in the fact that recent improvements in firm productivity (relative to

comparators) have a big impact on managerial responses. In fact, when we regress management scores

against lagged productivity growth rates there is no significant correlation. For example, a regression

of management scores against the productivity growth rates over the previous year generated a

coefficient (standard error) of 0.001 (0.002).40




40
  We also tested this management and productivity growth relationship over longer periods in a Table 2 Column (4)
specification – such as the last 5 years and the last 3 years – and found equally insignificant results. The positive
correlation of management with productivity levels and sales growth but not with productivity growth is consistent with a
simple dynamic selection model. Management (and therefore productivity levels) is fixed over time and the market
gradually allocates more sales to the more productive firms.



                                                           34
Finally, the Appendices report a further battery of robustness tests on this issue. Not all individual

questions are significantly correlated with performance, as shown in Appendix Table A2. Therefore,

to the extent this bias is a serious phenomenon it only seems to afflict certain questions. One reason of

course may be that some questions are more or less subject to bias because they are more or less

“objective”. To investigate this further Appendix Table D2 runs some robustness tests on the

management performance results by using a management measure based on the four questions which

are arguable the most objective (column 1), and the four questions which are arguably the least

objective (column 2).41 Comparing these two columns demonstrates that the coefficients on these two

sub-sets of questions, however, are not significantly different. In columns (3) to (8) in Appendix Table

D2 we report the results from running the production function estimation on three other survey

measures – a self-scored “work-life balance” indicator and two self-scored “organizational

devolvement” indicators - which should also be afflicted by the measurement bias story. However, as

can be seen from columns (3) to (8) these measures are not significantly correlated with productivity,

suggesting that the questions are not all reflections of a “warm glow” surrounding a firm who is

performing well.



Hence, in conclusion while there is undoubtedly scope for firm performance related measurement bias

in the survey; we do not find evidence that this is a major problem in our results.




41
   Appendix Table A2 reports the individual coefficients for every question so any other grouping of the questions by an
alternative categorization of “objectivity” can also be analyzed.

 V. ACCOUNTING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF MANAGEMENT

                                          PRACTICES


V.A The distribution of management practices

Having confirmed that our management measures are significantly related to firm performance, we

now proceed to examine the management scores directly. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the

average management scores per firm across all eighteen questions, plotted by country in raw form (not

in z-score form). It is clear that there is a huge amount of heterogeneity within each country with firms

spread across most of the distribution. About 2% of the overall variation in firms’ average

management scores is across countries, 42% is across countries by three-digit industry, and the

remaining 56% is within country and industry. This spread is particularly wide when considered

against the fact that a score of one indicates industry worst practice and five industry best practices.

Therefore, for example, firms scoring two or less have only basic shop-floor management, very

limited monitoring of processes or people, ineffective and inappropriate targets, and poor incentives

and firing mechanisms. Thus, one of the central questions we address in the next sub-section is how

do these firms survive?



Looking across countries the US has on average the highest scores (3.37), Germany is second (3.32),

France third (3.13) and the UK last (3.08), with the gaps between the US, Continental Europe (France

and Germany) and the UK are statistically significant at the 5% level. The UK-US gap also appears

persistent over time. The Marshall Plan productivity mission of 1947 reported that “efficient

management was the most significant factor in the American advantage [over the UK]” (Dunning,



                                                   36
1958, p. 120). We were concerned that some of the apparent cross-country differences in management

scores may simply be driven by differences in the sampling size distribution, but these figures are

robust to controls for size and public ownership.42



The presence of the US at the top of the ranking is consistent with anecdotal evidence from other

surveys.43 It also reflects the productivity rankings from other studies comparing the four nations (the

US is top and the UK bottom). One might suspect this was due to an “Anglo-Saxon” bias that is why

in the previous section we had to confront the scores with data on productivity to show that the

management scores are correlated with real outcomes within countries (see Table 2). Furthermore, the

position of the UK as the country with the lowest average management scores indicates that the

survey instrument is not intrinsically Anglo-Saxon biased. Table A2 in Appendix A provides more

details behind these cross-country comparisons, and reveals a relative US strength in targets and

incentives (more people management) versus a German and French strength in shop floor and

monitoring (more operations management)44.



V.B Management practices and product market competition

A common argument is that variations in management practice result from the differences in product

market competition; either because of selection effects and/or because of variations in the incentives

to supply effort. Table 4 attempts to investigate this by examining the relationship between product

42
   We also find that the 21 US multinational subsidiaries located in Europe in our dataset are significantly better managed
(average 3.74) than either the 405 domestic European firms (average 3.11) or the 16 non-US multinational subsidiaries
(average 3.12). So American firms also manage to transport their management practices to their overseas subsidiaries.
43
   For example, Proudfoot (2003) regularly reports that US firms were least hindered by poor management practices (36%)
compared to Australia, France, Germany, Spain, South Africa and the UK. Unfortunately, these samples are drawn only
from the consulting groups’ clients so suffer from serious selection bias.
44
   We also found in France and German firms were significantly more hierarchical (gave managers more power relative to
workers) in pace and task allocation compared to the UK and particularly the US.



                                                           37
market competition and management. We use three broad measures of competition following Nickell

(1996) and Aghion et al. (2005). The first measure is the degree of import penetration in the country

by three-digit industry measured as the share of total imports over domestic production. This is

constructed for the period 1995-1999 to remove any potential contemporaneous feedback45. The

second is the country by three digit industry Lerner index of competition, which is (1 – profits/sales),

calculated as the average across the entire firm level database (excluding each firm itself)46. Again,

this is constructed for the period 1995-1999 to remove any potential contemporaneous feedback. The

third measure of competition is the survey question on the number of competitors a firm faces (see

Appendix A3), valued zero for “non competitors”, one for “less than 5 competitors”, and two for “5 or

more competitors”47.



                                            [TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]



In column (1), we see that better management scores are positively and significantly associated with

greater import penetration. In column (2), we re-estimate the same specification but now include a full

set of controls, and again find that higher lagged trade competition is significantly correlated with

better management. The firm controls include firm size, firm age, listing status, skills and

consolidation status.48 Even after conditioning on these additional covariates, we find that the more



45
   Melitz (2003) and other have suggested this measure of trade exposure should truncate the lower part of the productivity
distribution. We have also looked at (Imports+Exports)/production as an alternative indicator of trade exposure with
similar results to those reported here.
46
   Note that in constructing this we draw on firms in the population database, not just those in the survey.
47
   This question has been used by inter alia Nickell (1996) and Stewart (1990).
48
   We also experimented with many other controls (results available on request). Union density was negatively correlated
with management scores, but insignificant. Although there was a significant negative correlation between management
scores and average worker age in simple specifications, this disappeared when we controlled for firm age (older workers
are more likely to be matched with older firms). The proportion of females was insignificant.



                                                           38
competitive country-industry pairings contain firms that are on average significantly better managed.

In columns (3) and (4), we run two similar specifications on lagged Lerner index of competition as an

alternative competition measure and again find a significant and positive effect. In columns (5) and

(6), we run two further similar specifications, but this time using managers’ own self reported measure

of the number of competitors they face, and again we find a positive and significant association: the

more rivals a firm perceives it faces the better managed it appears to be. The final two columns

include all three competition measures simultaneously. Although the statistical significance and

marginal effects are typically a bit lower, the same pattern of results persists. Tougher product market

competition is associated with significantly better management practices49.



The magnitude of the competition effect on average management scores is of economic as well as

statistical significance. For example in column (6) increasing the number of competitors from “few”

to “many” is associated with a management z-score increase of 0.145 or a raw management score

increase of about 0.160.50 As discussed in the section VI this competition effect accounts for a

substantial proportion of the tail of badly performing firms and the management gap between the US

and Europe.



These are conditional correlations, of course, as we have no instrumental variable for competition.

However, it is likely that any endogeneity bias will cause us to underestimate the importance of

product market competition on management. For example, in columns (3) and (4) an exogenous


49
   We also looked for a relationship between the level of competition and the spread of management practices (Syverson,
2004a, b), but could not find any significant relationship. One reason may be our current sample is too small to test for
differences in the second moment of management across sub-samples.
50
   The difference in the raw management score between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution is 1.06. The ratio of
the standard deviations of the firm-level management scores to the z-scores is 1.098.



                                                            39
positive shock that raises managerial quality in an industry is likely to increase profitability and

therefore the measured Lerner index (indeed, Table 2 showed a positive correlation between

management and individual firm level profitability). This will make it harder for us to identify any

positive impact of product market competition on management51.



One issue in interpreting this competition effect is that it potentially works through two mechanisms

(see Section II): (i) increasing management scores through greater managerial effort; and (ii) greater

competition increasing the relative exit rate of badly managed firms versus well-managed firms.

Using the managerial hours worked as a basic proxy for effort, we find an insignificant relationship

between tougher competition and longer hours52 Of course managerial hours is a very imperfect proxy

for managerial effort, as managers may supply more effort by a greater “intensity” of work rather than

longer hours. Still, it does suggest that the margin of impact of competition is not on the length of the

working day or week.



V.C Management practices and family firms

In Table 5, we investigate the impact of hereditary family ownership on firms’ management scores

(see Table 1 for descriptive statistics on types of ownership and control by the family). Column (1)

starts by regressing management scores against an indicator of the family as the single largest owner




51
   Similarly, better management will improve exports, reduce the degree of imports, and probably mean that the firm pulls
away from other competitors and feels less threatened. These will all generate a bias towards zero on the competition
indicators in Table 4.
52
   For example, the coefficient (standard deviation) of managerial hours on import penetration, the Lerner index and the
number of competitors is 1.033 (0.881), -2.498 (6.657) and 0.847 (0.612) respectively based on an identical specification
to Table 4 column (2), except with managerial hours as the dependent variable instead of the management score.



                                                           40
(defined on total family holdings53) plus the standard set of control variables. We see that family

ownership per se does not seem to be associated with depressed firm performance, with a negative but

insignificant coefficient. In column (2) we regress management practices against an indicator of

family ownership and family management (defined by the CEO being a family member), and find the

coefficient becomes more negative but again is not significantly different from zero. In column (3),

we include an indicator that the firm is family owned, family managed with the CEO succession

determined by primo geniture - that is they explicitly stated that the policy of the firm has been to pass

this position to the eldest son. For these firms we see a strongly negative and significant coefficient,

suggesting the sub-set of family firms who adopted primo geniture successions are substantially worse

managed. In column (4) we drop the general controls and show that the family firm correlation is

much stronger in the unconditional regressions. In column (5) we include all three indicators and see

that it is the primo geniture family firms that are driving the negative coefficients on family ownership

and management. In fact, family ownership per se has a positive and weakly significant association

with good management. The final column drops the founder firms from the sample so that external

ownership is the pure baseline, which makes little difference to the results. Taking Table 5 as a whole

it seems that the combination of family ownership and primo geniture family management

significantly damages company performance.



                                            [TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]




53
  We also looked at the breakdown of individual family holdings (e.g. if two brothers owned half the equity each), but
could not find any significant impact of the relative or absolute differences in holdings of the first and second largest
family shareholders. One reason may be that complete data on this was hard to obtain for European firms.



                                                           41
One interpretation of this result is that being a primo geniture company directly causes inferior

performance in family firms due to the types of selection and “Carnegie effects” discussed in section

II. Another interpretation is that primo geniture is an indicator of firms being more generally

backward, suggesting the persistence of “old-fashioned” management techniques. While this is

possible we do nevertheless find that primo geniture family firms are significantly worse managed

even after including controls for firm age, average employee age and CEO age.54 It is also difficult to

see why France and the UK should exogenously have a greater number of old-fashioned firms than

Germany or the US (given our controls for industrial structure, age and size). By contrast, the

common Norman legal origin of the France and the UK offers a direct historical reason for the

persistence of primo geniture.



V.D Management Scores and Management Ability

Another interpretation for the variation in managerial practices across firms is that our management

score proxies for the underlying ability of managers (and employees) in the firm, with well-managed

firms simply those containing a large-fraction of high ability managers. Under this view, our proxies

of human capital (such as the proportion of employees with college degrees and the proportion with

MBAs) do not control for this unobserved ability. Even under this interpretation it is, of course,

interesting that lower product market competition and primo geniture increases the incidence of poor

quality managers.



54
   Another interpretation on the poor management of family firms is that they operate less formally due to a lower return
from “bureaucracy” (Novaes and Zingales, 2004). The point-estimate (standard errors) for the column (3) specification for
individual management components are: Shop floor operations -0.341 (0.147); Monitoring -0.345 (0.116); Targets -0.229
(0.115); and Incentives -0.231 (0.099). So while there is some evidence for this in the particularly low monitoring scores
for family firms, they still score significantly badly on other management components like shop floor operations and
incentives, which are not obviously linked to more formalized management styles.



                                                           42
However, several findings cause us to doubt that the management scores we measure are simply a

cipher for employee ability. First, assuming employees are paid their marginal product, we would not

expect to observe the positive correlation between good management practices and profits and market

value discussed earlier (see Table 2) as this would be “priced out” in the market. Second, we also find

that controlling for the average wages has very little effect on the size of the management coefficient

in the production functions, suggesting that the management score is not simply a proxy for

unobserved employee ability55. Finally, CEO pay (a proxy for top-managerial ability) is not correlated

with our management score once we control for firm size56. Therefore, while managerial ability may

account for some of the variation in management practices across firms; this is unlikely to explain all

the observed variation. Our interpretation is that managerial practices are deeply embedded in the

organizational capital of the firm, and this explains the higher productivity and profitability of well-

managed firms. This organizational capital is greater than the sum of the parts of abilities and skills of

the current employees.



V.E Instrumental variable estimates of management practices in the production function

Returning to the production functions estimates in the previous section, we noted that it was not

possible to regard the coefficient on management as a causal effect of management on firm

performance. Our estimated effects of the “true effect” of management on productivity could be

biased upwards or downwards due to reverse causality. For example, positive feedback could occur if

55
   When we include the ln(average wage of the firm) and its interactions with country dummies in a specification identical
to that of column (4) in Table 2, the management coefficient is 0.051 with a standard error of 0.017. This compares to a
management coefficient of 0.059 with a standard error of 0.017 without the wage terms on the same sample (we only have
2,612 observations for this regression compared to the 5,350 in Table 2 because wage data is not reported for some of the
firms in the sample). The wage terms are positive and significant.
56
   For example, regressing log(CEO pay) on firm size, public/private status, country dummies, industry dummies, and the
management score, we find the coefficient (standard error) on the management score is 0.001 (0.051). Note that although
CEO pay includes bonuses it does not include share options.



                                                           43
higher productivity enabled cash-constrained to invest more resources in improving managerial

practices. This would bias our coefficient on management upwards. Negative feedback could occur if

higher productivity allows managers to reduce their input of effort.57 This would bias the coefficient

on management downwards.



                                            [TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE]



We present results in Table 6 using product market competition and/or family ownership as

instrumental variables for management practices. For this to be valid we need to not only assume that

our measures of product market competition and ownership are exogenous (as in Table 6) but also that

the mechanism by which competition (and ownership) impacts on productivity is solely through

improving managerial practices. Based on these admittedly very strong identification assumptions the

instrumental variable strategy identifies the causal effect of management on performance.



Table 6 contains the results of using competition and/or family management to instrument

management practices in the production function. The baseline is column (1) which repeats the simple

OLS productivity equations including management on the right hand side58. Columns (2), (3) and (4)

then present production function results confirming that competition and family primo geniture are

important determinants of firm level productivity, matching their role in determining management

practices. Column (5) then estimates a production function in which management is instrumented

using the import penetration and family primo geniture management, generating a management

57
   Higher scoring practices involve more time and effort from managers on a range of the monitoring and target practices,
plus potentially more difficult decisions in incentive practices over hiring, firing, pay and promotions.
58
   This is identical to column (1) in Table D1.



                                                           44
coefficient which significantly positive and over five-fold larger in magnitude than the OLS

coefficient. As noted in Section IV, this is likely to be due to heavy measurement error in our

definition of “good” management and/or negative feedback from firm performance to managerial

effort. As can be seen from the bottom of column (5) these instruments are not rejected by the

Hansen-Sargan test of instrument validity. Columns (6) and (7) then present robustness results

instrumenting management using just competition and then just family management individually.

These also suggest downward bias from the OLS estimates



The coefficients in the production function estimates are of quantitative as well as statistical

significance. Although we cannot clearly attribute causality to the management scores on productivity,

a movement from the lower to the upper quartile of management scores between firms (0.971 points)

is associated with an increase in TFP of between 3.2% and 7.5% under OLS and 21.6% under IV.

Empirically the difference in TFP between the lower quartile and upper quartile of our firms is 31.9%.

In a purely accounting sense, therefore, management scores explain between 10% and 23% of the

inter-quartile range of productivity under OLS and about 66% under IV59.




59
  We take the OLS coefficients in Table 2 to be between 0.032 and 0.075; we use the IV coefficient of Table 6 column
(5). The TFP calculations are the within-group residuals from Table D1 column (s). An equivalent calculation for the 90-
10 implies that management accounts for up to 22% under OLS and 64% under I.V.

     VI. EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ACROSS FIRMS

                         AND COUNTRIES: QUANTIFICATION


We turn to quantifying the role of product market competition and primo geniture family firms in

accounting for management practices.



VI.A Explaining the Tail of Badly Managed Firms

One of the interesting features of the raw data is the substantial fraction of firms that appear to have

surprisingly bad management practices, with scores of two or less. These firms have only basic shop-

floor management, very limited monitoring of processes or people, ineffective and inappropriate

targets, and poor incentives and firing mechanisms. In addition, our calibration of the measurement

error suggests these firms cannot be entirely explained by sampling noise. Interestingly most of the

differences across countries highlighted in Figure 1 are due to the left tail60 - the low UK and French

average management scores are primarily due to their long tail of badly managed firms.



To investigate the extent to which low competition and primo geniture family firms can account for

this tail of badly run firms we split the sample based on these measures. Figure 3 plots the

management histogram for all firms reporting low competition61 and/or primo geniture family


60
   We ran a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the equality of management score distributions between the US and Germany
versus the UK and France and found this is rejected (p-value=0.002) on the whole sample. If we test equality of this
distribution for management scores above 2 this is not rejected (p-value=0.391). After truncating at 2 the coefficients on
the country dummies (standard errors) in a Table 7 Column (1) specification with a US-baseline fall to -0.015 (0.060) for
Germany, -0.012 (0.078) for France and -0.128 (0.070) for the UK, so that the US-French gap is eliminated and the US-
UK gap falls by more than half.

because it is consistently measured across the sample. The Lerner index and import penetration measures may vary with

succession, accounting for 415 firms. Figure 4 plots the management histogram for the remaining

high-competition and no primo geniture succession, accounting for the remaining 307 firms.

Comparing these two graphs, it is clear that the tail of badly managed firms is substantially larger in

the low competition and primo geniture sample, with 8.9 per cent of firms scoring two or less,

compared to 2.7 per cent of firms in the high competition no primo-geniture sample.62 Given that 6.5

per cent of all firms in the sample scored 2 or less, controlling for competition and primo geniture

succession appears to remove over half of the tail of very badly managed firms.63

VI.B Explaining the Cross-Country Variation in Management Scores

In Table 7, we attempt to account for the variations in management practices across countries. In

column (1), we regress management on dummy variables for Germany, France and the UK (with the

US as the omitted as baseline category). We find that French and UK firms are significantly worse

managed than US firms on average, with a gap of 0.202 and 0.276 respectively, while German firms

are worse managed but not significantly so with a smaller gap of 0.045. In column (2), we include a

dummy for a primo geniture family firm whose coefficient is negative and significant at the 5% level

as expected. The coefficient on the UK and French dummy variables drop substantially by around

0.09, reflecting the extensive presence of family firms with traditional primo geniture progression


accounting standards and country size respectively. In the regression results, we controlled for this with country dummies
and identify from within country variations, but in this section we want to look across countries.
62
   This split is also true in the US and European sub samples. In the US 5.2% of firms, score 2 or less in the low
competition and/or primo geniture group while 0.6% score two or less in the high competition non primo geniture group.
In Europe 11.2% of firms score 2 or less in the low competition and/or primo geniture group while 5.3% score 2 or less in
the high competition non primo geniture group.
63
   Competition explains around two-thirds of this reduction in the tail, with conditioning on “many” competitors alone
taking the share of firms scoring two or less from 6.9% (in the whole sample) down to 4.2%.



                                                           47
rules.64 In column (3), we condition on our measure of the number of competitors faced by the firm.

Consistent with the earlier results of the competition variables this enters the regression with a

positive and significant coefficient. The coefficient on the UK dummy drops slightly as the degree of

competition is only marginally lower in the UK than in the US. By contrast the coefficients for France

and Germany drop by about 0.04, because the level of competition is reported to be lower by French

or German companies than by US firms.65 Together competition and family firm status accounts for

around two-thirds (62% = 100*(.202-.077)/.202) of the gap between the US and France and one-third

(32% = 100*(.276-.188))/.276) of the gap between the US and the UK. In column (4), we add one

final control, which is the proportion of employees with a college degree, and find that this accounts

for much of the remaining UK and French gap with the US.



                                             [TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE]



Although we were expecting the competition results, the role of family firms is more surprising. The

finding matches up with an earlier economic history literature of Landes (1967) and Chandler (1994),

who claim that hereditary family management was probably the primary the reason for the industrial

decline of the UK and France relative to the US and Germany around the early 1900s.66 For example,

Landes (1967) states that:




64
   Controlling for firm size and public/private mix does not notably change these results with the respective coefficients for
Germany, France and the UK in column (1) -0.081, -0.183 and -0.276; in column (2) -0.051, -0.075 and -0.200; in column
(3) -0.042, -0.127 and -0.251; and in column (4) 0.010, -0.028 and -0.126.
65
   In the descriptive statistics of Table B1, the index of competition is 2.56 for the US, 2.52 for the UK, 2.35 for Germany
and 2.32 for France.
66
   Nicholas (1999) provides supporting evidence for the UK, showing that over this period individuals who inherited
family firms accumulated less lifetime wealth than either firm founders or professional managers.

       hegemony. Now it was the turn of the third generation…[and] the weakness of British

       enterprise reflected their combination of amateurism and complacency”

                                                                                              [p. 563]



       “Before the war the model [French] enterprise was family-owned and operated, security-

       orientated rather than risk-taking, technologically conservative and economically inefficient”

                                                                                              [p. 528]



The results in Table 6 suggest family firms – at least in our sample of medium sized manufacturing

firms - are still a factor in explaining cross-country management practices one hundred years later.

And extrapolating from the 20 per cent of firms under family ownership in 2004 to the majority share

they would have accounted for in the early Twentieth Century suggests they could have played the

dominant cross-country role in that period as suggested by Landes and Chandler.




                                   VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we use an innovative survey tool to collect management practice data from 732 medium

sized manufacturing firms in Europe and the US. The methodology described here combines

traditional survey tools used by economists with the more in-depth case study interview techniques

recommended by management specialists. We believe that it will be a useful part of the empirical

toolkit to be used by economists interested in the internal organization of firms. Rather than simply




                                                 49
label unobserved heterogeneity “fixed effects” we have explicitly developed indicators of managerial

best practice.



In our application we find these measures of better management practice are strongly associated with

superior firm performance in terms of productivity, profitability, Tobin’s Q, sales growth and survival.

We also find significant country variation with American firms on average much better managed than

European firms. There is, however a much larger variation between firms within countries with a long

tail of extremely badly managed firms. This heterogeneity is consistent with what we know from the

productivity distribution between firms and plants. Why do so many firms exist with apparently

inferior management practices, and why does this vary so much across countries? We find this is due

to a combination of: (i) low product market competition that appears to allow poor management

practices to persist, and (ii) family firms passing management control down by primo geniture.

European firms in our sample report facing lower levels of competition than American firms. France

and the UK also display substantially higher levels of primo geniture probably due to their Norman

legal origin and traditions and the more generous exemption from the estate taxation regime. Product

market competition and family firms alone appear to account for around half of the long tail of badly

managed firms and between two thirds (France) and one-third (UK) of the European management gap

with the US.



A possible criticism of our research design is that we have focused on managerial practices from the

employer perspective rather than the worker perspective. Do these “tough” management practices

come at the expense of work intensification and a breakdown of reciprocity and job satisfaction in the

workplace? Although we did not interview workers directly regarding managerial practices, we doubt



                                                  50
that we would get a radically different picture from such information. In a companion paper (Bloom,

Kretschmer and Van Reenen, 2006) we show that our overall management score is strongly positively

correlated with many pro-worker features of firms such as more generous childcare subsidies and

better work-life balance indicators. Although these indicators have no association with productivity

conditional on management, it suggests that workers may actually prefer working in well-run firms to

badly run firms.



A range of potential extensions to this work is planned, including running a second survey wave in

2006. It is important to follow up these firms in order to examine the extent to which management

practice evolves over time. This will enable us to examine whether competition is working simply

through selection or if there is learning of better managerial techniques by incumbent firms. The

methodology of quantifying management is general enough to be applied (with modifications) to other

countries and other sectors, including the public sector. We are also developing this survey

methodology to measure the organizational structure and characteristics of firms, attempting to

empirically test the long line of organizational theories of the firm.

NOTES: These mean values are taken from our sample of 732 firms. Family shareholding is combined across all family members.
Family involvement is defined as second-generation family or beyond. Primo geniture defined by a positive answer to the question
“How was the management of the firm passed down: was it to the eldest son or by some other way?” (see Table A3). Alternatives
to primo-geniture in frequency order are younger sons, son in-laws, daughters, brothers, wives and nephews. “Family largest
shareholder” firms defined as those with a single family (combined across all family members, whom are all second generation or
beyond) as the largest shareholder; “Family largest shareholder and family CEO” firms are those with additionally a family member as
the CEO; “Family largest shareholder, family CEO and primo geniture” who additionally the CEO was selected as the eldest male child
upon succession. See Appendix B for more details on construction of the variables.

 NOTES: All columns estimated by OLS except column (7) which is estimated by probit Maximum Likelihood. In all columns (except
 7), standard errors are in parentheses under coefficient estimates and allow for arbitrary heteroskedacity and correlation (i.e. clustered by
 firm). In column (7), we report the p-value in square brackets below the marginal effects of each variable on the percentage increase in
 the probability of exit (between 2004 and 2005). The coefficients on capital, materials and labor are allowed to be different across
 countries and consolidation status (UK is base). “General controls” comprise of firm-level controls for ln(average hours worked),
 ln(firm age), a dummy for being listed, a dummy for being consolidated, the share of workforce with degrees, the share of workforce
 with MBAs, 108 three digit industry dummies and four country dummies interacted with a full set of time dummies. “Noise controls”
 are those in the final column of Table C1 (17 interviewer dummies, the seniority, gender, tenure and number of countries worked in of
 the manager who responded, the day of the week the interview was conducted, the time of the day the interview was conducted), the
 duration of the interviews and an indicator of the reliability of the information as coded by the interviewer). Data runs between 1994 and
 2004 except in column (7).

      NOTES: All columns estimated by OLS with robust standard errors in parentheses (standard errors are clustered by industry in
      column (9)). A single cross section of data used. “HC management” is the average z-score of the three explicitly human capital
      focused questions (questions 13, 17 and 18 in Appendix Table A1). “FC management” is the average z-score of the 3 most fixed
      capital focused questions (1, 2 and 4 in Appendix Table A1). “HC-PC management” is the difference of these two averages. “General
      controls” comprises controls for ln(firm age), ln(average number of employees), a dummy for being listed and country dummies.
      “Industry controls” are a full set of three digit industry dummies. “ln(proportion of employees with college degrees), three digit
      industry level” is the average number of employees with a college level qualification (or higher) in the industry in the 1991 to 1998
      US Current Population Survey (NBER MORG files). We use this measure in all four countries under the assumption that the relative
      skill intensity of industries is similar across countries. Column (9) is weighted by the number of observations on each industry in the
      CPS.

             average over 1995-1999 used. “Lerner index of competition” constructed, as in Aghion et al. (2005), as the mean of (1 - profit/sales)
             in the entire database (excluding the firm itself) for every country industry pair (average over 1995-1999 used). “Number of
             competitors” constructed from the response to the survey question on number of competitors, and is coded as zero for “none” (1% of

APPENDIX B: DATA

The entire anonymized dataset with a full set of do-files generating all results in this paper
will be made available on-line after publication of his paper.

Sampling Frame Construction

Our sampling frame was based on the Amadeus dataset for Europe (UK, France and
Germany) and the Compustat dataset for the USA. These all have information on company
accounting data. We chose firms whose principal industry was in manufacturing and who
employed (on average between 2000 and 2003) no less than 50 employees and no more than
10,000 employees. We also removed any clients of the consultancy firm we worked with
from the sampling frame (33 out of 1,353 firms).

Our sampling frame is reasonably representative of medium sized manufacturing firms. The
European firms in Amadeus include both private and public firms whereas Compustat only
includes publicly listed firms. There is no US database with privately listed firms with
information on sales, labor and capital. Fortunately, there are a much larger proportion of
firms are listed on the stock exchange in the US than in Europe so we are able to go
substantially down the size distribution using Compustat. Nevertheless, the US firms in our
sample are slightly larger than those of the other countries, so we are always careful to control
for size and public listing in the analyses. Furthermore, when estimating production functions
we allow all coefficients to be different on labor, capital, materials and consolidation status by
country (see notes to Table 2).

Another concern is that we condition on firms where we have information on sales,
employment and capital. These items are not compulsory for firms below certain size
thresholds so disclosure is voluntary to some extent for the smaller firms. By design, the firms
in our sampling frame (over 50 workers) are past this threshold for voluntary disclosure (the
only exception is for capital in Germany).

We achieved a response rate of 54% from the firms that we contacted: a very high success
rate given the voluntary nature of participation. Respondents were not significantly more
productive than non-responders. French firms were slightly less likely to respond than firms
in the other three countries were and all respondents were significantly larger than non-
respondents. Apart from these two factors, respondents seemed randomly spread around our
sampling frame

Firm level data

Our firm accounting data on sales, employment, capital, profits, shareholder equity, long-term
debt, market values (for quoted firms) and wages (where available) came from Amadeus
(France, Germany and the UK) and Compustat (US). For other data fields we did the
following:
Materials: In France and Germany, these are line items in the accounts. In the UK, these were
constructed by deducting the total wage bill from the cost of goods sold. In the US, these were
constructed following the method in Bresnahan et al. (2002). We start with costs of good sold




                                               77
(COGS) less depreciation (DP) less labor costs (XLR). For firms who do not report labor
expenses expenditures we use average wages and benefits at the four-digit industry level
(Bartelsman, Becker and Gray, 2000, until 1996 and then Census Average Production Worker
Annual Payroll by 4-digit NAICS code) and multiply this by the firm'      s reported employment
level. This constructed measure is highly correlated at the industry level with materials.
Obviously there may be problems with this measure of materials (and therefore value added)
which is why we check robustness to measures without materials.
Company Shareholdings: This was manually extracted from the Bloomberg online data
service for the ten largest shareholders and the ten largest insider shareholders.
Dates of Incorporation: For UK, French and German companies this is provided by Amadeus
datasets. For the US, this was obtained from Dunn and Bradstreet.
Family ownership data
The ownership data, directors’ data, shareholder information and family generation was
collected from company SEC filings (particularly the DEF14a), company databases
(Compustat and ICARUS in the US, AMADEUS in the UK, France and Germany), company
websites, and The International Directory of Company Histories (St. James Press) and
Moody’s Manuals (Moody’s Investor Service). When this data was missing or ambiguous this
was supplemented with information from the family firm telephone survey, which was run on
around 300 firms in the sample who were (or potentially were) family owned.67 This allowed
us to separate firms into the three family firm categories: “Family largest shareholder” firms
defined as those with a single family (combined across all family members, whom are all
second generation or beyond) as the largest shareholder; “Family largest shareholder and
family CEO” firms as those with additionally a family member as the CEO; “Family largest
shareholder, family CEO and primo geniture” who additionally the CEO selected as the
eldest male child upon succession.
CEO Pay and Age: In the US, the S&P 1500 largest firms (which cover all sectors) are
contained in Execucomp, which provided data for 106 largest of our US firms. For the
remaining firms we manually downloaded the Def14a proxy statements from the SEC to
extract the details of the CEO and CFO compensation package and age over the last three
accounting years68. In the UK, the highest paid director is a mandatory line item in the
accounts and we took this as the CEO’s salary. In France and Germany we have no data on
executive pay.

Industry level data
This comes from the OECD STAN database of industrial production. This is provided at the
country ISIC Revision 3 level and is mapped into US SIC (1997) three (which is our common
industry definition in all four countries). The measure of competition we use are “Import
Penetration” = ln(Import/Production) in every country*industry pair (i.e. 4 countries and 108
industries implies up to 432 cells). We use the average over 1995-1999. “Lerner index of
competition” constructed, as in Aghion et al. (2005), as the mean of (1 - profit/sales) in the
entire database (excluding the firm itself) for every country industry pair (average over 1995-
1999 used).

A full set of descriptive statistics are in Table B1.

CONTROLS

We decompose the variation in the question level z-scores qij into four components
q ij = mi + pij + u i + eij (where subscript i denotes firm and j denotes practice): the average
firm management practice mi ; the practice (i.e. question) specific deviations from the average
firm management practice pij where       pij = 0 ; the average firm-level measure error u i ; and
the practice specific deviation in measurement error from the firm average measurement error
eij where     eij = 0 .

Assuming that the practice deviations and measurement error deviations are i.i.d. within firms
(although not across firms), we can decompose the variance in q ij as 1 = σ m2 + σ 2p + σ u2 + σ e2
using the fact that z-scores have a variance of one. To determine these values of these
components we exploit the information in the first and second interviews and the variance of
question scores within and between firms.

At the question level the regression coefficient from the first on the second interview
                                        σ m2 + σ 2p
responses will take the value β q = 2                       , from applying the standard result on
                                   σ m + σ 2p + σ u2 + σ e2
the attenuation bias due to measurement error. The average coefficient from the first on
second interviews and the second on first interviews is 0.578. At the firm level the regression
coefficient of the first interview average scores on the second interview average scores will
                           σ m2
take the value β q =               . The average coefficient from the first on second and second on
                       σ m2 + σ u2
first interviews is 0.752. Finally, decomposing the variance in question scores within and
between firms provides values on σ m2 + σ u2 and σ 2p + σ e2 of 0.466 and 0.534.

Combining these three results together with the definition of the variances allows us to
calculate σ m2 = 0.350, σ 2p = 0.228, σ u2 = 0.116, and σ e2 = 0.306. Thus, we estimate the ratio of
variation from management practices to measurement error to be 58:42 at the question level.
This ratio rises to 75:25 at the firm level due to the higher correlation of management
practices than measurement error across questions within the firm. Interestingly the variation
in these management practices is driven both by changes in firm average management
practices (61%) and in firm specific practice capabilities (39%).

Table C1 below contains a list of interviewer, interview and interviewee characteristics as
described in III.E. Column (1) reports the results of an OLS regression where the dependent
variable is the average management z-score in the firm. The coefficient and standard errors of
each of the variables are reported. Column (2) drops the least significant variables from the
regression. We use these variables as “noise controls” in some of the regressions.

                    APPENDIX D: ADDITIONAL RESULTS
In this Appendix, we give some additional results that we refer to in the main text (Section
IV.B), but did not have room to discuss in detail. In Table D1, we present alternative
estimates of the production function. Column 1 simply reports the OLS levels regression that
is comparable with column (4) of Table 269 .

In the rest of the table, we implement the two stage estimates described in Section 4 of the
text. In the first stage, we estimate the production function:

                                    y it = α l l it + α k k it + α n nit + η i + u it                             (D1)

We recover our estimates of the fixed effects,η i , and then in a second stage we project the
fixed effects on the time invariant variables including the management score, M. The upper
panel of Table D1 (Panel A) shows the “first stage” results of the production function. The
lower panel (Panel B) shows the results of the “second stage” regression.

Within groups estimates equation (D1) directly, GMM System follows Blundell Bond (2000)
and allows the uit to follow an AR (1) process, u it = ρu it −1 + ε it , where ε it is a serially
uncorrelated error. We estimate a general dynamic model with a lagged dependent variable
and lags of all the factor inputs:

                    y it = π 1 l it + π 2 l it −1 + π 3 k it + π 4 k it −1 + π 5 nit + π 6 nit −1 + η i* + ε it   (D2)

We use the moment conditions suggested by Arellano-Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond
(1998) treating all factor inputs as endogenous. The underlying parameters of the production
function in equation (D1) are recovered by imposing the Common Factor restrictions in
equation (D2) by Minimum Distance. We can then estimate the fixed effects and proceed to
the second step regression as before.

In Olley-Pakes (1996) the unobserved productivity term is allowed to evolve over time in a
first order Markov process. In this case we estimate the efficiency term for each firm-year and
then average this over the eleven years in our data.

Note that we have also experimented with estimating the results in Table D1 for just the 1999-
2004 periods instead of the 1994-2004 period that lead to very similar results.

Column (2) of Table D1 presents the within group results where we have included a full set of
firm fixed effects. Compared to OLS levels the coefficient on capital falls by over 50 per cent
and the coefficient on labour rises. This is typical of within group estimates of production
functions and is suggestive of attenuation bias in the capital stock measure that becomes

69
   The minor differences with Table 2 are because we impose the same coefficients on the factor inputs across
countries in order to ease comparability with the other estimators – this makes practically no difference to the
results on the management term.




                                                              82
exacerbated when moving from OLS to within groups. The Olley Pakes results are in column
(3). The coefficient on capital is higher than in OLS levels and much higher than Within
Groups. The labor coefficient, by contrast, is lower. This is reassuring, as we would generally
expect OLS levels (column (1)) to generate an upwards bias in the labor coefficient and a
downwards bias in the capital coefficient. The GMM System estimator in column (4) also
generates a lower labor coefficient and higher capital coefficient than within groups70.

We recover the estimates of the unobserved efficiency terms/fixed effects and project them
against the management score and other variables in Panel B. In all three columns, there
remains a significant and positive association of (total factor) productivity with our
management score. The magnitude of this management coefficient ranges between 0.04 for
Olley Pakes and 0.08 for Within Groups with GMM system in between (0.07). We conclude
that using our simpler OLS methods of estimating the association of management and
productivity in the main text is not misleading. If anything, we may be underestimating the
importance of management.

The final two columns report the results of a simple test of splitting the sample completely
into the Continental European observations (France and Germany in column (5)) and Anglo-
American observations (US and UK in column (6)). This is a further test of whether our
management variables are Anglo-Saxon biased and matter less for the “social markets” of
France and Germany. We use the Within Groups estimates of column (2). The coefficient on
the management is significant in both columns and is actually larger in Continental Europe
than in the UK and US (although not significantly so). We therefore reject the hypothesis that
our management practice measures are culturally biased against France and Germany (this is
supported by the fact that one of the Anglo Saxon countries, Britain, has a lower average
management score than Germany and France).

Table D2 presents extensions to the production functions where we try to control for “firm
performance related measurement bias”. These are discussed in the text in sib-section IV.D.




70
   The similarity of the capital coefficient in GMM System and OLS levels is surprising, but it may because of
problems with the extra moment conditions for the levels equations in Blundell-Bond. Even though the Sargan
Difference test fails to reject the null of instrument validity in column (4), it might have weak power to reject.
We re-estimated the equation using only the differenced moments (Arellano-Bond, 1991). The results were
similar to the other estimates. The coefficient (standard error) on capital was 0.174(0.064), on labor 0.361(0.054)
and on materials 0.416(0.057).

NOTES: In all columns, standard errors are in parentheses under coefficient estimates and allow for arbitrary heteroskedacity
and correlation (i.e. clustered by firm). The data runs between 1994 and 2004. Column (1) is estimated by OLS levels and we
also include “general controls” comprising of “firm” controls for ln(hours worked), ln(firm age), a dummy for being listed, a
dummy for being consolidated, the share of workforce with degrees, the share of workforce with MBAs, 108 three digit
industry dummies and four country dummies interacted with a full set of time dummies. The controls also include the “Noise
controls” from the final column of Table C1 (17 interviewer dummies, the seniority, gender, tenure and number of countries

worked in of the manager who responded, the day of the week the interview was conducted, the time of the day the interview
was conducted, the duration of the interviews and an indicator of the reliability of the information as coded by the
interviewer). All other columns report “two stage” results where, in the first stage individual effects are included in the
production function and we report the estimated parameters on the factor inputs (Panel A). In the second stage the estimated
firm-specific efficiency term/“TFP” is regressed against the management z-score and the general controls as described above.
We report the coefficients and robust standard error for management in Panel B. Columns (2), (5) and (6) are estimated by
Within Groups. Column (3) implements a version of the Olley-Pakes (1996) technique. We use a third order series
approximation for (.), the non-parametric expansion of capital and investment. We also include a selection correction term
following Olley and Pakes (1996). Standard errors are bootstrapped (clustered by firm) with 200 replications. After
calculating the parameters of labor and materials (stage 1a) and capital (stage 1b), we calculate the efficiency term/TFP
averaged by firm across all year. This is used as a dependent variable in the lower panel and regressed on management and
the general controls (stage 2). Column (4) shows results from our implementation of the Blundell-Bond (1998) GMM system
(GMM-SYS) estimator (stage 1). Instruments for the differenced equation are lagged levels t-2 to t-3 on ln(sales), ln(capital),
ln(labor) and ln(materials). Instruments for the levels equation are lagged differenced t-1 on ln(sales), ln(capital), ln(labor)
and ln(materials). Standard errors are the “one step robust” (i.e. allow for clustering by firm). SC(k) is the p-value of an
LM(k) test of second order correlation of the differenced residuals (see Arellano and Bond, 1991). We find evidence of
significant negative first order correlation, but no evidence of second order correlation, which is consistent with the validity
of the instrumentation strategy. SARGAN is the p-value of a Sargan-Hansen test of over-identification (distributed 2 under
the Null). SARGAN-DIF reports the p-value of a Sargan Difference test of the validity of the extra “Blundell-Bond
moments” over the standard moments in Arellano and Bond (1991). We impose the COMFAC (Common Factor) restrictions
by Minimum Distance (see Blundell and Bond, 2000).

workforce with degrees, the share of workforce with MBAs, 108 three digit dummies and four country dummies. The
coefficients on capital, materials and labor are allowed to be different across countries and consolidation status (UK is base).

tenure and number of countries worked in of the manager who responded, the day of the week the interview was conducted,
the time of the day the interview was conducted, the duration of the interviews and an indicator of the reliability of the
information as coded by the interviewer). Management z-score, more “objective” questions is the average of questions 1, 3,
4 and 9, chosen as being arguably the most objective questions in the interview, while Management z-score, least “objective”
questions is the average of questions 6, 12, 17 and 18, chosen as being arguably the least objective questions in the interview.
Work-life balance focus is the z-score from the work-life balance question, “Relative to other companies in your industry
how much does your company emphasize work-life balance?” [much less/slightly less/the same/slightly more/much more],
graded on a 1 to 5 scale. Organizational devolvement - pace is the z-score from the question “Who decides the pace of
work?” and Organizational devolvement – task is the z-score from the question “Who decides how tasks should be
allocated?” both scored on a 1 to 5 scale [exclusively managers/mostly managers/equally/mostly workers/exclusively
workers].
