    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT


                               ABSTRACT


     A reduction in trade barriers generally will affect the
environment by expanding the scale of economic activity, by altering
the composition of economic activity, and by bringing about a change

in the techniques of production. We present empirical evidence to
assess the relative magnitudes of these three effects as they apply to

further trade liberalization in Mexico.
     In Section 1. we use comparable measures of three air pollutants
in a cross-section of urban areas located in 42 countries to study the
relationship between air quality and economic growth. We find for two

pollutants (sulfur dioxide and smoke") that concentrations increase
with per capita GDP at low levels of national income, but decrease
with GD? growth at higher levels of income. Section 2 studies the

determinants of the industry pattern of U.S. imports from Mexico and
of value added by Mexico's maquiladora sector. We investigate whether
the size of pollution abatement costs in the U.S. industry influences
the pattern of international trade and investment. Finally, in
Section 3, we use the results from a computable general equilibrium
model to study the likely compositional effect of a NAFTA on pollution

in Mexico.

      Environmental advocacy groups In the United States have voiced their

concerns about a potential North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Some

went so far as to oppose the Congressional. granting of fast-track negotiating

authority to the President to enable American negotiators to enter Into talks

with their Mexican counterparts.    The reservations of the lobbying groups

mirror a growing perception on the part of environmentalists worldwide that an

open world trading system may be inimical to the goal of preserving a clean,

healthy, and sustainable global commons.

      The arguments linking trade liberalization with environmental

degradation have not been fully articulated.' With regard to a NAFFA, the

environmentalists have expressed a number of reasons for fearing that freer

trade and direct investment flows between the United States and Mexico may

aggravate pollution problems in Mexico and in the border region.2 At the

least discerning level, some have argued simply that any expansion of markets

and economic activity inevitably leads to more pollution and faster depletion

of scarce natural resources. A more pointed argument recognizes that

pollution already is a severe problem in Mexico and that the country's weak

regulatory infrastructure is strained to the breaking point. Under these

conditions, it is feared that any further industrialization that results from

the liberalization of trade and investment will exacerbate an already grave

situation.

      Other environmentalists draw their conclusions by extrapolating the

experience of the maquiladora sector in Mexico. The maquiladoras are


       See Low and Safedi (1991), who cite several examples of writings that view
open trade as detrimental to environmental protection.

     2 See, for example, Gregory (1991), Kelly and Kemp (1991). National Wildlife
Foundation (1990), Leonard and Christensen (1991), and Ortman (1991).
                                          2


predominantly   foreign-owned firms   that produce largely for export to the

United States under a Mexican policy that allows duty-free imports of foreign

components for further processing and re-export. Originally, maquiladoras

were required to locate within a 20-kilometer strip along the U.S. -    Mexico

border in order to qualify for special customs treatment. The sector grew -

quite   rapidly and with little governmental oversight, and now is widely

regarded as being a major contributor to the perilous environmental and social

conditions in the border region. Environmental groups point to this sector as

a prime example of how unregulated expansion in response to trade oppor-

tunities can create risks to worker safety and public health. They argue that

investments in this sector have been encouraged by the lax enforcement of

environment and labor protection laws in t4exico and fear that any further

expansion in trade and investment flows between the United States and Mexico

will be motivated by firms' desires to avoid the high costs of meeting U.S.

regulations.

        A further concern of some environmental groups is that a NAFEA may

undercut regulatory standards in the United States. Spokespersons have made

the political-economic argument that, with freer trade, industry groups in the

United States will demand less stringent pollution controls in order to

preserve their international competitiveness, so that environmental standards

will tend toward a lowest common denominator. The environmentalists worry,

moreover, that existing environmental protection laws in the United States may

be seen as nontariff barriers to trade in the context of a regional trade

agreement.
        While the environmental groups have raised a host of valid questions

 they have so far been unable to provide convincing and well supported answers
                                      3


to these questions. Many of their arguments fail to recognize all of the

implications of trade liberalization for resource allocation and natural

resource use in each of the trade partner countries. Moreover, die empirical

claims that have been made rely mostly on anecdotal evidence and on

extrapolation of the experience in one region or industry to the entirety of

economic activity in Mexico. Indeed, relatively little is known at any level

of generality about the relationship between a country's trade regime and its

rate of environmental degradatton. or even about the relationship between a

country's stage of economic development and its output of pollution.

Theoretical investigation of these topics has been limited, and empirical

studies are virtually non-existent.

      It is useful to distinguish three separate mechanisms by which a change

in trade and foreign investment policy can affect the level of pollution and

the rate of depletion of scarce environmental resources) First, there is a

scale effect, capturing the simple intuition espoused by the environmental

advocates. That is, if trade and investment liberalization causes an

expansion of economic activity, and if the nature of that activity remains

unchanged, then the total amount of pollution generated must increase. The

environmental groups point, for example, to the deleterious environmental

consequences of the combustion of fossil fuels and to the air pollution that

is generated by the trucking industry. To the extent that economic growth

gives rise to an increased demand for energy, which then is generated by means

similar to the prevailing methods, there will be an increased output of

harmful pollutants that attends an increase in economic output. Similarly, to


      A similar decomposition of the effects of economic growth on the output
of pollution has been proposed by the Task Force on the Environment and the
Internal Market (1990).
                                       4

the extent that expanded trade gives rise to an increased demand for cross-

border transportation services without there being any change in trucking

practices, increased trade will contribute to a deterioration in air quality.

      Second, there is a composition effect that results from any change in

trade policy. When trade is liberalized, countries specialize to a greater

extent in the sectors in which they enjoy competitive advantage. If

competitive advantage derives largely from differences in environmental

regulation, then the composition effect of trade liberalization will be

damaging to the environment. Each country then will tend to specialize more

completely in the activities that its government does not regulate strictly.

and will shift out of production in industries where the local costs of

pollution abatement are relatively great. On the other hand, if the sources

of international comparative advantage are the more traditional ones, namely

cross-country differences in factor abundance and technology, then the

implications of the composition effect for the state of the environment are

ambiguous. Trade liberalization will lead each country to shift resources

into the sectors that make intensive use of its abundant factors, The net

effect of this on the level of pollution in each location will depend upon

whether pollution-intensive activities expand or contract in the country that

on average has the more stringent pollution controls.

      Finally, there is a technicue effect. That is, output need not be

produced by exactly the same methods subsequent to a liberalization of trade

and foreign investment as it has been prior to the change in regime. In

particular, the output of pollution per unit of economic product need not

remain the same. There are at least two reasons to believe that pollution per

unit of output might fall, especially in a less developed country. First,
                                          S


foreign producers nay transfer modern technologies to the local economy when

restrictions on foreign investment are relaxed. More modern technologies

typically are cleaner than older technologies due to the growing global

awareness of the urgency of environmental concerns.      Second,   and   perhaps   more

importantly,   if trade liberalization generates an increase in income levels,

then the body politic may demand a cleaner environment as an expression of

their increased national wealth. Thus, more stringent pollution standards and

stricter enfoccement of existing laws may be a natural political response to

economic growth.

       In this paper we explore some of the empirical evidence that bears on

the likely environmental impacts of a NAflA. In Section 1, we shed some light

on the relative magnitudes of the scale and technique effects. We use a

cross-country sample of comparable measures of pollution in various urban

areas to explore the relationship between economic growth and air quality.

After holding constant the identifiable geographic characteristics of

different cities, a common global time trend in the levels of pollution, and

the location and type of the pollution measurement device, we find that

ambient levels of both sulphur dioxide and dark matter suspended in the air

increase with per capita GD? at low levels of national income, but decrease

with per capita GD? at higher levels of income. The turning point comes

somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000, measured in 1985 U.S. dollars. For a

third measure of air quality, namely the mass of suspended particles found in

a   given volune of air, the relationship between pollution and GD? is
monotonically decreasing.
        Sections 2 and 3   address different aspects of the composition effect.

In section 2 we ask whether and to what extent the sectoral patterns of U.S.
                                           6


foreign investment in Mexico and of Mexican exports to the United States are

affected by the laxity of environmental regulations in Mexico as compared to

the stricter enforcement of controls in the United States. We relate the

sectoral pattern of maquiladora activity, of U.S. imports from Mexico under

the offshore assembly provisions of the US. tariff codes, and of total US.

imports from Mexico to industry factor intensities, U.S. tariff rates, and the

size of pollution abatement costs in the U.S. industry. We find that the

traditional determinants of trade and investment patterns are significant

here, but that the alleged competitive advantages created by lax pollution

controls in Mexico play no substantial role in motivating trade and investment

flows.

         Finally, in Section 3, we begin with the premise that resource

allocations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada have been guided by

competitive advantages generated by differences in factor endowments. We

borrow from Brown, Deardorff and Stern (1991) their estimates of the change in

resource allocation that might result from a NAFTA, and discuss the

implications of these predicted changes in the structure of production for

levels    of pollution in each country.


1 Economic Growth and Urban Air Pollution
         As we noted   in the introduction, economic growth has offsetting
implications    for the anthropogenic generation of air pollution. On the one

hand, some pollutants are &     natural   byproduct of economic activities such as

electricity generation and the operation of motor vehicles. As economic

activity expands, emissions of these pollutants tend to grow.        On the other

hand, firms and households can control their pollution to some degree by their
                                       7


choice of technology. Cleaner technologies produce less pollution per unit of

output. As a society becomes richer its members may intensify their demands

for a more healthy and sustainable environment, in which case the government

may be called upon to impose more stringent environmental controls,

      Little is known about the empirical relationship between national income

and concentrations of various poLlutants. Investigation of this issue has

been hampered by the paucity of data on air pollution that is available on a

comparable basis for a representative sample of countries. However, since

1976 the World Health Organization (WHO) has collaborated with the United

Nations Environment Programme in operating the Global Environmental Monitoring

System (GEMS). The goal of this project has been to monitor closely the

concentrations of several pollutants in a cross-section of urban areas using

standardized methods of measurement. This data set, which to our knowledge

has not previously been analyzed by economists, provides us with an

opportunity to examine how air quality varies with economic growth.4

      In the next subsection we describe the GEMS project, the types of

pollution that it monitors, and the data that it has generated.    Section 1.2

gives the details of the statistical analysis that we have performed. Our

findings are presented in Section 1.3 and the implications   for Mexico are

discussed in Section 1,4.




        The GEMS data have   been statistically analyzed by some enviroTuhlental
                                                                         to use
 scientists (see World Health Organization (1984]), but they have neglected
 any economic variables in their exclusively bivariate analyses.

1.1 The GEMS Data3

      The GEMS monitors air quality in urban areas throughout the world.

Daily (or, in some cases, weekly or less frequent) measurements are taken of

concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO) and suspended particulate matter

Data on particulates, which are gases and liquids suspended in the air, are

collected by different methods (described further below) that alternatively

measure the mass of materials in a given volume of air and the concentration

of finer, darker matter, sometimes referred to as "smoke".

      Sulfur dioxide is a corrosive gas that has been linked to respiratory

disease and other health problems.' It is emitted naturally by volcanoes,

decaying organic matter, and sea spray. The major anthropogenic sources of

SO are the burning of fossil fuels in electricity generation and domestic

heating, and the smelting of non-ferrous ores (World Resource Institute,

1988). other sources in some countries include automobile exhaust and the

chemicals industry (Kormondy, 1989). Sulfur dioxide emissions can be

controlled by the installation of flue gas desulfurization equipment

(scrubbers) on polluting facilities, and by switching electricity-generating

and home-heating capacity to lower sulfur grades of coal or away from coal

altogether.

      Particulates arise from dust, sea spray, forest fires, and volcanoes.

Most of these naturally produced particles are relatively large. Finer

1988 have been kindly provided to us by Gardener Evans of the U.S. EPA.

particles are emitted by industry and from domestic fuel combustion (World

Resources Institute, 1988). Larger particles reduce visibility but have a

relatively minor health impact, whereas the finer particles can cause    eye and

lung damage and can aggravate existing respiratory conditions (U.S. EPA,

1982). Particulate emissions from anthropogenic processes can be reduced via

the installation of control equipment and by switching to fuels that, when

burned, emit fewer particles.

         The GEMS sample of cities has been changing over time. Sulfur dioxide

was monitored in 47 cities spread over 28 different countries in 1977, 52

cities in 32 countries in 1982, and 27 cities in 14 countries in 1988.

Measurements of suspended particles were taken in 21 cities in 11 countries in

1977, 36 cities in 17 countries in 1982, and 26 cities in 13 countries in

1998, while data for darker matter (smoke) are available for 18 cities in 13

countries for 1977. 13 cities in nine countries for 1982, and seven cities in

four countries for 1988. In all, there are 42 countries represented in our

sample for 502, 19 countries in our sample for dark matter, and 29 countries

in   our sample for suspended particles. The participating cities are located
in a variety of developing and developed countries and have been chosen to be
fairly   representative of the geographic conditions that exist in different

regions of the world (Betmett et at., 1985). In most of the cities included

in the project, air quality measurements are taken at two or three different

sites, which are classified either as center city or suburban, and as

commercial, industrial, or residential. Multiple sites in the same city are

monitored in recognition of the fact that pollutant concentrations can vary

dramatically with local conditions that depend in part upon land use.

Observations at most sites are made on a daily basis and the data set includes
                                           10


measures of the mean, median, 80th, 95th, and 98th percentile of daily

observations in a given site for a given year.

        Sulfur dioxide concentrations have been determined by a number of well

accepted methods (see WHO, 1984). The reliability of these methods has been

checked in independent studies, and an intercomparison exercise was performed

using one particular method as a reference point (Bennett et al., 1985). It

was concluded that the measurements by alternative methods are roughly

comparable, although particular meteorological conditions can affect the

various methods differently. With these results in mind, we have chosen to

pool   our sample of observations of 502   concentration,    but to allow for a dummy
variable to   reflect the method of measurement at each site.

        Suspended   particles are measured by two main methods.    High volume

gravimetric sampling determines the mass of particulates in a given volume of

air while the smoke-shade method assesses the reflectance of the stain left on

a filter paper that ambient air has been drawn through. The former method

measures the total weight of suspended particles while the latter is

predominantly an indication of dark material in the air. Since the two

methods yield incomparable measures that capture different aspects of

particulate   air pollution, we treat the data generated by gravimetric and
smoke-shade methods separately in our analysis.7
        Table I provides the mean,   median     and standard deviation   for the 50th

and    95th percentiles of daily observations in our sample of cities for each of

        A few sites used nephelometric methods to measure suspended particles;
i.e., they measured the light loss due to scattering when a light beam is passed
through   a sample of particle-laden air. This method gauges the mass of suspended
particles, much as does the high volume gravimetric method. Since the estimates
are comparable in many cases, we pooled the observations from these two types of
instruments, but included a dummy variable to allow for device-specific
measurement    differences.

 the three types of pollution. Figure 1 displays the
                                                         corresponding histograms.
The median   of   daily observations on SO2 range from a minimum of zero to a

maximum of 291 micrograms per cubic meter (pg n13) of air, whereas the 95th

percentile of daily measures range from zero to 1022 pg m3.8 These numbers

can be compared with the World Health Organization recommendation that annual

average SO2 concentrations ought not to exceed 40-60 pg m and that 98th

percentile concentrations ought not to exceed 100-150 pg m3. The median of

daily observations for suspended particles varied from zero to 715 pg nC3

while that for the 95th percentile observation ranged from [5 to 1580      pg

The WHO guidelines for suspended particles list 60-90 pg nC3 as the safe limit

for the annual mean and 150-230 pg        as the safe limit for the 98th

percentile. Finally, the median of daily observations of dark matter (or

smoke) in the sample of sites varied from zero to 312 pg m3, while the 95th

percentile observation varied from two to 582 pg m3. The WHO recommends that

dark matter not exceed 50-60 pg & in annual average and 100-150 pg nC3 in the

98th percentile of daily observations.



1.2 Estimation

      Concentrations of pollutants in the air depend upon the amounts that are

emitted by natural and anthropogenic sources and on the ability of the

atmosphere to absorb and disburse the gases or particles. Thus, our analysis

of the relationship between growth and air quality must allow for an influence

of city and site characteristics on the observed concentrations of the various

pollutants in addition to the dependence on national product.



     a Actlly, SO concentrations are never literaLly zero, but the machines
are unable to detect very low levels of the gas.
                                          12

         We have sought to explain the median and 95th percentile of daily

observations for SO2 suspended particles (gravimecric and nephelomecric

methods) and dark matter (smoke-shade method). As explanatory variables, we

have included functions of per capita GOP in the country where the site is

located, characteristics of the site and city, and a time trend. We used the

Summers and 1-leston (1991) data for per capita CD?, which attempt to measure

output in relation to a common set of international prices. Initially, we

allowed the coefficient on per capita CD? to vary across income ranges by

including a dummy variable in our regressions for each $2,000 interval of per

capita GDP. These relatively unrestricted regressions suggested that a cubic

function of per capita CD? would fit the data fairly wellS The cubic

equations are the main focus of our subsequent analysis.9

         In the equation for concentrations of SO2, we included dummy variables

for the location within the city (central city or suburban) and for the land

use of the area near the testing site (industrial, commercial, or

residential). We also included a dummy variable for the method of measurement

<gas bubbler or otherwise). Another dummy indicated whether the city was

Located along a coastline or not (reflecting the disbursement properties of

the local atmosphere). We included a variable for the population density of

the city and a dummy variable for whether the city was located in a country

ruled by a Communist government.'6 Finally, a linear time trend was included

Co    allow for the possibility that pollution has been abating (or worsening)

      We also estimated equations in which we entered per capita GDP in
quadratic form. In general, the quadratic equations do not fit quite as well as
the   cubic equations, though in many cases the shape of the estimated   relationship
between   income and pollution is found to be roughly the same.
    ' Population densities were collected from several different sources.
These sources and other details of our data set are available upon request.

worldwide, in response to increased global awareness or for other reasons)'

       The regressions for suspended particles and dark matter included a

similar sat of right-hand-side variables, except that we did not include a

dummy variable for the method of monitoring dark matter, because all

measurements were taken in the same way. Since dust is an important natural

source of particulate matter, we included as an additional explanatory

variable a dummy that indicates whether the measurement site is located within

100 miles of a desert.'2

       Some commentators have argued that a country's level of pollution might

be directly related to its openness to international trade, perhaps becAuse

environmental regulations tend to a least common denominator. To test this

hypothesis, we estimated one set of regressions in which we included the trade

intensity of the country in which the site is located (ratio           of the sum   of

exports     and   imports to CDP)   as   a separate determinant of the concentration of

the   air   pollutants)3
       For each pollutant, we estimated a random effects model, allowing for a

component of the error term that is common to a given year's observations at
different sites located in the same city." We find that the variance of the

 sample, but the estimates of this model strongly suggested a simple, linear time
 trend.
                                                                    for Cordoba.

         However, we coded the desert dummy variable as zero

 the nearby desert. The regressions fit somewhat better
 way, although none of our conclusions    about the relationship  of particulate
 pollution to CDP depends upon this designation.

        That is, if     is the total residual in the equation for some pollutant
                                                                 where ait is the

common-to-the-city     component of the estimated residuals is relatively large in

comparison to the idiosyncratic (site-by-tine) component, so that ordinary

least squares would give an inconsistent estimate of the standard errors of

the regression. We also calculated one set of estimates that allowed for

fixed site effects, In other words, we included a separate dummy variable for

each   of the different sites in our various samples -  fixed effects were

conditions    at a site that might contribute to its ability to absorb or

disburse pollution. Of course, when we included the fixed site effects we

dropped the dummy variables reflecting the location of the site within the

city and the location of the city on a coastline or near a desert, since these

influences were no longer separately identified. The model with fixed site

effects provides an especially stringent test of the relationship between

national income and pollution, inasmuch as it ignores all information

contained in the cross-country variation in pollution levels and relies
instead only on the variation in air quality that resulted at the various
sites from changes in CDP during the twelve years of GEMS observations (and
then   only that part of the variation that cannot be explained by a common

linear time trend).




1.3 Findings

       The results of our various estimates of the random effects models for

the three pollutants are given in Tables 2-4. These regressions do not

include the model with fixed site effects, which we discuss separately below.

per capita COP in the range from zero to $2,000. The figure also shows the

estimated amount of extra pollution that is associated

approximates well the shape of the relationship between pollution and GOP that

is indicated by the less restrictive regressions,

the broad range between $5,000 and $14,000 (1985 U.S. dollars), and then

levels off or perhaps begins to rise again.'1 The turning point in the

for a renewed positive relationship between national product and SO2 pollution

predicted relationship for the median of daily observations comes at $4,119,

while that for the 95th percentile observation occurs at $4,630. We estimate

that a country with per capita CD? of $5,000 will have a 20 pg nC3 greater

concentration of 502 for the 95th percentile of its daily observations, as

compared to a country with a per capita CD? of $1,000, all else equal.

Table 2 indicates that the hypothesis that SO2 pollution is unrelated to the

level of CD? can be rejected at the 1/100th of one percent significance level

in the regression for the median observation and at the seven percent level in

the regression for the 95th percentile observation (see columns 2 and 5).

      Table 2 reveals that several other variables contribute significantly to

the cross-city variation in concentrations of SO2.     For example, cities

located on a coastline are estimated to have lesser concentrations of S0:

6.68 pg m3 lower for the median of daily observations and 46.79     pg m3 lower

for the 95th percentile observation. Concentrations of 502 are higher in the

center city than in the suburbs, lower in residential areas than in commercial

areas, and higher in industrial areas than in commercial areas (although this

effect is not statistically significant at conventional significance levels).

More densely populated cities suffer greater concentrations of SO2, all else

equal. We also find that SO2 pollution has been significantly greater in

cities Located in Communist-ruled countries. Finally, we note that 802 levels

have been trending downward in our sample of cities even after controlling for

the effects of income and other variables. The downward trend may reflect an

increasing global awareness of the health probLems associated with SO2, and

the expanding efforts that are being made worldwide to limit suLfur emissions.

     Columns 3 and 6 of Table 2 present estimates of a model for 802

determination   that   includes trade intensity as an additional explanatory

variable, Contrary to the fears of some environmentalists, we find that 502

Levels are significantly lower in cities located in countries that conduct a

great deaL of trade (relative to their GOP). We have no good economic

explanation for this finding.

      Figure 4 depicts the estimated (cubic) relationship between dark matter

and per capita CDP for the median and 95th percentile of daily observations.

Apparently, the nature of the relationship is much the same as for 502. The

concentration   of smoke in the air rises with per capita GOP at low levels of

income, peaks at around $5,000 (1985 U.S. dollars). and faLls with GOP at

higher income levels until it eventually levels off. We see in columns 2 and

5 of Table 3 that the three CD? variables are jointly significant in the

determination of dark matter pollution at the 1/100th of one percent
significance level. Moreover, the size of the estimated effects are quite
large. We estimate that a country with a per capita CD? of $5,000 will have a
higher concentration of smoke by about 90 pg     in its median of daily
observations    and 220 pg m3 in its 95th percentile observation, compared to

one with a per capita COP of $1,000. Recall that the WHO recommends that

concentrations of smoke not exceed 50-60 pg m for the mean observation and

100-150 pg of3 for the 98th percentile observation.

      Not surprisingly, the dummy variable indicating proximity to a desert

has a positive and significant coefficient in the regressions explaining

concentrations of dark matter. A location on a coast reduces a citys

 concentration of this type of pollution, and   again   the effect is statistically

 significant. We find that smoke pollution levels are greater in center cities

 than in suburbs, and smaller in residential areas than in commercial areas.

 Also, dark matter, like 502, rises with population density, although this
                                       18

effect is significant only in the regression for the median of daily

observations. Finally, there appears to be neither a global trend in this

type of pollution (once the upward movement in world incomes has been

accounted for) nor a significant association with trade intensity.

       Unlike the other two pollutants, the mass of suspended particles in the

air appears to fall in response to increases in per capita GD? at low levels

of economic deveLopment (see Figure 5). This relationship continues until per

capita GOP reaches about $9,000, whereupon economic growth has no further

effect on the concentration of suspended particles. Again, the estimated

effects are large in comparison to the WHO guidelines, and again the three CD?

variables are jointly significant in the determination of this measure of air

quality.

       As with dark matter, cities situated near to a desert are likely to

experience higher concentrations of suspended particles than cities located

elsewhere. This effect is both quantitatively large and highly significant.

The coefficients on the Communist dummy, the center-city dummy and the

industrial area dummy all are positive and statistically significant in the

regressions for both the median and 95th percentile of daily observations.

The global trend in suspended particle pollution apparently has been downward,

although the coefficient on the year variable is statistically significant

only in the regressions for the median of daily observations. Finally, a

country's trade intensity has a small and statistically insignificant effect

on this form of pollution.

        Table 5 reports the estimated coefficients from a random effects model

for   each type of pollutant that also allows for fixed site effects. The
numbers of site dummy variables that were included in the various regressions
                                      19


are shown in the table. These estimates of the relationship between per

capita GD? and the various measures of air quality rely only on the

covariation between GD? and concentrations of the pollutants over time within

the individual sites, and not on the cross-country variation in pollution and

GD? at a given moment in time. The estimated relationships    for the median of

daily observations of s2 and dark matter hold up remarkably    well. (see Figure

6). In each case, the data continue to indicate an inverted-U shaped

relationship between pollution and national income with peak levels of

pollution occurring for per capita incomes in the range from $4,000 to $5,000.

Only the estimated coefficients from the fixed site effects modeL for

suspended particles suggest a different relationship between per capita GD?

and concentrations of the pollutant than is found in the regressions without

site effects. In this case, the estimation indicates a monotonically

increasing relationship between particulate pollution and national output in

 the sample range of output levels.



 1.4 Implications for Mexico

       Unfortunately, Mexico has not participated in the GEXS project and

 reliable measures of its air pollution are not available (US GAO, 199lb).
                                                 from relationships that hoLd in

 and economic output ceases when the typical country reaches a per capita

Heston (1991) put Mexico's per capita CDI' in 1988 at $4,996. Thus, we might

expect that further growth in Mexico, as may result from a free trade

agreement with the United States and Canada, wild lead the country to

intensify its efforts to alleviate its environmental problems.

        Recent measures taken by the government of Mexico suggest that the

country already may have reached the turning point in tens of air pollution.

In the last year, the Salinas government has reduced the lead content of

petrol, ordered several power stations to burn natural gas instead of sulfur-

generating fuel oil, and shut down oil refineries and private firms that were

found to be major sources of air pollution (The Economist. May 18, 1991).

Also, new cars are being fitted with catalytic convertors, a new fleet of

cleaner buses has been introduced, and drivers have been banned from using

their cars in Mexico City one day each week. To beef up enforcement, the

budget of the environmental protection ministry has been increased sevenfold

(New York Times, Sept. 22, 1991). Further growth may enable the government to

implement fully its planned $2.5 billion, four-year program to clean up Mexico

City.



2 Pollution Abatement Costs and the Pattern of U.S. -   Mexico Investment

   and Trade

        A main source of concern about a NAFTA is that it will enable firms to

circumvent U.S. environmental protection laws. If the costs of meeting

pollution controls are high in the United States and low or negligible in

Mexico,    then the asymmetry in standards or enforcement efforts can create a
competitive advantage for Mexican producers and can motivate U.S. fins to
relocate    their production facilities south of the border. In these
                                        21

circumstances liberalization of trade and investment flows can strengthen the

incentives for "environmental dumping

      A number of authors1 including for example Pethig (1976), Siebert

(1977). 'lobe (1979) and KcGuire (1982), have studied the theoretical

relationship between environmental regulations and the pattern of trade. They

find that strict environmental standards or costly controls    weaken a country's

                                              industries and diminish its
competitive position in pollution-intensive

that fail to regulate industrial pollutioo increase their specialization

activities that damage the environment. Kccuire has extended these results to

include direct foreign investment: controls cause firms active in the

pollution-intensive industry to relocate their activities to the less

regulated countries.

      While these theoretical predictions are plausible and intuitive,      they

                                                   studies of trade and
have found little support in previous empirical

the pattern of U.S. imports from Mexico and the pattern of U.S. foreign

investments in Mexico- There is some evidence from a GAO survey suggesting

that a few American furniture manufacturers may have moved their operations to

Mexico in response to the State of California's tightening of air pollution

control standards for paint coatings and solvents (US CAO, l991c). But the

question remains open as to whether the overall sectoral pattern of U.S.

economic relations with Mexico has been meaningfully affected by the higher

costs of pollution abatement in the United States. If the pattern of

specialization has been so influenced, then the composition effect of a

further liberaLization of trade and investment may be damaging to the

environment.

      Using data from   the   Bureau of Census' 1988 survey of pollution abatement

costs in American industries (U.S. DOC, 1988). we have conducted three sets of

tests. We have studied the 1987 pattern of U.S. imports from Mexico in 3-

digit SIC manufacturing industries, the pattern of 1987 U.S. imports from

Mexico that have entered the country under the offshore assembly provisions

(again at the 3-digit SIC level), and the sectoral pattern of value added by

maquiladora plants in (approximateLy) 2-digit industry categories. In each

case we have investigated whether pollution abatement costs in the United

States help to explain the pattern of Mexican specialization and trade.

      Our estimates of the determinants of the pattern of manufactured imports

from Mexico are recorded in the first two columns of Table 6. We use the

ratio of 1987 U.S. imports from Mexico to total U.S. shipments in the same

industry as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables include factor

shares (reflecting the intensity of use of the various factors by the

different industries; see Harkness (19781), the U.S. effective tariff rate on
                                        23

imports of goods in the industry, and the ratio of pollution abatement costs

(operating expenses) to total value added in the U.S. industry.16 1e also

report another regression that includes the average injury rate in the

industry as an additional independent variable. Since firm outlays for worker

compensation insurance are roughly proportional to injury rates (Krueger and

Burton, 1990). the injury variable proxies for one (large) component of the

cost to American manufacturing firms of U.S. labor protection laws.

     We computed the factor shares as follows. Je took the payroll expenses

in an industry to represent a combined compensation for unskilled or "raw"

Labor and human capital. Payments to unskilled labor were defined as the

product of the number of workers in the industry and the economy-wide average

yearly income of workers in manufacturing with less than a high school

education. We formed a share by dividing this amount by value added, and

considered the remaining part of the total labor share to represent the

payment to human capital.11 Finally, we calculated the share of capital in

value added as the difference between one and the total payroll share.t619


     16
        The Cen5us survey did not include the apparel industry (SIC category 23).
For these observations and four others with missing data, we inserted the average
ratio of pollution abatement costs to value added for all manufacturing sectors
included in the survey.

        For tvelve industries, this method gives a negative number as the
estimate of the share of human capital. To ensure that our results were not
sensitive to the choice of income for an unskilled worker, we also computed
factor shares using the income level for unskilled workers ($10,819) that wade
                                                                            The

shipments is smaller in industries that are highly intensive in their use of

human or physicat capital. This means, of course, that Mexico exports to the

United States goods that have a relatively high share of unskilled Labor in

total factor cost. The coefficients on the physical. and human capital

variables both are statistically significant at the five percent level, but

the latter coefficient is quantitatively much larger. We estimate that a ten

percentage point increase in the share of human capital reduces the ratio of

imports to shipments by 0.52 percentage points, while a ten percentage point

increase in the share of physical capital lowers the import ratio by only 0.24

percentage points. Note that the mean ratio of imports to shipments across

all manufacturing industries is 0.69 percent.

      We estimate that the import ratio rises with the share of pollution

abatement costs in U.S. industry value added, as would be predicted by a model

of environmental dumping. However, the impact of these regulatory costs is



according to the old (1972) SIC categories, we used manufacturing census data
that were bridged to this classification scheme. The average income for a worker
in the manufacturing sector with less than a high school education was calculated
from the 1987 Current PQvulation Survey by the authors. Injury rates by industry
were taken from the Eureau of Labor Statistics publication. Occunational Injuries
and Illness in the United States by Industry. In the few cases where an injury
rate was not available for a three digit industry, we used instead the average
injury rate for the applicable 2-digit industry.
     '  We are also experimenting with a second procedure for dividing the labor
share into component parts representing the shares of unskilled labor and human
capital. In this, we form factor share for different skill groups (workers with
a high school education, workers with some college education, and workers with
a college degree) by taking the product of the industry labor force, the fraction
of the industry's workers in the skill group in question, and the economy-wide
average income of workers in that skill group, and then dividing by value added.
If this procedure yields substantially different conclusions, we will report on
the results in a future draft of this paper.

 industry value added and another that has a ratio that is two standard

 deviations higher. We estimate that the latter industry will have a greater

 ratio of imports to U.S. shipments by about 0.05 percent, which is less than

 1/20th of a standard deviation in the import variable. This
                                                                    finding can be
understood from the fact that pollution abatement costs
                                                             average only 1.38

4.85 percent in an industry that is two standard deviations        above the mean.

The implied variation in competitiveness is small in comparison with that

which arises from cross industry variations in Labor costs, for example.

         We note that the injury rate has a positive coefficient when it is

included in the import equation, but this variable too has a very small and

statistically insignificant effect. Finally the coefficient on the tariff

variable has the theoretically predicted negative sign (imports are smaller in

industries with high effective tariff rates), but also is not significant.2°

         We turn next to the determinants of the pattern of U.S. imports from

Mexico under the offshore assembly provision (i.e., import      category 207.00 in

the old TSUSA tariff schedule). U.S. trade law provides for duty free re-

entry   of American-made   components embodied in imported final   goods.   In cases

where    intermediate   products are exported for further processing or assembly

abroad, the applicable tariff rate applies only to the foreign value added.

Nearly 44 percent of the value of Kexican exports to the United States

qualified for this customs treatment in 1987 (Schoepfle, 1991). We study

    20
       A simultaneity bias may exist here, insofar as many political-economic
theories of tariff formation predict that high tariff rates will endogenously
emerge in industries in which import penetration is great.

 these imports separately, because much of the
                                                  output by maquiladora plants
 enters the United States in this manner, and maquiladoras
                                                              are the source of

 sectoral pattern of item 807.00 imports gives us an idea as to the pattern of

maquiladora activity.                                                            -




         The middle two columns of Table 6 reports estimates of
                                                                an equation for
 the ratio of the Mexican value added in imports entering under the 807.00 code

in 1987 to the total value added by the U.S. industry. We would
                                                                     expect this
variable to be high in industries where maquiladoras are
                                                            especially active;
i.e. •   those in which Mexico enjoys a competitive advantage. The independent

variables in these equations are the same as before, namely the factor shares,

the share of pollution abatement-costs in U.S. industry value    added, and in

one set of estimates, the industry injury rate. The tariff variable was

omitted from these regressions because our effective tariff rate applies to

all imports from Mexico, and does not reflect the average tariff paid on

imports that entered under the offshore assembly provision. We use a tobit

model to estimate these equations in view of the fact that item 807.00 imports

are zero in 58 of the 136 Industry categories.- Since the import share cannot

be negative, a censored regression model is appropriate.

         The foreign content of U.S. item 807.00 imports from Mexico is highest

in relation to total value added in the corresponding U.S. industry in sectors

that make relatively intensive use of unskilled labor. This is not

surprising, since many U.S. manufacturers attempt to outsource to maquiladora

operations the most unskilled labor intensive phases of the production

process. We find a negative association between the Mexican content of item

807.00 Imports as a fraction of total U.S. industry value added and both the
                                      27

human capital share and the physical capital share in U.S. industry costs.

The coefficient on the physical capital variable is estimated to be nearly

twice as large in absolute value as that on the human capital variable

(reversing the ordering found for total imports from Mexico), and the former

coefficient is statistically significant at the five percent level whereas the

latter is statistically significant at only the ten percent level.

      Again, we fail to find a significant positive relationship between the

size of pollution abatement costs (as a fraction of value added) in the U.S.

manufacturing industry and the scale of sectoral activity in Mexico. In fact,

the foreign content of item 807.00 imports from Mexico appears to be lower in

relation to the size of the U.S. industry in sectors where U.S. pollution

abatement costs are relatively high. The negative coefficient on the

abatement cost variable is found to be statistically significant at the five

percent level, although this may of course reflect a spurious correlation

between these costs and some omitted variable. When the U.S. injury rate is

included in the equation for item 807.00 imports, the estimated coefficient on

this variable is also negative. This would imply that relatively little

Mexican assembly activity takes place in those industries where the cost to

US. employers of workers' compensation insurance and other accident-related

costs are especially high. However, in this case, the estimated coefficient

is not significantly different from zero, so we cannot reject the hypothesis

that the association between injury rates and the pattern of Mexican assembly

operations is nil.

      The final set of estimates recorded in Table 6 relate to the activity of

Mexican maquiladoras. The Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografia E

Informatica (INECA), a private Mexican research institute, has surveyed all
                                       28

maquiladoras on the government's List of in-bond producers. Their

publication, Eiadistica de Ia Industria Maouiladora de Exoortacion. 1978-

UM. provides data on value added by maquiladoras in eleven different

manufacturing industries. We developed a concordance of the available data to

a 2-digit SIC basis and sought to explain the ratio in 1987 of value added by

maquiladoras to value added in the corresponding U.S. industry.2' The

explanatory variables are defined as before, except that now we calculate

factor shares and pollution abatement costs as a fraction of value added at

the 2-digit SIC level.

      The estimated coefficients from the models of maquiladora activity

confirm our findings for total U.S. imports from Mexico and for imports under

tariff item 807.00. Again we find that Mexican competitive advantage derives

from an abundance of unskilled labor, and that value added by maquiladoras

declines in relation to value added in the United States the greater are the

shares of human and physical capital in industry cost. Although neither

coefficient has been estimated precisely enough to allow for a clear rejection

of the hypothesis that the associations are zero, the magnitudes of the

coefficients are very much in line with what we have found before. Also, we

find no evidence in support of the hypothesis that U.S. regulatory costs

contribute to the explanation of the pattern of maquiladora activity. Neither

the coefficient on the abatement cost variable nor that on the injury rate

variable has the (positive) sign that one would expect if American firms are

investing in maquiladora plants primarily to avoid the high costs of



     al We note that INECA withheld industry-leveL data for industries with
sixteen or fewer maquiladora establishments. Thus, our analysis treats as zero
the maquiladora activity in sectors where some small amount of production may
have taken place.
                                         29

environmental   and labor protection laws at home. Evidently, the costs

involved in complying with these laws are small in relation to the other

components of total cost that determine whether it is profitable to operate in

the United States or Mexico.



3 Resource Reallocation: Implications for Pollution

      Our findings in Section 2 suggest that relative factor supplies govern the

pattern of trade between Mexico and its neighbors to the North. We might expect,

therefore, that trade liberalization will stimulate Mexican production in

unskilled labor-intensive industries, while the United States and Canada will

shift resources into sectors that make relatively heavy use of capital and

skilled labor. The removal by Mexico of barriers to direct foreign investment

can have the opposite effect on international patterns of specialization, if

foreign   firms bring with them the factors that are scarce in Mexico.   Then local

production  may expand in (moderately) capital and skilled-labor intensive
sectors. The question that arises is, what are the environmental, implications
of these potential resource reallocations?
      To answer this question fully, we need several pieces of information.

First, we need to know which sectors will expand in each country, and to what

extent.    Second, we need to know the pollution-intensities of the various

industries.     Finally, we must know how NAFrA will affect the production

technologies used in each location, so as to gauge any changes in pollution

generated per unit of output.     Estimates of NAflA impacts on the production

structure in each country are available from computational modeling exercises.

Brown, Deardorff, and Stern (1991), for example, have predicted resource

movements for several different scenarios of policy change under a NAFTA.
                                        30

Unfortunately, the remaining informational requirements pose more serious

difficulties. Concerning the pollution generated by different industries, the

United States collects data only on releases of toxic waste (and that of

questionable quality), while Mexico coLlects no such data whatsoever.          And

although our findings in Section 1 suggest that production techniques might well.

change in response to a trade agreement that generates economic growth in Mexico,

it is difficult to assess how these changes will be distributed across

industries.

      In this section we draw upon the detailed estimates of Brown, Deardorff,

and Stern (BBS) to derive some possible environmental implications of the

resource reallocations that would result from a NAFTA. After describing the SOS

modeling exercise, we turn to two issues.        First, we discuss the model's

predictions about each country's demand for the services of utilities. Second,

we use the information available in the U.S. EPA's Toxic Resources Inventory to

analyze how a NAFTA might affect releases of hazardous waste by the manufacturing

sectors in the three partner countries.

      The BbS estimates are based on a computable general equilibrium model of

the economic interactions between the United States, Canada,   Mexico,   a group of

31 other major trading nations, and an abbreviated fifth region comprising the

rest of the world.     The model aggregates production into 23 categories of

tradable goods and six categories of non-tradable goods and services.          The

industries are treated either as perfectLy competitive or monopolistically

competitive, with the latter set exhibiting economies of scale. Output in each

sector is produced from intermediate inputs and an aggregate of capital and

Labor. The authors allow for varying degrees of substitution between capital and

labor in the different sectors, but treat labor as a homogeneous input. The
                                            31

 latter assumption is unfortunate in view of our
                                                     finding in Section 2 that human
 capital   endowments play a central role in determining the
                                                               bilateral trade pattern
 between the United States and Mexico.

       Since it is not clear what policy measures will be
                                                               included in a NAFTA, BDS

 explore a number of alternatives. In one scenario they
                                                           assume the removal of all
 bilateral tariffs between the United States, Canada and Mexico, and an easing of

U.S. quantitative restrictions that generates a twenty five percent increase in

U.S. imports of agricultural products, food, textiles, and apparel from Mexico.

In a second scenario they allow for these same forms of trade       liberalization and
also a relaxation of restrictions on direct foreign investment in         hexico. The
liberalization of investment is assumed to result in an (exogenous)        ten percent

increase in Mexico's capital stock. It should be noted that in both of these

cases, the estimated impacts include not only the removal of existing barriers

between Mexico and its trade partners, but also the ultimate implementation of

the policy changes that comprise the already concluded Canada-U.S. free          trade

agreement.

      It is well known     that   many pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitric

oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and       carbon   dioxide, are byproducts of electricity

generation, especially when fossil fuels are burned in the process. Thus, an

important    determinant of the net effect of trade liberalization on air pollution
will be the induced change in the demand for electricity. Unfortunately, the
disaggregation in the EDS model does not allow us to identify the      likely impacts

of a NAFTA on    electricity use, inasmuch as the model treats electricity as a
component of the broader category of utilities.         It is interesting to note,

nonetheless, that BDS predict a decline of 0.56 percent in output by the Mexican

utilities sector in response to a hypothetical agreement involving an elimination
                                       32

of tariffs and an increase in U.S. import quotas.          This prediction can be

understood from the fact that the scenario generates output contractions in ten

of twenty one Mexican manufacturing sectors, and expansions are anticipated

primarily in labor-intensive industries such as food, textiles, apparel, leather

products, and footwear, which presumably are not the sectors that use energy most

intensively. ut just as Mexico will shift resources into activities that

require relatively little energy input, the United States and Canada may be

expected to do the opposite. The model predicts modest increases of 0.07 percent

and 0.09 percent, respectively, in production by utilities in the United States

and Canada.

      Quite different conclusions emerge from the scenario that attempts to

capture the effects of a potential liberalization of investment flows.         The

exogenous ten percent increase in the Mexican capital stock that is taken to be

the outgrowth of an easing of restrictions on foreign investment effects an

expansion of every manufacturing industry there, with the implication that demand

for utilities must rise.    The experiment generates an increase in utilities

output in Mexico of 9.31. percent. Presumably, air quality would deteriorate in

this case, unless the associated thcome growth gave rise to political demands for

more stringent standards and tougher enforcement.

      We turn next to toxic waste.      Our   focus   on this form of pollution is

primarily a reflection of data availability. As far as we know, this is the only

type of pollution for which data on releases are collected at the      firm level.
U.S. law requires all manufacturing firms with ten or more employees that use at

Least 10,000 pounds of one or more of over 300 chemicals to report their annual

chemical releases to the EPA.       Lines of business are recorded along with

information on releases, enabling aggregation of the data to the industry level.
                                       33

      Several pitfalls in the use of the data contained in the Toxic Release

Inventory (TRI) should be noted.22 First, since the report reflects releases

rather than exposures, it cannot reflect the great differences that exist in the

rates at which different chemicals are dispersed or transformed.         Second,

releases are measured only in terms of weight, and no effort is made to account

for the fact that some high volume releases are relatively benign, while other

lower volume releases may create great health risks. Third, many toxic chemicals

are omitted entirely from the inventory. Fourth, the inventory does not reflect

emissions by firms outside the manufacturing sector or by federal facilities.

Fifth, the EPA conducts relatively little verification of the information it

receives and makes relatively little effort to ensure compliance with the

reporting requirements.     Finally, there is no way to know whether the

relationships between toxic waste and industry outputs in Canada and Mexico

mirror those in the United States, or whether there are great differences across

countries in the industry-specific relationships between hazardous waste and

quantities of output.

      We have used the predictions of the BDS model and the data on the industry

breakdown of toxic releases by U.S. manufacturing firms contained in the TRI to

generate Table 7. The table contains estimated impacts on total toxic releases

by the manufacturing industries of Mexico, United States, and Canada in response

to two scenarios for a NAFTA. As before, the scenarios distinguish a NAFTA that

effects only trade liberalization and one that also includes investment

liberalization measures in Mexico. In constructing the table we have assumed

that an industry-specific fixed coefficient characterizes the relationship

between the amount of toxic release and the quantity of output produced. We have


     22The following discussion is based on U.S. GAO (199la).
                                        34

calculated this coefficient using output and total release data for the United

States in 1989.23 To the extent that releases per unit of output are uniformly

higher or lower in Mexico or Canada than they are in the United States, the

estimates in Table 7 for these countries can be adjusted upward or downward to

reflect these percentage differences. But lacking data for Canada and Mexico,

we cannot address the possibility that these countries have higher or lower

pollution coefficients than the United States in some industries but not in

others.

      The table tells a similar story to the one told by the utilities sector.

A liberalization of trade in the absence of increased capital flows causes Mexico

to shift resources toward industries that, on average, generate less pollution

than its current producers. In particular, the EDS model predicts contraction

by the industries producing chemical products and rubber and plastics products,

both of which generate great quantities of waste per unit of output.          The

beneficial environmental effects of these resource flows are largely offset by

an expansion of the electrical equipment industry, but a small positive net

impact remains. The reallocation of resources in the United States and Canada

differ from those in Mexico, as. these countries enjoy comparative advantage in

a complementary set of activities.     The model predicts an expansion of the

chemical products industry in the United States, and of the primary metals

industry in Mexico, with the implication that aggregate chemical releases by

manufacturing enterprises will rise in both of these countries.

      Again, the scenario that assumes a ten percent increase in Mexico's capital




     23The output data, which were provided to us by Dnisilla Brown, are those
that were used in the calibration of the BDS model.        Since these data are
reported on an ISIC basis, we were forced to reclassify some industries in order
to make them compatible with the SIC-based TRI data.
                                        35

stock has quite different implications for Mexico. As noted before, such growth

in the capital stock causes output to expand in every Mexican manufacturing

industry. If the relationship between waste and output remains unchanged, then

total chemical releases must rise.

      While our estimates in this section must be taken with a large grain of

salt, they suggest conclusions that accord well with intuition. Since Mexico

enjoys comparative advantage in a set of activities (agriculture and labor -

intensive   manufactures) that on the whole are "cleaner than the average, the

composition effect of trade liberalization way well reduce pollution there. On

the other hand, a NAFTA will cause the United States and Canada to specialize

more in physical and human capital-intensive activities, to the possible (slight)

detriment of their local environments. On the global level, a net benefit may

derive from the movement of the dirtier economic activities to the more highly

regulated production environments.



4 Conclusions

      Environmental advocacy groups have pointed to several risks that might be

associated with further liberalization of trade between the United States and

Mexico. While they raise a number of valid concerns, our findings suggest that

some potential benefits, especially for Mexico, may have been overlooked. First,

a more liberal trade regime and greater access to the large U.S. market    is likely

to generate income growth in Mexico.         Brown, Deardorff and Stern (1991). for

example, estimate potential short run   welfare   gains to Mexico of between 0.6 and

1.9 percent of CDP.     We have found, through an examination of air quality

measures in a cross-section of countries, that economic growth tends to alleviate

pollution problems once a country's per capita income reaches about $4,000 to
                                       36

$5,000 US. dolLars. Mexico, with a per capita GOP of $5,000, now is at the

critical juncture in its development process where further growth should generate

increased political pressures for environmental protection and perhaps a change

in private consumption behavior. Second, trade liberaLization may well increase

Mexican specialization in sectors that cause less than average amounts of

environmental damage. Our investigation of the determinants of Mexico's trade

pattern strongly suggests that the country draws comparative advantage from its

large number of relatively unskilled workers and that it imports goods whose

production requires intensive use of physical and human capital.     The asymmetries

in environmental regulations and enforcement between the United States and Mexico

play at most aminor role in guiding intersectoral resource allocations,           But

since it would appear that labor-intensive and agricultural activities require

less energy input and generate less hazardous waste per unit of output than more

capitaL and human capital-intensive sectors, a reduction in pollution may       well

be a side-benefit of increased Mexican specialization and trade.

       Our findings must remain tentative until better data become available. Ve

have been unable to use any information about the pollution situation as it

currently stands hi Mexico, since environmental monitoring there has             been

unsystematic at best. Furthermore, the kinds of pollutants that we can examine

are limited by data availability (eg. ,     there   are no reliable data on emissions

 of carbon dioxide in different countries). Still, one lesson from our study

 seems quite general and important. The environmental impacts of trade

 liberalization in any country will depend not only upon the effect of policy

 change on the overall scale of economic activity, but also upon          the induced

                                                                          and in the
 changes in the intersectoral composition of economic activity

 technologies that are used to produce goods and services.
