FX Market Metrics: New Findings Based on CLS Bank Settlement Data
Joel Hasbrouck and Richard M. Levich
NBER Working Paper No. 23206
March 2017
JEL No. F31,G12,G15,G23

                                          ABSTRACT

Using a new and unique data set of foreign currency settlement instructions provided by CLS
Bank, we investigate activity and liquidity in the foreign exchange market. In the major currency
pairs, CLS settlement volume shares are similar to those reported in the BIS triennial surveys.
They are also similar to shares computed from EBS trade data reported by Mancini, Ranaldo and
Wrampelmeyer (2013)(MRW), but only for currency pairs that do not belong to the “UK
Commonwealth” pairs, for which EBS coverage is limited.

We estimate Amihud (2002) illiquidity ratios from CLS submissions and Olsen price records, and
examine the correlations between these ratios and price impact estimates based on high frequency
EBS data and reported by MRW. The correlation is 0.748, but with marginal statistical
significance and only when the commonwealth pairs are excluded from the analysis. When the
commonwealth pairs are included, the correlation drops to -0.130 (insignificant). We believe that,
as with the volume estimates, this reflects EBS’ limited coverage of the commonwealth currency
pairs. The common liquidity factor in our illiquidity ratios constructed from all major pairs is
highly correlated, however, with the factor based only on non-commonwealth pairs, suggesting
that liquidity factors constructed from EBS data may be good proxies for factors based on broader
samples.

Our data include numerical identifiers for counterparties to each trade which allows us to estimate
market concentration by currency pair. We find that trading is more concentrated (across
participants) in less actively traded currencies, which typically exhibit lower liquidity.

I. Introduction and Motivation

       The global foreign exchange (FX) market holds a pivotal place among financial

markets. Most international trade in goods and services as well as risk management of

international asset and liability positions depends on a liquid and efficiently functioning

currency market. With April 2013 global turnover estimated at $5.3 trillion daily, the global

FX market is acknowledged to be the world’s largest financial marketplace.1

       Despite its size and importance, common liquidity and activity measures for the FX

market are difficult to track. The FX market is a geographically dispersed, broker-dealer

market. There are numerous platforms and means for executing currency transaction, and

yet, there is no central institution that records transaction data in real time or after the fact.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Surveys provide the most

authoritative overview of FX market turnover – by currency, by country, by instrument, by

counterparty, by method of execution and other broad aggregate categories but only as a

snapshot every three years (Bank for International Settlements (2013)).

       Over the last twenty years, a small literature has developed which investigates

patterns of FX market activity and liquidity based on trade-level data. The data derive from

diverse sources, such as proprietary data provided by dealing firms, regulatory data

collected by central banks, bilateral messaging systems, limit order markets, and various



1 $5.345T is the value reported in the BIS Triennial Survey for April 2013. An updated
survey for April 2016 has recently been released (Bank for International Settlements
(2016)). Moore, Schrimpf and Sushko (2016) discuss the 2016 figures, and the changes and
trends evident since 2013. As most of our data cover April 2013, however, most of our
references to the BIS data are to the 2013 release. It should be noted that the 2016 survey
contains a minor restatement of the 2013 data: $5.345T has been revised to $5.355T.

aggregators/consolidators. Most recent studies of high-frequency FX trading, however, use

data from one of the two dominant electronic limit order markets: Reuters or EBS.

       Among the studies based on EBS data, Chaboud, Chernenko and Wright (2007) use

one-minute time-aggregated volume and price data to document intraday volume patterns

for the EUR/USD and USD/JPY spot exchange market, and in addition, to examine price and

volume responses to macroeconomic news announcements. Mancini, Ranaldo and

Wrampelmeyer (2013) (MRW) utilize one-second time-aggregated data for nine currency

pairs. Their sample period 2007-09 allows the authors to analyze liquidity before and after

the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, and also to identify a common factor that explains co-

movement in liquidity across the 9 currency pairs as well as liquidity in other principle

financial markets. Karnaukh, Ranaldo and Söderlind (2015) (KRS) use a longer sample of

EBS data covering January 2007 – May 2012 to estimate and explain time varying and

cross-sectional variation in FX liquidity. Like MRW, KRS find evidence of “significantly

stronger commonality in periods of market stress—as indicated by high FX and stock

market volatility, tight funding constraints (high TED spread), and losses of carry trade

portfolios.”2 Hagströmer and Menkveld (2016) study a sample of EBS data at 100-

millisecond intervals to characterize patterns of price discovery before and after the

January 15, 2015 revaluation of the Swiss franc.

       While these studies reflect rigorous analysis and offer many useful insights, they

also harbor certain limitations. Firstly, although EBS claims to be “the recognized primary


2 KRS also analyze low frequency (LF) daily data over the same sample period and find that
liquidity measured with LF data co-moves with HF measures. See King, Osler and Rime
(2013) for a critical survey of the FX market microstructure literature and Berger, Chaboud
and Hjalmarsson (2009) for a review of the literature on FX volatility.
                                                                                        Page 5


source of global transactional spot FX market data,” it is not uniformly preeminent. King,

Osler and Rime (2012) note that, “EBS has long dominated interbank trading for the EUR,

JPY, and CHF, while Reuters dominates the GBP, AUD, CAD, and the Scandinavian

currencies.” Secondly, EBS and Reuters together constitute a small fraction of the overall FX

market, 15.0% of daily spot FX turnover by our estimate. Most spot FX transactions are

executed via other means such as single bank proprietary trading systems, multi-bank

proprietary trading systems, voice communication either directly with a dealer or

intermediated by a voice broker, and so on. Thirdly, EBS bids and offers are visible and

accessible only between participants who have established mutual credit arrangements.

They are not uniformly available across all EBS participants.3 While it is likely that most

large banks have mutually established arrangements, smaller banks may not be as well-

connected. This would limit their ability to compete as liquidity suppliers. Finally, although

MRW construct their data from individual messages, the commercially available EBS

datasets are time-aggregated and report only summary data on the trades within a given

window.4



3 The document EBS Dealing Rules – EBS Market Appendix notes, “Each Participant must
establish a relationship with its Counterparties, satisfy itself of the creditworthiness of its
Counterparties and extend credit to them as it sees fit. For a Match to be made in EBS
Market between two Participants, mutual credit must exist between those Participants. If
credit has not been established with or given by another Participant, or when credit given
by or to another Participant is exhausted, the prices submitted by each Participant will not
be Dealable prices for the other,” (EBS (2016)).
4 A product description from EBS (2012) summarizes the features of “Data Mine 2.0” as

follows: “One second time-slice; Best bid/offer with volume; Lowest given, highest paid;
Actual volumes.” A more detailed description of the EBS Data Mine Record Format (2011)
provides additional information about the nature of the data. As EBS (2011, p. 2) describes
it: “The Price Record lists the EBS Best prices at the end of a time-slice, and the Deal Record
lists the highest paid and the lowest given deal prices during the period of a time-slice.”
                                                                                          Page 6


       The motivation for our research is to utilize a new database that seeks to overcome

some of these limitations and holds the possibility of offering new and/or more robust

insights regarding FX market conditions and liquidity based on high frequency data for a

larger sample of currency pairs. The new database comes from CLS Bank International (or

simply CLS Bank, or CLS) which operates a payment-versus-payment (PVP) settlement

service designed to mitigate settlement risk for the FX transactions of its settlement

members and their customers (known as third parties). Our data consist of submissions to

CLS that specify settlement instructions.

       We estimate that CLS submissions cover about 37.2% of global spot FX turnover

considered in the 2013 BIS triennial survey (after adjusting the BIS figures for prime

brokerage). In contrast, EBS covers about 7.3%, while EBS and Reuters combined account

for 15.0%. Thus, CLS coverage of the market is substantially more comprehensive in terms

of value. Furthermore, CLS coverage is more extensive across major currency pairs than

EBS. In particular, CLS activity in the (UK) commonwealth currencies is much closer to the

2013 BIS figures. It is not the case, however, that settlement data are superior in all

respects. We find that due to limitations of timeliness and sequencing, the settlement




Thus, there seems to be no representation or assurance that the one second time slice
captures all trading activity within that interval. While EBS may provide an authoritative
close-up of FX market conditions among FX traders who post quotes and execute trades on
their platform, the EBS data appear to fall short of reporting a complete record of actual
consummated trade prices and amounts – even those executed on the EBS platform. A
more enhanced product (“Data Mine 5.0”) offers time-slices matching EBS Live, all bids and
offers (up to 10 levels of book) with volume, and other features – but not actual trade and
volume data. As of September 2012, Data Mine 5.0 was only available to current EBS
customers.

instructions correspond only approximately to market transactions and quotes. Liquidity

measures based on the settlement data are therefore limited to estimates over broad time

windows.

       This paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we briefly describe CLS Bank

and its operations. Section III presents summary features of the settlement data. In

Section IV we discuss the BIS survey methodology, compare the coverage of BIS and CLS

samples, and perform a similar analysis for EBS data. Section V examines the properties of

the settlement network. In Section VI we augment the settlement data with bids and asks

(collected at a ten-second frequency), and discuss the extent to which settlements are likely

to correspond to market transactions. Section VII discusses Amihud liquidity measures. A

summary concludes the paper in Section VIII.


II. CLS Bank Operations

       A foreign exchange settlement is the last stage of the trade process, and constitutes

irrevocable transfers (in opposing directions) of the two currencies. It is initiated when the

two parties to the transaction separately submit instructions that name each other as the

counterparty, and specify the terms of the settlement (the amounts of the two currencies

being exchanged, who is receiving which currency, and when the settlement is scheduled to

occur). When the details match, the transfers proceed.

       A settlement is generally distinct from what might be considered, in other contexts,

a trade. An execution on an electronic platform, for example, would typically report price,

quantity, and a time stamp. The settlement instructions would also include counterparty

identifications, but would not identify the platform or any other attribute of the execution

process (such as the time stamp). There is another important distinction. Because many
                                                                                        Page 8


execution mechanisms, such as electronic limit order books or voice brokers, provide pre-

trade anonymity, the resulting trades are presumed to be arms-length transactions at

market prices. Settlements, however, are bilateral transfers, and the terms of the exchange

bear no necessary relation to current market prices. An exercise of an FX option, for

example, involves a transfer at the exercise price, not the current market price.

       CLS Bank operates the largest FX settlement service. Developed and owned by a

consortium of major banks, it began operations in 2002, and is generally considered to be,

“the sole multi-currency settlement system of its kind, offering both liquidity savings and

settlement risk mitigation across all the major currencies, and the only one that operates

on a global basis across all the major currencies,” (Financial Stability Oversight Council

(2012)).5 It was originally formed to address Herstatt risk, a reference to a 1974 incident

of settlement failures in the US dollar/Deutschemark market that involved transfers

between entities in different time zones.6 Herstatt risk is pernicious not simply because of

the loss of principal (which in the global FX market could be substantial), but also because

of a systemic cascade effect should dealers withdraw from the market and be unwilling to

quote and trade with their normal counterparties.

       As noted earlier, CLS Bank operates a payment-versus-payment (PVP) settlement

service which mitigates settlement risk in the FX transactions of its settlement members

and their customers. While the details of the entire system are complex, the general


5 The initials “CLS” denote “continuous linked settlement,” but the settlement procedure is
now generally characterized as “payment versus payment” (PVP). See CLS Group (2013).
6 On June 26, 1974, Herstatt Bank received Deutschemark settlement payments at its

offices in Cologne Germany, but was later that day closed down and forced to cease
operations by German banking regulators. It was thus unable to deliver US dollars to its
counterparties once US banks opened for business.
                                                                                       Page 9


principle is straightforward.7 Both counterparties independently submit to CLS Bank

detailed settlement instructions (“submissions”), which CLS then matches. On the agreed-

upon settlement date, during the settlement cycle window, CLS Bank receives currency A

from one counterparty and currency B from the other counterparty. Once both amounts

have been received and CLS has verified that all details match, CLS releases the funds and

pays out both counterparties. 8 Once settlement has been concluded, it is final and

irrevocable. If counterparty B fails to provide adequate funding, CLS suspends the failing

counterparty and takes remedial action to protect the full amount of counterparty A’s

principal, which avoids settlement risk.9 The transaction between A and B is left to settle in

some other manner.

       Because of the complex nature of the actual CLS system – e.g. the need for a real-

time gross settlements domestic payments system, the need for countries to accept the

legality of a foreign entity (CLS Bank) to deem a transaction final and irrevocable, and the

risk that CLS Bank accepts when dealing with counterparties – CLS is available only for a



7 For example, of transactions submitted to CLS, only those that are matched and not
rescinded will be settled, subject to satisfying certain risk tests. More detail on how CLS
works is available here: https://www.cls-group.com/About/CG/Pages/CorePrinciples.aspx
8 The FX market generally works on a “T+2” settlement schedule (or “T+1,” if both parties

are in North America). That is, when a spot trade occurs on day “T”, settlement instructions
are submitted to CLS contemporaneously, but these instructions specify that the transfer
should actually occur two days later. Forwards and far legs of swaps, of course, will have
varied settlement dates, and so will depart from this convention. The date-time stamps on
our data refer to the submission (of the settlement instructions).
9 The Allsopp Report, an influential document that prefigured CLS, refers to a “guaranteed

refund system,” wherein “counterparties are guaranteed that any settlement payment they
make will be cancelled or returned if their counterparties fail to pay what they owe,” (Bank
for International Settlements (1996)). This contrasts with the “guaranteed delivery
system” used in regulated futures and options markets, where counterparties post
collateral and a clearinghouse guarantees delivery.
                                                                                           Page 10


restricted set of eligible currencies, eligible products, and eligible counterparties or

members.

       In April 2013, there were 17 CLS-eligible currencies including the major G-10

currencies plus the Korean won, South African rand, and others.10 Collectively, these 17

currencies accounted for 93.7% of global turnover in the 2013 BIS survey although this

overstates the potential reach of CLS because both currencies as well as both

counterparties in a trade must be CLS-eligible to settle in CLS. Levich and Packer (2015)

estimate that turnover among all pairs of the 17 CLS currencies measures 90.46% of global

turnover.

       In April 2013, CLS settlement was available for spot FX trades, outright forward

contracts and FX swaps. Collectively, these three products accounted for 92.7% of global

turnover in the 2013 BIS survey. As of April 2013, CLS did not settle cross currency swaps

(representing 1.0% in the BIS Survey), however CLS added the initial and final notional

principal exchanges of cross currency swaps as CLS-eligible in November 2015. FX options

(representing the final 6.3% in the BIS survey) are a special case. The initial payment of an

FX option premium does not settle through CLS (the premium is simply a one-way payment

from the buyer to the seller). However, an option exercise is CLS eligible and appears as a

spot settlement when exercised. Section IV.A provides more detail.

       Direct participation in CLS is limited to settlement member financial institutions (63

in number, as of April 2013). CLS also allows for indirect access. Third parties gain access

by contracting with a member acting as a Third Party Service Provider (TPSP). In effect,


10The 17 currencies are listed in Table 2. Subsequently to our sample, in November 2015,
CLS added the Hungarian Forint.
                                                                                        Page 11


TPSPs act as gatekeepers to CLS, assume the risks of dealing with their third party clients,

and charge these clients for their services.11 Third party institutions can be commercial

banks, central banks, non-bank financial institutions, corporations and investment funds.

They may also be subsidiaries, affiliates, or other sub-units of settlement members. This is

significant because it precludes identifying any given member as a distinct and

independent economic agent. As of April 2013, there were over 9,000 third parties.

Although members and third parties have the right to submit eligible transactions for

settlement in CLS, they are under no obligation to do so. Bilateral settling (the accepted

practice prior to the start of CLS) is still an available option.12


III. Data and summary statistics.

       Our data sample consists of all submissions to CLS during April, 2013 (to

correspond to the 2013 BIS survey of global FX turnover). Each record corresponds to one

settlement, but reflects submissions by both sides. By convention, the first member to

submit settlement instructions is designated as the “trading party,” and the currency they

are receiving as the “buy currency”; the later submitter is considered the counterparty, and

their received currency is the “sell currency”. There is no economic content to these

designations, however, as the essentials of the settlement would be identical if the


11 “TPSPs process all payment instructions and funding on behalf of their customers.” CLS
Third Party Evaluation Guide, August 2013, p. 3.
12 A CLS survey of their own settlement members reported that bilateral netting was used

to settle 25.8% of turnover even for trades involving CLS-eligible currencies (CLS Group
(2014)). Members may also elect other settlement methods such as on-us (when the
counterparty holds an account at the member’s financial institution), bilateral netting, or
other PVP systems. Given the risk mitigation advantages associated with using CLS and the
large number of member counterparties, it is unclear why counterparties select bilateral
settlement. See Kos and Levich (2016) for further discussion.
                                                                                         Page 12


designations were to be reversed. The two parties to the settlement are identified by Bank

Interchange Codes (BICs) that are encoded to ensure anonymity. The data are time-

stamped with one-second precision. Appendix A summarizes further details.13

       Table 1 reports total sample counts and settlement values, categorized by CLS’

classification of instrument type. Spot settlements account for over 90% of all settlements

by number, but only approximately 25% by value. FX option exercises are imputed by CLS

based on an algorithm that identifies outlier prices.14

       In most of what follows we concentrate on spot settlements. Table 2 reports shares

of turnover by currency. The dominant currencies are the USD, EUR, and JPY. The

percentages total to two hundred because each settlement has two sides/currencies. The

percentages are very close to the corresponding figures from the BIS 2013 survey reported

for comparison purposes in the last column. (Section IV presents a more thorough

reconciliation.)

       The Table 2 percentages summarize the overall importance of a given currency, but

there is substantial variation across counterparty currencies. To illuminate this variation,

Table 3 reports for each currency, the relative occurrence (by value) of currencies on the


13 Each record reports the time when CLS accepted the submission of the trading party, the
accept time of the counterparty’s submission, and the time when the instructions were
matched. Because the trading party is designated when the first submission is processed, it
is the earliest. It is therefore closest in time to the trade or similar event that motivated the
settlement. References to “time” in this paper accordingly denote the trading party accept
times. Submissions are generally processed continuously, on arrival. In our sample,
however, each day generally contains one interval of three or four minutes where
submissions are queued and the accept times are batched. We estimate that this affects
about 0.4% of the observations. Data from 2016 onwards do not contain queued intervals.
14 FX swaps by definition involve a paired near and far leg. The near- and far-leg counts in

Table 1 are very close, but not exactly equal. We believe that the difference is due to minor
timing discrepancies in the database extraction of our sample.
                                                                                      Page 13


other side of the settlement. The percentages sum to one hundred across each row. For

example, the first row corresponds to the AUD: relative to the total value of all settlements

that have the AUD on one side, 77.8% (by value) have the USD on the other side.

       Table 3 confirms that while the USD is usually the dominant contra currency, there

are some notable exceptions. Its share is relative small for the Nordic currencies (DKK,

NOK, SEK), each of which is much more likely to be exchanged for EUR. In many currencies

(CAD, HKD, ILS, KRW, SGD, ZAR) the entry in the USD column exceeds ninety percent. This

may reflect the use of the USD as a vehicle currency: if a currency pair has no established

market, each may be converted to/from USD as an intermediate step. The KRW is an

extreme case in that all of the settlements involve the USD on the other side.

       Table 4 reports for each currency the distribution of settlement values. That is, each

time a given currency appears on one side of a settlement, we include the value of the

settlement. (The total number of observations is therefore twice the number of

settlements.) Across all currencies, the median settlement size is slightly under one million

USD equivalent, but there are notable extreme values. On the low end, with the exception of

the KRW, all currencies have at least one settlement valued at under one dollar. We

conjecture that these reflect transfers that have been set up to verify trading or settlement

processes. Even at the 25th percentile of the distribution, however, the sizes are generally

substantially smaller than the traditional minimum size on the interdealer platforms.

Chaboud, Hjalmarsson, Vega and Chiquoine (2009) note, for example, that the minimum

size on EBS over their 2003-2007 sample is one million units of the base currency

(generally EUR, GBP or USD). This suggests that the sample of participants and trades is

somewhat broader than the usual electronic platforms.
                                                                                      Page 14


       At the other extreme, the largest settlements in many currencies exceed one billion

USD. We surmise that these flows do not arise from trades on the usual execution

platforms, but may instead reflect pre-arranged transfers related to securities flotations,

foreign acquisitions, or repatriation of funds.

       Settlement instructions can be submitted at any time, but submissions received over

a weekend are queued until Sunday afternoon. Most activity is concentrated on weekdays,

and is further concentrated within the day in local RTGS (real-time gross settlement)

banking hours for at least one of the counterparties. (This is not a formal convention,

however, as CLS submissions do not require RTGS systems.) Figure 1 presents histograms

of settlement value by submission date, for currencies grouped according to geographic

region. (Dates are based on Central European Time.) The plots exhibit no discernible day-

of-week patterns, but given the short length of the sample, a pattern would have to be very

strong to be detectible.

       Figure 2 depicts histograms of values submitted for settlement by time of day (CET).

EUR and European non-EUR submissions are concentrated 9:00-17:00 CET. CAD and MXN

settlements peak roughly 15:00-17:00 CET, which corresponds to morning in the Western

hemisphere, but exhibit substantial activity later. The time distributions of USD and Asia-

Pacific currencies are distinctly trimodal.

       We will subsequently consider other features of the CLS data that characterize

liquidity and settlement patterns between members. As earlier mentioned, however, one

important purpose of this analysis is to place the settlement data in the context of other

measures of the FX market. We turn to this in the next section.
                                                                                        Page 15


IV. Reconciliation and comparison of the CLS settlement data with other sources

         BIS turnover estimates, EBS executions, and CLS settlements are all measures of

flow in the FX market, but they differ markedly in coverage and construction. In this

section, we survey these measures, and discuss agreements and discrepancies. We start

with the BIS survey figures, which we believe are the most comprehensive, and then turn to

CLS and EBS figures.

A. Comparison with BIS turnover.

         In its capacity as a “bank to central banks,” the Bank for International Settlements

has organized a survey of global foreign exchange market turnover since 1989. 15 The first

three surveys were limited to the foreign exchange markets and from 1998 thereon, both

the foreign exchange and the derivatives markets have been surveyed. The survey design

relies on participating central banks, which collect data from banks and dealers in their

jurisdiction and calculate aggregate national results. These data are provided to the BIS

which compiles global aggregates. The April 2013 survey included 53 central banks and

other authorities who in turn collected data from about 1,300 banks and other dealers in

their jurisdictions. The BIS surveys turnover in 5 categories: spot, outright forward, FX

swaps, currency swaps, and FX options. In addition, the BIS requests information as to how

the trade was executed (e.g. voice or electronic platforms), the type of counterparty (e.g.

other reporting dealer, non-financial institution, retail, etc.), the location of the

counterparty (local or cross-border), the tenor of the forward contract or swap, and

whether the transaction was facilitated using prime brokerage, along with sub-categories

of many descriptors. The survey is conducted in April to minimize the impact of national

holidays and end-of-quarter transactions which could distort the results.

       The gross totals in the BIS survey data simply aggregate the reported trades. In

these gross data, a transaction between a reporting bank and a non-reporting entity is

reported once. For example, if Citibank (New York) pays USD and receives EUR from a

retail customer or a mutual fund, there is one trade report (from Citibank). When both

sides of the exchange are reporting banks, however, there will be two reports. For

example, if Citibank (New York) receives 10M EUR from, and pays 12M USD to, Wells Fargo

Bank (San Francisco), both banks include the trade in their survey responses. To correct for

this, the BIS subtracts from the gross turnover one-half of the value of trades between

reporting banks. The correction is made in two stages. “Gross-net” turnover reflects

corrections for trades between reporting banks in the same survey jurisdiction (as in the

Citibank/Wells Fargo example). “Net-net” turnover additionally includes a correction for

reporting banks in different survey jurisdictions. For example, if Citibank (New York)

receives 10M EUR from, and pays 12M USD to, the Royal Bank of Scotland (London), the

trade is included in Citibank’s survey response to the Federal Reserve Bank, and also in

RBS’ response to the Bank of England.

       In the examples above, all parties to the trades are acting on their own behalf. There

is also a large and growing usage of prime brokerage agreements, wherein one institution

(usually a major bank) acts as a broker, facilitating trades on behalf of another (such as an
                                                                                      Page 17


institutional fund, hedge fund or other proprietary trading firm).16 For example, access to

EBS was originally restricted to the member banks belonging to the consortium that

developed it. Nowadays, under prime brokerage arrangements, other institutions can trade

on EBS through the sponsorship of a member, with the member essentially guaranteeing

the trade. This has altered the structure of the FX market, transforming what was strictly

an interdealer market into one with more direct customer participation.

       Suppose that hedge fund A trades with Wells Fargo, and A is using Citi as the prime

broker. There are several ways of characterizing the prime brokerage. One perspective (the

“one-trade” view) is that A has essentially done a trade with Wells Fargo, and that Citi’s role

is incidental, becoming substantial only if A were to default on settlement of the trade. The

“two trade” perspective imputes two exchanges: Citi’s with Wells Fargo, and A’s with Citi.

The one-trade interpretation emphasizes the ultimate counterparties to the trade. The two-

trade view focuses on the exposures to counterparty risk: A vs. Citi and Citi vs. Wells

Fargo.17



16 The 2013 BIS survey instructions specified reporting conventions for prime brokered
trades: “Prime brokers are defined as institutions (usually large and highly -rated banks)
facilitating trades for their clients (often institutional funds, hedge funds and other
proprietary trading firms). Prime brokers enable their clients to conduct trades, subject to
credit limits, with a group of predetermined third-party banks in the prime broker’s name,”
(Bank for International Settlements (2012)).
17 Neither perspective has an obvious and exclusive claim to validity. In fact, the question

of how to characterize the role of broker/dealer intermediaries arises in other markets,
and both of the above views appear in different contexts. In US securities markets, for
example, an agency trade (that is, one conducted by a broker on behalf of a customer) is
conventionally reported once. Nevertheless FINRA rules also allow for two reports in
“riskless principal trades,” as when, for example, a broker buys securities in a market and
simultaneously sells them to a customer. Even when two reports are submitted, however,
only one is considered a “tape” report, and included in the usual trading volume statistics
(see FINRA’s “Trade Reporting Frequently Asked Questions,” FINRA (2015)).
                                                                                      Page 18


       While we do not definitively favor one perspective or the other, we must attempt to

ensure that similar conventions apply when making comparisons across different data

sources. The CLS settlement data report a prime-brokered settlement once, as occurring

between the ultimate counterparties. The BIS survey instructions, on the other hand,

specify that when a reporting bank is acting as a prime broker it must report both legs of

the transaction as two separate deals (allocating them by instrument, currency and

counterparty). In addition, both legs are included in a turnover subtotal labeled “of which

prime brokered,” (o/wPB).

       To estimate single-counted turnover in the BIS data we subtract one-half of the

o/wPB from the net-net turnover. The following example illustrates the intuition. Suppose

that (hedge fund) A trades one unit with (proprietary trader) B; A uses Citi as a prime

broker and B uses RBS. From the BIS survey perspective, the trade can be diagramed as

                      . Citi reports both legs, as “2 units, o/w 2 are prime brokered.”

Similarly RBS reports “2 units o/w 2 are prime brokered,” for a total gross-gross turnover

of 4 units, o/w 4 are prime brokered. The double counting of the                trade is

corrected, leaving net-net turnover of 3 units. Subtracting one-half the o/wPB leaves

         , the correct single-counted volume.18, 19




18 This example is straightforward only because we have focused on one particular trade. In
discussions, BIS personnel have told us that the adjustment cannot be relied upon for
correcting the aggregate numbers, particular for trades in which only one side is prime
brokered.
19 BIS turnover figures also include transactions between related parties, defined in the

2013 survey instructions as, “trades between desks and offices, and trades with their own
branches and subsidiaries and between affiliated firms,” (Bank for International
Settlements (2012)). Transfers in which a bank “passes the book” between desks in
                                                                                      Page 19


       The BIS turnover figures are stated on a per (business) day basis, wherein the total

over April for a given reporting area is divided by the number of official business days in

the same reporting area. We cannot implement this calculation for the CLS figures because

we do not know the locations of our settlement parties. The CLS settlement volume is

highly concentrated on twenty-two days, however, and we therefore divide the totals by 22

to arrive at per day estimates.

       BIS and CLS both classify trades/settlements according to instrument type. Three of

the categories in principle agree: spot, outright forwards, and FX swaps (far leg). CLS also

reports the near legs of FX settlements, but the BIS survey asks reporting banks to include

only far legs.

       Both BIS and CLS have a category labeled “options”, but the classification differs

significantly between the two entities. In the BIS survey, reporting dealers are requested to

provide information on turnover for over-the-counter (OTC) FX options. In practice, this

implies options that are created de novo rather than exchange traded options that are

created once and then bought and sold in a public market. More specifically, reporting

dealers are asked to report the notional amount of the option implying that a call option on




different time zones, for example, would appear to fall in this category. It is difficult to
generalize about the extent to which these events constitute substantive legal and
economic transfers of ownership, but few would require that the transfer be finalized by
any settlement. The BIS tabulations do not break down these transfers by instrument, so
we cannot impute an adjustment to spot turnover estimates, but the size of such an
adjustment might well be large. The survey reports related party transactions across all
instruments for April 2013 as $817,995 million (per day, USD equivalent), or roughly 15%
of the $5,344,549 million total turnover.
                                                                                        Page 20


10M EUR is reported as 10M EUR volume regardless of the strike price or tenor of the

contract. At the same time, the BIS asks reporting dealers to exclude option exercise as part

of spot FX trading activity. The rationale could be that option exercise reflects a contract

that was struck earlier (possibly prior to the April 2013 survey period) and the BIS survey

is intended to gauge current market conditions and activities. In the CLS submissions,

option settlements arise from option exercises. These are identified by a CLS classification

algorithm that flags outliers, that is, settlements occurring at implied rates that differ

substantially from current market rates and presumably reflect the exercise of in-the-

money options.

       Table 5 reports BIS turnover for the spot, forward, and swap categories (line 1). The

next lines contain the corresponding BIS “of which Prime Brokered” figures (line 2), the

implied turnover net of the prime broker adjustment (line 3), the average daily CLS

settlement volume (line 4), and the ratio of CLS volume to BIS volume.

        In the spot category, CLS settlement volume extends to 37.2% of BIS spot turnover,

slightly over one-third. Although the CLS/BIS spot coverage might initially appear low, the

two sources are focusing on different market segments. The BIS turnover includes large

components representing reporting banks’ transactions directly with customers, including

retail and institutions that do not use prime broker arrangements. In the other two

categories, the CLS market share of swaps is comparable to that of spot trades, while the

share of outright forwards is substantially smaller.20



20The 2013 BIS survey estimates that other reporting dealers are the counterparties for
33.0% of the spot turnover, but only 26.7% of outright forward turnover. Thus, outright
forwards may be relatively underrepresented in the settlement data.
                                                                                     Page 21


B. Comparison with overall EBS and Reuters trade volumes

       EBS and Reuters report monthly averages of daily spot volume on their websites.

For EBS, the average daily volume for April 2013, $128,300 M, is indicated in Table 5 (line

6). This constitutes about 7.3% of BIS turnover net of PB (line 7). Comparison with line 5

suggests that CLS appears to cover about five times as much activity as EBS. Reuters daily

average spot turnover for the month is $133,000M (line 8). This figure reflects all Reuters

electronic systems (including Reuters Matching and FXall). The sum of EBS and Reuters

turnover accounts for 15.0% of BIS net of PB; CLS turnover is about two-and-a-half times as

large.21

C. Cross-currency comparisons with EBS

       Mancini, Ranaldo and Wrampelmeyer (2013) (MRW) report (in the internet

appendix) average daily EBS trade counts for nine major currency pairs. The subsample in

their data that most closely corresponds to a BIS survey is mid-September 2008 to

December 2009 (“post-Lehman”). A triennial BIS survey was conducted in 2010.




21The BIS survey classifies turnover according to execution method. In these statistics, EBS
and Reuters are combined into one category (“Reuters Matching/EBS”, a subcategory of
“electronic, indirect” turnover. The reported average daily turnover in this category is
$313,118M, a value substantially greater than $261,000M total based on the markets’ self-
reported figures. We believe that the discrepancy is largely due to prime brokerage: the
markets’ own figures would report only execution volume conducted on their systems,
implying a single-counting of trades. The BIS survey instructions state that for prime-
brokered trades conducted on indirect electronic systems, both legs of the trade should be
counted. Interestingly, the BIS numbers (inclusive of both legs) imply that the Reuters/EBS
share of spot turnover is $313,118M/$2,046,158M=15.3%, which is very close to the
15.0% reported in Table 5.
                                                                                     Page 22


       Table 6 reports activity measures for the nine MRW currency pairs, derived from

the 2013 and 2010 BIS surveys, CLS and MRW. The left side of the table reports average

daily flows; the right side of the table reports the corresponding percentage shares across

currency pairs.

       The BIS turnover figures in columns (1) and (2) are stated on a “gross-gross” basis:

both sides of the trade are reported and there is no adjustment for prime brokerage. The

CLS settlement volumes are similarly reported. (The total of $1,101B (column 3) is slightly

less than twice the $650,480M reported in Table 2 due to activity in other currency pairs.)

Column (4) reports the number of CLS settlement sides (twice the number of settlements).

Column (5) contains the EBS figures reported by MRW.

       Of particular interest are the market shares across currencies. The CLS percentages

for both number of settlements and turnover approximate the BIS 2013 survey turnover

percentages. A comparison of the 2008-9 EBS and 2013 CLS percentages, though, displays

differences that are consistent with prior beliefs and assumptions. Specifically, the EBS

share is markedly lower in commonwealth pairs: 1.2% (EBS) vs. 9.8% (CLS) for the

AUD/USD; 1.4% vs. 8.8% for the GBP/USD; and 0.6% vs. 5.3% for the USD/CAD.

Presumably, the flow that goes through CLS, but not EBS, in these pairs is accounted for by

other execution methods or venues (such as Reuters).22




22The totals in the bottom row of Table 6 are consistent with estimates presented earlier. If
one settlement corresponds to one trade, an appropriate comparison would be
                   CLS settlements vs. 50,217 EBS trades. The two numbers come from
different time periods, however. We adjust for this as follows. Using figures reported on
the EBS website, the average daily turnover over the approximate MRW sample (October
2008 through December 2009) is $143.2B. The April 2013 EBS figure of $128.3B
                                                                                        Page 23


V. Activity by BIC

       In this section we consider the structure of the FX market in terms of settlement

activity between particular counterparties. Each participant in the CLS system is identified

by a Bank Interchange Code (BIC). The BICs in our sample are anonymized so that while we

can trace the activity of a particular participant, we do not know its true identity.

       The correspondence between BICs and distinct economic or legal entities is inexact.

As noted earlier, direct access to the CLS system is limited to settlement members, but

many more entities use CLS as third-parties. A third-party might be separate from any

settlement member, but might also be a subsidiary or affiliate of a settlement member.

       Table 7 summarizes the distribution of trading activity across BICs by number of

sides (Panel A) and USD value (Panel B). All statistics (except the number of observations)

are reported on a per [business] day basis.

       There are 7,267 distinct BICs in the sample of spot settlements. The first row of

Panel A reflects all BICs that had at least one submission over the month. Most of these

have low activity: the representative BIC at the 90th percentile has only 1.86 submissions

per day. The remaining rows of the table reflect subsamples constructed by currency. For

example, a BIC is included in the AUD row if it had at least one side denominated in AUD

over the month. Also, the settlement activity (number or value of sides) in the row reflects




constitutes roughly a         change, in moving from the early period to the later. Applying
this adjustment to the 2008-9 EBS numbers gives an imputed April 2013 value of
                       . The imputed ratio of EBS trades to CLS settlements is
      . From Table 5, the ratio of CLS settlement volume to EBS trade volume is
      .
                                                                                      Page 24


only activity in the AUD. (Note that this differs from the subsampling for sides in other

tables.)

       The most active currencies by trading volume are generally characterized by larger

numbers of BICs, especially the USD and EUR. In almost all currencies, the distribution of

activity reflects a large number of low-activity BICs. The KRW is a notable exception in that

virtually all of its activity is confined to a small number of large BICs.

       Table 8 reports the distribution (across BICs) of the number of counterparties (that

is, other BICs).23 The first row of Table 8 summarizes settlement links across all currencies.

The classic hub and spoke interdealer network arises when a very small number of dealers

are mutually linked, but each peripheral customer is linked to one or two dealers. The EBS

interdealer platform, for example, started as a consortium of 13 dealers. Viewed in these

terms, the CLS network is more comprehensive. The representative BIC at the 99th

percentile of the degree centrality distribution has 107 counterparties.

       The rows in Table 8 below the first correspond to individual currencies. The sample

in a given row essentially reflects the sub-network of BICs that had at least one submission

in which the indicated currency appeared on one side. Although these currency networks

are smaller than the larger settlement network, they are in one sense better connected. For

example, the 95th percentile of the full network is 15 settlement parties. The corresponding

percentiles for the individual currency networks are uniformly higher.




23 In terms of network formalities, each BIC may be viewed as a node, and we impute an
edge (link) between two BICs if there is at least one settlement between them. The number
of counterparties is then equivalent to the degree centrality of the node (Newman (2010)).
                                                                                        Page 25


VI. Settlements and market prices.

       Since most settlements occur in connection with trades, it might be supposed that

there is a correspondence between settlement prices and market quotes. While this

correspondence is broadly valid, there are also some significant differences. In the first

place, the trades being settled are not necessarily arms-length transactions at market rates

(as in the case of FX option exercises, discussed earlier).

       The trading and settlement processes also place different priority on timeliness. In a

trading system (a limit order book, for example), trades are important informational

events. Users generally expect that price and quantity will be reported promptly (presently,

within microseconds). In settlement, on the other hand, while accuracy of price, quantity,

buyer identity and seller identity are important, promptness can be satisfied in seconds,

minutes, or longer. In balancing the conflicting goals of speed and accuracy, trade reporting

favors the former, while settlement favors the latter.

       To investigate the relation between market and settlement activity, we supplement

the CLS data with Olsen quotes for April 2013. Olsen Financial Technologies, a commercial

data provider (olsendata.com), has compiled historical bid and ask data for major currency

pairs. Their data derive from consolidators such as Reuters, Knight Ridder, GTIS and

Tenfore. Our data are constructed over ten-second intervals, and within each interval Olsen

supplies the first new bid-ask pair. In practice, these observations are close to the start of

the interval: the lag relative to the start of the interval had sample median of 0.46 seconds

and a 90th percentile of 2.51 seconds. While the CLS data cover twenty-two days in April

2013, the Olsen data are only available for twenty-one days.
                                                                                      Page 26


       We view these as indicative prices. They are not necessarily firm (available for

immediate execution) nor are they necessarily the best bid and offer available to any

participant. The Olsen data we use correspond to a subset of the CLS sample. There are ten

Olsen currencies (vs. seventeen CLS currencies); and thirteen Olsen pairs (vs. seventy-five

CLS pairs). The Olsen sample is concentrated in the major trading pairs, however, and so

approximately eighty-seven percent of the CLS spot trades occur in an Olsen pair.

       For each Olsen currency pair, Table 9 reports the sample average of the bid-ask

midpoint and distributional statistics on the bid-ask spread. The smallest observed spread

is indicative of the tick size (pip): 0.001 when JPY is quote currency, and 0.00001

otherwise.

       For purposes of illustration, Figure 3 depicts several views of EUR/USD activity on

April 17, 2013. Panel A plots the exchange rate for each of the roughly 180,000 trades that

CLS has designated spot or option exercise.24 The vast majority of the trades cluster around

a narrow band in the vicinity of $1.3100, suggesting that most of the transfers reflect trades

at market prices. Nevertheless, there are also many outliers, at rates ranging from about

$1.2200 to $1.4400. These are indicative of settlements that don’t correspond to arms-

length trades at market rates.

       Panel B of Figure 3 plots CLS spot trades, excluding those flagged as option

exercises. The extreme outliers have been removed (although others remain). With a

narrower band of exchange rates, Panel B provides better detail, revealing two more



24The CLS data include settlement instructions for options written at an earlier date and
exercised during April 2013. By comparison, BIS survey data include all FX options written
during April 2013.
                                                                                          Page 27


features of the data. First, the rates appear to exhibit high local variation. Visually, there is

substantial blurring of rates with nearby time-stamps. Secondly, there are clear hourly

effects, on-the-hour concentrations of trades at away-from-the market rates (at 9:00,

11:00, 12:00, and 13:00, for example). There is directional variation in the peaks: the rates

are sometimes above and sometimes below the market.

       It is useful at this point to compare the CLS rates with the Olsen prices. Panel C of

Figure 3 plots the midpoint of the Olsen bid-ask series for the day (with CLS trades now

shown in gray). Panel D provides detail for the late afternoon 16:00-18:00 subinterval. If

the CLS prices simply reflected the quote midpoint plus some mean-zero error, we’d expect

to see the quote midpoint (solid black line) to lie in the middle of the cloud of trade

observations. Instead, the midpoint line tends to define, along the time axis, the leading

edge of the cloud. This is most clearly visible in the full-day plot (Panel C) with the

exchange rate drop that starts shortly before 16:00, and in the detail plot (Panel D) from

17:00 to 17:10.

       The observed pattern seems consistent with submission delays in the CLS data. As

noted above, both parties submit instructions to CLS. However, these submissions are not

trade reports. They are not directly generated by the execution platform, and the execution

platform is not identified to CLS. For settlement purposes, it is essential that the parties to

the trade agree on buyer and seller identities, the price and the quantity, but submission

time and method of execution have little relevance.

       For purposes of assessing liquidity, however, accurately time-stamped records of

trade volumes and prices are highly useful. We therefore seek better characterization of the

CLS accept times. To this end, for each CLS trade, we look backwards to find the most
                                                                                        Page 28


recent Olsen quote consistent with the CLS exchange rate. The process is depicted in Figure

4 for two trades denoted A and B. For trade A, the backwards search identifies one earlier

compatible price, and one imputed delay,      . For trade B, the most recent compatible price

implies a delay of    , but there is another earlier price that would lead to a longer delay of

  . This procedure can therefore generally identify at best a lower bound to the delay. More

formally, denote by     the price of a CLS trade with a reported accept time of t. Searching

backwards from t, the trade is considered matched with lag                when

                                          , where          is the average bid-ask spread for

the currency pair.

       Table 10 summarizes the distribution of the imputed reporting lag for each currency

pair and the full sample. Most of the distribution lies within thirty seconds or less, and only

a negligible amount lies in the range of thirty seconds to ten minutes. Thus, if settlements

can’t be matched within thirty seconds, they generally can’t be matched within ten minutes

(or at all). Over the full sample, 95.3% of the CLS trades can be matched within thirty

seconds, but the remaining 4.7% can’t be matched within ten minutes. Across currency

pairs, match rates are generally good, but they are noticeably poorer for the JPY pairs. In

the GBP/JPY pair, 8.8% of the trades can’t be matched within ten minutes. We investigated

the sensitivity of the imputed delays to the match criterion. Using a more stringent match

criterion,                                        , 81.3% of the trades were matched within

30 seconds, but 18.6% of the trades couldn’t be matched within ten minutes.

       We conjectured that when the difference between the trading party’s accept time

and the counterparty’s accept time was small, the match rate would be higher, on the
                                                                                        Page 29


theory that close agreement was likely to be more indicative of automated (and more

timely) reporting. The data did not support this conjecture.


VII. Liquidity measures

       From the preceding discussion, it should be clear that the settlement data do not

closely correspond to the stream of market transactions. Most importantly, the ordering of

successive settlement records is unlikely to correspond to the ordering of the trades that

generated them. This limitation rules out liquidity measures based on ordered sequences

of trade prices, such as Roll (1984) or Hasbrouck (2009).

       As an alternative, therefore, we consider the measure suggested by Amihud (2002).

The Amihud illiquidity ratio is defined as                  , where     is the absolute value of

the return over some interval and Volume is the quantity traded. I is an inverse liquidity

proxy. It is analogous to Kyle’s lambda,                                  , where p is the

(signed) price change and the denominator is the cumulative signed order flow over the

interval (Kyle (1985)). Order is signed positive if buyer-initiated, and negative if seller-

initiated. For a single order,          and                                    , and so I and 

differ only by a scale factor, p. However, if the interval includes returns and order flows

that are take on positive and negative values, the absolute values used in the computation

of I will not aggregate correctly. Although the close correspondence between I and  breaks

down in this case, I is still commonly used as a proxy for .

       Because I is computed using summary measures of volume, the within-interval

ordering of transactions is irrelevant. The measure is not unaffected, however, by reporting

lags that shift volume outside of the interval.
                                                                                         Page 30


        We compute our estimates of I as follows. We initially compute illiquidity ratios over

all one-minute intervals with non-zero volume. For a given currency pair, let          denote

the illiquidity ratio on day d;                                 indexes the start of all 30-

minute intervals within the day; and               indexes minutes within the interval. Then




where        is the average of the log change in the bid and the log change in the ask over the

minute, based on the Olsen data, and multiplied by 10,000 (to arrive at basis points).25

             is the cumulative value of all CLS settlements in the currency pair (that is, the

average of reported buy and sell values, in million USD). As stated in these units, a value

        implies that a trade with a value of one-hundred-million USD would be associated

with an exchange rate change of                                 . To mitigate the influence of

outliers in trading volumes and returns, we report the medians of the one-minute I ratios.

        Table 11 reports the median illiquidity ratios and confidence limits (computed

under the assumption that the one-minute observations are independent). Across pairs, the

median ratios are generally in the range of approximately 0.01 (for EUR/USD and USD/JPY)

to 0.10 (EUR/GBP, and so forth).

        Among the set of estimates, the illiquidity ratio for the GBP/JPY pair, at 0.7192,

stands as a striking outlier. It might be conjectured that this is a sample artifact. At the

beginning of April 2013, the Japanese government announced a more aggressive monetary


25 As noted above, our Olsen data are observed at a ten-second frequency and consist of the
first bid and ask pair observed in a ten-second window. For purposes of constructing
returns, of course, it would be preferable to have prices from the end of each ten-second
window.
                                                                                           Page 31


policy intended to curb deflation. JPY volatility increased, which would directly affect the

numerator of the estimated illiquidity ratio. On the other hand, the illiquidity ratios for the

two other JPY pairs (the EUR/JPY and USD/JPY) are much lower. This suggests that JPY

volatility is unlikely to have been the sole cause of the elevated I.

        The analysis of contra-currencies in Table 3, however, suggests another major

consideration. While both the EUR and USD are actively traded against the JPY (18.2% and

75.2%, respectively), GBP volume is much lower (2.2%). It is the combination, therefore, of

high volatility in the JPY and low volume in the GBP that causes the elevated GBP/JPY

illiquidity.

Comparison with other measures

        Mancini, Ranaldo and Wrampelmeyer (2013) discuss a wide range of liquidity

measures based on precisely time-stamped quote and trade data from EBS. As noted above,

the correspondence between settlement records and trades is not sufficiently strong to

support estimates of the MRW measures, which is why we focus on time-aggregated

illiquidity. There is nevertheless one MRW measure which bears a strong similarity to the

illiquidity ratio: the price impact coefficient. Like the illiquidity ratio, the price impact

coefficient can be viewed as a proxy for Kyle’s lambda. MRW estimate it as          from the

specification:




where is the return on a given currency pair and          refers to the ith one-second interval on

day t. The order flow measures       and    refer respectively to the number of buyer- and
                                                                                         Page 32


seller-initiated trades in the interval. The difference is therefore the net order flow.26

MRW’s median price impact estimates (from their internet appendix table IA.III) are

reported in the last column of Table 11.

       Figure 6 depicts a log-log scatterplot of the price impact coefficients and illiquidity

ratios. Visually there appears to be a weak positive correlation between the two measures,

but the dependence becomes stronger if we exclude the commonwealth currency pairs.

More formally, if we include all pairs, the correlations are -0.130 (Pearson) and 0.250

(Spearman), with neither statistically significant. If we exclude the commonwealth pairs,

the correlations are 0.748 (Pearson) and 0.886 (Spearman). The estimated type-I error

probabilities are 0.087 (Pearson) and 0.019 (Spearman), however, and given the small

sample size, we view these results as suggestive rather than definitive.

       That the commonwealth price impacts estimated from EBS data are outliers is

nevertheless consistent with the fact that EBS is not the dominant trading platform for

these currencies. Since EBS is relatively illiquid, it is not surprising that estimated price

impacts are outliers on the high side.

       A key contribution of MRW, however, is the construction and interpretation of a

liquidity risk factor. It is quite possible that even though EBS-based impact measures are

misleading for some currency pairs, dynamic variation in the common factor can be well-

estimated from those remaining. To examine this possibility further, we construct common



26There are several differences between the present paper’s illiquidity ratio and the price
impact coefficient . The major one is, of course, that the impact coefficient specification
uses a signed return and order flow, while the illiquidity ratio uses unsigned return and
volume. Another point of difference is that    is based on buy/sell counts; the illiquidity
ratio uses USD volume. Finally, the    specification includes lagged signed order flows.
                                                                                       Page 33


factors from our illiquidity ratios using all nine MRW pairs and also, alternatively, from the

six non-commonwealth pairs. To avoid variation associated with intraday patterns, we use

daily means of the illiquidity ratios (twenty-one days, nine currency pairs). We use three

approaches to constructing a daily common factor: the arithmetic mean of the illiquidity

ratios, the first principal component constructed from the correlation matrix, and the first

principal component constructed from the covariance matrix, for a total of six candidate

factors.

       Table 12 reports the correlations between these factors. It is emphasized that the

sample is limited to the twenty-one days covered by the Olsen data , and the reported

statistical significance numbers are not corrected for degrees of freedom lost in

construction of the factors.27 There are nevertheless several noteworthy features. Firstly,

principal components constructed from correlation and covariance matrices are very

highly correlated. This is because the means and standard deviations of the illiquidity

ratios are of similar magnitudes across currency pairs. Secondly, the factors constructed as

unweighted means are only modestly correlated with the principal components. This is

consistent with the fact that the principal components method seeks only to maximize

explained variation (subject to a normalization). The weights that define the first principal

component (that is, the elements of the first eigenvector) exhibit large values of opposing

signs. Thirdly, no matter which of the three construction methods is used, the factor based

on all currency pairs is very highly correlated with that based solely on the non-




27In addition, principal components are identified only up to multiplication by      . In the
present context, we set the sign so that correlation with the mean factors is positive.
                                                                                     Page 34


commonwealth pairs. Thus, exclusion of the currency pairs in which EBS is not dominant

does not appear to substantially affect the dynamics of the estimated common factor.


VIII. Conclusions

       This paper provides a first look at CLS Bank FX settlement data. Like EBS and

Reuters quotes and trades analyzed by others, the submitted settlement instructions

constitute a continuous record of FX transactions. With respect to typical EBS/Reuters

datasets, the CLS settlement data have several distinctive advantages. Firstly, they are more

comprehensive in terms of currency pairs covered. Whereas Reuters concentrates on the

(British) commonwealth currencies and EBS on the non-commonwealth, the CLS

settlement data uniformly cover the seventeen major currencies that constitute the bulk of

FX trading. Secondly, the CLS data are more comprehensive in terms of volume coverage.

We estimate that EBS and Reuters together account for about 15.0% of BIS spot turnover,

after adjustment for prime brokerage. The corresponding figure for CLS is 37.2%.

       The comprehensiveness of the CLS settlement flows offer insights into patterns of

exchange. Against most other currencies, the USD is the dominant contra currency: most

settlements have the USD on one side of the trade. The Scandinavian currencies (DKK, NOK,

SEK) are the exceptions, with the EUR being the dominant currency.

       Platform-specific quote and trade data can still claim, however, other advantages.

They generally reflect arms-length transactions at current market prices; they are

generally correctly sequenced (at least within a given currency pair); and, they have

accurate time stamps. Settlement instructions, however, are submitted separately by the

parties to the trade, and sometimes well after a particular platform (like EBS or Reuters)

might have deemed the execution to have occurred. Furthermore, the submissions do not
                                                                                        Page 35


necessarily reflect arms-length transactions, and therefore may include pre-arranged

transfers on terms that are far removed from current market prices. When we attempt to

match up submissions with current market quotes, we find patterns consistent with these

limitations.

       The fact that time-stamps and sequencing in settlement instructions do not appear

to correspond closely to market transactions means that many standard liquidity measures

(quoted spread, effective spread, price impact, and so forth) are not available. The Amihud

illiquidity ratio, however, can be constructed using time-aggregated price and flow data,

and this is our main liquidity measure.

       We find that in the cross-section, across currency pairs, the illiquidity ratio is

positively correlated with the price impact estimates computed by MRW based on EBS

data. This association is strong, however, only for the currency pairs in which EBS is the

dominant market. EBS-based estimates of price impact in the commonwealth pairs,

however, do not agree with the illiquidity ratios. Our illiquidity ratio estimates suggest that

these markets are much more liquid than the price impact estimates would suggest. We

document time-of-day patterns in the illiquidity ratios, and find these consistent with local

business hours for most currencies.

       In summary, the CLS settlement data offer a broad window on flows and liquidity in

the FX market. The correspondence between settlement instructions and market

transactions is not sufficiently precise to support the same liquidity estimates that can be

constructed from EBS/Reuters data. At all but the highest frequencies, however, the

settlement instruction data can provide useful measures of liquidity and liquidity variation

based on time-aggregated returns and volume. As larger samples of settlement data
                                                                                    Page 36


become available, longer series of the liquidity measures can be formed, and the relations

between liquidity and FX pricing can be studied over longer horizons and also during

specific macroeconomic and political events.

Appendix A. Data description

The CLS data in our sample reflect FX settlements initiated during the month of April 2013,

scheduled for settlement at a later value date, and authenticated (“matched”) by CLS

against other counterparty instructions to verify all the critical details of the transaction –

currency paid, currency received, counterparty identifiers, value date, and so on. Trades

and instructions submitted to CLS that do not match have been rejected and are not in our

sample. Our data reflect settlements initiated during April (rather than settlements that

occurred during April, but arranged at some earlier time). Each record includes 14 data

fields:

Some spot settlements, by prior agreement of the buyer and seller, may be batched for

settlement purposes (using the CLS Aggregation Service, CAS). When this happens, we

value date for both the near leg (the date when the swap is initiated) and the far leg (when

the swap is reversed).

                                          Table 7. Distribution of trading activity by BICs

The trading activity for each BIC (account) in the sample is measured by the total number of its sides (Panel A) and the total
USD value of its sides (Panel B). The row labeled “All” contains all BICS, and each BIC is measured by its total activity. A row
with a currency identifier contains just those BICs that had at least one side in that currency, and each BIC is measured by its
activity in that currency. All table entries except “N” are reported on a daily basis.

                     Number of settlement entities and counterparties.

For settlement purposes, counterparties are identified by BICs. The table reports, for the
full sample and by currency, the number of distinct BICs, and the number of counterparty
BICs. In the “all currencies” row, for a given BIC, another BIC is considered a counterparty if
there is at least one settlement between them (involving any currency). The separate
tabulations for the individual currencies are constructed as follows. A BIC is considered a
member of the Australian dollar (AUD) set if it participated in at least one AUD settlement,
and the number of counterparties refers to the number of counterparty BICs in AUD trades.

                       Table 12. Correlations between common factors

Common liquidity factors are constructed in alternative ways and based on different
variable sets. The data underlying all calculations consists of daily means of illiquidity
ratios for all nine currency pairs examined in Mancini, Ranaldo and Wrampelmeyer (2013),
for twenty-one days in April 2013. The construction either uses all pairs (“All”) or just the
six non-Commonwealth pairs (“Non-Com”). The methods of construction are simple
arithmetic mean, the first principal component (using the correlation matrix), and the first
principal component (using the covariance matrix).

                          Figure 4. Imputation of reporting delays



Points A and B mark reported prices and times of trades. The bid-ask midpoint is indicated

as a step function. The imputation involves looking backwards in time to determine the

most recent price at which the trade could have occurred. For trade A, this implies a

reporting lag of   . For trade B, the imputed reporting lag is     , but there is another

(longer) reporting lag,   , that is also consistent with the reported price.
