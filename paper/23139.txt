Did Medicaid Expansion Reduce Medical Divorce?
David Slusky and Donna Ginther
NBER Working Paper No. 23139
February 2017, Revised July 2020
JEL No. I13,J12

                                           ABSTRACT

Medical divorce occurs when couples split up so that one spouse’s medical bills do not deplete
the assets of the healthy spouse. It has not been studied in the economics literature, but it has been
discussed by attorneys and widely reported in the media. We develop a model of medical divorce
that demonstrates that divorce is optimal when a couple’s joint assets exceed the exempted asset
level. We use the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion which removed asset tests to qualify
for Medicaid as exogenous variation in the incidence of divorce (as it was only implemented by
some states). We find that the ACA expansion decreased the prevalence of divorce by 11.6%
among those ages 50–64 with a college degree. These results are robust to numerous placebo
checks including older subsamples (who qualify for Medicare regardless of assets) and earlier
years (before the expansion was implemented). Our results suggest that Medicaid expansion
reduced medical divorce.

Introduction
           Medical divorce has been discussed as a strategy to preserve the assets of a couple when one spouse
gets sick and his or her care results in high medical bills that could potentially bankrupt the couple. During
the debate over the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof opened a column
with the headline “Until Medical Bills Do Us Part” (2009). He told the story of a friend whose husband was
diagnosed with early-onset dementia. She faced the prospect of his care draining their entire retirement
savings, following which she would wind up a destitute but healthy widow with a long life expectancy.
Given this, she considered legally divorcing her husband to shield her assets. He would eventually draw
down his assets and be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, and she would be able to provide for herself
in retirement.1 After the passage of the ACA, states that expanded Medicaid eliminated the asset test for
individuals facing a costly, long-term illness such as cancer or dementia.2 Thus, couples living in Medicaid
expansion states would not face the dilemma of medical divorce. We examine whether divorce prevalence
fell in states that expanded Medicaid and eliminated asset tests, and find significant decreases in divorce
among couples ages 55–64, with a college education.
           Medical divorce has not been studied in the economics literature, but it has been discussed by
attorneys and widely reported in the media. Medical divorce can result from many medical situations. Any
medical condition that requires extensive treatment and costly care could make divorce rational. For
example, Goldman (2008) relates a story of a woman in Indiana who received a cancer diagnosis and
divorced her husband in order to qualify for Medicaid and receive cancer treatment.3 In addition, a traumatic
brain injury where the injured spouse required nursing care could put a couple into the situation of
contemplating medical divorce. In these cases the couple’s joint assets are too much for the unhealthy
spouse to qualify for Medicaid, and in order to receive medical care for that spouse the couple decides to
divorce.
           The 2010 ACA’s Medicaid expansion ostensibly fixed the underlying problem, as it expanded
Medicaid to cover all adults under 65 with incomes up to 138% of the poverty line, regardless of assets
(Sung, Skopec, and Waidmann 2015).4 Previously, many states had stringent asset requirements. For

    Others have written about this as well. See Kaplan (2014) and Olver and Lee (2010).

  This asset test was not necessarily eliminated for those seeking long-term nursing home care, and would not apply
to elderly people. Any remaining limits were reasonably uniform across states (e.g., see Watts, Cornachione and
Musumecisee 2016, Appendix Table 2) and so should not affect our results.

 See: Goldman (2008). Other examples of cancer and medical divorce are related in St. Pierre (2011), Paquette (2014)
and Egan (2018).

  The Affordable Care Act uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibility for Medicaid.
MAGI is Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed foreign income, non-taxable Social Security benefits, and tax-
exempt interest. According to healthcare.gov, for many people, MAGI is the same as AGI.

example, in Missouri, a permanently disabled individual was required to have total non-exempt resources5
under $2000 to qualify (Missouri Department of Social Services 2020). Nine states are community property
states where assets and liabilities are split evenly between the spouses. In states that expanded Medicaid,
as long as the sick spouse had a low income, the healthy spouse could keep his or her retirement assets
intact. However, this fix would take effect only if the couple’s state implemented the ACA Medicaid
expansion, which the Supreme Court made optional in National Federation of Independent Business v.
Sebelius. Those in non-expansion states still had an incentive to divorce for medical reasons. One couple
in Tennessee (a non-expansion state) even used their situation to lobby their governor to expand Medicaid
(Wilemon 2014). Despite these anecdotes, we know of no estimates about the prevalence of medical
divorce, as many couples who use this option refrain from publicly communicating their motives.
        This paper will use the partial Medicaid expansion as plausibly exogenous variation in access to
public health insurance that does not require asset drawdown. It will then compare the changes in prevalence
of divorce in states that expanded to Medicaid to states that did not expand, before and after implementation.
We find that states that expanded Medicaid had an 11.6% reduction in divorce among college-educated
individuals aged 50–64. Our estimates also suggest that medical divorce was prevalent among older, high-
income couples. The remainder of the paper discusses the literature, data and methods, and results.
Medicaid Expansion, Health Insurance and Divorce
        Our paper contributes to a large literature on the relationship between the welfare system as a whole
and the Medicaid program specifically and marriage and divorce. One of the early papers in this literature
found that from 1969 to 1985 the cross-sectional correlations between marital status and welfare benefits
were weak in statistical significance but increasing in magnitude over time (Moffit 1990). More specially
relevant to this paper, extending Medicaid eligibility beyond single-parent families in the 1980s and 1990s
increased the probability of marriage (Yelowitz 1998).
        The partial expansion of Medicaid in states in the 2010s under the ACA provides a plausible source
of exogenous variation, and many recent papers have examined its impact on health and economic
outcomes. Medicaid expansion increased health care consumption and diagnosis of chronic conditions
(Wherry and Miller 2016) and cancer (Soni, Simon, Cawley, and Sabik 2018); reduced disruptions in health
insurance coverage (Goldman and Sommers 2020), reduced federal disability program participation
(Chatterji and Li 2016; Anand, Hyde, Colby, and O’Leary 2019), and ultimately reduced mortality rates
(Miller et al. 2019). Others, however, have found minimal effects on labor force participation, employment
status, or hours worked (Leung and Mas 2018; Gooptu, Moriya, Simon, and Sommers 2016; Kaestner,

  Most states do allow the healthy spouse to keep some assets as “exempt resources.” Craig Reaves (2010), past
president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, concurring with other experts, opines that “the numbers
are just too low for many couples to feel good about this option.”



                                                       4
Garrett, Gangopadhyaya, and Fleming 2017; Buchmueller, Levy, and Valletta 2019). There is some
evidence that those with lower educational attainment are working less in states that expanded Medicaid
(Moriya et al. 2016).
         The ACA’s Medicaid expansion also improved household’s acute financial situation. It reduced
health spending (Levy, Buchmueller, and Nikpay 2017) and also improved credit scores and reduced unpaid
bills, medical bills, over limit credit card spending, delinquencies, collection balances, and public records
inquiries (Brevoort, Grodzicki, and Hackmann 2017; Miller, Hu, Kaestner, Mazumder, and Wong 2018;
Hu, Kaestner, Mazumder, Miller, and Wong 2018).
         There is one paper similar to ours which studies the impact of the ACA’s partial Medicaid
expansion on marriage and divorce rates (Hampton and Lenhart 2019). That paper, however, focuses on
those with low educational attainment, unlike our paper which focuses on those at the other end of the
educational attainment spectrum.
         Others have examined the impact of divorce on health insurance more broadly. Lavelle and Smock
(2012) found approximately 115,000 women annually lose private health insurance after divorce, and more
than half of them become uninsured. Couples with spousal health insurance but no other options therefore
often stay married to avoid being uninsured (Sohn 2015; Chen 2019a). In work closely related to ours, Chen
(2019a) found that Medicare eligibility (at age 65) and the 2006 Massachusetts healthcare reform increases
(2019b) both divorce rates. No literature has examined the impact of Medicaid coverage expansions on
medical divorce specifically.
         Other sections of the ACA affected marriage and divorce rates. The parental mandate that allowed
young adults to stay on their parents’ health insurance reduces marriage prevalence and increases the
likelihood of being single (Chatterji, Liu, Yörük 2018), decreased childbearing and marriage rates (Heim,
Lurie, and Simon 2017), and increased the prevalence of divorce (Abramowitz 2016). The ban on health
insurers discriminating on pre-existing conditions also lowered marriage prevalence (Hampton and Lenhart
2019).
         Demographers have documented an increase in “gray divorce,” divorce rates among older couples.
This research shows that divorce rates among people 55–64 have more than doubled since 1990, increasing
from 5.1 to 12.0 per 1000 in 2017 (Brown and Lin 2012; Allred 2019). However, much of this increase was
driven by remarriages ending in divorce (Brown and Lin 2012). In subsequent work, Lin, Brown, Wright
and Hammersmith (2018; 2019) found that marriage quality and economic disadvantage partially explained
the increase in gray divorce, as did increasing acceptance of both cohabitation (Brown and Wright 2017)
and divorce by older adults (Brown and Wright 2019). They also found that chronic health conditions were
not associated with gray divorce.




                                                     5
        This research also contributes to the broader ongoing literature on the household financial
consequences of the American health care system. This literature has historically focused on medical debt
and extreme outcomes like bankruptcy (Himmelstein, Warren, Thorne, and Woolhandler 2005; Dranove
and Millenson 2006; Himmelstein, Warren, Thorne, and Woolhandler 2006; Gross and Notowidigdo 2011;
Mahoney 2015; Dobkin, Finkelstein, Kluender, and Notowidigdo 2018; Himmelstein, Woolhandler, and
Warren 2018; Caswell and Goddeeris 2020), and so we contribute by turning the focus towards medical
divorce as a potential approach to limiting spousal impoverishment.
        This research is also related to the literature on the asset allocation decisions of elderly people to
qualify for Medicaid long-term care. Greenhalgh-Stanley (2012) found that state adoption of asset recovery
for Medicaid patients decreased homeownership and housing assets as a percentage of total wealth. In older
work, Norton (1995) finds that elderly people receive transfers from family members in order to avoid
Medicaid eligibility. Norton and Kumar (2000) found that the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988
did not prevent spousal impoverishment when one spouse entered a nursing home. This suggests that there
are incentives for older married couples to divorce when one spouse gets sick.
Model of Medical Divorce
        We develop a simple model to motivate our analysis of medical divorce. Older couples who have
been married for a long period of time have likely accumulated marriage-specific capital. In the Becker,
Landes, and Michael (BLM) (1977) model of divorce, children are considered “marriage-specific capital,”
and couples who have lived together longer and have marriage-specific capital are less likely to divorce
over time. Given income pooling in the household, we can consider assets such as a house and retirement
savings as marriage-specific capital. Income pooling is the appropriate choice here since this is how the
government treats the assets of married spouses when it comes to the asset test to qualify for Medicaid.6
Here we modify the BLM model of the decision to divorce to account for the choices facing older couples
where one experiences a health shock requiring expensive care in states that expanded Medicaid and those
that did not.
        Following Becker (1981), the decision to divorce occurs when the expected utility from being
married is less than that of obtaining a divorce. We are assuming that couples pool income and assets within
the household. Let the utility of marriage, 𝑈 , for an individual i be a function of their jointly held
assets, 𝑉 . This also holds for spouse j. Analogously, let the utility of being single, 𝑈 , be a function of
the division of the jointly held assets, where spouse i receives share π (0 ≤ π ≤ 1) of the assets, and spouse j




6
  Bargaining models such as Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981) offer an alternative to the
income pooling model of the household.



                                                       6
receives share 1       𝜋 . Here, following Becker (1976), we are assuming that utility is linear in assets,
meaning that the goal of an individual is to maximize the assets available to them, all else being equal.
                                                   𝑈       𝑉            𝑈
                                                       𝑈           𝜋𝑉
                                               𝑈               1    𝜋 𝑉
        These couples can reside in states that have asset tests for receiving Medicaid (non-expansion
states) or states that expanded Medicaid that no longer require asset tests. In addition, some states have
community property regulations where the value of jointly held assets is split equally upon divorce (π =
0.5).7 In the majority of states, π is determined by an adjudicated settlement known as equitable distribution
of property that does not need to be equal. For our purposes, all divorces are the result of mutual consent.
Couples choose between remaining married and divorcing to maximize utility.
        If the utility of marriage is greater than or equal to the utility of divorce for spouse i, 𝑈       𝑈 ,
and the same holds true for spouse j, 𝑈            𝑈 , the couple will remain married. For each spouse, we can
rewrite this condition in terms of the value of assets:
                                       𝑈       𝑉           𝜋𝑉           𝑈
                                       𝑈       𝑉               1    𝜋 𝑉         𝑈
        In other words the value of the jointly held assets from marriage needs to be greater than the value
of divided assets in divorce in order for the couple to remain married (3). In this simple case, couples will
always remain married since the share of marriage-specific capital is always smaller in the case of divorce.
        Suppose that one spouse, i, gets sick (which reduces utility by Si,) and requires expensive care. In
the absence of asset tests, the cost of that care, valued at Ci, is provided by Medicaid. This added to the
utility of marriage:
                                               𝑈           𝑉        𝑆       𝐶
For the healthy spouse, j:
                                                       𝑈           𝑉
        Since 𝑉        𝑆     𝐶   𝜋𝑉        𝑆   𝐶 assets remain intact, the sick spouse receives the care they
need, and the couple remains married.
        In the states that did not expand Medicaid, the healthy spouse is allowed an exemption, E and the
remaining assets are spent down so that sick spouse can qualify for Medicaid. The value of marital assets



7
  There are nine community property states where assets and medical liabilities are split 50/50 between spouses:
Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. As shown in Table
3, our results are robust to excluding them.



                                                               7
is therefore the maximum amount that can be retained (i.e., the exemption). In this case, the utility from
remaining married becomes 𝑈                 𝑆       𝐶 for the sick spouse and 𝑈                𝐸 for the healthy spouse.
           Following Becker (1981), the couple would choose to divorce when the additive utility from
marriage is less than the utility of divorce:
                                        𝑈       ≡𝑈          𝑈        𝑈        𝑈 ≡𝑈
Substituting in for the value of the assets (and cancelling out Si), when these marital assets are allocated to
long-term care:
                                    𝑆       𝐶       𝐸       𝜋𝑉       𝑆       𝐶       1   𝜋 𝑉
                                                𝐸       𝜋𝑉           1       𝜋 𝑉
                                                            𝐸        𝑉
As long as the exemption is less than the value of the total marriage assets, the couple has a financial
incentive to divorce.
           There is also the case when the sick spouse must still spend down his or her entire share of assets,
though the healthy spouse is now no longer subject to the exemption threshold. This case would be:
                                        𝑆       𝐶       𝐸        𝑆       𝐶       1   𝜋 𝑉
                                                        𝐸        1   𝜋 𝑉
Here, the couple still divorces as long as the exemption is less than the healthy spouse’s post-divorce share.
           The maximum Medicaid spousal asset exemption a state could set in 2017 was $120,900, and the
local exemption applies to spouses in all states that did not expand Medicaid (Medicaid 2017). So a couple
in this situation would seek a medical divorce if their retirement assets were greater than this amount.
According to analysis based on the Survey of Consumer Finance, 31% of households aged 55–64 have
retirement assets over $100,000 and 20% have retirement assets over $200,000 (GAO 2015).8 Therefore,
it is plausible that a substantial number of individuals would have sufficient assets to consider medical
divorce. From the model, we therefore hypothesize that Medicaid expansion will lower divorce prevalence
for those 55–64 with sufficient assets compared to states that did not expand Medicaid.
Data and Methods
           Our research will examine whether divorce incidence differed among older couples in states that
did and did not expand Medicaid under the ACA. Information on Medicaid expansion status comes from
Kaestner, Garrett, Gangopadhyaya, and Fleming (2017) and the Kaiser Family Foundation (2020). Given
the anticipatory nature of medical divorce, we drop a handful of states from our sample: those that had a

                                                                 8
prior full expansion of Medicaid and those that expanded Medicaid but after the original launch in January
2014.9 This leaves us with 38 states:10
              Traditional expansion states without a full prior expansion: Arizona, Arkansas, California,
               Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New
               Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, West Virginia

              Non-expansion states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri,
               Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
               Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming11
               This paper’s primary data is the Current Population Survey’s (CPS) Merged Outgoing Rotation
Group (MORG) for 2000–2016, a consistently estimated survey over the past several decades with a large
sample size (National Bureau of Economic Research 2019). We use this data because the US Census Bureau
(2017) uses the CPS to report on America’s Families and Living Arrangements. This version of the CPS
also contains income variables, which will used below in a robustness check. We also supplement this with
seasonally unadjusted monthly state unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area
Unemployment estimates (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). The closest related paper (Hampton and
Lenhart 2019) also uses the CPS.
               We limit the sample to those with a four-year college degree or equivalent (hereafter referred to as
a college degree) and age 50–64. This is because these individuals are more likely have been married for a
number of years, to have substantial assets, to be at greater risk of a degenerative medical condition, and to
be eligible for the Medicaid expansion. They are also less likely to be single mothers, which avoids
confounding our results with other modes of Medicaid eligibility.
               The empirical method is a straightforward state-month-year difference-in-differences estimation:

 Full prior expansion: Delaware, Washington DC, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont. Late expanders: Alaska,
Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Maine. In Table 3, we add back
Delaware, Washington DC, New York, and Vermont as regular expanders as a robustness check. (We continue to
omit Massachusetts as its prior expansion was before our “pre” period.)

   In Appendix Table 6 and Appendix Table 7 we use one treatment state at a time (and all of the control states) and
one control state at a time (and all of the treatment states) and find broadly consistent results. As every state’s asset
test policy is slightly different, this helps check that our results aren’t being driven or muddied by a handful of states.

records do not exist at this level of granularity.12 Treated equals 1 if a state expanded Medicaid in 2014 and
0 if it did not. The coefficient on Treated*Implemented (λ) is our primary difference-in-differences estimate.
         Other specifications include additional controls, including state fixed effects (instead of the treated
dummy), year-month fixed effects and the state-month-year level unemployment rate. X includes
individual level controls, such as age and educational attainment fixed effects (within the college educated
population, i.e., master’s degree, professional degree, doctorate) and dummies for race and gender.
Regressions are weighted using the CPS survey weights. Robust standard errors are clustered at the state
level.
         We drop the years 2012 and 2013 from our analysis, as it is ambiguous whether these years are
treated or not. Individuals knew about the partial Medicaid expansion and whether their states would or
would not expand, but the policy had not yet been implemented. While most other papers that study the
ACA Medicaid expansion include these years as untreated years, we believe that our paper is fundamentally
different from those because of the anticipatory nature of our outcome variable. Other outcomes (e.g.,
unpaid medical bills, diagnosis of chronic conditions, employment) measure the current state, whereas
preemptively getting a medical divorce before draining joint financial reserves is anticipatory on a multiyear
scale. This makes is difficulty to assign treatment or control status to 2012 and 2013, and so we omit them
from the primary specification.13
Divorce Prevalence Given Medicaid Expansion
         Before we address the role of Medicaid expansion, we will first examine the relationship between
age and the prevalence of divorce. The BLM (1977) model predicts that those who have been married for
longer periods of time are less likely to get divorced. Thus, we would expect older couples to be less likely
to divorce since they likely have longer marriage durations. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY 79), Aughinbaugh, Robles, and Sun (2013) found that the probability of divorce decreases
as educational attainment and age at first marriage increase. Brown and Lin (2012) used data from the
American Community Survey and found that the divorce incidence for adults aged 50 or over had more
than doubled between 1990 and 2010. However, they found that much of this divorce rate was driven by
people in second marriages. In their study, as marriage duration increased, divorce rates declined.




12
  We reached out to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to inquire about state-level divorce incidence
for our age group of interest. Their response was that “the collection of detailed marriage & divorce data was
suspended in the mid 1990s due to budget issues….there's no age or other demographic information available from
NCHS….[Survey data also] can't provide counts of marriages & divorces in a given year.”
13
  Despite being conservative here, Appendix Table 6 shows that our results are actually robust to including 2012-
2013 as treated or control years.




                                                        10
           We estimate the prevalence of divorced individuals using the CPS data for the years 2008–2011
(our pre-treatment period) both for those with and without a college degree, finding that divorce increases
almost monotonically from age 20 to age 55, and then declines only slightly by age 64.14 This greater
prevalence corresponds to the age at which rates of chronic health conditions are higher. The challenge in
interpreting this stylized fact is that many other things are changing as individuals age. One of the
contributions of our study is to use the variation in expansion and non-expansion states’ in health insurance
availability to examine one potential reason that divorce rates are higher for those over the age of 50.
           Next we construct an event study figure. The empirical method is a straightforward state-month-
year difference-in-differences estimation:

          𝑦        𝛼           𝜎 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 ∗ 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟_𝑡                𝜎 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 ∗ 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟_𝑡             𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞

                              𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡       𝛽𝑈𝑅         𝐗         𝜀
As above, y is outcome variable of interest (e.g., a divorce dummy) for individual i living in state s and
surveyed in month m and year y. The regression includes demographic controls X (age and educational
attainment fixed effects and dummies for race and gender); the monthly state unemployment rate (UR);
state and year-month fixed effects (state and yearmonth); and the traditional Medicaid expansion treated
state indicator (Treated) interacted with a dummy for each year (year). The coefficients are relevant to
2012, which is the omitted category. Robust standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: Sample is college-educated age 50–64. Dependent variable is a divorce dummy. All regressions
include demographic controls (age and educational attainment fixed effects and dummies for race and
gender), the monthly state unemployment rate, and state and year-month fixed effects. Coefficients are
relative to 2012. The whiskers show a 95% confidence interval.

         Figure 1 shows this event study for our main analysis. The beginnings of a gap in divorces in 2013
is intuitive. The Supreme Court decision was announced in the summer of 2012, and it was clear relatively
quickly which states would continue to expand as planned in 2014 and which states would not. Couples
that were going to divorce to shield assets likely did so before they would have actually qualified for
Medicaid. So once it was known whether a state would expand or not we would expect to start seeing some
divergence, which we do.15
         Table 1 shows the summary statistics and raw difference-in-difference estimates for our outcome
of interest and various controls values.




15
   Given the concern of potentially different trends in the pre-period, in Appendix Table 1 we regress divorce on a
treatment group specific time trend, a general time trend, and varying control specifications, per Akosa Antwi, Moriya,
and Simon (2013) and Maclean and Saloner (2019). In none of the regressions do we find a statistically significant
difference in these pre-period trends.

The estimate found above is extremely robust across difference specifications, including controlling for
individual demographic differences; adding state, year, and month fixed effects; and also controlling for
the unemployment rate. The estimate in column (4), a 1.6 percentage point increase, is statistically
significant (p<.001). It represents an 11.6% decrease on the pre-period mean for expansion states of 13.8%.
Column (5) adds state-specific time trends. While this results in a substantially less precise estimate, it is
still statistically significant (p=.014) and is actually larger in magnitude. While it is reassuring that our
results are consistent using these specifications, we prefer the cleaner results of Column (4) as our primary
estimate, especially given concerns about potential biases of treatment group-specific time trends (Wolfers
2006; Lindo and Packham 2017).

   Notes: Sample is college-educated age 50–64. Dependent variable is a relationship status dummy as
   indicated. 2008–2011 and 2014–2016. All regressions include individual level controls, the monthly state
   unemployment rate, and state, year-month fixed effects. Column (2) adds back DE, DC, NY, and VT.
   Columns (1)-(2) and (4)-(7) are for those with at least a college degree. Column (3) is for those with weekly
   income of at least $1000. Robust standard errors in parenthesis clustered at state level. Columns (2)-(7) are
   weighted. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

   Column (1) shows consistent results without using the survey weights. Column (2) adds back the dropped
   prior expansion states (except Massachusetts whose prior expansion was substantially earlier and more
   comprehensive). The estimated results become slightly larger. Column (3) looks at individuals with
   earnings of at least $1000/week. While this skews the sample and uses a more endogenous cutoff, the result
   is still broadly consistent and statistically significant (p=.013). Column (4) omits the nine community
   property states where assets and medical liabilities are split 50/50, as individuals can shelter less of their
   assets in those states, and therefore have less incentive to divorce. Here the results are also negative and
   significant.
           Columns (5)–(7) then look at the impact of Medicaid expansion on other marriage-related
   outcomes. As expected, we see an increase in marriage prevalence that is analogous in magnitude to the
   decrease in divorce prevalence (i.e., we cannot reject that the two are equal in magnitude). We also do not
   observe any statistically significant change in the prevalence of widowhood or never having been married,
   neither of which should be should be directly affected by Medicaid expansion.
           While this main result may seem large, given the relatively small magnitude of Medicaid expansion
   on actual take-up of Medicaid (e.g., in Wherry and Miller 2016), we stress that a couple does not have to
   actually enroll in the Medicaid expansion to be treated. All a couple has to do is consider their options
   (likely while they are still on private insurance), and weigh the costs and benefits of divorce if there is a
   significant asset test in their state of residence. Unfortunately, given the paucity of comprehensive data on


                                                        15
couples that consider medical divorce and no studies that we are aware of, there is no way to directly
compare our results with those of the literature on the more direct effects.
          We have estimated the number of individuals who stayed married as a result of the partial Medicaid
expansion. In 2016, there were approximately 8.5 million individuals age 50–64 with at least a college
degree in the states that expanded Medicaid on schedule. A 1.6 percentage point decrease in divorce
prevalence would have meant that in the states that expanded Medicaid on-schedule, approximately 136,000
fewer individuals (i.e., 68,000 fewer couples) divorced. While this estimate is larger than we had
anticipated, there are no other robust estimates of the magnitude of medical divorce for comparison.16 Thus,
our results indicate that medical divorce is a significant contributor to the incidence of divorce among older
adults.
Robustness Checks
          While Figure 1 suggests that the prevalence of divorce followed parallel trends until the passage of
the ACA, we estimated placebo regressions following Slusky (2017) to check this assumption. This test
uses the same grouping of states as above but compares them using different years of data before and after
a “placebo” Medicaid expansion. For example, instead of comparing 2014–2016 to 2008–2011, we
compared 2010–2012 to 2004–2007. Table 4, Panel A shows the results of these regressions.

  In presenting the results of this paper, we have been consistently shocked by the number of individuals who have
approached us and reported that medical divorce was recommended to their parents. These anecdotes, combined with
the results of this paper, have also led us to believe that medical divorce is far more common than previously reported..

    *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Columns (1)–(5) then compare the prevalence of divorce for earlier in time periods of 3 control years, 2
dropped years, ambiguous years, and 3 treated years.17 None of the coefficients are statistically significant
at even the 10% level nor are the point estimates larger in magnitude than our estimated results. Indeed, the
placebo point estimates are all an order of magnitude smaller. Additionally, divorce prevalence (shown in
the “mean” row) has remained relatively constant for the college-educated 50–64 population.
         Table 4, Panel B contains the results of estimating our model on four placebo populations for whom
we do not expect Medicaid expansion to affect medical divorce. If Medicaid expansion reduces financial
distress in households and improves overall health, this would likely reduce divorce rates for everyone in
states that expanded Medicaid. As a result, if our estimates are capturing changes in medical divorce, we
should observe a significant impact of Medicaid expansion for only those who were older and had both
increased rates of illness and higher levels of assets.
         Column (1) is the other half of the 50–64 sample used for the main regressions above: those with
less than a college degree. These individuals are much less likely to have sufficient retirement savings and
other assets that would create incentives for a medical divorce. As expected, we do not find a statistically
significant effect here. Column (2) is analogous to column (2) in Table 3: those 50–64 with less than $1000
of earnings per week. Here we also do not see any statistically significant effects. Columns (3) and (4)
examine those with at least a college degree but outside our target age range. Those 25–49 are likely too
young to have the kind of degenerative health problems that would potentially lead to medical divorce, and
likely do not have sufficient retirement assets. Those 65 and over were not eligible for the ACA’s Medicaid

17
   To be more conservative in ensuring we do not have statistically significant placebo results, we use year and month
fixed effects separately in the specification for Table 4.

expansion which was only designed to cover those too young to qualify for Medicare. In neither case do
we see statistically significant results.
        In Table 5, we include triple and quadruple difference specifications, using those over 65 or without
college degrees as the additional differences. Columns (1) and (4) in Table 4 contain the respective
difference-in-differences for those other samples. Column (1) in Table 5 shows our main difference-in-
differences result from above, estimated on the college-educated sample age 50–64. Columns (2) is a triple
difference specification estimated on the college-educated sample age 50 and above. It includes all the
respective pairs of difference-in-difference controls (i.e., age and time, age and expansion states, expansion
states and time). Column (3) is a triple difference for those of all levels of education attunement age 50-64
and again includes all pairs of difference-in-difference controls (i.e., education and time, education and
expansions states, and age and education). Finally, column (4) is a quadruple difference specification
estimated on those of all levels of educational attainment age 50 and above, and includes all difference in
difference and triple difference controls. Our results are consistent across all of these specifications.

         The appendix includes additional robustness checks. In Appendix Table 2, we check our results for
 the subsample of each of the eight rotation groups in the CPS (as opposed to the MORG file which includes
 only the 4th and 8th), using the basic CPS abstracts from IPUMS (Flood et al. 2017) and find that our results
 are consistently negative and significant. In Appendix Table 3, we show that our results are negative and
 significant if we control for home ownership and as expected if we stratify by home ownership
 (hypothesizing that owners would be more affected by Medicaid expansion). In Appendix Table 4, we
 estimate the divorce models separately by race. The effects are all of the same magnitude, though not
 statistically significant for black people given the small number of black people in the sample with at least
 a college education. In Appendix Table 5, we show consistent results at the household level and using
 household weights.


                                                      19
        In Appendix Table 6, we see if our estimates are robust to different treatments of the years between
the Supreme Court decision and Medicaid expansion (2012–2013). The drop in divorce prevalence in 2014–
2016 is so large that our results are broadly consistent regardless of how we treat 2012–2013, and we cannot
reject that any of the treatment effects are the same as each other.
        In Appendix Table 7, we include each treated state (along with all of the control states), one at a
time. Across 20 treated states, 12 have negative statistically significant drops in divorce, 7 have statistically
insignificant effects, and only 1 has a statistically significant (at the 5% level) increase. This strongly
suggests that our results are not driven by a large drop in a few states, but rather significant drops in a
majority of treated states. Similarly, in Appendix Table 8, we include each control state (along with all of
the treated states), one at a time. Out of 18 results, 13 are negative and significant (all at the 1% level), 1 is
not significant, and 4 are positive and significant (2 at the 1% level, 1 at 5%, and 1 at 10%). Both of these
sets of results are important as every state’s asset test rules are somewhat different, and we want to ensure
that individual states are not driving our results.
        In Appendix Table 9, we look at five-year age bands from age 25–64. We only see statistically
significant results in the 50–54 and 55–59 ages, with the majority of our results coming from the 55–59
group. This makes sense as this group is the far enough from retirement for divorce to be beneficial but old
enough to get sick and have sufficient assets.
        Finally, in Appendix Table 10 and Appendix Figure 3 we repeat our analysis using the ACS from
IPUMS (Ruggles et al. 2017) and find similar results, albeit smaller results (a 0.36 percentage point or 2.4%
decrease, corresponding to 28,000 fewer divorced individuals or 14,000 fewer divorced couples). We favor
the estimates from the CPS because it is the source of the US Census Bureau’s annual estimates of marital
status. According to the US Census Bureau (2016):
        Because of its detailed questionnaire and its experienced interviewing staff, the Current
        Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) is a high
        quality source of information used to produce the official annual estimate of poverty, and
        estimates of a number of other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, including
        income, health insurance coverage, school enrollment, marital status, and family structure.
As a result, we place more weight on the estimates we found using the CPS as compared to the ACS. This
is addition to the fact that, as mentioned above, the closest paper to ours (Hampton and Lenhart 2019) also
uses the CPS.
        Overall, these robustness checks suggest that our estimates are identifying changes in the incidence
of medical divorce.




                                                       20
Discussion and Conclusion
           It is also important for us to put our results in the context of other (limited) research on gray divorce
for the entire population (i.e., not just for the states that expanded Medicaid on-schedule). The Pew Research
Center (Stepler 2017) estimates that the divorce rate for Americans age 50 and older is about 1% per year.
In 2016 there were approximately 111 million Americans age 50 and older, but again using the sums of the
CPS survey weights as rough estimates of population, there were 20 million Americans (18% of the 50+
population) ages 50–64 with a college degree. An annual divorce flow of 1% of the population 50 and older
would be 1.11 million individuals, whereas using the estimated divorce rate per year derived from our
estimates, 0.53%18 of 20 million, is only 106,000 individuals per year (across the entire United States). So
the decrease in divorce rates for all Americans age 50 and older is only 9.5%19.
           Ours is the first paper that we are aware of that examines and quantifies the extent of medical
divorce for older couples in any context. We began our analysis by modeling the economic rationale for
medical divorce. Our simple model indicates that whenever assets exceed the asset exemption in a state,
couples have an economic incentive to divorce. Although vital statistics do not provide estimates of the
divorce rate by age, we use the CPS to analyze divorce incidence. The ACA’s Medicaid expansion provides
an ideal natural experiment to examine whether there might be medical divorce. If medical divorce were
truly rare, we should observe no significant differences in divorce in the treatment and control states. Our
results indicate that medical divorce is far more prevalent than previously assumed.
           We found that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion reduced the prevalence of divorce among college-
educated individuals ages 50–64 by 1.6 percentage points, which is an 11.6% decrease on the pre-expansion
mean for the treated states. This suggests that Medicaid without asset limits for individuals significantly
reduced the incidence of divorce among older and more highly-educated adults. Consistent with the
predictions of our model, our results strongly suggest that medical divorce was reduced in the first years of
the ACA.




18
  1.6 percentage points decline in divorce prevalence divided by 3 years equals a 0.53 percentage point decrease in
the divorce rate.
19
     106,000 individuals divided by 1.11 million individuals equals 9.5%.
