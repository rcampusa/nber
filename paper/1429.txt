      Fiscal Policy in Open, Interdependent Economies

                             ABSTRACT



The paper studies the effects of alternative financing policies in the

open economy.


     There is a non—trivial role for financial policy because of the

failure of first-order debt neutrality due to uncertain private lifetimes.

Both the single—country case and the interdependent two-country case are

considered. Capital formation is endogenous and there are unified global

financial and goods markets determining the interest rate, each country's

"Tobin's q" and the terms of trade. The government's present value budget

constraint or solvency constraint and the assumption that the interest

rate exceeds the growth rate imply that, given spending, current tax cuts

imply future tax increases. Such policies boost the outstanding stock of

public debt, raise the world interest rate, crowd out capital formation at

home and abroad, and lead to a loss of foreign assets. Provided a

"supply—side—response—corrected" transfer criterion -is satisfied, the

terms of trade will improve in the short run and worsen in the long run.

Introduction




       The paper studies fiscal policy in the open economy. It

proceeds from the very small country, which is a price taker

in the world financial market and in the markets for imports

and exports, via the semi-small country, which has some market

power in the market for its exportable, to the interdependent

two-country case. To keep the analysis tractable, a very simple

production structure is assumed: each country consumes both

domestic and foreign output but is wholly specialized in the

production of its exportable. So as to be able to analyse

"crowding out" issues in the short run and the long run, firms

in each country can engage in capital formation. Only domestic

output can be transformed into domestic capital, and the investment

process is subject to strictly convex internal costs of adjustment.

There is no money in the model, but international portfolio

lending and borrowing can occur in an integrated global financial

market. There is no direct foreign investment. Rational point

expectations   and certainty equivalence are assumed throughout,
so all stores of value are perfect substitutes in private portfolios.
As cyclical, Keynesian issues are not the focus of this paper,
full   employment is assumed throughout.



         The fiscal policy issue that is our primary concern

£s the choice of borrowing versus tax financing of   a   given

programme of public spending on goods and services ("exhaustive
                                2



spending"). The model can of course be used equally well for the

analysis of alternative spending-cum—financing policies. So as

not to get side—tracked into issues of excess burdens and deadweight

losses, all taxes are assumed to be lump—sum. From the government's

budget constraint, or rather from its "present value budget constraint",

or solvency constraint, it then follows that our concern is with the

consequences for private saving arid capital formation of intertemporal

redistributions of the tax burden. This means that, given the perfect

financial markets that are assumed in the model, the analysis could

stop right here if we specified households either as infinite-lived

or as endowed with operative intertemporal gift and bequest motives

(see e.g. Frenkel and Razin [1984a]). To get a non-trivial analysis

of the central issue of financial policy one therefore either has to

adopt the overlapping generations framework without gift and bequest

motives (see e.g. Buiter [1981])or the "uncertain lifetime" approach

first developed by Yaari [1965] and applied to macroeconomic issues of

fiscal policy in open and closed economies by Blanchard [1983a, b).

The overlapping generations approach has the major drawback that its

most popular variant, the two—period life cycle model, has a unit period

of about 38 years. This makes it a suitable vehicle, at most, for the

study of the Kondratieff cycle. To obtain a more interesting period-

ization a high price is paid in the form of higher order difference

equation systems and difficult aggregation problems. The Yaari—Blanchard

approach, adopted in the present paper, captures the essential notion

of finite private decision horizons while preserving lower—order dynamics

and easy aggregation. There is a price to be paid of course: the

 instantaneous probability of death is assumed to be independent of age
                                3




and consequently there are no characteristic life-cycle patterns
                        1/
of saving and wealth.




    This paper investigates the consequences of domestic and foreign

governments' taxation—borrowing mixes for saving and capital

formation in the two countries and for the interest rate and the

real exchange rate. Qualitative, analytical methods are relied on

as much as possible, but a large part of the dynamic analysis can

only be performed using numerical simulation algorithis.



     Section II presents the model. The very small cntry case is

studied in Section III, followed by the semi-small ccuntry case in

Section IV. The two-country model is put through its paces in Section V.




1. After completing an earlier version of this paper I became aware
    of two other applications of the Yaari—Blanchard consumption model
    to the analysis of fiscal policy in a two-country setting. The
    first, by Alberto Giovannini [1984] has the same behavioural
    equations as the model of the present paper, except for the invest-
    ment functions which are specified without internal or external
    costs of adjustment. Since only steady-state analysis is conducted,
    this is not a serious flaw. The second by Frenkel and Razin [1984b]
    does a dynamic analysis but has no capital formation (i.e. exogenous
    output) and only considers the one commodity case.

II.    The Model



       The paper studies the effects of fiscal policy in a dynamic,

2—country, 2—good rational expectations model. Each country is

completely specialized in the production of its exportable. Fixed

domestic capital formation takes the form of accumulation of domestic

output only (subject to internal costs of adjustments). Each country's

labour market clears and the world markets for the two traded

commodities are in competitive equilibrium. There is a single,

integrated, global financial market in which a bond denominated in

terms of home country output is traded.



       The derivation of the behavioural equations of the model is

given in Appendix 1. Consumer behaviour follow's Yaari's [19651

uncertain lifetime approach, as applied to an aggregated macroeconomic

model by Blanchard [1983a, b). Investment behaviour is governed by

a Tobin's "q"type relationship based on increasing and strictly convex

internal costs of adjustment.



       The equations governing the two—country model are



 (1)   q(s) = (0 + X) (w(s) +h(s))                                      0, X > 0

       Equations (1) through (8) describe the domestic economy.

Aggregate consumption, q(measured in terms of domestic output),is

a constant linear function of total (human h plus non—human w)

wealth (equation 1) .                   The constant of proportionality is the sum

of the pure rate of time preference, 0 and the constant (i.e. age—

independent) instantaneous probability of death, A. The familiar

infinite—lived consumer world with its debt-neutrality properties is the

special case of our model when A = 0.                  The rate of change of aggregate

private non—human capital w, equals private disposable income minus
                                         7




private consumption. Disposable income is labour income y                   j(.)

plus interest income rw minus taxes T .            Private     financial wealth

consists of private holdings of domestic government bonds, bG, of claims

on the rest of the world,F, and f claims on the domestic capital stock, K.

All assets are perfect substitutes in private portfolios, so their

expected rates of return are equalized.          All bonds, whether issued

by domestic or foreign private or public agents are deninated in

terms of domestic output (good x) and are of the fixed market value,

variable interest rate variety. r(s) is the instantaneous own rate of

interest on these bonds. Labour income y is the product of the wage

rate and the exogenous labour supply, which is fully employed. Choice

of units sets employment equal to unity .         The production function is

linear homogeneous in capital, K, and labour, is strictly concave and

satisfies the Inada conditions. Output (and output per worker) u is

therefore given by u =        f(K),   f' > 0, f" < 0, f(O) =    0,   urn f' (K) = +
                                                                     K+O
lim f'(K) =   0.       Under competitive market-clearing conditions, the wage

rate (and labour income) is given by j(K) =         f(K)   -
                                                               Kf'(K)      with

j' = —Kf" > 0      .
                                                Equation   (3) or (3)

expresses human capital h as the present discounted value of future

after—tax labour income. Note that the discount rate equals the market

rate of interest, r, plus the instantaneous probability of death, X

h(s) is the human capital of those currently alive. They do not expect

to be around forever even though a population of constant size is around

forever.

the foreign good c. The constant share of consumption of domestic

output in total ccnsumption spending (q) is c. The relative price

of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods (i.e. the reciprocal of

the terms of trade) is denoted by rr.



     Each country is completely specialized in the production of its

own exportable. Households and governments consume both domestic and

foreign goods. Capital accumulation in each country only involves

that country's own output. Investment is subject to quadratic internal

adjustment costs. Depreciation is ignored. Because both the production

function and the cost-of-adjustment function are assumed to be linear

homogeneous, the shadow price of domestic capital("Tobin's marginal q")

also equals the value of a unit of existing, installed capital in terms

of current output, i.    In    equation (6)    is the cost—of—adjustment

parameter. Equation (7) is the familiar condition that value of the

marginal product of capital (corrected for adjustment costs) equals the

cost of capital, i.e. the sum of the interest rate and the expected

proportional rate of change of        .    The government budget constraint is

given in (8). g denotes government spending on domestic consumption

goods and g government spending on imports.



     Equations (9) ,   (9'),   (10), (11), (11'), (12), (13), (14) and (16)

are self-explanatory foreign counterparts of domestic behavioural

relationships. q*, w and h* are measured in terms of foreign output.



     Equation (15) is the foreign cost—of—capital equation with the
                                                 9




assumption of a perfectly integrated set of financial markets

substituted in. The (costs-of-adjustment corrected) value of the

marginal product of foreign capital (in terms of foreign output)

equals the domestic interest rate minus the expected proportional

rate of change of the relative price of foreign goods minus the

        There are three economy-wide market equilibrium conditions:

market-clearing for foreign output (17), for domestic output (17') and

for financial claims .                 Because of Walras' Law, the financial

market equilibrium condition will be dropped from explicit

consideration. Equation (19) defines net domestic claims on the rest

        of future      spending programmes and the servicing of the    existing

        stock of debt must be equal to the present value of future taxes.

        The condition that it is not feasible to service debt through

        further borrowing indefinitely is of course only plausible if the

        real interest rate exceeds the natural (long run) proportional

        rate of growth of real economic activity. Note that while existing

        households discount future taxes at a rate r +      X   ,   the government,
        which knows it will tax both existing and yet-to-be born households,

        discounts future taxes at a rate r.




III.    The very small open economy



        The very small open economy treats both the interest rate and

        the terms of trade as parameteric. The behaviour of the house-

        hold sector is given by



        q = (r—O)q          —
                                (O+X)Aw

        w = rw +    j(K) -         —q



        The remaining dynamics can be summarized by
                                            12




                     1
             =




       r = f'(K)         iK2
       and



       F = f(K)      +   rF   -
                                  (q   +   +g    +   rg   +           )


       Under the assumption of exogenous factor income, this model is

       studied in Blanchard [t983b]. Since the capital stock dynamics

       is a function only of the exogenous rate of interest r, we can

       analyse the behaviour of q, w and F in response to any shocks

       other than interest rate changes, while treating K as exogenous.

       Indeed, by considering an initial position of stationary

       equilibrium, with K =               =0    (and I   = 1),   K can be treated as

       constant throughout. Furthermore, the (q, w) subsystem is self-

       contained and F is determined recursively given q and                        w.   The

       state—space representation of the system (with K = 0) is given

       in (22)




(22)             q       (r—O)         —(O÷X)A       0    q                     0

                                                                  +


                                                                          f(K)-(g+g)

       The (q, w) subsystem has two characteristic roots, r — (0 + X) and

       r+X. It will be saddle—point stable if —X <                         r   < 0 + X.    q is

       non-predetermined and, with 4 exogenous, w is predetermined. We
                                      13




       assume this condition to be satisfied. In addition we assume

       r > 0. The third root (the one governing F) is r.



       The steady-state conditions for the private economy are, for

       X>O:

                    (r—O)                    —   (r—e)
(23)   W =      2            2
                                 (y—t) =                     (y—T)
               r —O(r+A)—X                 [r—(O+X)][r+X]



                —   (O+A)X                  — (8+X)X
(24)   q   =
                2            2
                                 (y—T) =                     (y—T)
               r —e(r+A)—A                 [r—(e+A)] (r+X)




       The case of the infinite—lived consumer (A = 0)         yields no

       meaningful solution unless r0. We shall not consider it

       any further here.



       The "saddlepoint" condition implies that the denominator of

       (23) and (24) is negative.




       Even if the private economy settles down to a stationary equilibrium,

       the equation of motion for the current account could, apparently,

       exhibit perpetual deficits or surpluses. Indeed, the root governing

       the predetermined variable F in (22) is r> 0, implying explosive

       behaviour. This unfortunate feature of many small open economy

       models with a perfect international capital market is, however,

       ruled out by the government's present value budget constraint (PVBC)
                                               14




    given in (21) and the no-Ponzi game transversality condition

    given in (21'). We can therefore only consider budgetary and

    financial strategies which are consistent with bounded values

    of government debt. Consider any set of strategies which has

    the property that the stock of public sector debt converges,

    possibly asymptotically, to a finite stationary value. In steady-

    state equilibrium such strategies, are, from the government

    budget constraint in (8) characterized by



(25) gx + g            +rbG=T
           y

    with               =   o.



    Note that with (25), a stationary equilibrium for w implies a

    stationary equilibrium for F. Consider alternative stationary

    equilibria with identical constant values for exhaustive public

     spending g and g                    but different values of taxes t and public

    debt bG.                Across such steady states a lower value of taxes will

    be associated with higher private consumption and lower public

    debt. Private non-human wealth will be higher (lower) when steady—

     state taxes are lower, according as to the interest rate is above

     (below) the pure rate of time preference. All this holds for a

     constant level of exhaustive public spending.

E.g. if r =                 0,   public debt displaces foreign assets one—for-

one in private portfolios across steady states. Note that when

private agents have infinite horizons (A = 0) changes in r and

bG have no effect (short run                  or   long run) on consumption or net
                                                                             2/
foreign          assets if       exhaustive   public spending is constant.



Note       that we cannot use (25) by itself to analyse the "real time"
consequence of a change in T with g and g constant. bG is
predetermined at a point in time. Except through default, a
government cannot engineer a finite, discrete change in bG at
a point in time; real-time changes in bG have the dimension of
b    ,    i.e.       bG    is a continuous function of         time. What we must do

in order to be able to use (25) to derive the "real time" long—

run      effects of a change in T             is   to specify rules for spending,

taxation and               borrowing    that are consistent with convercjence to a

steady-state               equilibrium for bG and with unchanged valutes of g
and      g across steady states.


          Ideally,         such rules would reflect the optimizing       behaviour
of       governments. In this paper only ad-hoc                 rules that are likely
to       satisfy the government's solvency constraint are considered.

              A fairly general stabilizing rule for taxes is given in

       equations (26) arid (27) for the home country and the foreign

       country respectively:

              Thus taxes have a lump—sum component but also respond either

       to the deficit and/or to the size of the debt.

       Any     rule    with                        < 0     satisfies home country government's

       solvency requirement. In most of the examples considered below

       we assume v =                      = 0 in which case the solvency condition
       becomes p, p < —1



       The main fiscal experiment will be a change in                                  or   .   With
       v =            = 0,           this change in the lump—sum component of the tax

       bill also equals the steady-state change in total tax receipts.



       Note, however, from (31) and (28) that a long-run, steady—state

       tax increase is "achieved" by a short-run tax cut which results in

       an initial budget deficit. Indeed, the authorities run a net

       cumulative budget deficit during the adjustment process towards the

       new long-run equilibrium. With a given spending programme on goods

       and services, the higher long-run taxes will be exactly sufficient

       to service the higher volume of public debt.



       If we wish to use (22) to analyse the short-run and long—run

       consequences of a constant, exogenous change in taxes, the government's

       present value budget constraint (PVBC) can only be satisfied if

       we assume that public spending (g +7rg) is adjusted to maintain

       solvency.

       By analogy with (26) and (27) we could specify potentially

       stabilizing public spending rules that make spending responsive

       to the level and/or rate of change of public debt, e.g.



                                                       G

       rule parameters can be chosen in such a way as to make (32) and

       (33) convergent processes. For illustrative purposes, consider

       the case of exogenous taxes and \g =                                  0.   A convergent debt process

       requires Pg >                1       since

       The behaviour of the (q,w) system with exogenous taxes and endogenous

       spending (equation (30) with Vg = 0 and equation (34))is illustrated

       in Figure 1 for the case r=O. The unique convergent saddlepath SS'

        in q-w space is upward-sloping.

an immediate temporary tax cut, to be ended at t1 > to causes
consumption to increase immediately to some intermediate position

E1, between   E   and E1. From there the system moves gradually
along   a divergent trajectory drawn with reference to the E1 equilibrium,

until at t1 it arrives at E12 on SS' from where it converges

asymptotically to E0. Between to and t1 part of the tax cut

is saved. Dissaving takes place from t1 onwards.

       Since F E W - K       - bG      and K       0, the current accoit surplus

       isgivenby Fw_bG.


       For      the unexpected, immediate and permanent tax change, w is
       constant     throughout and foreign assets are crowded out one—for--

       one by domestic debt. With 11g > 1, the permanent ct in taxes

       is accompanied by transitory spending cuts which result in a

       budget surplus and a current account surplus. The government

       obtains      the means to finance the permanent tax cut by reducing
       its debt in the short run. As public spending converges back to
       its      original value, the public sector PVBC exhibits matching

       reductions in a liability, bG and in an asset -                 the present value
       of future taxes.




       In general, with exogenous taxes and             endogenous spending given by
       (30) with Vg = 0        (and therefore by 34)), the behaviour of q, w

saddlepoint configuration for two predetermined variables (w and

F) and one non-predetermined variable, q.



With a temporary tax      cut   there is no change in the long run values
                    G
of q, w, F and b         On impact, however, since

g =           +         bG -                 and Pg >   1    spending is cut by
       1-g1                     l••g
more   than taxes   and the home country runs a current account surplus.

In   Figure 1, between            and E12 the private sector saves. There
is   no private investment and         the   public sector has a budget surplus.
When the tax cut is reversed at t1,             spending    is raised by more and
the government runs a budget deficit. The private sector also

dissaves from E12 to E0 in Figure 1 and the economy as a whole has a

current account deficit that vanishes asymptotically.



Consider now instead a long-run tax cut financed by short—run tax

increases without any changes in the public spending programme.

Since the interest rate and the terms of trade are exogenous, this

policy leaves the present value of the future tax programme

(discounted at r) unchanged and merely redistributes taxes over

time and between generations. tinder this rule the equations of

motion are given by:

       from the government debt equation bG =                                    bG +

       one unstable root and the system will again have the                                proper
       saddlepoint configuration.



       what happens on impact to aggregate consumption in response to a

       long run tax cut (T1 down) financed through a short—run tax                                  increase,
       depends entirely on what happens to human capital h. From equation

       (3') we see that, with K given, the effect on human                                capital   depends

       only on the effect on the present value of future taxes                                discounted
       at r+X.         Let
                                                  23

             J
             S



It   is easily checked that



dT(s)    =        1     —
                                -     1
                 r+A                  (1+i
 dt1
                                r+X



This confirms the intuition that with infinite-lived households

(A = 0) and perfect capital markets, redistribution of taxes

over time has no real effects. However, with finite lives (X > 0)
                        dT(s)
and i <                               < o    :    raising taxes in the long run and
                                1
lowering them in the short run so as to keep their present value

discounted at r constant, lowers their present value discounted

at r+X.


Thus a policy of cutting taxes in the long run and financing this

by raising taxes in the short run, will lower human capital and

lower private consumption in the short run, even though it will

raise both in the long run.



Changes in the terms of trade



It is apparent from equation (22) that changes in the terms of

trade,            ,    have no effect, short-run or long-run, on the

behaviour of aggregate private consumption q and private sector

non—human wealth w.                   Furthermore, except insofar as public

spending on goods and services g + irg                        is a function of 7t     the
                                                          24



        current account is independent of the terms of trade in the

        short-run and in the long-run. This is the powerful simplifying

        effect of our choice of utility function. A more general

        analysis of the Harberger-Laursen—MetZler effect can be found in

        Razin and Svensson [19831 and Bean [1984].



        Changes in the interest rate



        In a steady state, r =                 r'   (K)        or K =   k(r)       k' < 0. The long—

        run   effects           of a change in the world interest rate on private

        consumption and non-human wealth are in general ambiguous, as

        shown in (37a, b), where we use the fact that j'k' = — K.

       The (K, ) dynamics is entirely self-contained, but feeds into the q,w
       dynamics as shown in (39) for the case where public spending adjusts
       to satisfy the government's PVBC.

       We saw that when K is treated as constant, the (q, w) subsystem

       is saddlepoint-stable under mild restrictions. It will therefore

       have a (locally) well—behaved solution when K is governed by an

       exogenous process provided K does not "explode too fast" (see Buiter

       [1984]). Since K in turn will be (locally) well—behaved

       provided only that r doesn't explode too fast, the system given in
                                    26




       (39) will be a saddlepoint equilibrium with two stable and two

       unstable characteristic roots.      JJ and q are non-predetermined,

       the boundary condition for K takes the form of an initial

       condition and w is subject to the simple linear restriction

       that at t=t , say
                  0



(42)   w(t) =    w(t)   + (i(t) —    (t))K(t)

       where x(t) = lim x(t0 -
                 0
                        t÷o
                        t> 0

       while w(t) is predetermined (inherited from the past),

       discontinuous jumps in       in response to 'news' at to can

       cause discontinuous jumps in w(t0).



       The four roots are 4     r        /r —     f"(K)     ,   r-   (O+X)


       and r0

       IV The semi-small open economy



              The semi—small open economy is a price taker in world financial

       markets      but has some influence on the world price of its exportable.
       Price-taking behaviour in the world capital                 market is specified as

       the   home country taking r*              r—        as   given. Through the endogeneity
       of it therefore,         the domestic interest rate, r, becomes endogenous,

       at    any rate in the short run. The terms of trade are endogenized
       through the domestic output equilibrium condition


               f(K)     =   cq + g + (-)K+cz*7rq* + g* +           4(P_n2 !


               We   also assume that g is independent of it and            that   (CL*itq*+g*)it1

       is    independent of it,       i.e.   that (cL*irq* +g*)it =M ,     say, which permits
       us to solve for it as




(43)   it    = [f(K)        —
                                q—g    + (14)K       —
                                                         4(4_1)2     M




               This     has the sensible property that an increase in world demand

       for the home good cet. par. raises its relative price (lowers it).

       Note that this representation makes it a function of domestic demand

       for domestic output but not of domestic demand for foreign output.—                     3

               The long—run comparative statics of q, w, K and                 are the same

       as those of the very small open economy, since in long—run equilibrium

       r =    r*    =   f' (K) and q is independent of it . If in addition total

                                                                         (1—i1)K -                 >
       3.      We must of course assume that f_ciq_g +
                                                                                     4(*_1)2
               for      it to be positive.

        government spending, measured in domestic output (g                     g + irg)
        is independent of r, the long—run comparative statics of bG and

        F are also the same as in the very small open econo1y.



        The long—run effects of fiscal policy changes and changes in the

        world rate of interest on                      all follow straightforwardly from the

        unit elastic foreign demand for domestic output function. The

        steady—state version of (43), given in (44), yields the following

        long—run comparative static results:

rule given by (30) with                            =   0,     i.e.

               In   order to simplify the analysis further, it is also assumed

               that all variations in public spending take the forn of variations

               in public spending on imports, i.e. g is held constant throughout.



               We eliminate r from the system through the real interest equal-

               ization condition and obtain                 by logarithmic differentiation

               of the relative price equation. In a neighbourhood of the

        The characteristic equation of the state matrix in (46a) does

        not appear to factorize in any convenient manner. Experimentation

        with a range of plausible numerical values did, however,

        consistently yield the right kind of saddlepoint configuration

        with two stable and two unstable characteristic roots. The

        following results of simulations involving a world interest rate

        increase and a tax cut for two distinct numerical versions of the

        of the model, cx = .6, 0 = .03,       = .031     and A = .03..

        The production function is Cobb-Douglas with f(K) =           K   and   = .25

        in both versions of the model.



        In version I, r* = 0 = .03.         This means that the steady-state

        value for w equals zero. We also assume that the initial

        value of taxes, t        , is 25   per cent of initial labour income,

        that g        is fifteen per cent of initial labour income, that

rg is five per cent of labour income and that M = .8968.                        The

initial steady state value of the relative price of foreign goods,

    is then equal to unity. The initial steady-state equilibrium

is furthermore characterized by K0 = 16.90;              f(K0) =   2.03;
j(K) = 1.52;              =   1,   bG = 2.54   and F0 = —19.43.



The characteristic roots of the linearized system (given in 46a)

are all real and given by C— .02284; —.01226; .03696; .05841)

Because the stable roots are so small, convergence to the steady

                                                              1
                                                                     .     We

assume lJg = 2, so the public debt converges with a mean lag of

33.3 periods when r* =             .03.   The consequences of a permanent tax

cut financed by a temporary cut in spending are as follows. The

long—run effect is to boost domestic private consumption, because

human wealth increases, and to lower the relative price of foreign

goods, r .        K, w, i and r are unchanged in the long run; since
r* =    U   ,   public   debt decreases and net foreign assets increase by

equal amounts.



If the tax cut is not only permanent but also unanticipated, the full

long-run adjustment of all endogenous variables other than bG and F

takes place immediately, i.e. 'rr falls instantaneously to clear the

market for the domestic good at the higher level of domestic consumption

demand and nothing else changes.



An anticipated future permanent tax cut also causes an immediate,

discrete upward move in aggregate consumption, q, at the date that
                                           33



the unexpected announcement of the future tax cut occurs. After
the   initial jump, q is still slightly below              its   new steady state

level and continues to rise towards it. It is the effect of future

tax cuts on current human capital that causes this response. The

relative price of foreign output falls discretely on impact, but

by less than the long-run decline: it 'undershoots' its long-run

equilibrium. value. Since ir continues to fall after the                  initial   drop,

the interest rate declines on impact and stays below the world level

throughout the adjustment process.               4'   increases on impact and capital
begins to accumulate. This process, however, is reversed in due course

as 4'    falls   below unity and the capital stock returns to its initial

value. At the announcement date, w increases because of the increase

in 4'.     Saving, however, is very negative initially, as consumption is
raised before the tax cuts come through. w becomes negative, reaches a

minimum     at   the date the tax cut comes through and then returns to zero.



With     the unanticipated tax     cut, bG declines and F rises throughout
                                     •G
the adjustment process (with b =                - F).    In the case of the anticipated

future tax cut, F falls until the tax cut is actually implemented and

rises thereafter. bG rises until the tax cut occurs and declines

thereafter.        It is no longer the case that F + b              = 0   at each instant.



An unexpected permanent increase in the world                 real interest rate r*
lowers     K in the long run, raises w and q and lowers it.               F increases

and bG falls. The impact effect on w, q and it with K predetermined,

is the exact opposite.        4'   falls   discretely, reducing wealth (w becomes

negative). Consumption falls because both w and h are lower. With
                                                 34




private domestic consumption and investment demand dn, but output

still predetermined, it rises. In the long run, of course, r falls,

so !.    becomes negative immediately following the initial increase

in IT. The positive effect of the increase in r* on r is not, however,

offset completely by the (anticipated) decline in rr and r rises on

impact. Savings are positive and w increases steadily after the

initial capital loss. Capital decumulates steadily.



The second version has r* =                    .05,   0 =   .04,   A =    .03,      = .031,

  =    .25,    M = 1.3155511,              =    .6    and as before, T = .25 j(K),

gx     = .15 j(K ) and          ii g   =   .05 j(K 0).      This implies that Ko = 8.55,
  0
                0                oy0
bG     = 1.28 (       j(K0 ))    and   F = -3.82.        The four characteristic roots
                                        0
of    the K, w, q,          subsystem are (—.01558, —.01115, .05820 and

.07853). The root governing bG (with i = 2)                              is —.05.




A permanent tax cut raises q and w in the long run, leaves K unaffected

and lowers        .     F increases by more than bG decreases. If the tax cut

is unexpected, ij increases on impact, thus raising w. Consumption jumps

up discretely and continues to rise gradually thereafter. w, after the

initial capital gain, rises smoothly. The capital stock increases

initially, as JJ exceeds unity, but then falls back to its original

value.        rr drops sharply on impact (because none of the                    public   spending

cuts fall on demand for domestic output) and then declines gradually

to its new steady-state value, i.e. it undershoots on impact. The

interest rate falls on impact and rises gradually back to its original

value.
                                            35


An anticipated future tax cut (of the same magnitude), leads to a
smaller          discrete increase in q at the announcement date.             ir also

declines by less on impact and its subsequent rate of decline is

initially smaller numerically than under the immediate tax cut, but

becomes larger subsequently. 4                   rises   by more on impact.

Dissaving takes place between the announcement date and the

implementation date. Once the tax cut                    is in effect saving becomes
positive          again.




A permanent increase in r* has the long-run effect of lowering K, bG
arid ir and raising w, F and q. Again the impact effects on w, q and

ir are in the opposite direction. The analysis is qualitatively very

similar to the case where r* = e.



A long-run tax cut financed by a temporary tax increase




We   now treat both g           g   + irg        and g      as parametric and have taxes

determined by (26) with v =            0,    i.e. by


     =              •G
             1
                 i.ib        T —1
and, therefore,

         =           bG    + 1T (g —


          Note that a change in T1 in the semi-small open economy model,

unlike in the very small open economy model, does not merely involve

the redistribution over time of a given present discounted value of

future taxes; while the spending programme is given, the interest rate
                                                    36


is endogenous          in the semi-small open economy outside the steady
       7/
state.

The       values of the parameters for both numerical versions are the same
as with the "spending endogenous" policy except that now ilg =                                0    and
      =    -2. The long—run effects of changes in                             (and in r*) are the
same under the "tax endogenous"                 policy          as under the spending endogenous
                                                                                                  8/
policy. The transitional dynamics are, however, very different.


Both in version 1                (r* = 0 =   .03)        and in version 2          (r* =   .05 > 0 = .04)
an unexpected, immediate reduction in                             lowers consumption in the

short run. The reason is that total taxes T are actually increased

initially by so much that human capital declines.                                  (and therefore w)

and r increase on impact.




7.        In the two—country model interest rates are endogenous both in the
          short run and in the long run.

After the initial capital gain, dissaving takes place. This is

ultimately reversed with w going back to the original steady state

value of zero in version 1 (r* =          ) and   rising beyond it in

version 2 (r* >     0).   Capital accumulates for a while and then

reverts to its original level. The initial decline in consumption

is reversed as human wealth increasingly reflects the long—run

tax cuts   and   non—human wealth recovers. Government debt is retired

continuously,     even after total tax receipts have become less than
in the initial equilibrium. This reflects the budgetary effects of
lower debt service payments. The current account is in surplus
throughout.


The unexpected announcement of a future cut in               has a qualitatively
smaller impact effecton 4,      w,   q and ,      although   the direction is
unchanged.


After the initial capital gain at the "announcement date", non—human
wealth, w, continues to accumulate until the moment                is actually
cut. The sharp increase in total taxes at the "implementation date"
starts   a process of dissaving which is in due course reversed again

as the long-run     tax cut   comes through. There still is a current
                                                                            -
account    surplus and a   public sector budget surplus throughout,

although   the latter is very small until            is actually cut (and r
increased).

V      The two-country model



       Stationary equilibrium


       In a long—run stationary equilibrium the exogenous variables are

        It is informative to solve the domestic ouput market equilibrium
        condition (55) and the foreign output market equilibrium
        condition      (56) for the two "fundamental"long-run endogenous
        variables r and it.

        The analysis can be simplified somewhat by specifying public
        spending analogously with private consumption                in the following

        sense:




(60a)   g + 1rg        =   g                where g is independent of it

         The effect of lower taxes and higher public spending (domestic or

         foreign) is to lower the long-run world interest rate. This is only

         a paradox       until one remembers that lower taxes or higher spending are,
         across steady            states, associated with lower public debt (see (57) and

         (58)). Of course the process of adjustment towards such a lower debt

         steady state will involve transitorily higher taxes and/or lower

         public spending to achieve the surpluses necessary for retiring the

         debt. The association of higher spending with lower interest rates

         is present regardless of the composition of the spending increase between

         domestic and foreign output.

The effect of tax cuts on the terms of trade in the long run can be

explained in terms of a familiar transfer problem criterion plus a

correction for supply adjustments. E.g. from (67b), ignoring

supply-side adjustments (k' = k*P =         0),   a domestic tax cut will raise

the relative price of domestic output               >   o) if a >     c   ,   i.e.   if

the marginal (and average) propensity to consume domestic output is

greater at home than abroad. Lower taxes also are associated with

lower interest rates, higher capital-labour ratios and higher output.

If there is no bias in domestic private consumption towards home

goods (a =4) and if technologies are similar in the sense that k' =k*',

the output adjustment term vanishes. If there is a bias towards home

goods (a >        and if k' and k*' are similar, then the supply effect
             4)
reinrorces the transfer effect and            > 0       a-fortiori.       By exactly

analogous reasoning, given supply,                > 0 if a* > a           or 1—c <        1—a.

A cut in foreign taxes will raise the relative price of foreign goods

if foreigners allocate a larger fraction of their total consumption

spending to foreign goods than do domestic residents. Again the same kind

of supply side effect that was discussed for a domestic tax cut must be

allowed for. We shall not consider it any further here or below when

the effects of spending increases on ir are discussed.



An increase in domestic public spending raises the relative price of

domestic output        <   0   )   if the domestic public sector's marginal
                                                  _____
propensity   to spend on domestic output                     exceeds a weighted

average of the domestic and foreign private marginal propensities to

spend on domestic output, i.e. if (ignoring supply effects)

Similarly, an increase    in foreign public spending will raise the

relative price of foreign output                Oj   if the foreign public

exceeds a weighted average of domestic foreign private marginal

propensities to spend on foreign output 1 —            and 1 —   a*. The
exact condition can be obtained from (67h).



In terms of Figure 3 ,     a domestic tax increase or spending cut shifts

yy up and to the right while yy shifts up and to the left.

A foreign tax increase or spending cut shifts yy and yy in the

same   directions.


Having derived the steady-state effects on 71         and   r, the remaining
long-run   comparative statics is straightforward. Any policy
change   that raises r lowers the capital stock at home and abroad.
Lower long—run domestic taxes are associated with a lower long—run

stock of domestic public debt, with a lower global interest rate

and a higher capital stock in both countries. Domestic human                capital
is higher and consumption is almost certain to increase. Foreign

human capital (measured in foreign output) is also increased because
                                                   46




       of the lower r and higher K*; the lower interest rate is likely to

       reduce foreign non-human wealth and foreign consumption in the

       long   run.




       With T*        and g* given, a lower world interest rate still requires,
       at a given value of , a larger long-run stock of foreign public

       debt (assuming b > 0 initially). This could be reversed by a

       decline in r.




       Finally,       there is the effect of domestic and                   foreign   fiscal policy

       on the long run           value   of F.




       From equation (59) it is easily checked that, in response to a change

       in some exogenous variable z, F changes as follows



(68)
       dz
              =   —   ! EF

                                                            f'k'lj dz   +

                                                                             r
                                                                                 (8-4-X)X .L
                                                                                         dz
                                                                                               +
                                                                                                   r dz




       At a given interest rate, a higher steady state level of public spending

       must be associated with a larger stock of claims on the rest of the

       model, in order to finance the increase in the excess of domestic

       absorption over domestic income. Since increased public spending is

       associated in the long run with a lower interest rate, and thus a larger

       domestic capital stock and domestic output level, this indirect

       effect will tend to lower F. The reduction in private consumption

       likely to be associated with a lower value of r will also tend to

       lower F. Finally, a lower value of r will cet. par. worsen (impro.re)
                               47




the current account through the debt service (foreign investment

income) component rF if the country is a net creditor with F > 0

(a net debtor with F < 0). Thus cet. par. a positive (negative)

value of F will tend to make        positive (negative) through the

net foreign interest component. With minor and obvious changes,

the argument about the effect of an increase in g on F also applies

to a cut in T .   It is also easily seen that an increase in g* will
tend to have the opposite effect on F of an increase in g and that

a cut in r will tend to have the opposite effect on F of a cut in t.

It seems plausible that the "direct" effect of an increase in g or

a cut in T of raising F in the long run will outweigh the indirect

effects through production, private consumption and net foreign

investment income. Our numerical examples do indeed all have this

property, although it is not implied by all parameter values consistent

with saddlepoint stability.




Dynamic adjustment



The linearized structural form of the two-country mode]. is given in

Appendix 2. The production functions in the two countries are

assumed to be Cobb-Douglas with competitive capital shares     and I3

respectively. To calculate the initial stationary equilibrium we

must assign values to ,
   *x
                          , , , 0,       0*, A, X, ,   a*,   8x

     *
  x48 y
         , g, g*,    and T. A full characterization of the dynamic

behaviour also requires values for    and   .  There are eight

linearly independent state variables in the linearized state—space

representation of the model.   A convenient choice of state variables

    G
is b ,   b*G K, K*, w, h, h* and .
            ,                                For a (locally) unique convergent
saddlepoint equilibrium solution to exist we therefore require five

stable and three unstable characteristic roots in the state matrix.



The one—commodity case




First consider the special case of the model where the relatIve price

of foreign goods, it, is constant throughout in response to tax changes.

This requires not only that the private domestic propensity to spend on

domestic output equals the foreign private propensity to spend on domestic

output (cx =    a*) but also that the supply responses to the interest rate

changes induced by the fiscal policy have no further effect on r (see

equations (67b) and (67d)). This extension of the familiar transfer

criterion for a change in the terms of trade is of course unnecessary

when output is exogenous (k' =    k*I    =   0).


The numerical details of the first simulation are given in Table 1.

The two countries are identical (with a =            = .5)   and the initial long—

run equilibrium is one with F = 0.



The policy experiment is an increase in              Because of our tax function

this policy experiment amounts to a short-run tax cut followed by (and

indeed necessitating) a long—run tax increase through its effect on the

stock of outstanding public debt.

Figure 4 shows the dynamic response of the key variables in the

two countries.



The long-run response to the increase in    is a larger stock of

domestic public debt, -a small reduction in the foreign stock of

public debt; equal reductions in the domestic and foreign capital

stocks; a small increase in domestic private non-human wealth;

a larger increase in foreign non-human wealth; a large reduction in

domestic human capital and a smaller reduction in foreign human

capital. The interest rate goes up, domestic consumption falls and

foreign consumption rises. The net foreign asset position of the

home country becomes negative as domestic government debt crowds out

domestic net foreign assets as well as domestic and foreign real

capital.   Tr is, of course, unaffected in the long run as in the short

run. The system exhibits (local) saddlepoint stability.



The dynamic response to an unexpected, immediate (at t = 0) and

permanent increase in     as follows.




In the short run, taxes are cut by about the same amount they will be

raised in the long run. The tax cut is reversed gradually and becomes

an increase from period 14 on. The stock markets (4' and   4'*)   fall on
impact in both countries, reflecting higher anticipated future interest

rates. The behaviour of 4' and 4* and of K and K* is identical. The

interest rate rises only gradually. Domestic consumption increases on

impact, reaches a peak soon after and then begins a steady decline. -

Foreign consumption drops on impact, reaches a trough soon afterwards

and   increases        steadily thereafter to its higher new long—i-un level.



If the foreign country were to raise T at the same time and by the

same amount as the home country raises T1, the results are the following.

In the long run, all "country—specific" endogenous variables change

by the same -amount in each country. F of course remains unchanged.

b
 G
      and b*Gincrease by the same amount and             the   change in bG + b*G is
exactly twice that when only T1              was   increased. K and K* fall by twice
as    much while r increases twice as much. Consumption declines in both

countries, as does human capital. The current account remains in balance

throughout the adjustment process. In fact, all domestic and foreign

variables (b and b
                   G        *G
                                 ,   K and K*, w and w*, h and h*, i     and    ,q   and q*,

t    and   T*)   move in the same way. The long—run            tax   increase   is preceded,
in    both countries by an initial cut in total taxes which boosts consumption

and creates budget deficits which only vanish asymptotically. The joint

move towards fiscal expansion in the short run creates a steeper decline

in the two countries' stock markets.



The only way for the foreign country to avoid the higher world interest

rate resulting from the short—run expansionary fiscal action in the home

country, is for the former to engage in short-run contractionary fiscal

action. Consider e.g. a policy response by the foreign country which

consists of a reduction in                  (and therefore a short run increase in T*)

equal in magnitude to the increase in T1. The result is no change in

r,    i, ij, K     and K* in the short run or in the long run.              All other country—
 specific        endogenous variables change by opposite amounts in the long—run

 and during the adjustment process. The home country runs budget deficits
                                          53




and   current   account deficits throughout while the foreign country runs

budget surpluses and current account surpluses. In the long run w and h-

are down (and w and h* are up by equal amounts). Consumption falls at

home in the long run and declines abroad. The short term response is in

the opposite direction.




These results are not affected qualitatively by changing parameter values

in   such a way that the initial stationary equilibrium is one in which the
home country is a net creditor (F0 > 0) or a net debtor (F < 0). E.g.
consider g0 =     .1939 and g = .10   while keeping the     other parameter values

the   same as those given in Table 1.      This "shifting" of public spending

towards   the   home country lowers   the initial long-run value      of bG to 2.534,

raises that of b to 4.412 but leaves r and r unchanged. The home
                   0                           0    0
country   becomes a net creditor with F0 = .939.        The characteristic roots

are   virtually the same as inthe case where F =        0   (specifically, the
saddlepoint equilibrium configuration with 5 stable and          3   unstable roots
persists) and even quantitatively the short—run and long-run response of
the   system is not much affected. Shifting public spending the other way,

towards the foreign country,with g = .10,          g* = .1939        and bG = 4.412,

b:G = 2.534      and F = - .9390213     again does not yield a picture that is

significantly different from that shown in Figure 4.



The two-commodity case



We now introduce a bias in private spending towards a country's own good,

i.e. c > ct. The first numerical example, specified fully in Table 2a,

again has F0 =     0.   The adjustment process following an unanticipated permanent
                                       54




increase in r1 is shown in Figure 5. The long—run effect of an

increase in T1 on most endogenous variables is qualitatively the

same as in the one-good case. One exception is that b         shows a

small increase rather than a small decline. The reason for this,

as can be seen from equation (58),is the long—run increase in ri. The long—

run reduction in home (consumption) demand worsens the home country's terms

of trade since the share of domestic consumption spending falling

on domestic output is higher than the share of foreign consumption

spending allocated to domestic output (ct > a*).



    Because ir now varies over time, there is a certain amount of

"decoupling" between domestic and foreign capital formation during the

adjustment process. The short—run domestic tax cut outweighs the

long-run tax increase, so h and q increase on impact. With q* falling,

the terms of trade improve in the short run. After the initial

discontinuous drop in it, however, it rises smoothly throughout the

adjustment process. This rise in iris anticipated. Since r* =           r_!
is the interest rate governing ijj*,   the   foreign stock market falls by

less initially than the domestic one and domestic capital decumulates

more swiftly than foreign capital.



A simultaneous, equal increase in T1 and T has exactly the same effect

as it has in the one-good version of the model since 11 remains constant

throughout. While   this   stabilizes the real exchange rate relative to a

unilateral increase in T1,   it reinforces the effect on the interest rate.

A policy of reducing T by the same amount as the increase in r1 does

indeed stabilize the interest rate (r) but reinforces the swings in it

which falls by more in the short run and rises by more in the long run.
To prevent both n and r from changing, two fiscal instruments (e.g. *

and g*) must be used.



Even   when the terms of trade are endogenous, the sign of the initial
external net worth position of the two countries does not appear to have
crucial implications for the qualitative stability or saddlepoint
properties of the model. Table 2 shows how the desired saddlepoint
configuration   is present when F is negative   (Table 2b) and   when F

is positive (Table 2c).    Qualitatively, the long-run and short-run

responses of the endogenous variables in the net external creditor and

the net external debtor cases are similar to each other and to the zero

net external debt case.

Conclusion



   The purpose of this paper has been to study certain aspects of

public debt and deficits in the open economy using a model in which

private sector behavioural relationships have been derived explicitly

from optimizing behaviour. The public sector's present value budget

constraint or solvency constraint, together with the. assumption that

the real interest rate exceeds the rate of growth, was shown to tie
                                                    11/
together current tax cuts and future tax increases.     In a two—country

setting such a policy would raise the interest rate in an integrated

global capital market, crowd out private capital at home and abroad

and worsen a country's external net worth position. If in addition

private spending shows a preference, at the margin, for domestic output

over foreign output, then the policy would improve the terms of trade in the

short run but cause them to worsen in the long run.



    The analysis brings out the central role of the interest rate in

transmitting disturbances between countries when capital markets are

highly integrated. While there always exist paths (or contingent

rules) for the domestic fiscal policy instrument that can neutralize

any incipient shocks to the path of interest rates originating from

abroad, such "stabilizing" policy actions inevitably involve costs.

Even if lump—sum taxes are used, intertemporal (and therefore inter-

generational) redistribution of the tax burden is inevitable. If lump—

sum taxes are not available, dead—weight losses and excess burdens will

be imposed. Varying the public spending programme involves distortions

in the intertemporal allocation of public consumption. If public sector

     monetary economy by Sargent and Wallace (1981].

capital   formation (not considered in this paper) is varied yet   other
costs   are incurred. Taxing international capital flows may    be an
interesting   second-best policy.



      The finite private decision horizon (or the excess of the    effective
private discount rate over the government's discount rate) permits a

non—trivial analysis of one of the central current issues of financial

policy: the consequences for private saving and    capital    formation of

varying   the time pattern of taxation and borrowing.


        Several possible extensions of the model came to mind. The first is
to   add money to the asset menu. To do this properly would be a major

task, but the ad—hoc inclusion of domestic money as an argument in the

direct utility function may be a useful first step.       If non—interest-

bearing government fiat money is added to the instantaneous utility function

in logarithmic form (+ y ln m, where m is the nominal money stock

deflated by the Cobb-Douglas price index, p, appropriate to the utility

function) the extension is trivial.



        Money demand is given by m =
                                       r+• q     and is unit elastic with


respect to the nominal interest rate r+            If all non—money assets

are index—linked, money is a veil. Super—neutrality prevails in the

short    run as in the long run and in response to any kind   of monetary

shock. Real interest rates are unaffected by monetary policy. The real

seigniorage    the authorities can   extract through monetary expansion is

independent    of the rate of growth of nominal money and of the rate of
inflation. The terms of trade are independent of the behaviour of the
                                       61



nominal exchange rate.



     If nominally denominated interest-bearing public debt exists in

addition to money, unanticipated monetary policy changes which cause

discontinuous jumps in the general price level can inflict capital

losses or gains on the holders of these nominal assets. A non—unitary

interest elasticity of demand for real money balances permits the

consideration   of seigniorage issues.



     A second   important issue   is the de facto   non-existence of lump—sum
taxation. Barro [1979] analyzed the problem of the optimal inter—
temporal pattern of distortionary taxation and (under very strong conditions)
derived a version of the "uniform tax rate over time" result for an
economy in which "first—order debt neutrality" held. It would be rather
more relevant to study this problem in a world which does not have this

strong   first order debt neutrality property, such as the Yaari—Blanchard
model or the overlapping generations model without operative intergenerational
gifts and bequests.


     A further desirable extension would be to relax the unattractive,
highly   restrictive perfect   capital market assumption which permits

private agents, once allowance is made for their finite expected lifetimes,

to borrow   on the same terms as the goverrunent.


     Fourth, labour market disequilibrium could be added as a feature
to the model. The simplest approach simply posits different combinations
and degrees of nominal and     real   wage rigidity. The obvious starting point
                                     62



here is the work of Sachs [1983].



     Finally, the model is inhabited by well-informed, rationally

anticipating and optimizing private agents and rather mechanically

acting governments. Clearly, government behaviour should be endogenized

in a more satisfactory manner. The interaction between the two

national governments could be strategic in nature. Recent developments

in differential game theory and its applications to economics hold

considerable promise (see e.g. Miller and Salmon [1983]).



     The Yaari—Blanchard model, as developed in this paper would seem

to be a flexible vehicle forthe analysis of a wide range of interesting

issues in international economics.

Private consumption behaviour and asset demand



      The   essential features of the model of consumer behaviour are
taken from Yaari [1965], as presented in Blanchard (1983a, b].
Time is continuous. At each instant a new age cohort, composed of
many agents, is born. The size of each cohort is        normalized to

A, 0 < A < 1. During their lifetime each agent faces a common,

constant instantaneous probability of death A. All surviving agents

therefore have a life expectancy of A1.           A is also taken to be

the   proportion of agents in each cohort which die at each instant.
The size of the surviving cohort at time t which was born at time t°
                A(t—t.° )
is therefore Xe           . Total population at any time t is constant
and given by A- )r   e—A(t—s)   ds =   1.



      All surviving agents have the same labour income. Private agents
can save or dissave by buying or selling bonds and domestic capital
(which are perfect    substitutes) or by buying or selling annuities

in a perfect insurance market.          There is no direct foreign investment.

Bonds   are   short and have a fixed value in terms of good x, the

domestically    produced good.     The instantaneous interest rate is
r(t).       Since there is no bequest motive and negative bequests are

not permitted, agents will contract to have their entire non—human

wealth   returned to the life insurance company in the event of their death.
The life insurance industry is competitive and subject to free entry.
Thus if an agent's non-human wealth is w they will receive A at each
                                                         64




instant they are alive and pay w to the insurance company                                 the day
they die.



       Each agent born               at   time t has the utility function (1) which

he maximizes at each instant s subject to the budget constraint (2).

       is governed by

    Production and private investment



    We consider a competitive economy with continuous full employment.

    The production function has constant returns to labour and capital

     and satisfies the Inada conditions. Domestic output y is therefore

     given by



(15) y = f(K)              f' > 0;     f" < 0;        f(O) =   0;     urn f' =
                                                                      K+0

                           urn f' = 0
                           K-°


     It follows that labour income, j                 is   given by



     j
          =    f(K)   —   Kf' (K)
     or

     j
          =    j(K)                 g' > 0



     Private capital formation involves the transformation of domestic

     output into capital and is subject to quadratic internal costs of

     adjustment. The firm's objective functional is

        A convenient representation of the linearized model involves 8 state
                                        G   *G
        variables (x                  {b , b ,    K, K*, w, h, h*, i}'), eleven output
        variables or short—run endogenous variables

        (y         {q, q*, r, T, T1 F, ii, )*, ff *, W*}t) and six exogenous or

        forcing variables (z                  {t1, T, g, g*, ,              g*}I)   The inclusion of

        both it and                  and their rates of change as output variables is merely

        a device to let the computer do more of the work.



        The boundary conditions for four of the state variables are given by

        the assignment of given initial values:



CiBa)   bG(O)


(lBb)   b*G(0) =             b
                                 *
(lBc)   K(0)        =        K

(18d)   K*(0)




        The initial value of w is given by the linear restriction:


(18e    w(0) =           w(0)         + ((O) —    4(O))K           =   w(0)   + (4(O) —
                                                                                           1)K.-"
        10. We make              use   of the assumption that (0) =              P*(O)     =   1.
                           72




The remaining boundary   conditions   (for h, h* and )   take the
form of the restriction that the system has to lie on the

stable manifold. Provided the state matrix of the linearized

system has three unstable roots, this suffices to ensure a

unique (convergent and continuous except at those moments

when "news"   arrives) solution.


The linearized system is represented in (19) and (20).

        Provided (21a) has as many stable characteristic roots as pre-

       a unique convergent solution exists. This result is of course strictly

       local in our model.



       The   algorithm "Saddlepointt' of Austin and Buiter [19821 only permits
       boundary conditions for the predetermined variables of the    form

       x     contains   the predetermined variables for which the boundary conditions

       take the form of linear restrictions at the initial date (w in our model).



       In    terms of the notation of equation (22), boundary condition (iBe)
       can be represented as in equation (23).
