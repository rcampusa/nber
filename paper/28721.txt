                                         ABSTRACT

We examine respondents in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to observe how their
financial situations unfolded as they aged. We focus on low income older adults and follow them
over time to identify the factors associated with having low income at baseline and thereafter. We
find that (a) real income remained relatively stable as individuals approach and enter retirement,
and progress through their retirement years, and (b) labor force participation declined and thus
earnings became less important with age, while Social Security and retirement savings rose as a
proportion of annual income.

What Explains Low Old-Age Income? Evidence from
        the Health and Retirement Study
       A long-held view in the economics of aging has been that retired

individuals live on fixed income, so their real income declines with inflation.

To evaluate this proposition and to assess how individuals fare in later life,

this study follows individuals in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for

over two decades and finds that average real income remains relatively stable

for this cohort. As they age, Social Security and retirement savings replace

earnings enabling retirees to maintain their economic status even for

individuals in the lowest quartile of the income distribution.

       Moreover, older consumers often undertake financial decisions in

later life that can end up eroding their retirement security. For instance, older

workers may take on excessive debt, opt for lump sum distributions rather

than retirement income streams from retirement plans, claim Social Security

benefits early, or retire before they are eligible for Medicare despite not

having health insurance. In addition, they may be subject to shocks such as

unemployment and disability, which can also leave them vulnerable.

       This paper examines some of the factors explaining why the income

of older Americans fluctuates as they transition from working to retirement,

devoting special attention to work, saving, health, and other measurable

factors. We use a rich longitudinal and nationally representative dataset

known as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) covering individuals age
                                                                           2


50-61 when first surveyed, and we follow them as they age, to track their

financial situations. Specifically, we pose and answer three questions:

·     What factors are associated with low incomes for older Americans

nearing retirement?

·     Which financial and other behaviors appear to improve or set back

low-income peoples' financial status as they move through their later years?

·     Does real income decline as individuals enter and live through

retirement? If so, is this a particular problem of low and middle income

households?

      In what follows, we first describe how we identify low-income older

adults, and how we follow them over time. The Original HRS cohort was

first inducted into the HRS in 1992 when respondents were age 51-61. We

report on factors associated with being a low-income respondent when we

first observe our panel, at baseline. Subsequently, we estimate profiles of

income by age and explore which factors are associated with increasing or

decreasing incomes in later years.

      The subsequent section discusses how results change when we include

the annuitized value of wealth in older persons' financial resources. In an

extension, we compare the Original HRS group with the War Babies cohort

(WBB) first included in 1998, and the Early Baby Boomer cohort (EBB) first
                                                                                            3


included in 2004.We follow all three cohorts though their 2016 interviews. 1

Throughout, all dollar values are provided in real $2019 terms.

        To this end, we collect data on household earnings from employment

and self-employment; income from pensions or annuities; income from

Social Security; unemployment and worker compensation benefits, and
                                   2
household capital income.              We adjust these household money income

values using the conventional household equivalency metric used by both

the CBO and the OECD, 3 which divides total household money income by

an adjustment factor to obtain the individual's Adjusted Money Income. In

a subsequent analysis, we compute Adjusted Full Income measures over

time, where this measure includes the annuitized value of the respondent's

net wealth. 4

  A 2018 HRS survey wave has been made available, but many of the variables we require
for our analysis have not yet been constructed for this dataset. Moreover, there are no HRS
data available as of yet on experiences during the pandemic; see Clark, Lusardi and
Mitchell (2021) for more on that topic.
2
  These measures are available from the RAND datafile with imputations for missing data;
see https://www.rand.org/well-being/social-and-behavioral-
policy/centers/aging/dataprod/hrs-data.html
3
   To test robustness of our results, we also examined a second equivalency measure also
used by the OECD where the formula is First Adult + 0.5 × Subsequent Adults + 0.3 ×
Children (< age 18, if any). Results are similar so we focused on the first, more widely used,
adjustment.

  Total household wealth is defined as the sum of the value of the primary and secondary
residence (if any), plus the net value of real estate; vehicles; businesses; IRA and Keogh
accounts; stocks, mutual funds, and investment trusts; checking, savings, or money market
accounts; CD, government savings bonds, and T-bills; bonds and bond funds, and all other
savings; minus the sum of all mortgages/land contracts (primary and secondary residence),
other home loans, and other debt. Company pension and social security wealth values are
not included. If net wealth fell below $1, we assigned a value of $1 for the log
transformations below. For additional evidence on rising cohort debt through time, see
Lusardi, Mitchell, and Oggero (2018, 2019).
                                                                           4


       Our study following the same individuals in three cohorts over time

provides the following key insights:

1. Factors most closely associated with being in the lowest income quartiles

   at baseline included being Black or Hispanic, female, having less

   education, being nonmarried, not working for pay, being disabled, and

   having underage children at home. Additionally, respondents resident in

   the South of the country were systematically more likely to be in the

   lowest quartile.

2. As we follow respondents as they age, those initially found in the two

   lowest Income quartile at baseline were able to maintain their real

   income throughout retirement. The stability of real income occurs as

   Social Security and retirement saving replace declining earnings. Those

   in the third quartile experienced economic declines as they aged.

3. People in the highest baseline groups saw large improvements in income

   as they aged, ending up with values 30% higher than at baseline. In other

   words, including the annuitized share of wealth when measuring peoples'

   access to resources improved our measure of many elderly respondents'

   financial conditions. Nevertheless, even after taking in to account

   household wealth, that Blacks and Hispanics, women, the least educated,

   disabled, the nonmarrieds, and residents of the US South, still fared
                                                                                         5


    relatively worse in later life, along with those having underage children

    and health problems.

       While there have been many prior studies of peoples' financial status

in retirement, there are relatively few that follow cohorts of individuals as

they age. One analysis by Brown, Dynan, and Figinski (2020) examined only

two waves, 1994 and 2014, of the Health and Retirement Study, for persons

initially age 57-62. By contrast, we track respondents from three separate

birth cohorts, and we follow them every two years from their baseline wave

through 2014. Accordingly, we have a far more detailed and granular

perspective of the factors associated with financial conditions at older ages,

compared to prior research.



1. Building the Baseline Original HRS Dataset

       We begin by examining the Original HRS cohort, where we first focus

on a sample of 9,955 individuals initially age 50-61 when they were first

surveyed at baseline, in 1992. For this sample, we have 13 waves of data

enabling us to follow them through time every other year from 1992 to

2016. 5 In the process, we collect each household's money income (e.g. labor



5
 People could attrite for several reasons. Some respondents refused or are unable to do the
interviews because of illness or due to being in a nursing home. Sometimes respondents may
have moved and been lost to follow up. When respondents died, the HRS sought to conduct
"exit interviews" with the next of kin; this was successful in a majority of cases. If a
respondent was institutionalized, efforts were made to survey the respondent's proxy. Our
data are available only on HRS respondents, not proxies or exit interviews.
                                                                              6


earnings, pension benefits, Social Security benefits, disability benefits,

welfare benefits, withdrawals from accounts (e.g. IRAs, bank accounts), self-

employment income, consulting income, and any other income (see

Appendix Table 1 for descriptive statistics). Dollar values across all years

are expressed in $2019 values using the CPI. We next divide total household

money income by a family size adjustment to obtain an individual's Adjusted

Money Income (these measures are identical in single person households).

In separate robustness analysis, we also add in the annuitized value of

household wealth including net financial and nonfinancial assets; we then

adjust household wealth by the same equivalency measure and compute the

annuity value of this wealth if the respondent were to convert his or her share

to an income flow in retirement. This second measure we call Adjusted Full

Income.

       The HRS is a very rich dataset, as it contains information on each

respondent's age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, current and past

marital/partnered status, labor force status, self-reported health (limitations

of daily living, the respondent's depression score, self-assessed chance that

the respondent will live to age [X= 65, 75], high blood pressure, diabetes,

cancer, lung disease, heart disease, had suffered a stroke, psychiatric disease,

arthritis, ulcer, cognition score, numeracy score), and whether the respondent

had health insurance status (none, private, public). Adjusted Money Income
                                                                                         7


was based on self-reports of all household income including respondent and

spouse earnings, pensions and annuities, Social Security Disability and

Supplemental Income payments, Social Security retirement, unemployment

and workers compensation, other government transfers, household capital

income, and other income.

       Figure 1 depicts the distribution of the Adjusted Money Income values

at baseline for our Original HRS cohort in 1992 (in $2019). According to

this metric, baseline median Adjusted Money Income for respondents age

50-61 was around $44,795 (in $2019), with 1% having no or negative

earnings, and 4.1% earning over $150,000.

Figure 1 here

        Next, we split the baseline sample into four Adjusted Money Income

quartiles, shown at the bottom of Figure 1. 6 The lowest group, Q1, had

annual median Adjusted Money Income of $11,411; Q2 had $30,770; Q3

had median income of around $53,504; and Q4, the highest income group,

had median income of around $94,050. Figure 1 also indicates that there

were about 2,400 respondents per quartile at baseline, and the quartile cutoffs

for Q2, Q3, and Q4 were, respectively, $21,024, $41,596, and $68,345.

 Our analysis follows individuals by their position in the income quartiles at baseline. Of
course, individuals may move up or down across quartiles over time. Hungerford (2019,
2020) examines how income distributions change with age.
                                                                               8


      In separate robustness analysis to be explained in more detail below,

we also undertake an analysis of Adjusted Full Income, which we define as

adjusted money income plus the annuitized value of baseline wealth.



2. Lowest Income Recipients in the Original HRS Cohort at Baseline

       To evaluate the factors associated with being in the lowest adjusted

money income quartile at baseline, we focus initially on the Original HRS

respondents first surveyed when they were age 50-61. The factors associated

with being in the lowest income quartile, Q1, are derived from a multivariate

logit regression analysis with estimated marginal effects reported in Table 1.

Here, the first Column uses an abbreviated set of controls, while Column 2

includes additional health, insurance coverage, and region controls. All

variables are measured at baseline.

Table 1 here

       We see in Column 1 that Blacks and Hispanics, women, the least

educated, and nonmarried persons were more likely to be found in Q1, as are

disabled persons and people with underage children at home. Nonworking

persons were also more likely to be in Q1, as were residents of the US South.

These findings are robust to the inclusion of additional controls, as is evident

from Column 2. That is, the magnitude and statistical significance of the

estimated coefficients for Blacks and Hispanics, nonmarried, lower-
                                                                               9


educated, and women are relatively robust to the addition of controls. Having

underage children also continues to predict Q1 Adjusted Money Income. In

addition, we see that those in poor health and with health problems were

more likely to have Q1 Adjusted Money Income than their counterparts, as

are people without health insurance. Those working for pay were 20% less

likely to have Q1 Adjusted Money Income in Column 1, though the effect

halves to 11% after health and health insurance are controlled in Column 2.

         One clear finding in Column 2 is that the probability of a respondent

being in the Q1 Adjusted Money Income group at baseline was higher for

older persons. That is, Column 2 shows that people age 56 and younger were

half as likely to be in the lowest quartile at baseline, compared to people age

57-61.

         Table 2 provides additional detail on the probability of being in any

of the lowest three Adjusted Money Income quartiles (Q1, Q2, or Q3), versus

being in the reference or highest quartile (Q4) at baseline. Again, logit

marginal effects are reported. Most of the results gleaned from Table 1 are

confirmed here as well. For instance, age effects are mostly not significant

up to about age 58. Thereafter, people were more likely to be found in Q1

than in the higher income quartiles, and this effect is strongest for those over

the age of 58. As before, men were less likely than women to be in any of

the bottom three quartiles and more likely to have top quartile Adjusted
                                                                            10


Money Income. Also before, Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be in

Q1 than Q4, as are the least educated and nonmarried persons. Being in poor

health or disabled, not having health insurance, and not working for pay are

all factors clearly associated with worse economic standing, as before. In

terms of quantitative magnitudes, not working for pay is associated with a

12-22% higher chance of being in the lowest compared to the highest

quartile. In other words, groups that subsequently were the hardest-hit by the

COVID-19 pandemic were already in a financially fragile state beforehand

(Economic Policy Institute, 2020). Residents of the US South were roughly

as likely to be in the lowest quartile as are respondents having underage

children. Overall, the baseline results tell a consistent story about the

directionality of the factors predictive of low incomes at baseline, when most

Americans are nearing retirement.

3.    Age-Income Profiles Over Time for the Original HRS Cohort

      This section asks how real income changes with age for this cohort,

and whether these changes differ across respondents in the quartiles of the

income distribution. Thus, we now examine how Adjusted Money Income

changed over time for the Original HRS respondents first observed at

baseline in 1992 when they were age 50-61. To this end, we classified each

respondent as before using his or her Adjusted Money Income quartile at
                                                                                            11


baseline, and then followed respondents in every wave observed thereafter.

To trace the trajectories by age, we regressed (ln) Adjusted Money Income

on a set of age controls, with age 50 as the reference category. 7 Other

controls also included are all of the socio-demographic factors in Table 1,

and controls for the year of interview. As usual, all dollar values are in $2019.

A plot of the results appears in Figure 2, which illustrates the average

percentage change in Adjusted Money Income by respondent age and initial

quartile. 8

Figure 2 here

         As is clear from the figure, Adjusted Money Incomes across the full

set of respondents (black line) remained relatively stable in real terms, from

age 52 to 82. Interestingly, people whose baseline Adjusted Money Incomes

were initially in the lowest two quartiles (Q1, red line, Q2, blue line)

experienced the largest fluctuations in their Adjusted Money Incomes with

age. The income for those in Q1 dropped twice between ages 52-62 but

thereafter, the Q1 group experienced improving Adjusted Money Incomes

up to age 72. This age pattern reflect some early retirement prior to age 62

and then the fact that many respondents begin receiving Social Security and

 pension benefits around that age. 9 Individuals in Q2 had the best experience

 during the sample period as their Adjusted Money Income remained higher

 than at baseline throughout retirement.

         Turning to the two top quartiles at baseline, Q3-4, Figure 2 indicates

 that they experienced rather different trajectories. After about age 62, the Q3

 (yellow line) faced a large and steady decline in their Adjusted Money

 Income until age 82. At that point, the Original HRS cohort in Q3 at baseline

 had 35% less Adjusted Money Income than they did at age 52 indicating that

 upper middle income households are less able to maintain their preretirement

 standard of living during their retirement years. Money incomes of the top

 quartile, Q4 (green line), actually fell from about age 53 onwards.

         Our analysis of the original HRS cohort illustrates that, over a 24 year

 period, real household income remained relatively stable; however, income

 fluctuations differed by income quartiles measured at baseline. In sum, those

 initially in the lowest Adjusted Money Incomes at baseline did relatively

 better after age 62, while those in higher baseline quartiles saw their

 Adjusted Money Incomes decline in real terms.



4.   Explaining the Stability of Real Income


 9
   An alternative explanation for the improving lot of the Q1 quartile could be that people
 reporting the lowest annual incomes at baseline (below $10,000/yr) might have experienced
 a recent income shock, and then their subsequent Adjusted Money Income rose to more
 normal levels thereafter (Hudomiet 2015).
                                                                                      13


       The age/income patterns we observe occurred as the proportion of

respondents working for pay in each quartile fell rapidly with age.

Approximately 80% of individuals in the top three quartiles were working

for pay in the early 50s while by age 65 only about 40% were working for

pay and by age 82 virtually all of the respondents have left the labor force

(see Figure 3). 10 Despite this rapid decline in the probability of working, real

income remained relatively constant between 62 and 72. The probability of

working for Q1 respondents was much lower at baseline than those in other

quartiles, and members of Q1 continue to have lower labor force

participation rates up to age 82.

Figure 3 here

       Of course, as individuals leave the labor force, money from earnings

decline. In order for real income to remain constant, other sources of income

must increase. To examine the changing contribution of various income

sources, we calculate the share of annual income for each respondent

attributable to earnings, Social Security, unemployment and worker

compensation, pensions and annuities, and capital income. Figure 4 shows

the dramatic decline in the share of income for the entire cohort due to

earnings falling from 75 to 80% in the mid-50s to essentially 0 by age 80.

Over the same ages, the share of income due to Social Security rose from

  The Congressional Budget Office (2019) provides a review of recent changes in the
employment of individuals aged 55 to 79.
                                                                            14


less than 5% to over 60% with smaller increases in income shares for

pensions and capital income.

Figure 4 here

      Even more interesting are the changes in income shares for the four

quartiles. Beginning with respondents in the lowest quartile, we observe that

earnings initially represented a smaller income share (about 50%) and

declined to less than 10% in the 60s. In contrast, the share of income due to

Social Security rose from around 20% when respondents were in their 50s to

over 80% when they reached their late 60s. The dotted line indicates that

over 60% of these low income households were receiving 90% or more of

their income from Social Security. Given that Social Security benefits are

indexed for inflation, it is easy to see how the income of those in the lowest

quartile remained relatively constant in real terms.

      Similar changes in income shares occurred for respondents in the

second and third quartiles. For respondents in the highest quartile, capital

income and pensions were more important with each representing about 20%

of total income. Interestingly, even for individuals in the highest quartiles,

benefits from Social Security represented over 40% of annual income.



5. Integrating Respondent Wealth as a Potential Financial Resource for

the Original HRS Cohort
                                                                            15


       Previous sections focused only on money income to trace peoples'

financial fortunes over time. In this section, as described above, we also

incorporate the baseline level of each household's net wealth by converting

baseline wealth into an equivalent income stream. Our goal is to establish

what each individual could have obtained, if his or her share of household

wealth been converted to an annuity at baseline. To derive this measure, we

first divide baseline household wealth for an individual living in a multi-

person household by the number of (adult) co-residents, if any. Next, we

apply an appropriate age/sex annuity factor (Academy of Actuaries 2012) to

the resulting wealth allocation, to determine what the annuitized total income

of that respondent would be. This annual annuitized wealth amount is then

added to Adjusted Money Income in all future years. In what follows, we

call this Adjusted Full Income, which is the sum of Adjusted Money Income

plus the adjusted baseline value of annuitized household wealth.

       Figure 5 reports the distribution of Adjusted Full Income at baseline.

A few people had negative wealth and no money income (most of these lived

with other persons); about 36.9% had Adjusted Full Income of under

$40,000 per year; and about 15% had measured Adjusted Full Income of

over $100,000 per year. The Figure also reports quartiles of Adjusted Full

Income for the Original HRS cohort at baseline, labeled as EWQs to

distinguish them from the Adjusted Money Income quartiles (Q1-Q4) in the
                                                                                         16


discussion above. At the bottom of Figure 3, we see that the median Adjusted

Full Income was $13,569 for the lowest quartile (EWQ1), and for EWQ2-3-

4, respectively, $36,400, $63,045, and $114,361. Average Adjusted Full

Income was 23% above average Adjusted Money Income ($68,391 versus

$55,726), and median Adjusted Full Income exceeded median Adjusted

Money Income by 18% ($53,047 versus $44,795), In other words, a

comparison of Figures 1 and 3 confirms that all Adjusted Full Income

quartiles indicate greater access to resources than the Adjusted Money

Income measure. 11

Figure 5 here

        Figure 6 tracks the percentage changes in Adjusted Full Incomes for

each baseline quartile as respondents age. Interestingly, the average across

all quartiles (black line) traces a gradual but steady upward trajectory from

age 62 onward, ending up with Adjusted Full Income about 30% higher than

at the outset. This assessment of economic conditions is more positive than

the impression gleaned from focusing only on Adjusted Money Income in

the earlier Figures. 12

Figure 6 here




11
   Nevertheless, Appendix Table 4 confirms that these two income measures are highly
correlated.

   An F test rejects the hypothesis that the quartile lines in Figure 4 are identical.
                                                                              17


       We also see from Figure 4 that the baseline lowest EWQ1 quartile

(red line) experienced important increases in its Adjusted Full Income after

age 62 up to age 75. Individuals in the highest (EWQ4) quartile had a steadily

rising Adjusted Full Income throughout the sample period. While the first

pattern replicates what was shown in Figure 2, the improvement in top

quartile Adjusted Full Income is much more strongly positive. By contrast,

those initially in the second (blue line) and third quartile (yellow line) had

relatively little upward or downward movement in Adjusted Full Incomes

with age.

       Table 3 reports marginal effects from multivariate logit models of the

probability that an Original HRS respondent was in the lowest Adjusted Full

Income quartile at baseline (EWQ1). Here there are no statistically

significant age effects, a result that differs from Table 1. As before, however,

we find that men were much less likely to be in the lowest Adjusted Full

Income quartile, while Blacks and Hispanics, the least educated, and

nonmarried persons were more likely, as were Southerners, the disabled, and

those with underage children. Also as before, people lacking health insurance

were also more likely to be in the lowest Adjusted Full Income quartile.

Those still working for pay were 8% less likely to have the lowest (EWQ1)

Adjusted Full Income when health and health insurance are controlled in

Column 2.

Table 3 here

       Table 4 extends the analysis of Table 3 using a multinomial Logit

model to evaluate the probability of appearing in each of the bottom three

quartiles, versus being in the top adjusted Full Income quartile (EWQ4) at

baseline. As in Table 3, age is not positively related to the chance of being

in a low-income quartile. Also as before, men were less likely to be in the

bottom three quartiles and were more likely to have top quartile Adjusted

Full Income. Results for Blacks and Hispanics were significant across the

board, and they confirm that these two population subgroups were always

least likely to be in the highest Adjusted Full Income group. Having more

education and being married does reduce the chances of being in the bottom

quartile, while having more underage children, being in poor health, and not

working for pay are associated with worse economic standing, as is residing

in the US South. The quantitative impact of working for pay is attenuated in

the second panel compared to the first, suggesting that the additional controls

in the second panel ­ including being in good health and having private

health insurance are stronger influences than working per se. Overall, these

results continue to tell a consistent story about the directionality of the factors

predictive of poor financial conditions at baseline, even after taking

household wealth into account.

6.    Comparing the Original HRS with Subsequent Cohorts

       With the support of the National Institutes of Health and the Social

Security Administration, the HRS has been able to include new cohorts of

older Americans every six years since 1992 when the Original baseline group

entered the study. For two of these additional cohorts, sufficient additional

waves have now been fielded to enable a comparison with the original HRS

cohort examined above. Specifically, in this section, we compare the original

HRS cohort with the War Babies (WBB), age 50-56 in 1998, and the Early

Baby Boomers (EBB) who turned age 50-56 in 2004. Both of these

additional cohorts were surveyed every two years until the year 2016 (see

Appendix Table 2 for descriptive statistics).

       Figure 7 pools these three cohorts for a sample size of 14,180 into a

single figure using the Adjusted Money Income measure (as before, in

$2019). This expanded dataset has fewer respondents with zero or negative

income, and a higher fraction with income over $150,000. Nevertheless, the

distribution is similar in the mid-range of adjusted total income. To generate

these comparisons, we utilize the same dollar amounts for the maximum

amount cap for Q1-Q4 based on Adjusted Money Income for the Original

HRS cohort at baseline.

Figure 7 here
                                                                                           20


            To track these individuals through time, Figure 8 includes all three

cohorts and traces the percentage changes in Adjusted Money Incomes by

age and baseline quartile. As we saw in Figure 2, the overall average remains

fairly constant (black line), but now the lowest Adjusted Money Income

quartile (Q1) did much better from ages 52 to 72 (red line). The Q2 group

(blue line) here is similar to that in Figure 2, rising toward older ages. The

top two quartiles' Adjusted Money Incomes eroded somewhat with age, as

in Figure 2. 13

Figure 8 here

           Tables 5 and 6, respectively, report the probability of the pooled

sample falling into the lowest Adjusted Money Income at baseline, which

may be compared with Tables 1 and 2. As in Table 1, older individuals (age

57+) in Table 5 were more likely to be found in the lowest group, but the age

effects are attenuated in Table 6 (as in Table 2). One of the most robust

findings is that men were less likely to fall into Q1 in both Tables 6 and 7,

again supportive of the earlier findings. And once again, Blacks, Hispanics,

the least educated, nonmarried, the disabled, Southern residents, and those

with underage children were more at risk for falling into the lowest income

group. As before, those in poor health and those lacking health insurance

were also at greater risk. People who were working for pay were, again, less

                                                                                          21


likely to be found in the lowest quartile. Overall, then, a consistent story

emerges from all three HRS cohorts examined. 14

Tables 5 and 6 here

         Figure 9 reports the findings using Adjusted Full Income values at

baseline for the pooled cohorts, where we see that the larger sample size

helps smooth the volatility evident in earlier figures using just one cohort.

Again, the cutoffs for each of the EWQ thresholds are the same as for the

Original HRS cohort at baseline. In the pooled sample at baseline, fewer have

zero Adjusted Full Income and more respondents have Adjusted Full

Incomes above $150,000.

Figure 9 here

         Figure 10 traces the Adjusted Full Income paths of the pooled sample

by age, and interestingly, there is again about a 20 percent upward trajectory

in the lowest quartile's Adjusted Full Income from baseline onward (red

line). The two middle quartiles (blue and yellow lines) fared less well but

ended up above where they started out, while the group that initially had the

highest Adjusted Full Income (green line) entered its 80's with 60% more

Adjusted Full Income compared to its baseline. 15

Figure 10 here



14
   Most of the cohort dummy variables are not significantly different from zero in the models
with the additional controls. In other words, our results are robust across cohorts as well.
15
   An F test rejects the hypothesis that the quartile lines in Figure 8 are identical.
                                                                            22


       In Table 7, we run a multinomial logit model of the factors associated

with the chances of someone being in the lowest Adjusted Full Income

Quartile at baseline, but now using the pooled dataset with all three cohorts;

results may be compared with Table 3. As we saw when we focused on the

Original HRS cohort alone, there appears to be no age effect associated with

the chance of being in the bottom (Q1) Adjusted Full Income quartile at

baseline. Also as before, we again see that men were least likely to be found

in Q1, while the most vulnerable groups include Blacks, Hispanics, the least

educated, nonmarried, persons with underage children, the disabled, those

without health insurance, Southern residents, and the nonemployed.

Table 7 here

       Table 8 runs the same model used in Table 4, again with the pooled

sample, but now the dependent variable is the probability of being in any of

the lowest three Adjusted Full Income quartiles, versus being in the reference

or highest Adjusted Full Income quartile (EWQ4) at baseline. Again, logit

marginal effects are reported. Our earlier results in Table 4 are confirmed

once more, in that age is not statistically significant in almost all of the

coefficients. Also as before, men were least likely to be found in the lowest

Adjusted Full Income quartile. Our earlier results are also supported in that

the chance of being in the lowest quartile was greatest for Blacks and

Hispanics, Southerners, nonmarried persons, the least educated, people with
                                                                                             23


health problems, those with underage children, the disabled, and those not

working for pay. 16

Table 8 here



7. Additional Consideration

         One question that may come to mind is whether the reported income

profiles traced of older persons over time might be influenced by differential

mortality experiences across cohorts and demographic groups. For instance,

if higher income persons have higher survival rates than do lower income

persons, survival bias could skew observed changes in financial conditions

with age. 17 Nevertheless, Hungerford (2019) has recently explored this

question in the same dataset we use, the HRS, focusing on the Original HRS

Baseline cohort examined here. Interestingly, he concluded that differential

mortality by education, sex, and race does not account for rising income

inequality as the population aged. We therefore leave to future work an

analysis of selective mortality.



8.     Conclusions



16
   Only four of 12 cohort dummy variables are significant at the 5% level, indicating that
the cohorts were actually quite similar.
17
   Appendix Table 3 reports sample sizes over time. Naturally since the Original HRS
started earlier, before the two later waves, this cohort is the only group that has been
interviewed in waves 11-13.
                                                                            24


       One primary finding of this analysis is that the real income of

individuals in the HRS remained relatively stable between 1992 and 2016,

as the cohort aged from 50-61 to 74-85. Moreover, this constant real income

is explained by the change in income sources from labor earnings to Social

Security. We also illustrate how these findings vary by income quartiles:

interestingly, individuals in the lowest quartile actually experienced rising

real income with age. Adding annuitized wealth to provide a measure of total

income strengthens these findings.

       Another contribution of our paper is to identify the key factors

associated with poor financial status in retirement by undertaking a granular

analysis of three HRS cohorts whom we follow as they age. Our results

identify a set of factors that are systematically associated with older

Americans being in the lowest quartile of what we called the Adjusted

Money Income distribution in their early 50's. This set of factors includes

age, in that people in age 50-56 typically have more income than do their

counterparts in their late 50's and early 60's, mainly because the older group

is more likely to have left paid employment. Multivariate analysis confirms

that Blacks, Hispanics, people with underage children, those in poor health,

and people lacking private/employer-provided health insurance, were also

more likely to be in the lowest Money Income quartile when observed at

baseline. Another group systematically at risk is respondents living in the
                                                                              25


South of the US. The better-educated and those who continue to work for

pay at older ages were most likely to be in higher Adjusted Money Income

quartiles.

        We also traced how peoples' financial fortunes changed with age,

and we identified the factors associated with these trajectories. Interestingly,

we found that individuals whose baseline Adjusted Money Incomes were

initially the lowest, went on to experience rising real incomes after about age

62. By contrast, persons initially found in the Q3 and Q4 groups experienced

a downward trend in money incomes as they age. Accordingly, those initially

in the lowest income group did relatively better after age 62, whereas the

others did about the same or saw their incomes fall.

        We further incorporate wealth into computations of peoples'

financial resources at older ages, by adding in an estimate of their annuitized

wealth to their incomes, which we call Adjusted Full Income. Interestingly,

this measure tracks upward from age 62, on average, providing evidence of

a more positive trajectory than one might glean from looking only at

Adjusted Money Income. Moreover, the lowest and the highest baseline

groups experience large increases in Adjusted Full Income with age, ending

up with values 30% higher than at the outset. In other words, including the

annuitized share of wealth when measuring peoples' access to resources

makes many elderly respondents' financial conditions appear better. This
                                                                             26


could imply that making it easier for older people to access their net home

equity and other assets would enhance their financial positions in old age

(Mayer and Moulton, 2021).

       Using the Adjusted Full Income measure, we again find that Blacks

and Hispanics, the least educated, disabled, and nonmarried persons, fared

relatively worse in later life, as well as those having underage children and

health problems. These findings imply that enhancing lower paid workers'

health conditions and health insurance could improve their retirement

wellbeing. Additionally, since many older persons in fragile economic

circumstances are also likely to be caring for underage children, finding

methods to ease this burden could substantially enhance wellbeing for many,

in later life. Finally, we find that residents of the US South were consistently

more likely to be in the lowest income quartile on the verge of retirement,

and they continued to be in this group throughout retirement, even after

controlling on many other socioeconomic factors. While the HRS data do

not permit a fuller examination of this result, other analysts (e.g., Henderson

2019) have pointed to substandard educational levels, a dearth of job training

and skills, and the paucity of well-paying jobs in Southern states.
