                                              ABSTRACT

We analyze the impact of population aging on Japan's household saving rate and on its public pension
system and the impact of that system on Japan's household saving rate and obtain the following results:
first, the age structure of Japan's population can explain the level of, and past and future trends in,
its household saving rate; second, the rapid aging of Japan's population is causing Japan's household
saving rate to decline and this decline can be expected to continue; third, the pay-as-you-go nature
of the public pension system, combined with rapid population aging, created considerable intergenerational
inequities and increased the saving rates of cohorts born after 1965, which in turn slowed the decline
in Japan's household saving rate; and fourth, the 2004 public pension reform alleviated the intergenerational
inequities of Japan's public pension system somewhat but will in the long run exacerbate the downward
trend in Japan's household saving rate.

1. Introduction

         Japan’s population is aging at the fastest rate in human history (as measured by the


speed with which the share of the elderly (those aged 65 or older) in the total population


has increased over time) and is now virtually the most aged in the world. In 2006, the


share of the elderly (those aged 65 or older) in the total population was 20.6%, which


implies that more than one-fifth of Japan’s population was elderly, and this ratio is


projected to increase further to 28.7% by 2025 and to 35.7% by 2050, according to official


Japanese government projections. In this paper, we discuss the impact of population aging


on Japan’s household saving rate and on its public pension system and the impact of that


system on Japan’s household saving rate.


         In section 2, we present data on trends over time in Japan’s household saving rate


and on Japan’s household saving rate in relation to the other OECD countries; in section 3,


we discuss the impact of the age structure of the population on the level and past and future


trends in Japan’s household saving rate; in section 4, we discuss the impact of population


aging on Japan’s public pension system and the impact of that system on Japan’s household


saving rate; and section 5 is a brief concluding section.

2. The Level of, and Trends over Time in, Japan’s Household Saving Rate

         In this section, we present data on trends over time in Japan’s household saving


rate and on Japan’s household saving rate in relation to the other OECD countries in order


to shed light on whether Japan’s household saving rate is high in absolute and/or relative


terms.   We present data on net saving (saving net of depreciation on fixed capital) because


it is net saving that leads to an increase in wealth or assets and that is thus the more


meaningful concept.




2.1. Trends over Time in Japan’s Household Saving Rate

         We look first at trends over the past century in Japan’s household saving rate. As


shown in Horioka (1993a), Japan’s household saving rate was volatile during the prewar,

wartime, and early postwar periods.    It was low, sometimes even negative, during about


half of the years in this period but was high and generally in the double digits during the


other years. In fact, it exceeded 30 or even 40 percent at the height of World War II


(1941-44), but during the war years, goods were scarce or rationed and the state encouraged


and often forced people to save.       If we exclude the war years (1937-45), Japan’s


household saving rate was low, on average, during both the prewar and early postwar



                                           -2-
periods, averaging only 4.3 percent during the prewar period (1906-1936) according to the


Long-Term Economic Statistics and only 5.6 percent during the early postwar period


(1945-54) according to the former System of National Accounts (hereafter SNA).1


        Turning to the post-1955 period, a continuous time series is unfortunately not


available for the entire post-1955 period.    The Japanese government switched from the


1968 United Nations SNA to the 1993 United Nations SNA in 2000, and thus data based on


the 1968 SNA are available only for the 1955-1998 period whereas data based on the 1993


SNA are available only since 1980. 2         Two further complications are that the 1995


benchmark revision was implemented at the same time as the conversion to the 1993 SNA


and that the 2000 benchmark revision was implemented in 2005.         As a result, there are


three different data series for the 1955-2004 period, with data based on the 1968 SNA

(1990 benchmark revision) being available only for the 1955-1998 period, data based on


the 1993 SNA (1995 benchmark revision) being available only for the 1980-2003 period,


and data based on the 1993 SNA (2000 benchmark revision) being available only for the


1996-2005 period.


        In the case of the 1993 SNA, we present data on the adjusted household saving rate


because it includes social transfers in kind (i.e., social benefits in kind and transfers of



                                             -3-
individual non-market goods and services from the government and from private non-profit


institutions serving households) in both the numerator and the denominator and hence is the


correct theoretical concept and because it is consistent with the household saving rate based


on the 1968 SNA.


         Figure 1 shows data on all three series for the 1955-2005 period, and as can be


seen from this figure, Japan’s household saving rate showed a steady upward trend from the


mid-1950s until the mid-1970s, increasing from 11.9 percent in 1955 to a phenomenal level


of 23.2 percent in 1974 and 1976, but has shown a downward trend since then, falling to the


2 to 3 percent level in recent years.3

         (Figure 1 about here)


         If we give precedence to data based on the 1993 SNA whenever possible, Japan’s

household saving rate exceeded 20 percent only during the six-year period from 1973 until


1978, exceeded 15 percent only during the 21-year period from 1961 until 1981, and


exceeded 10 percent only during the 41-year period from 1955 until 1995.


         To sum up, Japan’s household saving rate was not always high.          It was high


during much of the postwar period (especially during the 1960s and 1970s), but it was not


necessarily high during the prewar and early postwar periods and has by no means been



                                           -4-
high in recent years.




         2.2. An OECD Comparison of Household Saving Rates

         We turn now to an international comparison of household saving rates.      Horioka


(1989, Table 1) shows data on household saving rates for the 1975-84 period for the sixteen


Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries for


which data are available, while Horioka (2007, Table 1) shows data on household saving


rates for the 1985-2005 period for the 23 OECD member countries for which data are


available.   Data are available only on gross household saving rates for five of these


countries, but since net household saving rates are, on average, about 70 percent of gross


household saving rates, the figures on the gross household saving rate were converted to a


net basis using this conversion factor in the case of the five countries for which only gross


data are available.


         As can be seen from Horioka (1989, Table 1) and Horioka (2007, Table 1), Japan’s


household saving rate was one of the highest among the OECD member countries during


the 1975-85 period. It ranked first in 1975, was second only to Italy in 1980 and 1985,


and was 1.6 to 1.8 times the OECD average in these years. However, Japan’s rank among



                                           -5-
the OECD member countries as well as the ratio of her household saving rate to the OECD


average both fell steadily during the subsequent twenty years, falling to 17th place (43


percent of the OECD average) by 2005.


        Thus, Japan’s household saving rate was high not only in absolute terms but also


relative to the other developed countries during the 1955-95 period (especially during the


1960s and 1970s) and was at one point the highest in the developed world, but it has since


fallen not only in absolute terms but also relative to the other developed countries and is no


longer high by any standard.




3. The Impact of the Age Structure of the Population on the Household Saving Rate

        In this section, we discuss the impact of the age structure of the population on


trends over time in Japan’s household saving rate and on the level thereof.




        3.1. Theoretical Considerations

        In this subsection, we discuss the impact of the age structure of the population on


the household saving rate from a theoretical point of view.


        According to the life cycle hypothesis, the household saving rate will be higher in



                                            -6-
a country with a younger population (a country in which the elderly dependency ratio,


defined as the ratio of the elderly population to the working-age population, is low) because


the young typically work and save, whereas the elderly typically retire from work and


dissave their previously accumulated saving (see, for example, Modigliani and Brumberg,


1955).   Conversely, one would expect a country’s household saving rate to decline as the


population of that country ages and its elderly dependency ratio increases.


         However, one would also expect a country’s young dependency ratio, defined as


the ratio of children to the working-age population, to exert downward pressure on its


household saving rate because children, like the elderly, contribute to consumption without


contributing to income.    Moreover, the young dependency ratio typically declines as the


population ages, and this will at least partially offset the downward pressure on the


household saving rate caused by the increase in the elderly dependency ratio.




         3.2. The Impact of the Age Structure of the Population on the Past Level of,


and Trends over Time in, Japan’s Household Saving Rate

         In this subsection, we discuss the impact of the age structure of the population on


the past level of, and trends over time in, Japan’s household saving rate.



                                            -7-
        Japan’s population is now virtually the most aged in the world, but until recently,


Japan’s population was the youngest among the industrialized countries.        As Horioka


(2007, Table 2) shows, in 1975, the share of the elderly (those aged 65 or older) in Japan’s


total population was only 7.9 percent, which was the lowest among the OECD member


countries at the time (this ratio was 3.6 percent in South Korea in 1975, but South Korea


was not yet an OECD member country at the time).       Thus, if the life-cycle hypothesis is


applicable, the young age structure of Japan’s population can explain why Japan’s


household saving rate was so high in the past. Indeed, Horioka (1989) finds that the low


ratio of the aged population to the working-age population was by far the most important


cause of Japan’s high private saving rate during the 1975-84 period, and the same


undoubtedly holds for her household saving rate.


        Moreover, as Horioka (1991, 1997) shows, the age structure of Japan’s population


can also explain trends over time in its household saving rate.       In Japan, the young


dependency ratio has shown a downward trend over time, and the elderly dependency ratio


has shown an upward trend over time, but the relative speeds of these trends has varied


over time.   For example, until the early 1970s, the decline in the young dependency ratio


was more pronounced than the increase in the elderly dependency ratio in Japan, and this



                                           -8-
can explain the steady upward trend in Japan’s household saving rate until the early 1970s.


         By contrast, the increase in the elderly dependency ratio has been more


pronounced than the decline in the young dependency ratio in Japan since the early 1970s,


and this can explain why Japan’s household saving rate has been declining sharply since the


early 1970s.


         Thus, the age structure of Japan’s population can explain the level of its household


saving rate as well as trends over time therein, and thus it appears to be a major determinant


of the level of, and trends over time in, Japan’s household saving rate.4




         3.3. The Impact of the Age Structure of the Population on Future Trends in


Japan’s Household Saving Rate

         In this subsection, we discuss the impact of the age structure of the population on


future trends in Japan’s household saving rate.     As Horioka (2007, Table 2) shows, the


share of the population aged 65 or older to the total population in Japan is projected to


increase from 17.2 percent in 2000 to 28.7 percent in 2025, rising from third to first place


among the OECD member countries).            This will cause its household saving rate to


continue its rapid decline if the life-cycle hypothesis is valid, and Horioka (1993b, 2002,



                                            -9-
and 2006b) argues that it is.    Indeed, a number of authors have projected that the rapid


aging of Japan’s population will cause Japan’s household saving rate to decline to zero or


even negative levels by 2010-24 if all other determinants of the household saving rate


remain constant (see Horioka (1989), Horioka (1991), Farrell and Greenberg (2005), and


for a useful survey, Horioka (1992)).5




         3.4. Summary

         Our conclusion in this section is that the age structure of Japan’s population can


explain the level of its household saving rate as well as trends over time therein and that it


is a major determinant of future trends in Japan’s household saving rate as well.


         Of course, many other factors, such as (1) the growth rate of income, (2) the level

of household wealth holdings, (3) the availability of consumer credit, (4) the bonus system


of compensation, (5) tax breaks for saving, (6) the government’s saving promotion


activities, and (7) culture and tradition, may also influence the level of, and trends over time,


in Japan’s household saving rate, and one especially important factor is the public pension


system (see Hayashi (1986, 1997) and Horioka (1990, 1993b, 2006a, 2007) for useful


surveys of the literature on household saving behavior in Japan and Horioka and Okui



                                             - 10 -
(1999 and 2007) and Wakabayashi (2001) for analyses of the impact of public pensions on


household saving).   Thus, in the next section, we discuss Japan’s public pension system,


with emphasis on the impact of population aging on this system and its likely impact on


Japan’s household saving rate.




4. Japan’s Public Pension System and the Household Saving Rate


         4.1. Japan’s Public Pension System and Reforms of the System through 2004

         As discussed in section 3, from a macro perspective, Japan’s household saving rate


can be expected to decline sharply as its population ages. However, aging will also raise


the saving rate of individuals due to the existence of a pay-as-you-go public pension system.


How did population aging affect Japan’s public pension system and how was the household


saving rate affected by this system?   Furthermore, how will the 2004 reform of the public


pension system affect future trends in the household saving rate?   We examine these issues


in this section.


         Japan’s public pension system can be divided broadly into the Employees’ Pension


System to which private salaried workers and their spouses belong, the Mutual Aid


Association Pension System to which government workers and their spouses belong, and



                                           - 11 -
the National Pension System to which the self-employed and all others belong.         The first


tier pension (the “basic pension”) is common to all three systems.


         These public pension systems are essentially operated on a pay-as-you-go system.


Thus, in a society in which fertility is declining and the population is aging, it becomes


necessary to raise the contribution rate in order to maintain benefits at their original levels,


and this, in turn, requires younger cohorts, whose net transfer from the public pension


system is negative, to increase their own saving for retirement.     These effects are common


to all three public pension systems, but in what follows, we focus on the Employees’


Pension System, which is the largest system.


         Japan’s Employees’ Pension System was operated as a fully funded system when it


was first established in 1937. However, from the end of World War II until the rapid


growth period, a number of reforms were enacted that gradually raised the benefit levels of


pensioners irrespective of the amount of their contributions, and these reforms gradually


transformed the system into a pay-as-you-go system.          The 1973 reform of the public


pension system introduced wage indexation and inflation indexation, and this reform


resulted in a pure pay-as-you-go system that lasted until the 2004 reform.


         Let us now provide an overview of this system that continued until 2004.



                                            - 12 -
         First, benefits were determined through two types of indexation.


         (1) The benefits of pensioners reaching the pensionable age (at present 65) in a


given year were set so that the earnings replacement rate (the ratio of pension benefits to


the average wages of current workers) would be kept constant at roughly 60%. Such a


system, whereby the benefit amount of pensioners reaching the pensionable age each year


is adjusted so as to keep the replacement rate constant, is called “wage indexation.”


         (2) The benefits that pensioners received in their second and later years were


automatically increased each year by the rate of inflation.      This system of raising the


nominal benefit amount of pensioners in their second or later years so as to keep the real


purchasing power of benefits constant throughout the remainder of the pensioner’s life is


called “inflation indexation.”


         Note that if pensioners are compared at a given point in time in an economy in


which the average (real) wage rate is continuing to increase, the average benefit amount


will be higher the younger is the pensioner due to the wage indexation.


           Second, the future schedule of contribution rates of current workers was decided


so as to generate enough revenue to finance the level of benefits determined by the two


indexation systems.   Thus, the contribution rate was decided by conducting a projection of



                                           - 13 -
the future finances of the public pension system once every five years and making


adjustments if the finances of the public pension system had deviated from equilibrium


since the previous projection.


        After entering the 1980s, the decline in the fertility rate and the aging of the


population proceeded more rapidly than projected by the Ministry of Health and Welfare


(now called the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, hereafter MHLW).       Consequently,


during the past 25 years, the contribution rate had to be increased each time the


government’s population projections were revised, and this has led to massive


intergenerational inequities, as we will show in the next subsection.




        4.2. The Impact of the Pre-2004 Public Pension System on Saving: Simulation


Analysis

        In order to analyze the impact of Japan’s public pension system on the household


saving rate by cohort, the authors conducted a simulation analysis using the OSU II Model,


a simplified public pension finance simulation model they themselves developed


(http://www.geocities.jp/kqsmr859).6    This model accurately reflects the details of Japan’s


complex public pension system including survivors’ pensions, disability pensions, and



                                            - 14 -
transitional measures contained in past reforms.


        It should be noted, however, that the OSU II Model projects the fiscal balance and


reserves of the public pension system by treating demographic and macroeconomic


variables (e.g., the growth rate of wages, the interest rate, and the inflation rate) as


exogenous.7   Thus, it does not have a feedback mechanism whereby the fiscal projections


of the public pension system affect the macroeconomy, causing macroeconomic variables


to vary endogenously.


        The predictions of the OSU II Model are very close to those of the MLHW, which


are apparently based on the undisclosed MLHW model.8         This implies that the MLHW


model does not have a feedback mechanism, either.       Incidentally, the MLHW model is


neither published nor available on the web, while the OSU II Model is available on the web.

Thus the OSU II Model is the only publicly available pension model that reflects the details


of the post-2004 reform pension system.9


        Figure 2 shows the results of the OSU II Model concerning the intergenerational


inequity of public pension benefits and contributions.      This figure   is based on the


provisions (contribution rate, indexation scheme, and financing scheme of the basic


pension) of the pre-2004 public pension system but uses the same economic assumptions



                                           - 15 -
and demographic projections as the 2004 fiscal projections of the public pension system.10


          (Figure 2 about here)


          The horizontal axis of Figure 2 is the year of birth. The thin dotted line shows


lifetime contributions by birth year based on the pre-2004 public pension system for


married male pensioners of the Employees’ Pension System with the average contribution


period.    The lifetime contribution rate is the ratio of the present discounted value of


lifetime contributions to the present discounted value of lifetime wages (including bonus


income).     The pre-2004 lifetime contribution rate was calculated using not the


contribution rate schedule decided in 1999 but the contribution rate schedule used in the


document “On the Impact of the New Population Estimates on the Finances of the


Employees’ Pension System and the National Pension System,” released by the MHLW in


May 2002.     In this document, the MHLW itself calculates by how much the increase in the


contribution rate schedule decided in 1999 would have to be accelerated pursuant to the


2002 revision of the population projections of the National Institute of Population and


Social Security Research and expresses the view that the ultimate contribution rate of


21.6% calculated in 1999 would have to be increased to 24.8%. According to the OSU II


Model, if the ultimate contribution rate were to be raised to 24.8%, the reserves of the



                                          - 16 -
public pension system would not be exhausted until 2100.


         By contrast, the thin solid line in Figure 2 shows the lifetime benefit rate by birth


year.   The lifetime benefit rate is the ratio of the present discounted value of lifetime


benefits to the present discounted value of lifetime wages where lifetime benefits include


the wife’s basic pension, survivors’ benefits, and other supplementary benefits.


         The two lines cross in around 1965, which means that lifetime benefits and


lifetime contributions are roughly equal in that birth year.    For cohorts born before around


1965, benefits exceed contributions, whereas for cohorts born after around 1965, benefits


fall short of contributions.   In other words, massive intergenerational inequities are caused


by the public pension system.       The gap between the lifetime contributions and lifetime


benefits of cohorts born after around 1965 represents the excess payments of these cohorts,


and if they wish to spend all of their lifetime contributions to finance living expenses


during retirement, they would have to save the aforementioned gap on their own.            Thus,


for those born after around 1965, the public pension system has the effect of raising their


saving, and this effect is larger, the later the birth year of the cohort.   Since the proportion


of the population that was born after around 1965 will increase over time, the upward


pressure the pre-2004 public pension system exerted on the household saving rate has



                                              - 17 -
increased over time, thereby holding down the decline therein caused by population aging


and other factors.




          4.3. The Main Features of the 2004 Reform of the Public Pension System

          The solid line in Figure 3 shows projected public pension reserves in the case of


the pre-2004 public pension system.         The economic assumptions and demographic


projections are the same as in the case of Figure 2. Pension finances were supposed to be


in balance as a result of the 1999 reform, but this figure shows that because of changes in


economic conditions and demographic projections, public pension reserves were projected


to be exhausted by 2050 at the time of the 2004 reform.          Thus, it was necessary to


reconstruct the finances of the public pension system and to convert it into a self-sustaining


system.


          (Figure 3 about here)


          The 2004 reform reconstructed the finances of the public pension system, but at


the same time, it represented a fundamental change of course.      Until 2004, benefit levels


had been determined first, and contribution rates had then been set at levels that could


finance that level of benefits. However, in the 2004 reform, the contribution rate was



                                            - 18 -
determined first, and the level of benefits was then set in such a way that the level of


contributions could finance it. More specifically, the following system was introduced:


         (1) Lowering the contribution rate cap.      The 1999 reform specified that the


contribution rate (expressed as a percent of total compensation including bonus income)


would be raised to 21.4% by 2025, but the 2004 reform specified that the contribution rate


would be raised by 0.354 percentage points per year until it reached 18.3% in 2017 and that


it would not be raised any further thereafter.


         (2) The introduction of “macroeconomic indexation.” It was decided to lower the


earnings replacement rate in such a way that fiscal balance is maintained over the next 100


years given the contribution rate fixed as specified in (1).       Reducing the earnings


replacement rate means not indexing benefits fully for a period long enough to allow the


system to recover fiscal balance.        More specifically, it was decided to deduct an


adjustment coefficient of about 0.9 percentage points from the growth rate of wages used to


index the wages of new pensioners as well as from the inflation rate used to index the


benefits of existing pensioners.    This way of reducing the indexation rate in response to


the macroeconomic balance of the system is called “macroeconomic indexation,” and the


period during which “macroeconomic indexation” is applied is called the “macroeconomic



                                             - 19 -
indexation period.”


          (3) The finite equilibrium system.   Before 2004, the public pension system was


designed so that it would achieve fiscal balance over an infinite horizon, but beginning with


the 2004 reform, it was decided that the public pension system would be designed so as to


achieve fiscal balance over a roughly 100-year period, a system called the “finite


equilibrium system.”    Thus, the policy goal was to leave behind at least one year’s worth


of benefits as reserves as of 2100.


          (4) Establishment of a lower bound on benefit levels.   During the macroeconomic


indexation period, the earnings replacement rate will continue to decline, but when the


earnings replacement rate reaches 50%, macroeconomic indexation will be halted even if


the system is not in balance.         However, what countermeasures will be taken after


macroeconomics indexation is halted is not clear at this time.


          (5) The increase in the government subsidy for the basic pension.              The


government subsidy for the basic pension was one-third before the 2004 reform, but       the


2004 reform stipulates that it will be gradually raised until it reaches one-half by 2009 at


the latest.




                                            - 20 -
        According to the public pension system’s fiscal projections (benchmark


projection11) of the MHLW, pursuant to the 2004 reform, the system will reach fiscal


balance after a period of macroeconomic indexation at the earnings replacement rate of


50.2% and leave behind one year’s worth of reserves in 2100.      The dotted line in Figure


3 shows the projected reserves of the Employees’ Pension System after the 2004 reform


according to the OSU II Model.    As can be seen from this figure, positive reserves will be


maintained even in 2100.


        We can favorably evaluate the 2004 reform (1) because it achieved the transition


from a pure pay-as-you-go system in which the contribution rate is increased without limit


in order to maintain benefit levels to a system in which the contribution rate is capped and


benefits are reduced if necessary and (2) because it automatically stabilized pension


benefits in the face of demographic fluctuations by introducing a macroeconomic


indexation system.12   13




        4.4. The Impact of the 2004 Public Pension System: Simulation Analysis

        What impact did the post-2004 public pension system have on the household


saving rate?   If we look again at Figure 2, the bold dotted line shows the post-reform



                                           - 21 -
lifetime contribution rate while the bold solid line shows the post-reform lifetime benefit


rate.   Because the reform lowered the contribution rate cap, the lifetime contribution rate


curve shifts downward, as shown by the bold dotted line, but because a macroeconomic


indexation was introduced, the lifetime benefit rate curve shifts downward also, as shown


by the bold solid line. In order to make it easier to see the change caused by the 2004


reform, Figure 4 shows the net lifetime benefit rate, defined as the lifetime benefit rate


minus the lifetime contribution rate. As this figure shows, the reform increased the net


benefits of cohorts born in 1970 or later. Thus, if we confine ourselves to the public


pension system itself, the 2004 reform alleviated somewhat the intergenerational inequities


of the public pension system and presumably also alleviated somewhat the upward pressure


the existence of a public pension system imposed on the saving rates of cohorts born after


1970.


         However, the increase in the government subsidy to the basic pension is likely to


be financed by an increase in the consumption tax, and in order to see the total impact of


the reform on intergenerational equity, it is necessary to take account of this increase in the


tax burden.    We did so by estimating the increase in the consumption tax rate needed to


finance the future increase in the government subsidy to the basic pension14 and by



                                            - 22 -
deducting this tax increase from the net benefit ratio.   As can be seen from comparing the


bold and thin solid lines in Figure 4, the improvement in the net benefits of younger cohorts


is not as great when account is taken of the increase in the consumption tax, but even so,


the 2004 reform alleviated somewhat the intergenerational inequities of the public pension


system, with net benefits increasing for all cohorts born after 1980.


         (Figure 4 about here)


         It is probably more appropriate to examine the impact of pension reform on the


household saving rate by looking at the change in net benefits caused by the reform in


relation to expected post-reform income (wages plus net benefits to be received after the


reform) rather than to lifetime wages.    This is because, in the case of current pensioners,


wages are something they have already received and how the pension reform changes their


future consumption schedule will be determined by the expected value of their subsequent


pension benefits. Similarly, in the case of current workers as well, how the pension


reform changes their future consumption and labor supply schedules will be determined not


by how much wages they have already received but by the wages and net pension benefits


they receive after the reform.   Therefore, in order to see the impact of the reform on the


household saving rate, we use a direct measure called the “rate of change in post-reform net



                                            - 23 -
income,” which we define as follows:


                              The total present discounted value of the change in net
Rate of change in post-        benefits caused by the reform_______________________
reform net income     =     The total present discounted value of post-reform wage receipts
                              and net benefits

          Figure 5 shows the rate of change of post-reform net income for each cohort, and


 as can be seen from this figure, the impact of the reform on the household saving rate


 differs by cohort.    The bold dotted line shows the case that takes account of the increase


 in the consumption tax rate necessitated by the increase in the government subsidy to the


 basic pension whereas the bold solid line does not.    As can be seen from the bold dotted


 line, in the case of cohorts born after around 1975, for whom the rate of change of


 post-reform net income is positive, the reform causes downward pressure on their saving


 rates.   By contrast, in the case of cohorts born before around 1975, for whom the rate of


 change of post-reform net income is very minus, the reform causes upward pressure on


 their saving rates.   Since cohorts born before around 1975 are far more numerous than


 cohorts born after around 1975, the net effect of the 2004 reform is likely to be to hold up


 the aggregate household saving rate, but the proportion of the population that was born


 after around 1975 will increase over time, and thus the post-2004 public pension system




                                            - 24 -
 will eventually exert downward pressure on the household saving rate, causing it to


 decline even faster than projected earlier.


        (Figure 5 about here)


        As for the impact of the public pension reform on government saving, since a


 decumulation of the reserves of the public pension system represents negative government


 saving and causes national saving to be lower than it would be otherwise, the reduction in


 the need to decumulate the reserves of the public pension system caused by the 2004


 reform of the public pension system will prevent national saving from falling as much as it


 would have otherwise.




5. Conclusions

        In this paper, we analyzed the impact of population aging on Japan’s household


saving rate and on its public pension system and the impact of that system on Japan’s


household saving rate and obtained the following results: first, that Japan’s high household


saving rate was a temporary phenomenon and that it was high in both absolute and relative


terms during the 1955-95 period (especially during the 1960s and 1970s) but that it was not


unusually high during the prewar and early postwar periods or after 1995; second, that the



                                               - 25 -
age structure of Japan’s population can explain the level of its household saving rate as well


as trends over time therein and that it is a major determinant of future trends in Japan’s


household saving rate as well; third, that the rapid aging of Japan’s population is likely to


cause Japan’s household saving rate to continue declining and to cause it to become zero or


even negative in the near future; fourth, that existence of a pay-as-you-go public pension


system increased the savings rate of cohorts born after 1960, slowing the decline in Japan’s


household saving rate as the proportion of these cohorts in the total population increased;


and fifth, that the 2004 public pension reform alleviated the intergenerational inequities of


Japan’s public pension system somewhat but will in the long run exacerbate the downward


trend in Japan’s household saving rate.


        Looking finally at the policy implications of our findings, one might be tempted to


conclude that measures are needed to prevent Japan’s household saving rate from


continuing its sharp decline, but we do not feel that such measures are necessary for the


following reasons:    First, corporate saving has been increasing in recent years and


government saving has been increasing since 2005 as the government reconstructs its


finances after accumulating massive debts during the prolonged recession.               Thus,


increases in corporate and government saving have, and will continue to, offset declines in



                                            - 26 -
household saving to a large extent, as a result of which the national saving rate will not


decline as sharply as household saving rate declines.      Second, Japan’s population is


declining in absolute terms, which means that there will be less need to expand the


productive capacity of the economy and hence less need for investment.    Thus, even if the


national saving rate declines, it will be accompanied by declines in investment, meaning


that a saving-investment imbalance will not necessarily emerge.15   Third, even if a saving-


investment imbalance did emerge, Japan always has the option of borrowing from abroad,


and with many East Asian and Southeast Asian countries showing high saving rates, there is


no shortage of potential lenders.


        Turning to the policy implications of our findings for public pension policy, the


2004 public pension reform can be favorably evaluated because it held down future

increases in contribution rates and reduced intergenerational inequities somewhat, but


substantial intergenerational inequities remain, and moreover, this reform may have adverse


implications for household saving. Further reforms of the public pension system that


further reduce intergenerational inequities of the system and move the system toward a


funded system so that its adverse impact on household saving are offset by increases in


government saving, may be warranted.

    However, Japan’s household saving rate was high (in excess of 15 percent) during the

1935-37 period according to the former System of National Accounts.

    A detailed discussion of the conceptual differences between the 1968 SNA and the 1993

SNA is beyond the scope of this paper, but the main difference between the two lies in their

treatment of bad loans. Under the 1968 SNA, write-offs of bad loans to households and

unincorporated businesses are treated as a current transfer from financial institutions to

households.     Thus, bad loan write-offs increase the incomes of households, and because

their consumption does not change, their measured saving increases.       In contrast, the 1993

SNA treats write-offs of bad loans to households and unincorporated businesses as a

decline in the asset holdings of financial institutions, and thus they do not affect the saving

rate of households.
3
    Note, however, that Japan’s national saving rate has not declined as sharply as her

household saving rate in recent years because corporate saving has been increasing and that

it has been increasing since 2004 due in part to continued increases in corporate saving and

in part to the turnaround in government saving in 2005.
4
    Of course, there is the possibility that the sharp decline in Japan’s household rate during

the 1990s and early 2000s was due, in part, to temporary factors such as price deflation,

negative growth, and an unstable banking system.


5   Note, however, that changes in the public pension system, economic growth rates, the


labor force participation rate of the aged, etc., may affect future trends in the household

saving rate (see section 4 for a discussion of the impact of the public pension system).

    In 1999, Hatta and Professor Noriyoshi Oguchi of Senshu University released the OSU

(Osaka and Senshu Universities) Model, which uses the publicly available data and

projections of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and can roughly replicate the results of

the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s simulation analysis of pension finances (see Hatta and

Oguchi, 1999).     The OSU II Model is an updated version of the OSU Model that

incorporates the 2004 revision of the public pension system.    The OSU Model was widely

used during the policy debate concerning pension reform because it was made publicly

available, unlike the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s model, which was not publicly

available. The primary variables that are projected are the finances and reserves of the

Employees’ Pension and National Pension Systems; the Mutual Aid Association Pension

System is not included in the model because virtually no data are available on this system.

7   The OSU II Model consists of the following five blocks: (1) the insuree block, (2) the

contribution rate block, (3) the beneficiary block, (4) the benefit amount block, and (5) the

fiscal balance block. First, we derive estimates of the future enrollment probabilities of

each public pension system using the estimates of future population of the National

Institute of Population and Social Security Research.    We then estimate the population of

each age in the (1) insuree block and (3) the beneficiary block.    (2) The contribution rate

block calculates contributions by multiplying (1) the number of insurees by future expected

wages at each age and the contribution rate. In (4) the beneficiary block, we calculate

expenditures by multiplying by the number of beneficiaries in each public pension system

from block (3) by the benefits of each public pension system.      Finally, in (5) the fiscal

balance block, we calculate the fiscal balance as contributions minus expenditures and

estimate future reserves.

     The difference between the performance of the OSU II and MHLW Models, measured as

the average deviation rate through 2100, was 4.97% in the case of the Employees' Pension

System.

     Other pension simulation models of the post 2004 reform include Okamoto (2003) and

Kawase, et al. (2007). Neither of these models reflects the full complexities of the actual

pension system; for example, neither incorporates survivors’ benefits or disability benefits.

Thus, neither model is suited for conducting policy evaluations.     However, it should be

noted that Okamoto (2003) employs an overlapping generations model to endogenize some

of the variables we treat as exogenous and that the comprehensive model of Kawase, et al.

(2007) contains a macro-econometric model but that this model is not used when making

their pension projections.

     The 2004 fiscal projections assume that the growth rate of nominal wages, the nominal

long-term interest rate, and the inflation rate remain constant at 2.1%, 3.2%, and 1.0%,

respectively, in 2009 and later.
11
     In January 2002, three population projections (the low estimates, the medium estimates,

and the high estimates) were released.       The benchmark projection uses the medium

estimates of population

     This reform, heavily influenced by the 1999 reform of Sweden’s public pension system,



                                            - 38 -
largely incorporated Hatta and Oguchi’s (1999) recommendation that the system shed its

pay-as-you-go nature.

13   Kawase, et al. (2007) and Kitamura, et al. (2006), who compared the impacts of the two

 systems on intergenerational equity, are more critical of the 2004 reform.             Their

 criticism is based on the rather peculiar comparison they make.          They compare the

 pre-2004 system, whose contribution schedule was based on the 1999 demographic

 projections, to the post-2004 system, whose contribution schedule is based on the 2004

 demographic projections.     As discussed in the main text of this paper, the 1999 system

 had become fiscally unsustainable even before the 2004 reform.      The 2004 reform can be

 evaluated fairly only if the post-2004 system is compared to the pre-2004 system after

 adjusting the contribution rate schedule of the latter system in such a way that the two

 systems would attain the same degree of fiscal solvency given the same demographic

 projections. This is exactly what we do in the current paper.

14   Regarding the conversion to a consumption tax rate, we forecast future aggregate

consumption and thence the future schedule of the consumption tax rate using the future

rate of decrease of population and the future income growth rate.

15   Note, however, that to the extent that a labor shortage emerges, firms will substitute

capital for labor, which will increase the demand for investment, which in turn will partially

offset the reduction in the demand for investment causes by population declines.
