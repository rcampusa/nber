Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States,
may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22
licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics
that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in
occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to
members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams
show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations
and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence
that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the
interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational
licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in
the United States.

1. Introduction

    Occupational licensing has become one of the most significant forms of labor market

regulation in the United States. About 25 percent of the workforce requires a license to

work; in 1950, that figure was only 5 percent (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of

Labor Statistics 2016; Kleiner and Krueger 2010, 2013). Proponents of occupational

licensing contend that it protects consumers, ensuring high service quality and protecting

the public from harm by making sure that all service providers have attained a minimum

qualification level. By requiring such qualifications, however, occupational licensing

may also restrict entry and limit the mobility of individuals in these occupations. The

jurisdiction-specific nature of licensing also may limit the ability of workers to move to

take advantage of job opportunities, and may limit the wage growth and employment of

members of licensed occupations by restricting their geographic mobility. We provide

new and more comprehensive detailed evidence of the influence of occupational

licensing on reducing the interstate migration of licensed workers. These results suggest

that reducing some of these restrictions has the potential to enhance labor market fluidity,

increase the efficiency of the labor market, and raise the earnings of regulated workers.

    Economists have long recognized the ability of workers to move to different labor

markets without restriction as fundamental to the efficient functioning of those markets

(Smith 1776; Friedman 1962). Most occupational licenses are granted at the state level, 1

and often the cost of attaining licensure in another state can be significant, even for those

already licensed in another state. If the rise in occupational licensing restricts interstate

mobility, it potentially subjects a growing share of the labor force to barriers to mobility


1A White House report estimated that over 1,100 occupations are licensed in at least one state and
60 are licensed in every state (U.S. Executive Office of the President, 2015).

                                                 1
and subsequent wage growth. In this study, we show that individuals in a variety of

licensed occupations, ranging from high income and education professions to blue-collar

trades, move across states at a significantly lower rate than others, although the size of

this reduction varies substantially across occupations. Our empirical strategy exploits the

detailed migration information available in the American Community Survey (ACS) to

control for unobservable characteristics of licensed occupation members that influence

the probability of moving a long distance. We show that occupations with state-specific

licensing requirements, such as exams, experience the largest reductions in interstate

migration, whereas the interstate mobility of occupations requiring passage of a national

exam for licensure is generally no lower than that of others. We provide additional

evidence of a causal link between state licensing requirements to the interstate migration

of lawyers. We provide approximations of the earnings growth of licensed individuals

arising from their reduced incentives to move across states.

   Despite the growing importance of occupational licensing, the existing literature

investigating the link between occupational licensing and geographic mobility is sparse.

Using data from the 1950 census, Holen (1965) showed that dentists and lawyers have

limited between-state mobility relative to physicians. Pashigian (1979) considered the

interstate migration of multiple universally licensed occupations, and occupations with

little reciprocity between states had lower interstate mobility between 1965 and 1970. In

a study of 14 universally licensed occupations also using the 1970 census, Kleiner et al.

(1982) found a negative relationship between licensing “restrictiveness” (based on state

exam and experience requirements) and interstate mobility, as well as a positive

correlation between expanded reciprocity and interstate migration rates. More recent



                                              2
work includes Tenn (2001) and DePasquale and Stange (2016). Tenn’s dissertation

examines the links between the interstate migration of lawyers and their wages, finding

that wages are higher in states with lower migration rates. In contrast, DePasquale and

Stange show that the adoption of the Nurse Licensure Compact, which enables registered

nurses to practice across state lines without obtaining additional licensure, does not affect

the labor supply or the geographic mobility of nurses.

    The growth of occupational licensing from the 1950s through 2008 is shown in

Figure 1 (Kleiner and Krueger 2013). The figure also shows the decline in gross interstate

migration rates from World War II using estimates from the Current Population Survey

(CPS) for various years. The limiting effect of occupational licensing on interstate

migration can provide insights into two yet-unexplained trends: the decrease in interstate

migration and labor market churn over the last three decades. Annual interstate migration

fell from 3 to 1.5 percent between 1980 and 2010 (Molloy et al. 2011), and annual job-to-

job flows fell from 16 to 11 percent over the same time period (Molloy et al. 2016). 2 If

occupational licensing decreases interstate migration by 20 percent, as our results

suggest, the increase in licensing can account for 4 percent of the decline in interstate

migration and 1.2 percent of the decrease in job-to-job flows between 1980 and 2010.

The aging of the U.S. population, in contrast, accounts for only 10 percent of the decline

in interstate migration between 1980 and 2015 and 9 percent of the decline in job-to-job

flows between 1998 and 2010 (Molloy et al. 2016; Hyatt and Spletzer 2013).




2 Many others have also documented and investigated these trends. For more on the decline in
geographic mobility, see Molloy et al. (2013), Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017), and Johnson and
Schulhofer-Wohl (2017). Work on the decline in labor market churn includes Abowd and Vilhuber
(2011), Bjelland et al. (2011), Davis et al. (2012), Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012), and Lazear and
Spletzer (2012).

    Our study proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a simple theoretical framework

relating occupational licensing and geographic mobility. Section 3 describes our data.

Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy, and Section 5 presents our results, including

tests of the robustness of our results and the causal model for lawyers. In Section 6 we

summarize, conclude, and present directions for future research.

2. Modeling Occupational Licensing and Geographic Mobility

    The potential restrictive effect of occupational licensing on interstate migration can

be modeled using classic models of migration decision making developed by Sjaastad

(1962). In these models, an individual decides whether to migrate based on expected

utility differences (usually modeled as a function of wages or trade-offs of wages for

other nonpecuniary items) between the origin and destination. They migrate if, given

their beliefs, they have a higher expected utility from migrating than from not migrating:


                      𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑤𝑤𝐷𝐷 )] − 𝐶𝐶 ≥ 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑤𝑤𝑂𝑂 )].             (1)

While expected utility 𝑢𝑢 is a function of wages in the origin and destination (𝑤𝑤𝑂𝑂 and 𝑤𝑤𝐷𝐷 ,

respectively), migrating also incurs a cost 𝐶𝐶. Often this cost is thought of as including

onetime moving costs, such as transportation, finding a home and job and other setup

costs incurred at the destination, as well as so-called psychic costs, such as being farther

from family, finding new friends, and so on. For moves where the origin and destination

are both within a state, members of licensed occupations incur no additional cost to

migration relative to unlicensed workers. Licensed individuals considering a move to a

destination in another state face the additional cost of re-licensure, an issue that

unlicensed individuals considering the same move do not face. If re-licensure cost is




                                                 4
high enough, the interstate migration rates of licensed individuals will be lower than that

of others, but their within-state migration rates should be unaffected.

   Although the exact requirements for licensure vary by occupation, most include

training, experience, and exam obligations, as well as the payment of licensing fees and

participation in continuing professional development activities (Sass 2015). An

individual seeking re-licensure in another state may range from completing more training

and exams or merely filling out forms and paying a fee. The specific requirements vary

not only by occupation but also by destination and origin state. For particular

occupations, some states have reciprocity agreements with other states, which recognize

licenses granted in another state as valid for practice. Institutional costs are associated

with these regulations. In some cases, re-licensure costs can be high. For example, a

licensed public schoolteacher with a decade of teaching experience in New Hampshire is

not legally allowed to teach in an Illinois public school without completing significant

new coursework and apprenticeships (Sass 2015). The existence of such requirements

could constitute a significant cost to migration across state lines for those in licensed

occupations, and these costs could prevent individuals from moving if the costs of re-

licensure had been lower.

3. Data

   For our empirical analysis, we rely on the ACS as available through IPUMS-USA

(Ruggles 2017). As the largest nationally representative survey that contains detailed

migration and occupation measures, as well as other information, the ACS is the existing

dataset most suited to studying the relationship between licensing coverage and




                                              5
migration. 3 We use the ACS from 2005 to 2015 for our main analyses because these

years contain more detailed migration information than is available in earlier years.

Since we are interested in the migration of currently employed and employable

individuals, we limit our sample to those aged 18 to 65. The data available through the

ACS only have information on occupational licensing coverage, but not if the individual

attained a license (Gittleman and Kleiner 2016). 4

     The 22 licensed occupations we examine are shown in Table 1. We chose these

occupations based on the following criteria: (1) they were uniquely identifiable using

ACS occupation codes, (2) they were universally licensed in all states, and (3) entry into

the occupation requires licensure, so all members of an occupation must be licensed. All

of these occupations require passage of at least one exam to attain licensure. We use the

structure of this exam to divide the occupations into two categories: occupations for

which the content and passing standards of the licensing exam vary across states, and

those for which the main licensing exam is a national exam with a single passing

standard. We refer to the former group as “state-specific” licensed occupations and the

latter as “quasi-national” licensed occupations. 5 Some occupations with similar tasks,

such as occupational and physical therapists, were merged by combining two or more

ACS occupation categories to increase the sample size. These 22 licensed occupations

cover a wide variety of employment types, from low to high income and education, and




3 The address-based sampling design of the Current Population Survey (CPS) unfortunately limits its
usefulness in studying the relationship between migration and licensing because movers are not
followed over time.
4 The ACS has a weakness of only identifying current occupation; consequently, we only observe
occupation of migrants after their move. We discuss in detail the implications of our results in Section 4.
5 More details on the rationale for classification of occupations as quasi-national and state-specific

are shown in Appendix Table A1.

                                                     6
across a range of industries. The occupations we analyze make up 11 percent of the U.S.

labor force, with the state-specific licensed occupations accounting for 7 percent and the

quasi-national licensed occupations for 4 percent.

    We focus on occupations that are universally licensed in all states and all the

individuals in the occupation have attained a license and use it in their work to ensure that

all members of the occupation face re-licensure costs to move across states (Gittelman

and Kleiner 2016). Although many occupations, such as engineers and accountants, are

universally licensed in all states, licensure is not required to enter the occupation, and half

or less have attained a state license (Gittleman, Klee, and Kleiner, forthcoming).

Therefore, re-licensure costs do not factor in the interstate migration decision for a large

percentage of the members of these occupations. Similarly, we do not examine other

occupations such as securities brokers since they are largely licensed at the national level

and state provisions are not relevant. In addition, we do not analyze truck drivers, since a

large part of the relevance of licensing is either national or local, and state provisions are

less applicable.

4. Empirical Strategy

    We estimate the relationship between being a member of a licensed occupation and

interstate migration using the following model:

                 𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (2)

where 𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for moving between states in the last year for individual 𝑖𝑖

residing in state 𝑠𝑠 in year 𝑡𝑡, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for being a member of a licensed




                                                                 7
occupation, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of control variables, 6 and 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 are state-year fixed effects.

The comparison group in our model contains members of all other occupations regardless

of licensure status. 7 The estimate of our coefficient of interest, 𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 , likely does not identify

our parameter of interest, the effect of the cost of re-licensure on interstate migration, due

to the presence of correlations between 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and the error term 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Fortunately,

we can address this selection bias problem by using the detailed migration information

available in the ACS.

    Starting in 2005, the ACS contains detailed information for migrants on current and

previous locations at geographies below the state level, known as Public Use Microdata

Areas of migration (MIGPUMAs). These geographic units correspond to areas with

roughly 100,000 or more residents and are defined separately within each state. 8 We use

this current and former MIGPUMA of residence information to define two types of

migrants for those who move within a state: those who move within the same

MIGPUMA or between adjacent MIGPUMAs (defined as MIGPUMAs who share a

border) and those who move between non-adjacent MIGPUMAs. We refer to the former

group of within-state migrants as “close” migrants and the latter as “far” migrants.



6 These variables include measures of education (less than high school, high school graduate, some
college, bachelor’s degree, more than a bachelor’s degree), race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic white, and other race), sex, marital status (married, divorced, widowed, never
married), age (5-year categories with a separate category for ages 18 and 19), citizenship status,
employment status (employed, unemployed, not in labor force), and number of children. We also
control for income quartile (measured in 2015 dollars), with the quartiles calculated for each
occupation separately, and those with incomes greater than the maximum reported from each
occupation excluded from estimations for that occupation (or occupation type).
7 The presence of licensed occupations in our comparison group biases our estimate of 𝛿𝛿 towards
                                                                                          𝐵𝐵
zero, as some of the members of the comparison group are also licensed. These are members of
licensed occupations not identifiable in the ACS.
8 Some MIGPUMAs combine two or more Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) of residence, so the
two do not perfectly correspond. For more information, see https://usa.ipums.org/usa-
action/variables/MIGPUMA1#description_section.

                                                     8
Annual close, far, and interstate migration rates for our sample, as well as selected

descriptive statistics, are shown in Table 2. Note that the majority of moves are close,

since approximately 11.5 percent of the population moves within states in a given year,

compared to 2.5 percent moving between states and 1 percent moving a far distance

within a state.

    Far moves made within a state are likely to be more similar to interstate moves than

close moves. Individuals moving within the same MIGPUMA or between adjacent

MIGPUMAs are likely to keep the same employer and job after the move, since they are

moving within the same local area; these moves are more likely motivated by reasons

other than employment. Moving a farther distance, whether it is within the same state or

between states, is more likely to be accompanied by a change in employer. To illustrate

how the similarity between far within-state and interstate moves allows us to address the

selection problem in equation (2), consider the corresponding equation for far moves:

                    𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (3)

where 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is now an indicator for moving far within a state, and all other variables are

defined as in equation .2. Similarly, we expect 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) ≠ 0, and therefore

our estimate 𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 , to also suffer from selection bias. However, as members of licensed

occupations do not need to become re-licensed when they move within a state, 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 = 0.

Therefore, 𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 identifies the bias resulting from correlation between the probability of

making a far move and being a member of a licensed occupation. Consider the following

expression for the error term 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 :

                                     𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,         (4)




                                                                9
where 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 captures unobserved characteristics correlated with licensure status that affect

the probability of moving at all, regardless of distance. The 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 term represents

characteristics affecting the likelihood of moving a far distance, whether within or

between states, that are correlated with being in a licensed occupation. Licensed

occupations, such as lawyers, realtors, barbers and cosmetologists, and many health care

related occupations, are likely to have a “practice” or “network” component, and

consequently success in these occupations involves development of reputation capital or

clientele in one’s local area. Moving away from these customers results in loss of this

local capital and development of similar capital in the destination area, which requires a

significant investment of time and money. The additional reputation- or network-related

cost likely deters members of licensed occupations from moving far distances and is

unrelated to the cost of licensure itself. If we assume 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0, the

expectation of 𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 is

    𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � = 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ),   (5)

where 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (∙) is the bias resulting from that component. Note that both 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

are also components of the error term in the interstate migration equation,

                                             𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (6)

as they also influence the probability of moving between states. Therefore, we have this

expression for 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � if we also assume 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0:

                            𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � = 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ),          (7)

and 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � − 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � identifies 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 if 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) =

𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). Each of these bias terms contains three elements: (1) the correlation

between the component and the dependent variable, (2) the correlation between the

                                                                     10
component and 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and (3) the correlation between the component and the other

variables in the equation. As the right-hand side of each equation is specified identically,

(2) and (3) are plausibly true. Recall that we defined 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 to be unobserved characteristics

correlated with licensing status affecting the probability of moving at all, and so its

relationship with the dependent variable in both equations (moving far or moving

between states) should be similar. The other component 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents characteristics of

licensed occupations that affect the probability of moving a long distance, and so its

relationship with moving far or moving between states should be identical. Therefore, it

is plausible that the bias from each term should be approximately equal in both the far

and interstate equations.

    In addition to the assumptions discussed above, the ability of the “difference”

estimator 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � − 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � to identify 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 also relies on the additional assumptions of no

correlation between 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and the remaining parts of each error term (𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and

𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). These assumptions are likely to not hold, as there are potentially other unobserved

factors correlated with licensing status that affect the likelihood of migration, whether

between states or within a state, that are not captured by 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 . We therefore do

not claim that 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � − 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � identifies a causal effect of licensure on interstate

migration, but this difference estimator is likely “closer” to this effect than the estimate of

𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 in equation (2).

    We face an additional issue in estimating the effect of re-licensure costs on interstate

migration from the content of the ACS dataset. Our key independent variable

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is defined based on current reported occupation, and our dependent variables

are measures of migration in the past year. The ACS does not contain information on an


                                                   11
individual’s occupation last year (i.e., prior to their move). Therefore, individuals

currently in licensed occupations in the ACS consist of two groups: individuals who were

also employed in that occupation last year (“continuing” members of the occupation) and

individuals who were not (“new entrants” into the occupation). Therefore, 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 and 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 do

not solely identify the effect of re-licensure cost on migration (as they would if we could

condition on last year’s occupation), but instead are a combination of this effect (the

difference in migration rates between continuing members of licensed occupations and

other occupations) and the difference in migration rates between new entrants into

licensed occupations and new entrants into other occupations.

   We have previously described the predicted relationship between re-licensure costs

and migration rates of continuing members of occupations: continuing members only

face re-licensure costs if they move between states. We then ask, what is the relationship

between licensure costs and migration rates for new entrants into occupations? All new

entrants into licensed occupations face initial licensure costs, whether they stay where

they are currently living or move. If initial licensure costs vary across states, new

entrants into licensed occupations have an incentive to move to states with lower

licensure costs. Relative licensure costs between states are not a factor in the migration

decisions of unlicensed occupations.

   Assuming that other incentives to migrate for new entrants operate similarly across

licensed and unlicensed occupations (and/or differences in these incentives are effectively

“differenced out” using the between–far difference estimator), we expect new entrants in

licensed occupations to have higher interstate migration rates relative to new entrants in

unlicensed occupations, as they have a stronger incentive to move across states because



                                             12
of varying initial licensure costs, but this difference in incentives does not exist for

within-state moves. This means our estimate of the effect of licensure on interstate

migration is a combination of a negative effect for continuing members of licensed

occupations and a positive effect for new entrants. Therefore, our estimator 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � −

𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � is biased upward by the presence of new entrants in our sample.

     We can provide some suggestive evidence on the size and presence of this bias by

using data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population

Survey (CPS ASEC). While not a panel dataset, the ASEC records both the current

occupation of individuals as well as their occupation one year ago. As the data contains

the occupation before and after a move for those who moved in the last year, we can

identify new entrants into occupations as well as continuing members, and therefore

calculate the fraction of new entrants into occupations by their migration status. The

CPS migration question allows us to distinguish three types of migration for those who

moved: moves within a county, moves between counties within the same state, and

moves between states.

     Table 3 shows the fraction new entrants into our three main license categories: all

licensed occupations, state-specific licensed occupations, and quasi-nationally licensed

occupations, 9 by their migration status in the last year. For all three occupation

categories, individuals who moved between states have the highest fraction of new

entrants, followed by individuals who moved between counties within a state. 10 The fact



9All 22 occupations we use in the ACS are also identifiable in the CPS ASEC.
10It is not surprising that a large fraction of interstate migrants are new entrants into occupations,
given that the most commonly cited reason for far-distance moves is a job change, and migration is
highest among young people who are likely to be at the beginning of their careers (Molloy et al. 2011,
2013).

                                                 13
that interstate migrants currently employed in a licensed occupation are 3.6 percentage

points (about 25 percent) more likely to be new entrants than those who move between

counties within a state suggests that the upward bias in our estimates is potentially quite

significant. 11 However, the difference in the relative fraction of new entrants among

interstate migrants is similar between quasi-nationally and state-specific licensed

occupations, making it quite likely that results for the two categories are equally affected

by this bias. 12

5. Results

   We estimate our difference estimator E�δ�B � − E�δ�F � by simultaneously estimating

models (2) and (3), clustering our standard errors on last year’s state of residence. As we

use linear probability models, the coefficients are percentage point changes, which are

not directly comparable across the two models because of differences in the mean of the

dependent variable (only about 1 percent of the population moves far within a state,

whereas approximately 3 percent of the population moves between states within a year).

We therefore convert our estimates to percentage effects by dividing them by the

estimated value of the constant in their respective model and multiplying by 100, and we

use the simultaneous estimation to calculate standard errors. We first estimate our model

for all licensed occupations and the two licensed occupation groups (state-specific and

quasi-national) and provide evidence that our results are robust to changes in the

definition of far moves. We then explore the heterogeneity in effects across occupations


11 We performed a similar analysis using the 2001, 2004, and 2008 panels of the Survey of Income

and Program Participation, and results were consistent with our CPS findings, and are available in
Appendix Table A2.
12 The sample size in the CPS ASEC is much smaller than the ACS, which is why we do not employ

more sophisticated statistical techniques to examine this difference, or repeat our analysis by
occupation.

                                                 14
and show more direct links between licensing policies and the interstate migration of

lawyers.

5.1 Results by licensing group

    Our main results are shown in Table 4. We provide the estimate of the difference

estimator E�δ�B � − E�δ�F � as well as the estimates of its two components. Results are

shown for four different specifications. Column (1) compares the migration rates of

members of all 22 licensed occupations to that of others, finding that individuals in these

occupations have between-state migration rates that are 22.5 percent lower than their far

within-state migration rate relative to members of other occupations. This difference is

driven by their lower between-state migration rate, as their far within-state rate is similar

to that of other occupations. Columns (2) and (3) repeat the analysis for the state-specific

licensed occupations and the quasi-national licensed occupations, respectively. The

results are very different for the two different groups: the relative interstate migration rate

of state-specific licensed occupations is 36 percent lower than that of others, whereas that

of quasi-national licensed occupations is 5 percent higher. A more direct comparison of

the two groups is shown in Column (4), which compares state-licensed occupations to

quasi-national licensed occupations (i.e., the “treatment” group is state-licensed

occupations, and the comparison group is quasi-national occupations, with others

excluded from the sample). In this case, all members of the sample are subject to

occupational licensing, but individuals in licensed occupations with state-specific exam

requirements move at a 31 percent lower rate between states than those with national

exams. However, they also move far within a state at a 15 percent lower rate, which is

evidence that clientele and network-based aspects of these occupations may play a


                                              15
significant role in limiting migration of these occupations out of their local area. After

accounting for these estimates, the relative migration rates of state-specific licensed

occupations between states are still 16 percent lower than those of quasi-national licensed

occupations.

5.2 Robustness to MIGPUMA definitions

   The ability of our estimation strategy to identify the effect of licensing on interstate

migration relies on our measure of far within-state migration (moving between non-

adjacent MIGPUMAs within a state) being a good proxy for a move that corresponds

with both a job change and a move out of one’s local area. To implement a robustness

check for how sensitive our results are to the definition of a MIGPUMA, we exploit the

fact that these definitions changed as a result of the 2010 census.

   The definition of MIGPUMAs in the ACS changed in 2012. The extent of these

changes varied substantially across states: some states saw no change from the pre-2012

definition, whereas others saw the number of MIGPUMAs within their state decrease

substantially. To ensure that our results are not driven by these changes, we repeat our

analysis for the time periods with consistent MIGPUMA definitions: 2005–2011 and

2012–2015. Results are shown in Panels A and B of Table 5. Results are similar across

the two periods, although in the later period there is no significant difference in relative

between-state migration rates for quasi-national occupations. It is, therefore, unlikely

that our results are affected by the change in MIGPUMA definition, and our measure of

far migration within a state (moving between non-adjacent MIGPUMAs) performs

equally well in being a proxy for a “far” move under both definitions.




                                             16
    Another threat to our empirical strategy is if some movements between states do not

result in changing the state of licensure of an individual. For example, individuals who

are licensed and working in New York may move to Connecticut while keeping their job

and license in New York. These types of moves are most likely to occur in the Northeast

census region, where states are small and metropolitan areas often cross many state

borders. 13 We therefore repeat our analysis excluding individuals currently residing in

this region or who did a year ago. Results are shown in Panel C of Table 5 and are very

similar to our main results in Table 4. Our results appear unaffected by the unique

geography of states in the Northeast region. 14

5.3 Occupation-specific analysis

    As state requirements for licensure are unique to each occupation, we expect

substantial variation in the effects of licensure on interstate migration across occupations,

even within the state-specific and quasi-national categories, especially as these

classifications are based on only the exam requirement. We investigate the heterogeneity

across occupations in the effect of licensing on interstate migration by repeating our

analysis separately for the 22 occupations listed in Table 1. In these specifications, the

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicator is replaced by an indicator for belonging to one of the listed

occupations (i.e., 𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , etc.). In some of the specifications, we also set a

minimum education, as many occupations require a minimum education level to enter.



13 The Northeast census region contains the New England division (Connecticut, Maine,

Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and the Mid-Atlantic division (New
Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania).
14 States in the Northeast region were also the most affected by the MIGPUMA definition change in

2012. For example, Massachusetts had many small MIGPUMAs in the pre-2011 definition, and after
the change in 2012, the entire eastern half of the state was combined into one MIGPUMA. As results
excluding the Northeast are nearly identical to results using the entire country, this is further
evidence that our results are not sensitive to MIGPUMA definitions.

                                                      17
For example, we limit the sample for the physician education level to those with at least a

bachelor’s degree, since including those with lower education levels in the comparison

group for such a highly educated profession are likely errors in the data. 15 All other

control variables are the same as in our main analysis.

     Results for the state-specific licensed occupations are shown in Table 6. There are

large differences across occupations in the relative between-state migration rate.

Pharmacists and teachers have the lowest relative rates, at -47 and -39 percent,

respectively. 16 Other occupations with reduced relative interstate migration include

lawyers (-25 percent), real estate appraisers and brokers (-21 and -13 percent,

respectively), electricians (-13 percent), and barbers/cosmetologists (-7.5 percent). The

other occupations—insurance agents, EMTs/paramedics, pest control workers, and

chiropractors—display no statistically significant difference in their relative between-

state migration rates compared to members of other occupations, although their point

estimates are all less than zero. Our results also show that occupations for which network

and clientele effects are expected to be important also have lower far within-state

migration rates, such as teachers, barbers/cosmetologists, and real estate brokers and

appraisers. 17



15 Minimum education levels for each occupation’s specification, if applicable, are listed in the notes
to Tables 6 and 7.
16 In many states, only teachers employed by public schools have to be licensed. Unfortunately, the
industry and occupation codes in the ACS do not allow distinction of public school teachers from
other teachers. Our estimate of the effect of licensing on migration of teachers is therefore likely to
be upwardly biased, as the migration decisions of private school teachers should not be affected by
licensing.
17 The lower far migration rate for teachers is likely not a result of a network or clientele effect, but

instead likely a result of the loss of benefits specific to school districts, such as tenure, pensions, and
seniority within union contracts. Perhaps surprising is the fact that lawyers appear to not suffer
from this clientele effect, as they move at a higher rate and far distance within the state. However,
many lawyers work for corporations, as public defendants, or district attorneys, or they work for
large law firms, where development of a local clientele and network is less important.

                                                    18
     Table 7 shows the results for the quasi-national licensed occupations for the period

2005–2015. Here again, we see large differences across occupations. Nurses and

physicians move at a relatively higher rate between states than those in other occupations,

and there are no significant differences in migration rates for most other occupations,

consistent with state licensing requirements not affecting the migration of these

occupations with national licensing exams. However, three occupations stand out as

showing substantially limited interstate migration, at a level comparable to lawyers:

social workers, dental hygienists, and dentists. Why would their interstate migration

rates be lower if their licensing is based on a national exam? Social workers do have a

national exam but no system of reciprocity between states, and many states require

additional state-specific courses for licensure. 18 Although their main written licensing

exam is national, dentists and dental hygienists must also pass a clinical exam. Several

clinical exams are offered by regional organizations, and not all are accepted by all the

other states for licensure. A few states, such as California and Delaware, have a state-

specific clinical exam. For these three occupations, these state-specific training

requirements and differences in accepted clinical exams likely explain their reduced

interstate migration.

     Our results strongly suggest that state-specific requirements for occupational

licensing limit the ability of individuals in affected occupations to move between states,

but the interstate migration of licensed occupations with more nationally standardized

requirements is not influenced by state licensure. However, despite the use of our




18See Social Work License Map, “Frequently Asked Questions,”

                                              19
differences estimator to remove the influence of unobservable characteristics correlated

with migration and licensure, they do not prove that this relationship is causal.

Fortunately, we do have information on potential exogenous variation for one occupation

in our sample that we can use to implement a causal model.

5.4 Additional evidence from lawyers

   Ideally, we would have information on historical changes in state requirements for re-

licensure for all of our licensed occupations—information that would enable a causal

analysis. Unfortunately, this information is not available for most occupations. States

have broad discretion to set their own licensing requirements for each occupation, and

often the specifics are delegated to a licensing board.

   One exception is lawyers. Unlike many other occupations, lawyers have a large

national association, the American Bar Association (ABA), and a national organization,

the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), both of which oversee a major

component of lawyer licensure: the bar exam. The websites for these two entities provide

current information on state licensing requirements and a listing of ABA-accredited law

schools, as well as historic information for the last 5–15 years.

   One aspect of lawyer licensure for which we have information is reciprocity

agreements. Entering into reciprocity agreements, which accept individuals holding

licenses in specific other states as qualified to practice with few or no additional

requirements, is one way that states can lower the barriers to re-licensure. The licensing

guides published by the NCBE provide the year in which states entered into reciprocity

agreements for the first time for lawyers, but we only have information about the member

states of each agreement starting in 2015. We use this information, as well as information



                                             20
on the difficulty of each state’s bar exam, to draw a more concrete link between the

limited between-state migration of lawyers and licensing requirements.

5.4.1 Lawyer reciprocity and between-state migration

     Ten states adopted reciprocity agreements for lawyers between 2001 and 2015. As of

2015, 7 states had no such agreement, and the remaining 34 states already had reciprocity

agreements in place in 2001. The introduction of reciprocity potentially increases the

ability of lawyers to migrate to a state, as the barriers to re-licensure are much lower. We

test whether this is the case using the following specification:

  𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾1 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 ×
               𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                                                 (8)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for moving between states in the last year for individual 𝑖𝑖

residing in state 𝑠𝑠 in year 𝑡𝑡, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for being a lawyer, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is

an indicator for having a reciprocity agreement in place, and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 , and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are as

in equation (2). The adoption of a reciprocity agreement for lawyers should only affect

the migration of lawyers, so 𝛿𝛿 is the key coefficient of interest. We use this difference-

in-difference (DID) strategy to examine both in-migration and out-migration of lawyers

to and from states that adopt reciprocity agreements. In-migration specifications define

the reciprocity variable using the current state of residence, and out-migration uses last

year’s state of residence. We repeat the analysis for three different control samples: all

individuals with at least a bachelor’s degree (the sample used in the main analysis), as

well as all licensed individuals (defined using members of the 22 occupations in Table 1)

and state-specific licensed individuals with this minimum level of education. As these

individuals also face a potential barrier to migration from licensing, they are likely a

more appropriate comparison group for lawyers.

                                                                      21
   Results are shown in Table 8. The in-migration of lawyers increases by 0.004

percentage points after the introduction of a reciprocity agreement, approximately 15

percent relative to all licensed individuals and 20 percent relative to state-specific

licensed individuals. In the out-migration specifications, none of the coefficients are

significant, although the point estimates on the migration of lawyers after the introduction

of reciprocity are positive using the licensed and state-specific licensed samples. The

lower half of Table 8 shows the results of tests of differences in pre-trends between the

migration rates of lawyers and the comparison group in the three years prior to the

adoption of a reciprocity agreement. The p-value for the test of joint significance for

these three coefficients is not above conventional thresholds for statistical significance,

indicating no difference in pre-trends for the two groups in all three specifications.

   The in-migration of lawyers increases into states that adopt reciprocity agreements

relative to that of other licensed occupations, but there is little evidence of an effect on

out-migration of members of that occupation.

5.4.2 Difficulty of re-licensure: the bar exam

   One of the major components of lawyer licensure is the bar exam. All lawyers must

pass this state-specific exam, and the content and difficulty vary significantly across

states. To investigate whether the difficulty of a state’s bar exam is related to the

movement of lawyers, we use information from the American Bar Association on ABA-

approved law schools’ median LSAT scores (the law school entrance exam) and state bar

passage rates to form a state “bar difficulty index.” We form this index by regressing bar

passage rates on school median LSAT scores and year and state fixed effects using data

from 2011 to 2015, the only years available, weighted by the number of bar takers from



                                              22
each school. The index is expressed in standard deviation units, ranging from -3.13

(Alaska) to 2.18 (California).

     Bar exam difficulty should only affect the migration of lawyers who must take it to

become licensed in that state. As mentioned in the previous section, by 2015 all but

seven states have some form of reciprocity agreement in place for lawyers. The existence

of these agreements means that not all lawyers licensed elsewhere have to take a state’s

bar exam to become licensed. To qualify for licensure under these agreements, lawyers

have to be licensed in a particular state and have been practicing lawyers for a minimum

number of years (usually three out of the last five, five of the last seven, or similar

requirements). Using the member states of current reciprocity agreements and practice

requirements from a guide published by the ABA and NCBE, we identify individuals

who likely must take a state’s bar exam for licensure using the current and last year’s

state of residence and age. 19                 We therefore limit our sample to include only lawyers and

explore the relationship between our index and the migration of lawyers using the

following specification:

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾1 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 +
𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , (9)

where 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for likely having to take the bar for licensure in

that state, 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠 is our bar difficulty index, and other variables are the same as in

equation (2). As we have no time variation in the bar index, 20 we cannot include state


19 We use the median age of law school graduation reported by the ABA (26) and make the

assumption that a law school graduate has practiced every year since graduation. So to satisfy a
three of the last five years requirement, we assume an individual must be at least 29 years old. We
also use information on the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE), which has been adopted by 18 states since its
introduction in 2011.
20 Indices computed using individual years of data varied greatly from year to year (while relative bar

difficulty likely does not) because of the small number of observations for many states—hence our
creation of only one index from five years of data.

                                                                    23
fixed effects in our specification. Our coefficient of interest is 𝛿𝛿, which measures the

effect of bar exam difficulty on the migration of lawyers who likely have to take the bar

exam for licensure relative to lawyers who likely do not.

     Results are shown in Table 9. Using all states, we see that increasing bar exam

difficulty by one standard deviation is associated with 1.2 percentage point lower in-

migration and 2.5 percentage points lower out-migration rates of lawyers who likely must

take the bar relative to lawyers who likely do not. This is a very large relative effect:

approximately a 40 percent reduction in in-migration rates and 90 percent in out-

migration rates. However, it is common knowledge among lawyers that the California

bar exam is notoriously difficult, with about a 50 percent pass rate over time. To see

whether our results are driven by California’s statistics, we exclude the state from the

sample and re-estimate our model. Indeed, the coefficient on the interaction between the

bar index and likely having to take the bar is no longer significant once we exclude

California, although the point estimate remains negative. This pattern remains the same

when we change our measure of bar exam difficulty to an indicator for having a bar exam

in the top five most difficult according to our index.21 California’s difficult bar exam

appears to deter both migration into and out of the state, but we cannot conclude that bar

exam difficulty is related to interstate migration in other states (Tenn 2001).

     Results using reciprocity and bar exam measures show that adopting reciprocity

increases the migration of lawyers into a state, and state bar exam difficulty negatively

predicts in- and out-migration of lawyers relative to those in other occupations, at least in

California. However, these results are not conclusive. The reciprocity results have


21These states are, in decreasing order of bar difficulty, California, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, and
Hawaii.

                                                  24
modest statistical significance, and the lack of a time dimension in our bar exam index

limits its causal interpretation. In any case, the results only provide evidence linking state

licensure and migration for a single occupation. Despite these limitations, they do

provide evidence that the reduced interstate migration rates experienced by state-specific

licensed occupations are likely tied to the high cost of re-licensure.

5.5 Potential Economic Consequences

      Occupational licensing’s limiting effect on interstate migration has potential

implications for the earnings growth of individuals in licensed occupations, and the rise

of this form of labor market regulation may explain part of the decrease in interstate

migration and job transitions since 1980. To gauge the size of these effects, we perform

some simulations using our estimates, and the results are shown in Tables 10 and 11.

Table 10 shows that if licensing reduces the interstate migration of licensed relative to

unlicensed individuals by 20 percent (approximately the median reduction for the state-

specific licensed occupations we study), the number of annual interstate migrants is

reduced by 93,600. Moreover, as these individuals do not experience the additional 10

percent earnings growth from changing jobs (Topel and Ward 1992), 22 their total annual

earnings is reduced by $356 million. Table 10 also shows this value for 10 percent and

40 percent reductions in migration for licensed individuals, which lead to annual earnings

losses of $178 million and $711 million, respectively.

      Table 11 reports simulations of the fraction of the decline in interstate migration and

job-to-job flows arising from the increase in occupational licensing using our estimates.

Panel A shows the annual interstate migration rate and rate of job-to-job transitions in



22   We assume all interstate migrants experience a job-to-job transition.

                                                   25
1980 and 2015, as well as the fraction of the workforce licensed in each year. We make

two simplifying assumptions in our calculations. First, we assume there was no change

in the relative interstate migration rate between licensed and unlicensed individuals over

this time period. Second, we assume every interstate move results in a change of job. As

shown in Panel B of Table 11, if licensing reduces the interstate migration of licensed

relative to unlicensed individuals by 20 percent, the increase in occupational licensing

from 15 percent of the labor force in 1980 to 30 percent in 2015 explains 6 percent of the

decline in interstate migration and 2 percent of the decline in job-to-job flows over this

time period. These numbers are 3 and 1 percent and 13 and 4 percent if we assume

migration rates of licensed workers are 10 and 40 percent lower than those of unlicensed

workers, respectively. To put these values in context, others have shown that the aging of

the U.S. population over the same time period explains only 10 percent of the decline in

interstate migration over the same time period and 9 percent of the decline in job-to-job

flows between 1998 and 2010 (Molloy et al. 2016; Hyatt and Spletzer 2013).

6. Conclusion

   We examined to what extent occupational licensing may be a contributing factor to

the general decline in interstate migration. We compared the relative within- and

between-state migration rates of members of 22 licensed occupations to those of others

using data from the American Community Survey. Our empirical strategy compared the

relationship between licensure and migration between states and a far distance within

state, which controls for unobservable characteristics that influence the propensity of

licensed occupations to move out of their local area. First, we found that migration across

states for licensed individuals is reduced, but the size of the reduction varies across



                                             26
occupations. Quasi-nationally licensed occupations do not show any limitations on their

interstate geographic mobility. Second, using a causal model with reciprocity agreements

for lawyers, we find evidence that the adoption of these agreements increases the

migration of lawyers into a state.

       Economists have long held that restrictions on geographic mobility limit the ability of

the labor market to operate efficiently. Within this context, occupational licensing

provisions that restrict job entry through interstate migration could also be a barrier to

economic opportunity and labor market efficiency. Specifically, the paper has

empirically examined whether occupational licensing statutes limiting occupational entry

from other states influence interstate migration.

       The results of our estimates have implications for public policy and law. For example,

in 1941, the U.S. Supreme Court held against a California statute, making it illegal to

restrict indigent individuals from migrating to the state during the Great Depression. 23

The Court ruled that the California statute “prevent[ed] a citizen because he was poor

from seeking new horizons in other States (Roback 1943). In this way, limits on

occupational entry might essentially withhold the ability to migrate from large segments

of the population.

       Our analysis examines the migration of individuals. For many, migration is not an

individual decision; instead, it is a choice made on the basis of overall household or

family well-being. As our analysis is limited to the individuals we observe in an

occupation after their move, we miss a potentially important effect of licensure on those

making interstate moves: individuals who are forced out of an occupation or out of the

labor force entirely as a result of moving between states. An example is so-called trailing

spouses—those who move because their partner obtains a better job in another state. And

if these spouses were in a licensed occupation prior to the move, they may have to switch

careers as a result. The effect of licensure on career changes or labor force exits made as

a result of household migration is potentially important, and because we cannot identify

individuals affected by these phenomena in the ACS, we leave their analysis for future

research.

   While our main empirical strategy helps control for unobservable differences driving

migration patterns, we can only provide causal evidence using differences in state

licensing policy for one occupation. As additional statutory data on licensing become

available, researchers should develop additional causal models between the changes in

occupational licensing statutes and its influence on interstate migration for additional

occupations.

         workforce size of 104 million (calculated using 2015 ACS data), median
         individual annual earnings of $38,000 (also from the ACS), occupational
         licensing rate of 30% (Kleiner and Krueger 2010), annual interstate
         migration rate of 1.5% (Molloy et al. 2016), and an additional earnings gain

results in a job-to-job transition. Calculations as follows: Column (2) is 0.03/(0.85+0.15(1-column (1)/100), as population total migration
rate must be (weighted) average of licensed and unlicensed migration rates. Column (3) is 0.7*column 2 + 0.3*((1-column
1/100)*column 2), assuming no other change in migration rates between 1980 and 2015. Column 4 is (0.03-column 3)/0.015, as actual
decline in interstate migraiton was 0.015 between 1980 and 2015. Column 5 is (0.03-column 3)/0.05, as actual decline in job to job
flows was 0.05 between 1980 and 2015.
