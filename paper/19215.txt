This paper examines the impact of youth friendship links on student’s own academic performance
(grade point average) using the Add Health. We estimate a reduced form, high dimensional fixed
effects model of within cohort or grade friendship links, and use this model to predict each
student’s number of friends whose mothers have a four year college degree. The effects of
friendship links are identified using across-cohort, within school variation in demographic
composition of the student’s cohort or grade. We find that increases in number of friendship links
with students whose mothers are college educated raises grade point average among girls, but not
among boys. Additional analyses suggest a positive view of the school environment and a
perception of one’s self as functioning well in that environment as possible mechanisms. The
effects are relatively broad based across students over maternal education, racial and ethnic
composition and across schools that vary in demographic composition over the same variables.

The Consequences of Friendships: Evidence on the Effect of Social Relationships in School
                             on Academic Achievement

1. Introduction

           Economists have long been interested in whether the outcomes of individuals are shaped

by their interactions with those around them. A special focus has often been placed on the effect

of environment on children since the have less control over their environment and because these

environmental effects may have impacts on intergenerational mobility. A large literature

documents the effect of school peers on student outcomes using quasi-experimental variation

across cohorts of students (Lavy, Paserman and Schlosser 2012; Bifulco, Fletcher and Ross 2011;

Lavy and Schlosser 2011; Friesen and Krauth 2011; Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin 2009; Hoxby

2000). The evidence on exposure to neighborhoods is more mixed. Oreopoulos (2003), Jacob

(2004), Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and Ludwig et al. (2013) find minimal effects of

neighborhood using experimental and quasi-experimental evidence on the mobility of public

housing residents. More recently, Chetty, Hendren and Katz (2015) find long-run effects for the

youngest children of movers out of public housing, and Chetty and Hendren (2015) find evidence

of neighborhood effects comparing children within the same families who were different ages

when they moved. 2

           Many studies suggest that social interactions are an important mechanism behind peer and

neighborhood effects at least in part by showing that peer and neighborhood spillovers are larger

when individuals are more similar on economic and demographic attributes. Bertrand, Luttmer

and Mullainathan (2000) find evidence that residing near individuals who speak the same language

as oneself raises welfare usage for members of language groups that have a high rate of welfare

participation. Bayer, Ross and Topa (2008) find that individuals have better labor market outcomes

when their immediate neighbors are similar in education, age, gender, marital status and age of

children. Bayer, Hjalmarsson and Pozen (2009) show that criminal peer effects are stronger when

juveniles who have similar criminal expertise are grouped together in correctional facilities.

Hellerstein, McInerney and Neumark (2011) find that same race and ethnicity employees at the

same firm are more likely to come from the same neighborhood relative to employees who just

work in the same location. Haskell (2015) finds that students’ who are more demographically

distance from their cohort peers engage in riskier behavior and have worse social and emotional

outcomes. Billings, Deming and Ross (2016) show that residential exposure to nearby peers who

are of the same age, race and gender increases the likelihood of committing a crime when the

individuals attend the same school.

         However, these quasi-experimental, reduced form studies typically do not have any direct

information on whether the individuals in the school or neighborhood interact socially, share

information or have other contacts. 3 In one clear exception, Air Force Academy students were

assigned to groups intended to maximize the performance of the lowest ability students based on

previous evidence of peer effects in this population (Carrell et al. 2009). However, Carrell,

Sacerdote and West (2013) find an unexpected negative effect on the treatment group, apparently

because after the experiment students in treated squadrons tended to self-segregate into subgroups




  3
    Billings, Deming and Ross (2016) represent an exception because they observe whether individual students were
arrested for committing crimes together. Also see Fisman et al. (2008) on speed dating. A large structural literature
also exists empirically examining the effects of networks on economic outcomes. See for example Calvó-Armengol,
Patacchini, and Zenou (2009), Patachini and Zenou (2012), and Bramoulle, Djebbari and Fortin (2009). These models
have in some cases been identified by assuming social network structure is exogeneous or assuming that the
unobservables of the friend’s of a student’s friends are uncorrelated with the students unobservables, after conditioning
on the friend’s observables.
                                                                                                                    4


based on ability.       This study documents that social interactions and relationships between

individuals can be a critical component in generating positive or negative peer effects. 4

         In this study, we estimate whether having friends whose mothers have a four-year college

degree affects a student’s Grade Point Average (GPA) using one of the only data sets that both

contains information on social relationships and supports quasi-experimental analyses of peer

effects, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). 5 Specifically, we

estimate a non-parametric, reduced form model of within grade and school friendship links using

high dimensional fixed effects across schools and exploiting the demographic match between

students of different types based on race and maternal education. Using the friendship link model

estimates and the set of same gender-same grade potential friends, we predict the maternal

education composition of each students’ friends so that, for a given student type, predicted

friendship composition only varies across cohorts/grades based on across cohort variation in

demographic composition. Critically, the fixed effect estimates used for one cohort of students

omits that cohort from the estimation so that the predicted friendship patterns of the students in a

specific grade and school is not influenced by the within grade friendship choices of those students.

The across cohort variation in predicted friendships with students of high maternal education is

strongly predictive of actual friendships, and the prediction appears orthogonal to a relatively

broad set of student demographics.

         We then regress grade point average on predicted friendship composition conditional on

fixed effects for school-by-student-type and school-by-cohort. This model follows a difference-




  4
    Similarly, Weinberg (2007) develops a model in which peer effects are non-linear and vary across individuals
because students can sort within peer groups. Weinberg (2013) exploits a similar model to examine the optimal
composition of broad peer groups in order to facilitate integration in social relationships within those groups.
  5
    Maternal education was identified as an important peer attribute for explaining student outcomes in the Add Health
sample by Bifulco, Fletcher and Ross (2011).
                                                                                                                   5


in-differences structure because predicted friendship composition is based on combining

information on friendship patterns that are estimated at the school by student type level and

friendship opportunities that are measured at the school by cohort level. We find that having more

friends whose mothers have a four year college degree is associated with better academic grades

for female students. 6 One additional friend whose mother has a college degree implies a 0.204

grade point increase in GPA, which is about an 8 percent increase at the mean GPA of 2.71 for all

female students and represents a 0.25 standard deviation increase. A one standard deviation

increase in the number of friends of this type is associated with a 0.17 standard deviation increase

in GPA. We do not find statistically significant effects for male students, but the estimates are

noisier and we cannot rule out friendship effects for males.

         As with Carrell, Sacerdote and West (2013), we cannot prove that friendship patterns are

responsible for the differences in grades because the demographic environment of a cohort of

students that facilitates such friendships potentially could cause the effects on GPA. However, our

model specification and other tests rule out traditional cohort level peer effects even if those effects

are heterogenous across students. Further, our results complement those of Carrell, Sacerdote and

West (2013) providing a second strong piece of evidence that the effect of exposure to the peer

environment is highly correlated with the types or extent of social relationships facilitated by that

peer environment.

         Further, our paper contributes additional quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of

friendships on academic outcomes. There exists very limited quasi-experimental evidence on



   6
     Several peer effect studies have found that effects differ by gender including Argys and Rees (2008), Bifulco,
Fletcher, Oh and Ross (2013), Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2010) and Hseih and Lin (2017). Our specific results
are in line with several papers that have produced evidence of gender-based peer effects on labor market outcomes.
For example Olivetti et al. (2013) find associations between adolescent peers mother’s labor supply decisions and own
outcomes for women; Mota et al. (2016) show evidence of similarity in women’s labor force decisions between
neighbors with similarly aged children. In each case, there was no similar effect for men.

effects of friendships on youth outcomes. 7 Fletcher and Ross (2018) examine the spillover effects

of friends’ smoking and drinking finding large increases in these behaviors in response to the

behavior of friends. Lavy and Sand (2013, 2018) examine the effects of being separated from

friends during a transition between schools, and find negative effects on test scores and other

measures of student well-being. Billings, Deming and Ross (2016) show that student residing very

near other are more likely to be arrested together for a crime if they are assigned to the same school

attendance zone. 8 To our knowledge, these are the only three studies that provide evidence of

spillovers across friendships or social relationships based on exploiting quasi-randomness in

student or youth assignments to grades or schools. 9

2. Empirical Model

         Friendships patterns are characterized by homophily (Weinberg, 2007, Moody 2001), and

the demand for homophily might vary based on a school or school’s demographic composition. In

a school with more minority students, the value of friendships with minority students might be

higher because the tendency towards homophily implies greater popularity among minority

students as their representation increases. 10 Alternatively, increases in minority share may lead to




  7
      Weinberg (2007) and Mayer and Puller (2008) show that students tend to associate with individuals like
themselves, which may mitigate the impact of peer composition. Marmaros and Sacerdote (2006) examine the
predictors of email contact among Dartmouth students. Neither paper exploits quasi-experimental variation. Also see
Lichter (2013).
   8
     See Conti, Galeotti, Muller, and Pudney (2013) for a recent study that provides more traditional evidence on the
impact of friendship nominations using individual level exclusion restrictions.
   9
     A small, but growing, number of studies develop structural models of productive social networks with endogenous
network formation including Currarini, Jackson, and Pin (2009), Badey (2013), Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens
(2013), Graham (In Press), Lui, Patachinni, Zenou and Lee (2014) and Hseih and Lin (2017); however, parameters
are usually not identified from quasi-experimental variation. Some of these studies exploit the strategy of using the
behaviors or attributes of friend’s friends as instruments for friend’s behaviors or attributes, as in Bramoullé, Djebbari
and Fortin (2009).
   10
      Ballester, Calvó‐Armengol, and Zenou (2006) and Calvó-Armengol, Patacchini, and Zenou (2009) consider
models where the gains from friendship depends upon network centrality.
                                                                                                                             7


increased polarization between groups or simply increase the number of same-race friendship

candidates and crowd out across-race friendships.

         We develop an empirical model of within-grade friendship links based on the race,

ethnicity and the education of the student’s mother. Race and ethnicity are included in the model

due to the strong patterns of friendship homophile documented in the existing literature. 11 As a

second variable, we also include maternal educational attainment because we are explicitly

interested in the effects of having friend’s with different levels of maternal education on student

academic outcomes and in part because maternal education is our best measure of “social class”

in our data. We divide students into cells based on students having the same race, ethnicity and

maternal educational attainment. We model the observed patterns of friendship links using a non-

parametric specification within each school based on high dimensional fixed effects associated

with each possible combination of same grade, same gender students based on the cells above. We

focus on within grade friendships, which represent 83% of same-sex nominations in our sample.

Students of a given race, ethnicity or maternal education may sort into schools through parents’

choices, but are assumed to be distributed quasi-randomly across the cohorts/grades within any

school. 12

         In modeling within grade, within gender friendships, every student may form a friendship

with any same gender student in his/her grade or cohort c within school s, and our student level

data is arranged as a sample of pairs of same-grade, same-gender students i and j. 13 Students are

categorized into one of x nominal “types”, where a type is defined as an observationally equivalent

cell based on the race/ethnicity and the family background (maternal educational attainment) of


  11
      See Weinberg (2007) and Moody (2001) for example.
  12
      This assumption is supported by balancing tests conducted here and in Bifulco, Fletcher and Ross (2011).
   13
      If a cohort has 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 students of a given gender, then that population of students will contribute 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 (𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 − 1)/2
total observations to our sample where pairs are non-directional.
                                                                                                                     8


each student. The pair of students of type x and type y is defined as {x,y}. A self-reported link

between students i and j (𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is a binary outcome that depends upon the quality of the match

between students.

(1)              Pijxycs = δxys + 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐 + μijxycs

where 𝛿𝛿𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 is a pair-type-by-school fixed effect that allows for non-parametric patterns of

friendship formation because pair type enumerates all observationally equivalent pairs of students

based on race, ethnicity and maternal education, and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐 is a cohort/grade fixed effect. Finally,

𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a stochastic return to the match between students, which might include each student’s

unique propensity to form friendships.

         Using our friendship formation model, we develop predictions of friendship composition

for each individual type (observationally equivalent students over maternal education and

race/ethnicity) in each cohort and school. For individual i of type x, the expected number of friends

of type y is based on summing equation (1) over all individuals of type y in the cohort and dropping

the unobservable.

These predictions vary across demographic groups within cohorts because the likelihood of

friendship formation differs based on 𝛿𝛿xys and vary across cohorts for the same student type

because cohort differences in composition change the opportunity set of potential within cohort

friends. 14

         In practice, we must use an estimate of 𝛿𝛿xys , and given potentially small demographic cells

within schools an individual’s own friendship decisions or the decisions of others who interact



  14
    We omit the estimates of the cohort fixed effects in equation (1) from our prediction for parsimony of presentation
because those estimates have no effect given the fixed effect structures used in the models to follow.

This strategy is similar to “leave-one-out” instrumental variable approaches used in Angrist,

Imbens and Krueger (1999) and Blomquist and Dahlberg (1999). 15

         Unlike Bifulco, Fletcher and Ross (2011) who simply included school fixed effects, our

model includes school by student type fixed effects. These fixed effects absorb any effects or

correlates of schools that vary across the type of student including heterogenous effects of peers

at the school level and variation that arises because selection into the school might vary based on

student race, family background or past behavior. Therefore, equation (6) is only identified using

across cohort comparisons of demographically identical students over type x. Further, our model

includes school by cohort fixed effects that capture any homogenous peer or environmental effects

at the grade or cohort level. As noted above, the resulting model is basically a difference-in-

      Appendix A is presented at the end of the paper. Note that while Guryan, Kroft and Notowidigdo (2009) consider
bias associated with peer group means in balancing tests, their arguments apply to conditional means, such as predicted
values from regressions, and any regressions using such means, not just balancing tests.
   17
      This model is quite different from models discussed in Angrist (2014). Angrist considers a model where an
individual attribute like SAT score is replaced in a regression by the average attribute of a group, and the test for peer
effects is whether the average attribute has some explanatory power over and above the individual attribute. Angrist
makes two important points: 1. the group average can be viewed as an instrument for the attribute and so the test for
peer effects is whether the IV estimate exceeds the OLS estimate, and 2. with random group assignment the instrument
is likely weak so this test requires the assumption that the IV and OLS estimates be the same under the null hypothesis
of no peer effects. In our case, the individual attribute is number of friends of a certain type, and we measure the
conditional mean of that attribute for a group of same type, school and cohort students. However, we are not testing
for the excess effect of the group mean over the actual attribute, but rather instrumenting for an endogenous individual
attribute. Further, based on the F-statistics below our instruments are not weak.
                                                                                                                11


differences analysis where the first difference arises by comparing observationally equivalent

individuals in different cohorts of the same school, and then the second difference is between

cohorts for different types of students where the differences in outcomes between cohorts should

be larger for the types of students where the difference in the predicted number of friends is largest.

        Given that predicted numbers of friends only vary by student type-cohort-school, we can

convert this model to a triple difference model simply by adding fixed effects for student type by

cohort or

(7)                   Yics = θp� ixcs + πq� xcs + 𝛾𝛾xs + υcs + 𝜔𝜔𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝜏𝜏ics

The triple difference estimates basically compare the difference-in-differences estimates across

schools testing for larger difference-in-differences estimates in schools where the differences

between student types in across cohort differences in predicted number of friends are largest. We

focus on the difference-in-differences estimates because they are more intuitive, and present the

triple difference estimates for the baseline model as a robustness test. However, all results

presented in the paper and appendix have been replicated using the triple difference estimator.

3. Data

        The Add Health surveyed schools with school sizes between 44 and 2,418 students

containing students between grades 7 through 12. For each high school in the survey, 18 a middle

school whose students tended to feed into this high school was identified and also surveyed. For

this analysis, we create pseudo schools by combining each high school with the middle school

feeder that was surveyed so that friendship patterns can be documented for six grades/cohorts of

students in each pseudo school. This reorganization leads to a sample of 87 pseudo schools that




  18
      With the exception of a few smaller combined middle-high schools. Note that even if a middle school contained
a 6th grade those students were not surveyed.
                                                                                                                     12


we label as “schools” for brevity. 19 We focus on the “In-School” sample of over 90,000 students

(virtually all students) at sample schools in the 1994-95 academic year. The survey collected data

on socio-demographic characteristics, health status, risk behaviors, academic achievement, and

friendship nominations. After several sample restrictions for technical reasons, we have a final

sample of 87,006. 20

         Each student was asked to identify up to five male and five female friends that attended the

same school, and these “friends” are linked by name to the other surveyed students. Like much

previous work, we focus on same-gender friendships in this sample to separate “friends” from

“romantic relationships”. We also focus on within grade friendship (83% of same-sex friendships)

in order to identify the effect of peer composition using across cohort variation. 21 We analyze

mutual friendship or reciprocal links, meaning two students are friends if they both nominated

each other, since presumably relationships in which both parties agree on the friendship are

stronger (Goodreau, Kitts and Morris 2009). 22 In addition, mutual acknowledgement of friendship

rules out nominations that reflect aspirational preferences. 23 Another interpretation of using mutual




  19
      When middle and high schools could not be matched, the individual schools were treated as their own school or
cluster for the purpose of the analysis, rather than dropping observations.
   20
      178 individuals were dropped from the sample due to missing identification numbers, who were likely new
students and not yet on the school roster; another 2,637 are dropped because of missing grade, race, sex, or missing
the majority of their friendship information; we exclude the twin sample, which contains 2,492 students; 400
observations are dropped because they have assigned grades that do not match the grades associated with that school
(e.g. a 7th grader in a high school that primarily contains 9th-12th graders); and we exclude 49 observations from small
schools (less than 10 students per grade/cohort on average).
   21
      We regressed our cohort variables on whether individuals nominate friends outside of their grade with school-
gender fixed effect, and found no correlation
   22
      Goodreau, Kitts and Morris (2009) explain the focus on mutual friendship as follows: “mutual friendships are
cross-validated and are likely to be stronger than one-way friendship nominations. Focusing on mutual ties may thus
reduce the truncation induced by the cap on five nominations…”.
   23
      The average numbers of identifiable same-gender friends nominated are 2.65 for male students and 3.10 for
female students, and very few students reach the survey cap of 5 friends. However, most nominations are one-
direction. On average, a male has 0.69 and a female has 1.10 mutual friends.
                                                                                                                   13


friendship nominations is a focus on “best friends” rather than acquaintances. 24 Both bidirectional

and single direction friendship links capture actual friendship patterns with error, but measurement

error in the left-hand side variable is not a source of bias in the friendship match model. Further,

in the second stage analysis on the effect of friendships, our instrumental variables strategy

insulates us against bias from measurement error in actual friendships.

         Table 1 shows basic friendship patterns over maternal education and race/ethnicity, i.e. the

fraction of same-gender/same-grade friendships in each maternal education or race/ethnicity

category by the students’ own category. Maternal education levels are divided into four categories:

no high school degree, high school graduate, graduate with a four year college degree, and maternal

education missing. 25 Race/ethnicity is captured by non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,

Hispanic and other race, where the other category is primarily Asian or Pacific Islander. Columns

(1) and (4) indicate the average number of friends that a student of a certain category has; columns

(2) and (5) show the share of friends coming from the students’ own category; columns (3) and (6)

provide the sample shares of each group. The table shows substantial homophily in friendship

patterns. The percent of friends with the same maternal education as the student always exceeds

the fraction of students in the population with the largest differences arising for students whose

mothers either did not graduate from high school or are college educated where the fraction of

same group friends is nearly double the share in the population. Homophile is even more

pronounced over race and ethnicity with share of own race friends typically 3 to 4 times the

representation in the population for blacks, Hispanics and other race students. In terms of gender,




  24
     We also examine link models based on one-way friendship links, and the resulting estimates are qualitatively
similar, but smaller in magnitude consistent with one way links being less important than friendships identified where
both individuals claim each other as friends.
  25
     Appendix Table 1 presents the same means by gender.
                                                                                                                    14


black and Hispanic female students and female students whose mothers are not college educated

exhibit higher levels of homophily than comparable males.

         Maternal education is not reported for approximately 20 percent of the sample, and we

create a separate “missing” category for those students. While students may not randomly select

into this category, it is notable that the likelihood of a maternal education missing student having

a maternal missing friend is very close to the population average so we do observe assortative

matching on student’s own missingness in maternal education. Further, we rely on our non-

parametric controls to capture students sorting into schools by type, including maternal education

missing. 26

         In order to create the student friendship link sample, we form a sample of all possible, non-

directional pairs between students from the same grade and of the same gender for every school.

The resulting matched sample contains about 6 million potential links. The outcome is a binary

variable indicating whether the two parties in a pair nominated each other as a friend. As discussed

above, we defined four racial and ethnic categories (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,

Hispanic, and Asians/Other race) 27 and four maternal education categories (four-year college

degree, high school graduate, no high school degree, and maternal education not reported). This

implies 10 racial/ethnic combinations for a pair of students (N(N+1)/2=4(4+1)/2=10) and 10 maternal

education combinations. Further, race/ethnicity and maternal education together define 16 student

types. This results in 136 potential student-pair combinations (fixed effects) for each gender and




   26
      Our analyses are reduced form, and we obtain the causal effects of exposure to students of each type including
education missing. Both our balancing tests and our estimates of friendship effects are robust to how we treat students
for which maternal education is missing. Later in the paper, we also present robustness tests that modify how we
handle students where maternal education is missing.
   27
      56% in this group self-identify as Asian, and results are robust to omitting non-Asians.
                                                                                                                      15


school. 28 The fixed effects are estimated using linear probability models. The resulting predicted

friendship composition variables are merged back into the student level data by school,

grade/cohort, gender and student race, ethnicity and maternal education type.

         Table 2 shows the means of student variables where we divide the sample by whether the

student has zero versus one or more friends whose mothers have a four year college degree. Panel

1 presents outcome variables demonstrating that GPA increases modestly and number of friends

whose mothers have no high school degree decreases modestly with maternal education level of

friends. Panel 2 shows the student demographics that are exploited for predicting friendship

patterns, Panel 3 shows the demographics used in the balancing tests below, and Panel 4 shows

the means over school attributes. 29 Students with friends who have college educated mothers are

more likely to be female, be white, have a mother who completed college, live with both parents,

live in households that have less kids, and be born in the U.S. They are also more likely to attend

schools that have a higher percentage of white students, have a higher share of maternal college

mothers, and are larger.

3.1 Evidence Supporting the Research Design

         Our maintained assumption is that students are quasi-randomly sorted into cohorts, and if

this assumption holds then the predicted friendship patterns should be uncorrelated with the

attributes of the individual conditional on the school by student type fixed effects. We conduct

student level balancing tests to validate that assumption by selecting demographic variables like

nativity or family structure that are not used in the fixed effect vector and regressing predicted




  28
      N(N+1)/2=(16*17)/2=136. One example is white-dropout/white-college, indicating that one student is white with
a high school dropout mom, and the other is white with a college graduate mom.
   29
      Note that one of the variables used in the balancing test is years of maternal education because years of education
can vary within our maternal education attainment cells.
                                                                                                                       16


friendship patterns on these attributes. If an attribute is missing, the variable is set to zero and a

dummy variable is included that takes on the value 1 whenever this particular variable is missing.

         The first balancing test uses the entire student sample and conducts a traditional cohort

balancing test regressing cohort composition over maternal education, race and ethnicity after

                                          −𝑖𝑖
omitting a student’s own contribution (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) on ten exogenous attributes of students (𝑋𝑋ics). 30

                           −𝑖𝑖
(8)                     𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = α𝑋𝑋ics + 𝜑𝜑gs + 𝜙𝜙c + 𝜉𝜉ics

where 𝑋𝑋ics is the vector of attributes, 𝜑𝜑gs are actual school (high school or middle school) by

gender fixed effects and 𝜙𝜙c are cohort or grade fixed effects. These results are shown in Table 3

Panel 1. Each column in Table 3 Panel 1 represents a single regression relating cohort composition

to individual demographics and presents the F-tests for the full set of demographic coefficients in

the regression. All F-tests are statistically insignificant, and cohort shares cannot be explained by

the predetermined student attributes. 31 Further, we calculate the R-squared of the balancing test

variables conditional on the fixed effects by calculating first the R-squared with and without the

balancing test controls and then dividing the improvement in the R-squared from adding the

balancing test controls by the variance that was not explained by the fixed effects alone (one minus

the R-squared without controls). This ratio is presented in the row labelled within R-squared, and

we find that the balancing test variables explain less than one-tenth of one percent of the remaining

variation in the cohort compositions.32




  30
      We follow Billings, Deming and Rockoff (2012) by placing the cohort composition on the left-hand side and
conduct an F-test test for whether the set of exogenous attributes systematically explains cohort composition. The
results are nearly identical if we do not omit the individual since on average a single person is only a small part of the
cohort of students to which they belong.
   31
      See Appendix Table 2. All individual coefficients are insignificant. Note that years of maternal education can be
included in the balance test because the fixed effects control for discrete levels of educational attainment.
   32
      We also pass balancing tests on share students with maternal education missing and show that cohort variables
are uncorrelated with students nominating friends outside of his/her own grade.
                                                                                                                       17


           Next, we conduct a balancing test using the regression sample and our constructed

variables for predicted number of friendships of a given type.
                             y,−c                    y,−c
  (9)                      p� xcs = α𝑋𝑋ixcs + πq� xcs + 𝜑𝜑xs + 𝜙𝜙cs + 𝜉𝜉ixcs

                                                        y,−c
where again 𝑋𝑋ics is the vector of attributes, q� xcs is our control function for the omission of own

                 y,−c
cohort from p� xcs , 𝜑𝜑xs is the vector of student type by school fixed effects and 𝜙𝜙cs is the vector of

cohort by school fixed effects. 33 In Table 3 Panel 2, we present the estimates for these models

where columns 1 and 2 present the F-tests for the female sample on predicted number of maternal

college friends and maternal no high school degree friends, respectively. Columns 3 and 4 present

the same analysis for the male sample. Again, the F-tests are statistically insignificant, 34 and the

variables explain less than one-tenth of one percent of the variance after conditioning on the fixed

effects.

           For comparison, we estimate these models in Panel 3 for actual number of maternal college

friends using the full sample and strongly reject the independence of actual friendships. 35 This

exercise illustrates that actual friendship pattern differences across cohorts are highly correlated

with student demographics, but our instrumental variable strategy is successful in eliminating this

correlation. Unlike in panel 2, the resulting F-statistics are substantial in magnitude and statistically

significant. Similarly, the within fixed effects R-squareds in panel 3 are an order of magnitude



  33
      The regression sample is restricted to the 73,840 students who self-report their Grade Point Average on the in-
school survey conducted in wave 1. This sample also includes a restriction dropping 223 observations that belong to
singleton student type by school clusters.
   34
      See Appendix Table 3. Again, virtually all individual estimates are statistically insignificant. Balancing tests
yield estimates even closer to zero with even smaller F-tests if we do not include the term q� y,−c
                                                                                               xcs consistent with Guryan,

Kroft and Notowidigdo (2009)’s conclusion that omitting own cohort biases results towards finding balance and that
the control function eliminates that bias.
   35
      Panel 2 restricts the sample to be the same as regression sample used in the next section to demonstrate balance
for the same model and sample. There is no reason to impose this restriction in panel 3, but when the sample restriction
is imposed the results are very similar. Finally, the regressions in Panel 3 do not include the control function for the
omission of own cohort since actual friendships are used as the dependent variable.
                                                                                                                      18


larger than those in panel 2 for the maternal college graduate models and 2 to 4 times larger for

the maternal no high school models. Finally, comparing the individual estimates in Appendix

Table 3 for the predicted friendship patterns and Appendix Table 4 for the actual friendships shows

estimates in Appendix Table 4 that are often an order of magnitude larger than the estimates in

Appendix Table 3.

4. Results

         In columns 1 and 5 of Table 4, we show that our predicted friendship composition measures

are strongly related to the actual friendship nominations with t-statistics over 10 for number of

maternal college friends and over 6 for number of maternal no high school degree friends. Looking

at the IV regressions in columns 3, 4, 7 and 8. The associate F-statistics from the test for weak

instruments always exceeds 10 and is around 100 for maternal college and between 30 and 40 for

maternal non-high school graduate. 36 The OLS coefficients for Grade Point Average (GPA) from

columns (2) and (6) show that students having more friends with a college educated mother have

higher GPA relative to their cohort/grade mates, but having more friends whose mom dropped out

of high school is unrelated to GPA.

         In Columns 3, 4, 7, 8, we examine friendship composition effects for GPA using two-stage

least squares. We test one “type” of friendship at a time. For example, in columns (3) and (7), we

regress GPA on the predicted number of friends with a college graduate mom. The IV estimates

differ from OLS estimates. The coefficient of college graduate mom increases by 31% for female

students, but changes from significant and positive to insignificant and small for males. 37 The


  36
      In another illustration of the power of the instruments, Appendix Table 5 presents the standard deviations of the
instruments and the standard deviation of the instrument residuals after removing the school by type fixed effects and
over half the variation in the variables remains in the residuals.
   37
      While the IV point estimate is near zero for males, the estimate is significantly noisier than the estimate for
females with a standard error that is three times larger than for females, and we cannot rule out substantial friendship
effects for males. Further, note that the noisy estimate is not due to differences in the strength of the instrument, but
                                                                                                                19


estimated coefficient of number of friends with college graduate mom is 0.204 for females,

indicating that one more mutual friend with a college educated mom is associated with a 0.204

grade point increase of GPA, which is about a 7 percent increase at the mean GPA of 2.88 for all

female students and represents a 0.25 standard deviation increase. A one standard deviation

increase in the number of friends of this type is associated with a 0.17 standard deviation increase

in GPA. The coefficients on dropout in columns (4) and (8) remain small and insignificant.

         For comparison purposes, we estimate a model of peer effects examining how the share of

students in a cohort whose mothers have a four year college degree affects the GPA of female and

males students. We estimate a standard cohort based peer effects model simply controlling for

actual school and cohort/grade fixed effects or

                                     −𝑖𝑖
  (10)                    Yics = θ𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾s + υc + 𝜏𝜏ics

         −𝑖𝑖
where 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is simply the cohort share of students whose mothers have a four year degree omitting

the student themselves.

         We find peer effect estimates for the share of students whose mothers are college educated

of 0.585 with a standard error of 0.210 for girls and a somewhat smaller estimate of 0.499 with a

standard error of 0.242 for boys. 38 This implies that a 10 percentage point increase in the number

of maternal college educated students in a cohort leads to a 0.059 increase in GPA for girls and a

0.050 increase for boys. The sample average number of maternal college students is 0.298

(omitting students for whom maternal college is missing). A 10 percentage point increase leads to




instead potentially due to a much noisier process for determining male GPA. The standard errors associated with the
effects of friends whose mothers did not complete high school are also always quite large, likely due to the small
fraction of students in the population whose mothers did not complete high school and the concentration of this
population among Hispanic students.
   38
      These estimates are presented in Appendix Table 6. The effect for GPA differs from the results of Bifulco,
Fletcher, Oh and Ross (2014) who find that share of cohort level peers whose mothers have a college degree only
affects college attendance for boys.
                                                                                                                   20


a 0.398 share or a 34 percent increase in the share, and so implies a 34 percent increase in the

potential friendship links to maternal college students. Later in the paper, we show that the

estimate friendship effects are relatively stable over schools based on the share of maternal college

students, and similarly confirm that the first stage friendship predictive model is stable over type

of school. 39 Therefore, as a back of the envelope calculation, we can approximate the effect of

increasing the number of potential links with maternal college students by 34% as an increase in

the number of potential maternal college friends by 34%. The estimated effect of such a change

on GPA is then simply 0.34 times the average number of maternal college friends of 0.318 times

the estimated effect size of 0.204, or an increase of 0.022, which is approximately 38 percent of

the peer effect estimates for girls and more than double the difference between the estimated peer

effects for girls and boys. These effect sizes suggest that friendships play a significant role in

observed peer effects for girls.

4.1 Robustness

         We next examine the robustness of these estimates in Table 5. First, in Panel 1, given that

maternal education is missing for a large segment of the population, we re-estimate the models

dropping all observations where maternal education is not observed, and then re-estimate the

models replacing maternal education with paternal education whenever maternal education is not

observed. 40 Column 1 repeats the estimates from Table 4. Then, the results for dropping



  39
      The GPA effect estimates are 0.212 and 0.195 for the subsamples of schools below and above the median share
of students whose mothers have four year college degrees, respectively. Similarly, the first stage estimates for below
and above median schools are 0.853 and 0.880, respectively.
   40
      When dropping observations where maternal education is missing, we only need to rerun the second stage
because the relevant fixed effects for this sample are unaffected by dropping those individuals. On the other hand,
when we use paternal education to replace missing maternal education, the fixed effect estimates will be affected so
we rerun both the friendship link model and the IV model for grade point average. We follow this strategy through re-
estimating both stages when the sample or model is changing in a way that will alter the fixed effects, and only re-
estimating the second stage when the fixed effects are unchanged such as when we examine subsamples by type of
school.
                                                                                                                   21


observations if missing and for replacing maternal with paternal education if missing are shown in

columns 2 and 3 of Panel 1. All results are robust, although the additional information provided

by replacing maternal with paternal education when missing leads to a noisier, but larger effect

size of maternal college friends for female students.

         Next in Panel 2, we show the effects of changing the source of identifying variation by

changing the fixed effects structure. As discussed above, we first estimate a triple difference model

adding controls for student type by cohort fixed effects. These estimates are shown in column 1.

Second, we change the demographic cell structure by adding a third variable for defining

observationally equivalent students and then estimated fixed effects based on either race/ethnicity-

maternal education-whether student was born in the U.S. and race/ethnicity-maternal education-

whether students resides with both parents cells. The results based on incorporating nativity into

the cell structure are shown in column 2, and the results using family structure are shown in column

3. The substantially more complex fixed effect structures of either the triple difference model or

the expanded student type models yield very similar estimates for the effect of maternal college

friends on female students, and as always all other estimated effects are statistically insignificant. 41

         In the last panel, we conduct three additional tests, which while intended to show

robustness, also change the type of friendship effects for which we are testing. In the first column

of Table 5 Panel 3, we present estimates based on friendship link and friendship effect on grade

models that use any friendship referrals whether or not they are reciprocal. The results are robust,

but the effect size is considerably smaller, consistent with one-way referrals representing

friendships that are not as close and so possibly have less impact on outcomes. Next, in column



  41
     Finally, we verify that our results for males and females are robust to estimating models where we control for
multiple friendship variables using the same IV strategy. The maternal college friends effect is robust, and the other
variables like total number of friends or number friend’s of a specific race are not significant.
                                                                                                                     22


2, we present results based on dropping all seventh and eighth grade students, as well as 9th graders

for the few high schools that are only 10th through 12th grade, from both the friendship link model

and the GPA model rerunning those models for high school grades and students only. Again,

results are robust. If anything, the results suggest that friendship effects on GPA are larger in the

high school subsample. In both cases, there was no similar effect for men.

         Finally, in column 3, we present estimates where the student race, ethnicity, parental

education cells are based on paternal education, instead of maternal, when available, 42 and re-

estimate the model. The estimated effects for paternal education are significantly smaller

suggesting that maternal education is a much better proxy for the factors that influence friendship

patterns along family socio-economic lines. This finding is consistent with earlier work that

documents a relationship between the child’s labor supply and both mother’s labor supply and

peer’s mother’s labor supply (Olivetti et al. 2013). Similarly, the estimates for males for paternal

education are larger, but still noisily estimated so we cannot determine whether friend’s paternal

education affect boys’ grades. The increase in point estimates when using paternal education

reinforces our inability to make strong claims about whether friendships have effects on male

students. 43

         Finally, in the appendix, we present estimates where we instrument for multiple measures

related to friendship composition within the same model. First, we include both number of

maternal college and number of maternal no high school degree students in the same model, then

we add and instrument for a control for the total number of friends and finally for controls for the




  42
     If paternal education is missing, we use maternal education as a proxy.
  43
     We also examine models where we include weights based on one over the cohort size since the number of
observations in the linked sample size is quadratic in the cohort size, but use of those weights has virtually no impact
on our estimated effects of friendships in the second stage model.
                                                                                                                        23


number of black and number of Hispanic friends. Our estimated effects of maternal education are

robust across all models. Appendix Tables 7 presents the first stage estimates for the additional

friendship variables, and Appendix Table 8 presents the instrumental variables estimates for these

models. 44

4.2 Friendship Effects versus Peer Environment Effects

         While we cannot prove that friendships drive our estimated effects, we provide some

evidence concerning whether the effects appear to be attributable to friendships as opposed to other

heterogeneous effects of peers. First, in Table 6, we allow average peer effects to vary by student

type interacting the share of students in a cohort whose mothers have a college degree with

maternal education, race and ethnicity. The friendship findings are robust. The strong positive

effect of maternal college education friends for females remains and moderately increases, and the

other effects remain small and insignificant. Only the interaction between student Hispanic and

share maternal college is significant for girls with larger positive spillovers for Hispanic students,

but the F-test on the full set of interactions is insignificant suggesting that these effects may have

arisen from type 1 error. For boys on the other hand, the interaction between student black and

share maternal college for men is negative implying smaller or even negative spillovers when

compared to the average effect of peers presented in Appendix Table 6, and the F-test is highly

significant. While not the topic of our paper, the cohort level positive peer effects of share maternal

college students for boys appears concentrated among white and Hispanic students.




  44
      In the model with all controls, total number of friends and number of black friends are statistically significant for
males. However, the F-statistic for weak instruments is much smaller at 16, the two coefficients are positive correlated
and have opposite signs, and both coefficients are smaller and insignificant when estimated without the other variable
in the equation. This pattern at least raises concerns that these new results in the multivariate analysis are not reliable
or robust.
                                                                                                   24


          As a second attempt to address heterogeneous environmental effects, we examine whether

the “direct environmental effect” associated with our female instrument can be found in the male

sample—that is, if our instrument for female friendship patterns has more general, direct effects

on own GPA other than friendship, one way to indirectly test for this is to examine whether the

instrument also predicts GPAs for the males. 45 We conduct this examination in two ways. First,

we use the actual female instrument based on the composition of female students in each cohort to

explain the GPA of boys and visa versa for girls’ GPA. Second, we use the estimated link model

fixed effects for female students with the male cohort composition to develop an instrument for

boys’ friendship composition and similarly only the female student fixed effects for predicting

boys’ friendships. In both cases, we do not find evidence that the girl’s link model or girls’

composition can explain the GPA of boys. For girls, however, we find that using the boys’ fixed

effects with girls’ cohort composition has similar explanatory power to the models estimated

above, likely because the friendship pattern fixed effects do not differ very much between boys

and girls within the same school and the power of the instrument is primarily derived from

variation in the cohort demographic composition. Regardless, the instrument that relies on the

cohort composition of boys has no explanatory power for girls’ GPA. 46

           These findings strongly suggest that our results are driven by the composition of potential

friendship links that girls face within their cohort of grade mates, consistent with our estimates

capturing the effects of friendship. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely rule out environmental factors

that strongly correlate with the friendship environment. The environment could be shaped by

simply having a lot of people around who would be good candidates to be friends with you. Such




  45
       We thank Damon Clark for this suggestion.
  46
       These results are shown in Appendix Table A9.
                                                                                                                      25


an environment might, for example, be a relatively safe environment even if you are not friends

with these people.

4.3 Mechanisms Analysis

         To investigate potential channels through which girls are affected by friends, we use the

IV specification to examine non-cognitive outcomes. We manually classify variables into seven

categories and use factor analysis procedures to generate composite variables. A high score reflects

high self-evaluation or self-esteem, 47 positive integration with the school social environment, 48

good mental health, functioning well in school, 49 more misbehavior, high frequency of

smoking/drinking and good physical health respectively. 50 The composite variables resulting from

the principle components analyses are all standardized to have a variance of one. The individual

components of each variable are shown in Appendix Table A10.

         In Table 7, we present the results of our mechanisms analyses for females. Each column

refers to a single outcome of interest, and each cell in Panel 1 represents the relevant coefficient

of interest from a separate IV regression. The results suggest that female’s subjective evaluation

of the school environment and their integration into that environment are positively correlated with

the expected number of high maternal education friends. The results indicate that girls with more

friends whose moms graduate from college are to functioning well within the school getting along

with others and participating in school. A one standard deviation on these variables implies

approximately a one-quarter point increase in GPA. There are no statistically significant




  47
      Self-evaluation includes whether the interviewees think themselves physically fit, are proud of themselves, like
themselves, think they are doing things right, and try to study well. When discussed in Psychology, the concept of
self-esteem can be either overall feeling about self or on a specific aspect, such as academic, appearance or popularity.
It also can indicate troublesome behavior and depression (Rosenberg et al. 1989, Markowitz 2001).
   48
      Environment evaluation shows the extent that students feel close, safe, fair and accepted at school.
   49
      i.e. getting along with teachers and students, paying attention in school, and getting homework done.
   50
      See Appendix A7.
                                                                                                                 26


relationships with number of maternal college friends for male students, although the estimated

effect of maternal college friends on functioning well in school is similar in magnitude to the

statistically significant estimate for girls.

        Our findings that girls are more influenced by high quality peers than boys on their

integration with the school environment and their successful participation in that environment are

consistent with the existing literature (Brown 1982, Griffin et al., 1999, Durlauf 2004). Numerous

studies also have found that academic achievement and identification with school (which is similar

to our measures of “environment”) are positively correlated. For example, Akerlof and Kranton

(2002) hypothesized that a sense of identification with the schooling process was the most likely

explanation of the finding from Krueger and Whitmore (2001) that he impacts of small

Kindergarten class size disappeared in middle school but re-emerged later with an increase in

college going. 51 Our analysis is novel because we have plausibly exogenous variation in friendship

composition that can separate correlational and causal effects of peers. However, our analysis

cannot establish the direction of the causal link between self-esteem and school achievement

because we have only shown that friendship composition has a causal influence on both

variables. 52

4.4 Heterogeneity of Friendship Effects.

        We next examine how broad based these friendship effects for female students are. We

start by looking across courses based on the GPA in the core areas of math, English, science and

history. These estimates are presented in Table 8 where the estimates for girls are shown in Panel




  51
     Fletcher (2009) tested this hypothesis but found no evidence with measures of participation in school clubs and
activities.
  52
     Most mechanism analyses of peer effects suffer from this problem including Bifulco, Fletcher and Ross (2011),
Lavy and Schlosser (2011) and Carrell, Sacerdote and West (2013).
                                                                                                                 27


1, and the boys’ estimates are shown in panel 2. With the exception of GPA in math courses, we

find friendship effects for girls on all subjects. A lack of finding on math GPA is not entirely

surprising because other papers have shown evidence that cognitive skills are more invariant to

peers than non-cogitive skills (e.g. Kerr et al. 2013, Lavy and Sand 2018). We do not find any

statistically significant effects for boys, and the point estimates are always smaller than the point

estimates for girls. 53

        Then, we examine the effects for girl students by different types of schools splitting our

sample based on the school having a share white above or below the sample median share white

(64%), being above or below the median share maternal college (24%), and being above or below

the median size (241 total students across the 6 grades). These estimates are shown in Table 9,

and none of the differences between the subsample estimates are statistically significant.

Moreover, the effect sizes are relatively similar across the samples with the exception of share

white, but in that case the larger estimates for schools with above median share white are

accompanied by a much larger standard error. Therefore, the statistical evidence for heterogeneity

across schools is very weak.

        Similarly, we find at most limited evidence of heterogeneity across types of girl students.

Table 10 shows estimates for maternal college and maternal high school graduate students in

columns 1 and 2, and estimates for white, black and Hispanic students in columns 3 through 5.

The effect of friendships with maternal college students have a substantially larger point estimate

for students whose mothers only have a high school degree, but the estimated difference between

the maternal education subsamples is still less than a standard deviation. On race and ethnicity,



  53
     Given the sizable estimate on paternal education for boys, we also estimated the models in Table 10 Panel 2 for
boys using the paternal education based instrument. The estimates tended to be smaller than the robustness test
estimates, and all estimated effects on subject GPA were insignificant for boys using paternal education.
                                                                                                   28


the estimated effects are larger for whites and Hispanics, but the standard errors in the

race/ethnicity subsamples are very large. The inability to identify heterogeneity by race is not

entirely surprising given that the identification strategy almost certainly relies heavily on the high

levels of racial and ethnic homophile in friendship patterns.

5. Conclusions

       This paper presents new evidence of the effects of the characteristics of friends on academic

achievement. We use a novel strategy that leverages across-cohort, within school variation in the

“supply of friend ‘types’” and allows the impacts of the supply of friends to vary across schools.

We then show that having friends with highly educated mothers is causally related to academic

achievement for female students. The magnitude of these friendship effects suggest that increased

friendship opportunities can explain approximately 38 percent of the estimated peer effects arising

from an increase in the fraction of students in a cohort whose mothers have completed a four year

college degree.

       Naturally, we cannot rule out the possibility that some aspect of the school environment

that promotes friendship between a student and student’s whose mothers have a college degree

also independently improves outcomes for that type of student. Therefore, a somewhat weaker

conclusion is that peer environments that raise the likelihood of a student having friends with

college educated mothers leads to an increase in girls’ GPAs. However, our results cannot be

explained by simple, school or grade/cohort level peer effects even when those effects are allowed

to be heterogenous across students. Further, additional investigations show that the key factor that

drives the significant estimate on number of maternal college students for girls is the composition

of potential same cohort-same gender friends.
                                                                                                29


       To examine potential mechanisms, we show evidence that a friend’s maternal education

status is also linked to increases in both favorable opinions of and integration into the school

environment, as well as student perceptions that they are functioning well in school in terms of

getting along with teachers and other students and participating in their education. We also show

that these effects are broad based arising in all subject areas examines other than math and appear

to be relatively homogeneous across both types of students and types of schools.

                      Appendix A: Derivation of Control Function for Omit-Self Bias
                                                                    𝑦𝑦
        A key problem that arises from the estimation of p� 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 from equation (2) in the main text to
          𝑦𝑦                                                                          𝑦𝑦       𝑦𝑦
predict 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is that the estimates only vary across cohorts for each type, p� 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ≠ p� 𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 where c ≠ d,

if the total number of students of type y in school s is not large; otherwise idiosyncratic variation

will converge to zero and cohort composition will simply represent school composition as student

population becomes large relative to the number of types. Therefore, while the total number of

students of type x in the sample and the total number of students in any school or cohort may be

relatively large, the number of students in each type in each school must be relatively small in

order to create variation across cohorts. The dimensionality of our fixed effect vector increases

linearly with the number of schools and the number of pair types, and so the school by student

pair-type fixed effects suffer from an incidental parameters bias due to small numbers of

observations in each cell. Specifically, the unobservable of a student i of type x in school s affects

the estimates of δ�xys for all types y and so the conditional expectation of the unobservable in the

student outcome equation 𝜏𝜏ixcs is non-zero.

(A1)                  E�𝜏𝜏ixcs �δ�xys ∀ y� ≠ 0

        In order to address this source of bias, we develop a cohort specific measure of predicted

friendship outcomes that explicitly omits all students in the same cohort c as student i from fixed

effect estimates. This correction is based on the logic of using jackknife instrumental variable

estimators for small samples (Angrist, Imbens and Krueger 1999; Blomquist and Dahlberg 1999)

that develop a prediction for each observation using the entire sample, except the observation itself,

and comparable to, but more conservative than, the common practice of omitting an individual

from the calculation of their peer averages.
                                                                                                   38


        In mean differenced models, the standard approach to estimating the fixed effects is to back

out those fixed effects by calculating the mean of the within cell residuals conditional on the cohort

fixed effects 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐 in the non-differenced sample. The cohort specific fixed effect that omits student

i’s own cohort c can be estimated in the same way by summing the predicted residual over all

cohorts d and pairs of students, j and k where d≠c as long as there exists at least one student of

type x any cohort other than c in school s.

(A2)           𝛿𝛿̂𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
                  −𝑐𝑐                                                                      −𝑐𝑐
                         = ∑d∈{e,s} 𝑒𝑒≠𝑐𝑐�∑j∈{x,d,s} ∑k∈{y,d,s},k<j�Pjkxyds − 𝜋𝜋�𝑑𝑑 �� /𝑁𝑁𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥

where

                  −𝑐𝑐
(A3)           𝑁𝑁𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = ∑d∈{e,s} 𝑒𝑒≠𝑐𝑐�∑j∈{x,d,s} ∑k∈{y,d,s},k<j 1�

The notation in equation (A2) is structured so that the first summation term sums over all cohorts

in the school other than c in order to calculate a school level fixed effect, the second two term sum

over all pairs of students j and k in the same cohort and of types x and y not allowing for student’s

to pair with themselves and not including duplicate pairs of (j,k) and (k,j).

        Now based on equation (3), we define the individual specific prediction as
                        𝑦𝑦,−𝑐𝑐
(A4)                𝑃𝑃�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = ∑j≠i,j∈{y,c,s}� 𝛿𝛿̂𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
                                                   −𝑐𝑐
                                                          �

        However, as noted by Bayer, Ross and Topa (2008) and Guryan, Kroft and Notowidigdo

(2009), this process creates a negative correlation within type-cohort-school because an

individual’s contribution to the fixed effect is eliminated for themselves and not for anyone else in

the type-cohort-school. In Guryan et al.’s example, players select into golf tournaments, but are

then randomly assigned to teams, which Guryan refers to as urns. The average team ability

experienced by an individual golfer (omitting self) is negatively correlated (conditional on

tournament fixed effects) with the individual’s unobservable because within the tournament and

urn the golfer cannot be paired with him/herself. Guryan et al. proposes a solution to this bias for
                                                                                                                   39


peer composition or subgroup means, which is to include an additional control for peer

composition at the higher tournament level of aggregation also omitting self. This control captures

the negative correlation arising from omitting self and the estimates on the subgroup means are

unbiased.

         In order to apply the Guryan et al. logic to our example, it is useful to consider a slight

generalization to their problem. Consider the following simple behavioral model

(A5)               𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where c is an urn and s is a tournament. Assume that for any individual i, 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is correlated with

𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , but can be divided into two additively separable components

                               𝑖𝑖         −𝑖𝑖
(A6)               𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where the first component contains the contamination that leads to the correlation and the second

component is uncorrelated with 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

                                   𝑖𝑖                    𝑖𝑖
(A7)               𝐸𝐸�𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 � = 𝛼𝛼𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

                                   −𝑖𝑖
(A8)               𝐸𝐸�𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 � = 0

                                                   −𝑖𝑖
         In Guryan et al., the second component 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is equivalent to the average urn ability omitting

                                                                                 𝑖𝑖
self, and simply including this control will lead to biased estimates because 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is omitted and

   𝑖𝑖           −𝑖𝑖
𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are correlated.

                                  −𝑖𝑖        𝑖𝑖                    −𝑖𝑖                  𝑖𝑖        −𝑖𝑖
(A9)              𝐸𝐸[𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 � = 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝐸𝐸[𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 ]

         However, including both variables yields unbiased estimates since

                                    −𝑖𝑖        𝑖𝑖                    −𝑖𝑖                 𝑖𝑖
(A10)               𝐸𝐸[𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 ] = 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + (𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼)𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠

                   𝑖𝑖                                                                                −𝑖𝑖
The coefficient 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 includes both the true effect and contamination allowing the estimate on 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

to be consistent. While the Guryan et al. idea of controlling for the tournament mean minus the

individual’s contribution seems intuitively appealing, the true source of the solution is that the
                                                                                                   40


within tournament variation in this mean nearly perfectly correlates with the individual, additively

separable portion of the mean (the contaminated component) that has been removed from the

variable of interest since after removing tournament fixed effects only the omission of the

individual's own attribute remains in the variable.

        In our context, students of a given type x sort into schools, but their allocation to a cohort

or grade is assumed to be quasi-random. Therefore, the aggregate groups (or tournaments) are

defined as type-school cells, and type-cohort-school cells are equivalent to one of Guryan et al.’s

subgroups (or urns). We wish to separate the estimate of the predicted friendship outcome from
                                       𝑦𝑦
equation (3) using all information 𝑃𝑃�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 into a component that omits all information involving or

influenced by choices made by individual i (omitting own cohort) and a second component that

contains this contamination.
                                            𝑦𝑦          𝑦𝑦,−𝑐𝑐     y
(A11)                                   𝑃𝑃�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝑃𝑃�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + q� xcs

                           𝑦𝑦,−𝑐𝑐
        The expression 𝑃𝑃�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 has been constructed in equation (3) so that it does not contain any

information from the choices of individual i and i’s grademates, and differencing equation (3) from
                                              𝑦𝑦
the actual fixed effect estimates yields q� xcs :
                                  𝑦𝑦
(A12)                           q� ics = ∑j≠i,j∈{y,c,s}(δ�xys − δ�−c
                                                                  xys )


For our context, this contaminated component is equivalent to the control developed by Guryan et

al. After the inclusion of tournament fixed effects, the Guryan et al. correction simply controls for

the individual’s contribution to their urn or team mean. The expression in (A12) contains the

contributions of the choices made by all students in the individual student’s cohort to the

conditional mean or prediction for the student type by cohort by school cell to which the individual

belongs.

Notes. Panel 1 presents the results for a balancing test where the cohort share of a subgroup is
regressed on student demographics listed in panel 3 of Table 2. The models control for actual
school (high school or middle school) by demographic type based on the variables in panel 1 of
Table 2, and are estimated using the entire sample of students with valid friendship information to
estimate this traditional cohort study balancing test. Panel 2 presents the results for a balancing
test regression predicted number of friends on the same demographics controlling for student type
by school district and cohort by school district fixed effects plus a control function to address the
omission of cohort from friendship predictions following our grade point average model
specification and using our sample of students where we observe grade point average. Panel 3
presents the same balancing tests for actual number of friends using the full sample and not omit
the control function created for the predicted friendship variables. In all models, demographic
variables are set to zero when missing and a dummy for missingness is included for that variable.
Then, an F-test is conducted on the demographic controls.

Notes: Columns (1) and (5) show the coefficients from the first stage regression of the 2SLS, which is regressing actual number
of friends on the predicted number of friends for “Friends with Mom college Graduate” and “Friends with Mom No High School”
separately. The predicted number of friends is generated by summing up the predicted probability of being friends from estimation
using the pair level friendship link sample for each student over all potential friends of a certain type (e.g. maternal college
education). The R-squared and F-statistic from first stage are presented under columns (3), (4), (7) and (8). Each column among
(2) to (4) and (6) to (8) displays a separate regression of GPA on number of mutual friends with college graduate mothers and/or
with high school dropout mothers. Columns (2) and 6) present the OLS estimates while the other columns present IV estimates.
The numbers of mutual friends are instrumented with corresponding predicted number of friends from the friendship link model.
All regressions control for school-student type and school district-cohort/grade fixed effects, and models are estimated separately
by gender. IV regressions include a control for the omission of the student's own cohort information from predicted friendship
patterns in both first and second stage. All standard errors are clustered at the school level. **p<0.01 and *p<0.05.

Notes. See notes for Table 4. Table 5 Panel 1 contains estimates that address concerns that
maternal education is missing for a substantial fraction of the sample. Column (1) replicates
the estimates from Table 4, column (2) presents estimates dropping individuals who did not
report their maternal education, and and column (3) presents estimates where maternal
education is replaced with paternal education when maternal education is missing. Panel 2
presents estimates using different fixed effect structures. Column (1) presents estimates using
based on adding a vector of fixed effects for student type by cohort fixed effects, Column (2)
presents estimates expanding the student type by school district so that student type includes
whether the student born in the U.S. or not, and Column (3) presents estimates expanding the
student type by school district so that student type includes whether the student lives with both
parents or not. All standard errors are clustered at the school district level. **p<0.01 and

Notes: See notes for Table 4. The “Share maternal college” is the fraction of students in the grade whose
mothers completed a college degree, and in each row this variable is interacted with a dummy for a specific
student demographic attribute. All regressions control for school-student type and school-cohort fixed effects,
and the share maternal college variable itself is subsumed by the school-cohort fixed effects. The instrumental
variable regressions include “omit own cohort controls.” All standard errors are clustered at the school district
level. **p<0.01 and *p<0.05.

number of students whose mother have a four year college degree from a separate IV regression; therefore each row contains coefficients from eight
IV regressions. The regressions are the same as described in the note for Table 4, except for the dependent variables. Dependent variables, except
grade point average, are constructed by factor analysis of students’ report on own mental status, behavior, school and family environment (see

Notes: Each column displays a separate regression of a cohort composition variable on ten predetermined
demographics variables. To maintain the sample size, we also include interaction terms of each
predetermined demographic variable and the indicator for non-missing value of that variable. The cohort
composition variables for a student includes the percentage of black (not Hispanic), Hispanic, other/Asian,
mother graduated from four year college and mother dropout from high school, omitting the student’s own
contribution. All regressions control for school-gender fixed effect, grade dummies, and a Guryan type
control for school level composition omitting the student him/herself. Standard errors are clustered at the
school level. Observations with missing maternal education data are assigned the median value of the
cohort variable of all other students in the school-grade-gender group. **p<0.01 and *p<0.05.

Notes: Each column displays a separate regression of the instrument variable--predicted number of mutual
friends with college graduate mothers or with high school dropout mothers, on ten predetermined
demographics variables and the interaction terms of the predetermined demographic variables and their
indicators for non-missing values. All regressions control for school-gender-student type fixed effect and
school-grade fixed effect. A control for omitting self from cohort composition is included in all
regressions, but results are very similar with or without this control. Standard errors are clustered at the
school level. **p<0.01 and *p<0.05.

Notes: The first row presents the standard deviation of the predicted number of friends whose mothers
have a four year degree for the female and male subsamples (columns 1 and 2) and the predicted number
of friends whose mothers do not have a high school degree (columns 3 and 4). The second row predicts
the residual standard deviation after removing school district by student type fixed effects.

Notes: Predicted number of friends is generated by summing up the predicted probability of being friends
from estimation using the pair level match sample for each student over all potential friends of a certain
type (e.g. black). All regressions control for school-gender-student type fixed effect, school-grade fixed
effect, and Guryan type controls for school level friendship pattern omitting the student’s contribution.
Standard errors are clustered at the school level. **p<0.01 and *p<0.05.
