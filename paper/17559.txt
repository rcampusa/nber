                                              ABSTRACT

We study how the rise of trade in services with China and India has impacted U.S. labour markets.
The topic has two understudied aspects: it deals with service trade (most studies deal with manufacturing
trade) and it examines the historical first of U.S. workers competing with educated but low-wage foreign
workers. Our empirical agenda is made complicated by the endogeneity of service imports and the
endogenous sorting of workers across occupations. To develop an estimation framework that deals
with these, we imbed a partial equilibrium model of ‘trade in tasks’ within a general equilibrium model
of occupational choice. The model highlights the need to estimate labour market outcomes using changes
in the outcomes of individual workers and, in particular, to distinguish workers who switch ‘up’ from
those who switch ‘down’. (Switching ‘down’ means switching to an occupation that pays less on average
than the current occupation). We apply these insights to matched CPS data for 1996-2007. The cumulative
10-year impact of rising service imports from China and India has been as follows. (1) Downward
and upward occupational switching increased by 17% and 4%, respectively. (2) Transitions to unemployment
increased by a large 0.9 percentage points. (3) The earnings of occupational ‘stayers’ fell by a tiny
2.3%. (4) The earnings impact for occupational switchers is not identified without an assumption about
worker sorting. Under the assumption of no worker sorting, downward (upward) switching was associated
with an earning change of -13.9% (+12.1%). Under the assumption of worker sorting, there is no statistically
significant impact on earnings.

1. Introduction

Beginning in the mid-1990s, cumulative improvements in information and communications tech-

nologies (ICT) facilitated a dramatic expansion of international trade in services. By our calcu-

lations the value added in U.S. service trade is now one-fifth the size of the value added in U.S.

goods trade, and by most estimates the number of U.S. jobs now exposed to service imports is at

least double the size of total manufacturing employment (Blinder 2007, van Welsum and Reif 2006,

and Jensen and Kletzer 2007). Trade in services is now large — yet its impact on U.S. labour market

outcomes has received relatively little attention. An important piece of the service tradability

‘revolution’ is the rise of service offshoring to China and India, which has a major new implication

for American workers: for the first time ever educated U.S. workers are competing with educated

but low-paid foreign workers.

   This paper examines the impact of trade in services with China and India on U.S. labour market

outcomes, especially occupational switching, transitions to unemployment, and earnings. The

trade-and-wages debate, exemplified by the seminal papers of Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999),

has been dominated by analysis of the impacts of merchandise trade on manufacturing workers.

Remarkably, only six papers have examined the impacts of service trade: Amiti and Wei (2006),

Geishecker and Görg (2008), Liu and Trefler (2008), Blinder and Krueger (2009), Crino (2009),

Criscuolo and Garicano (2010), and Ebenstein, Harrison, McMillan and Phillips (2011). In short,

research on the labour market impacts of service trade have been scarce.1

   The starting point of our analysis of the impacts of service trade on the U.S. labour market is the

observation that industry-level impacts on employment and wages paint an incomplete picture:

If a displaced worker immediately finds work elsewhere without taking a wage cut then the

implications of displacement are small. Thus, it is not enough to look at industry-level outcomes,

one must also look at what happens to workers who lose their jobs. There is abundant evidence
   1 Using British worker-level data, Criscuolo and Garicano (2010) find that increased imports of services raises both
wages and employment in occupations subject to licensing requirements. Using British household data, Geishecker and
Görg (2008) find that offshoring raises the wages of skilled labour and lowers the wages of unskilled labour. Using
matched CPS data, Liu and Trefler (2008) find very small impacts of service imports from China and India on U.S.
industry switching, occupational switching and earnings changes. These conclusions are superseded by the current
manuscript. Using matched CPS data, Ebenstein et al. (2011) find that foreign affiliate employment has had modest
effects on employment and wages. Since one-third of foreign affiliate employment is in services (Harrison, McMillan
and Null, 2007, tables 1–2), Ebenstein et al. is at least partially about service trade. Using U.S. industry-level data,
Amiti and Wei (2006) show that service imports only slightly lower labour demand and Crino (2009) shows that service
imports drive up the relative demand for skilled versus unskilled labour in tradable sectors. Blinder and Krueger (2009)
administered a worker-level survey on earnings and job offshorability and found no correlation between the two. See
Amiti and Wei (2005) and Trefler (2005) for surveys of earlier work on service offshore outsourcing.



                                                           1
from the labour literature that short-run transitions of labour market status, such as occupational

switches, industry switches, and unemployment transitions have profound implications for work-

ers’ lifetime welfare. For example, see Topel (1991), Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan (1993), Neal

(1995), Parent (2000), and Kambourov and Manovskii (2009).2 In addition, we show below in

table 1 that for workers in occupations exposed to tradable services, those that switch out of

their occupation have a 6.9% to 9.8% probability of becoming unemployed and these unemployed

remain unemployed for between 15.3 and 16.5 weeks. These numbers paint a picture of very large

costs of job loss.

   In contrast, studies relating merchandise trade to worker displacement arrive at more nuanced

conclusions. Kletzer (1998, 2001) estimates small effects. Crino (2010) finds larger wage effects.

Hummels, Jorgensen, Munch and Xiang (2010) find very large effects (imports depress the post-

displacement wages of Danish workers by between 19% and 28%). Ebenstein et al. (2011) find

modest effects (wage losses of 2–4% for workers who leave manufacturing and 4–11% for workers

who switch occupations.) Although Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2011) do not track workers or their

displacement, they develop an innovative local labour markets approach and use regional-level

U.S. data to show that U.S. merchandise imports from China have had large impacts on unem-

ployment, labour force participation, and government transfer payments (especially disability

payments).

   We examine the impact of service trade from China and India — of competition from low-wage

educated labour — on occupational switching, the incidence of unemployment, and earnings.

Unfortunately, this is a complicated exercise because of the endogeneity of imports and the sorting

behaviour of workers. Empirically, trade economists have typically dealt with import endogeneity

and labour economists have typically dealt with sorting on unobservables. Unfortunately, no

paper has dealt with both concerns and both are unavoidable in our setting. To address the

endogeneity of imports, we use a partial equilibrium variant of the Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg

(2008) model of trade in tasks. To address sorting on unobservables we imbed this partial equilib-

rium trade-in-tasks model within a general equilibrium model of occupational choice (Ohnsorge
    2 Jacobson et al. (1993) find that displaced workers suffer long-term losses of as high as 25%. Neal (1995) shows that

human capital is industry-specific and thus workers who switch industries experience greater wage losses following
displacement. Parent (2000) confirms that industry-specific human capital matters a lot for workers’ wage profiles.
Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) find that human capital is also occupation specific: five years of occupational tenure
is associated with a 12-20% increase in wages. Topel (1991) shows that 10 years of job seniority raises wages by over
25%.




                                                            2
and Trefler 2007). The latter is a Ricardian or Roy (1951) model in which workers with unob-

served heterogeneous attributes sort across occupations that have heterogeneous returns to these

attributes.3

   As is well known from the work of Krueger and Summers (1988), Murphy and Welch (1991), and

Gibbons and Katz (1992), it is essential to understand worker sorting if one is to draw conclusions

about the impact of imports on welfare. If (1) workers are homogeneous or (2) returns are the

same across occupations then inter-occupational wage differentials likely reflect good jobs (e.g.,

unionized jobs or jobs associated with efficiency wages) and there are large welfare losses when

good jobs move to China and India. On the other hand, if worker sorting on unobservables is

important, then the welfare losses are more moderate.4

   This distinction between ‘good jobs’ and ‘heterogeneous returns to heterogenous skills’ is partic-

ularly salient in light of research by Gibbons, Katz, Lemieux and Parent (2005). They find that, rel-

atively speaking, high-paying manufacturing occupations are associated with ‘good occupations’

whereas high-paying service occupations are associated with high returns to heterogenous skills.

The implication is that import-induced worker displacement has more severe welfare implications

in manufacturing than in services, the latter being our sector of interest.

   There is now a large literature on worker sorting and international trade. See Davidson, Martin

and Matusz (1999), Grossman and Maggi (2000), Grossman (2004), Davis and Harrigan (2007),

Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007), Costinot (2009), Costinot and Vogel (2010), Davidson and Matusz

(2010), Helpman and Itskhoki (2010), and Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding (2010). Our work

is most closely related to a remarkable paper by Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2010). They

develop and estimate a structural model of workers’ dynamic choices of industry and how these

choices responds to trade shocks. We are also interested in how trade affects sorting behaviour (oc-

cupational choice in our setting), but take a reduced-form approach that focuses on identification

issues associated with the endogeneity of imports and the unobserved heterogeneity of workers.5
   3 In our partial equilibrium model, an industry is associated with an occupation and there is an exogenous, upward-

sloping supply of workers to an occupation. In our general equilibrium model, this supply function is generated
endogenously by worker sorting across occupations.
   4 For the latter perspective, see Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) and, for a recent contribution, see Gathmann

and Schönberg (2010).
   5 Two recent papers on sorting offer results that are more tangential to our work. Using matched employee-employer

data for Sweden, Davidson, Matusz, Heyman, Sjöholm and Zhu (2011) show that openness leads to a greater degree
of assortative matching (‘good workers’ matched to ‘good firms’) in export-oriented industries but not in import-
competing industries. Bombardini, Gallipoli and Pupato (forthcoming) show that unobserved worker characteristics
are a determinant of trade flows.




                                                          3
   A major prediction of our model is that one must look at occupational switchers, and in partic-

ular, one must look separately at two groups of workers: those who ‘switch down’ to occupations

with lower inter-occupational wage differentials and those who ‘switch up’ to occupations with

higher inter-occupational wage differentials. For example, we show that more education lowers

the probability of switching down and raises the probability of switching up. To deal with switch-

ing we use March-to-March matched CPS data. In an international trade context these data have

been exploited by Goldberg, Tracy and Aaronson (1999) and Goldberg and Tracy (2003) in their

study of the impacts of exchange rates, by Liu and Trefler (2008) in a paper superseded by the

current manuscript, and by Ebenstein et al. (2011) in their closely related study of the wage and

employment impacts of merchandise imports and foreign affiliate employment.6

   Turning to our empirical work, we combine matched CPS data for 1996–2007 with detailed BEA

data on bilateral service transactions between the United States and 31 trade partners. We find that

rising service imports from China and India have had the following cumulative 10-year impacts.

(1) Downward and upward occupational switching increased by 17% and 4%, respectively. (2)

Transitions to unemployment increased by a large 0.9 percentage points. (3) The earnings of occu-

pational ‘stayers’ fell by a tiny 2.3%. (4) Matched CPS data does not allow us to identify earnings

impacts for occupational switchers unless an assumption is made about unobservables and worker

sorting. Under the assumption of no worker sorting based on unobservables, downward switching

was associated with an annual earnings hit of -13.9% and upward switching was associated with an

annual earnings gain of 12.1%. Under the assumption of worker sorting, trade-induced switching

had no statistically significant impact on earnings.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the theory. Section 3 describes the BEA

service trade data and the matched CPS data. Section 4 describes the key variables and provides

a simple difference-in-differences analysis. Section 5 reports the results for occupational switching

and transitions to unemployment. Section 6 reports the IV results. Section 7 reports the results for

earnings changes. Section 8 presents the empirical results for sub-populations by education, by

age, and especially by routinization. Following the pioneering work of Autor, Levy and Murnane

(2003), we use O*NET data to explore the role of routineness of tasks. This is a minor part of

our paper, but dovetails nicely with Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2010), Ebenstein et al. (2011), and
   6 The 2009 NBER version of their paper does not use matched CPS data; however, a new version of the paper available

on their websites does use matched data.

robustness of our results. Section 10 concludes.



Some Familiar Facts

We conclude this introduction with some raw numbers that provide a context for our interest in

the costs of occupational switching and the role of sorting. We emphasize that what follows are

facts whose interpretation is far from clear: no causal inferences are intended or drawn. We present

them here because, although these numbers will be familiar to many labour economists, they will

be new to most trade economists.

   We begin by calculating inter-occupational wage differentials (IOWDs). To this end, we regress

a worker’s log of CPI-deflated annual earnings on her observed worker characteristics (education,

experience, experience squared, marital status, sex, race, and state of residence) and dummies

for 4-digit Census occupation codes of the worker’s initial occupation. The estimated occupation

dummies are the IOWDs. We estimate IOWDs using the full CPS data for 1996–2007 (details

below). We then track the occupational switching behaviour of the 38,719 workers in the CPS

sample who can be tracked for one year (March-to-March matching) and who are in occupations

that provide tradable services (in a sense defined below). Finally, we group these workers into

three categories, those that do not switch occupations (‘stayers’), those that ‘switch down’ to an

occupation with a lower IOWD and those that ‘switch up’ to an occupation with a higher IOWD.

   The first row of table 1 shows that workers who switch down have IOWDs in their new

occupation that are 0.249 log points lower than in their old occupation. However, row 2 of table 1

shows that the actual wage change of downward switchers is much smaller (0.148 log points). A

common explanation for why it is smaller appeals to worker sorting e.g., Gibbons and Katz (1992).

Row 3 shows that workers who switch down are less educated than stayers, who in turn are less

educated than workers who switch up. It is thus plausible that switchers are also different from

stayers in terms of unobservables such as ability. We therefore need to model sorting behaviour in

a setting where worker characteristics are not fully observable.




                                                   5
2. Theory

We are interested in the reduced-form relationship between individual outcomes (e.g., switching

occupations or becoming unemployed) and trade in services. Let y denote the outcome, let d ln M

and d ln X denote the log changes in imports and exports of services, and let C denote an additional

set of controls. The reduced-form relationship of interest is



                                 y = α + γ M d ln M + γX d ln X + γC C + ε                                    (1)

where for expositional simplicity we use a linear probability specification. In this section we lay

out a simple theory that motivates the interpretation of (γ M ,γX ), the choice of C, the potential

for endogeneity, the sign of endogeneity bias, and the appropriate instruments. We first lay out

a partial equilibrium model of trade in tasks adapted from Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008)

and then embed it into a general equilibrium model of occupational choice from Ohnsorge and

Trefler (2007).


A. A Partial Equilibrium Model of Offshoring

There is a single industry Q and a continuum of tasks i ∈ [0,1]. Production of one unit of Q requires

a fixed amount of each and every task.7 Tasks are normalized so that a measure one of tasks is

needed to produce one unit of Q. Let L measure units of labour.8 A task requires a units of labour

if produced at home and a∗ units if produced abroad. Tasks are identical except in one dimension:

some are more easily offshored than others. In particular, a task that requires a units of labour

when produced at home requires a∗ βt(i ) units of labour when produced abroad. β is a measure of

the efficiency of the technology for offshoring. Tasks are ordered so that t(i ) is increasing in i. We

assume that t is differentiable, strictly increasing and strictly positive.

   Domestic and foreign wages are denoted by w and w∗ , respectively. Task i is done more cheaply

abroad than at home when w∗ a∗ βt(i ) < wa. We assume that some but not all tasks are offshored.

This ‘interior’ assumption and the fact that t is strictly increasing implies that there is a unique

I ∈ (0,1) given by

                                               w∗ a∗ βt( I ) = wa                                             (2)
  7 Adding  substitution possibilities across tasks provides no additional empirical insights.
  8 As detailed below, the number of units of labour supplied by a worker varies across workers (and indeed across
occupations for a given worker). Hence in the partial equilibrium we keep track of units of labour, not workers.



                                                        6
such that all tasks i < I are offshored and all tasks i > I are produced at home. Imports are the

measure of tasks imported:9

                                                       M ≡ IQ

   We assume that there is an upward-sloping supply of domestic labour to the industry, denoted

LS (w). We endogenize this supply function when we turn to the general equilibrium in subsection

C below. Since one unit of output requires one unit of each task, the demand for domestic labour

is L D = a (1 − I ) Q. Substituting I = M/Q into this yields


                                                  LD = a (Q − M)                                                    (3)


Foreign labour supply is assumed infinitely elastic at wage w∗ .

   The unit cost of task i is wa for i ∈ ( I,1] and w∗ a∗ βt(i ) for i ∈ [0,I ). With constant returns to

scale and free entry, price equals average cost. Hence10
                                                                     Z I
                                                               ∗ ∗
                                        p = wa(1 − I ) + w a β             t(i )di.                                 (4)
                                                                      0


   Let D ( p,δD ) and X ( p,δX ) be domestic demand and foreign demand (exports), respectively.

These are assumed to be downward sloping in price p. δD and δX are domestic and foreign demand

shifters, respectively. We close the partial equilibrium model with two equilibrium conditions.

The product market clearing condition is D + X = Q. The labour market clearing condition is

L D = LS = L. Our product and labour market equilibrium conditions together with M ≡ IQ and

equations (2)–(4) are six equations which determine the six endogeneous variables Q, L, I, M, w,

and p. The exogenous variables are w∗ , a∗ , a, β, δD , and δX .


B. Estimating Labour Demand when Imports are Endogenous

As a preliminary to estimating equation (1), consider estimating the impact of changes in imports

on changes in labour demand. Plugging Q = D + X into equation (3) and totally differentiating

yields

                            d ln L D = −θ M d ln M + θ X d ln X + θ D d ln D + d ln a                               (5)

         could equally work with (1) the measure of tasks imported inclusive of offshoring costs, 0 βt(i )diQ or (2) the
labour content of the measure of tasks imported, a∗ IQ. Our key points hold for these definitions as well.
   10 Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) use equations (2)–(4) to show that p < wa i.e., offshoring reduces price below

its autarchy level of wa. We will have nothing to say about this ‘productivity effect’.

                 where θ M , θ X , and θ D are all positive.11 In estimating equation (5), several possible sources of

                 endogeneity bias arise and the model provides a way of coherently classifying them. This is

                 the most important contribution of the partial equilibrium theory. In particular, the sign of the

                 endogeneity bias depends on the nature of the shock generating the change in imports. To establish

                 this we consider three shocks, a domestic demand shock (δD ), a foreign cost shock (w∗ a∗ ), and an

                 offshoring cost shock (β).

                    Domestic demand shock (δD ): Consider figure 1. The right panel plots demand and supply in

                 the domestic labour market. The left panel plots the demand for imports.12 Consider a positive

                 shock to domestic product demand (δD ). The resulting increase in Q shifts out both the M and

                 L D schedules in figure 1. There are then second-order effects as w, p, and I all rise. However, the

                 total effect is that both M and L D rise.13 It follows that a demand shock induces a non-causal positive

                 correlation between import changes d ln M and labour demand changes d ln L D . If one naively regressed

                 d ln L D on d ln M without any controls for demand shocks the OLS estimate would be less

                 negative than the ‘true’ coefficient i.e., the negative impact of imports would be underestimated.

                    Effective foreign wage shock (w∗ a∗ ): A decline in effective foreign wages w∗ a∗ is shown in the left

                 panel of figure 2 as a downward shift of the foreign labour supply schedule. Holding w and p
                    11 θ = M/ ( D + X − M ), θ = X/ ( D + X − M ), and θ = D/ ( D + X − M ) are shares. The fact that the coefficients
                         M                       X                          D
                 are shares is an artifact of the Leontief technology assumption. For more general technologies the coefficients also
                 depend on production-function parameters.
                    12 It is straightforward to prove that labour demand slopes down. L D = a (1 − I ) Q depends on w only via I. (We

                 are holding Q fixed in this labour-demand exercise.) From equation (2), I is increasing in w. Hence ∂L D /∂w =
                 − aQ(∂I/∂w) < 0. Likewise, import demand slopes down. M = IQ depends on w∗ via I and from equation (2), I
                 is decreasing in w∗ . Hence ∂M/∂w∗ = (∂I/∂w∗ ) Q < 0

             constant, the fall in w∗ makes offshoring more attractive (I falls) so that imports increase while

             domestic labour demand L D decreases.14 Now however, the change in L D is causally related to the

             change in M. This is because changes in w∗ a∗ have no direct impacts on domestic labour demand:

             changes in w∗ a∗ affect L D only via changes in imports. This can be seen from the fact that w∗ and a∗

             only appear in equation (2). Thus, when effective foreign wages are the source of import shocks,

             OLS produces an unbiased estimate of the impact of imports on switching. Another way of

             saying the same thing is that d ln w∗ a∗ is a valid instrument for d ln M in a regression of d ln L D on

             d ln M.

                 Offshoring cost shock (β): Since β and w∗ a∗ always appear together (w∗ a∗ β in equation 2), the

             analysis of changes in w∗ a∗ should carry over to changes in β. This is not the case. In particular,

             d ln β is not a valid instrument. When β falls, offshoring becomes more attractive and tasks are

             moved from the domestic economy to the foreign economy. This is shown in figure 3. The rise

             in β raises I directly (equation 2) which in turn raises M ≡ IQ and, via M, indirectly raises L D

             (equation 3). The problem with this analysis is that the recent reductions in offshoring costs β

             were driven by innovations in information and communications technologies (ICTs), innovations

             that are associated with skill-biased technical change and that have famously had independent

             impacts on U.S. labour markets e.g., Katz and Murphy (1992). The most natural way to model

             these independent impacts is by treating ICT innovations as labour demand shifters i.e., ICT
               14 There will be second-order effects as w and p adjust. Appendix equation (29) shows that M must rise. Appendix

             equation (32) shows that L D can rise or fall.

             improvements directly raise the demand for skilled labour.15 Mathematically, we would introduce

             β and d ln β directly into equations (3) and (5), respectively. But this is exactly how a and d ln a

             already appear in equations (3) and (5). Thus, ICT innovations are easily introduced into the model

             by reinterpreting a as depending on ICTs.

                  Adopting this approach, the direct impact of ICT innovations is illustrated in the right panel

             of figure 3, which is here taken to represent the market for skilled labour. The innovations raise

             the demand for skilled domestic labour. Since the change in L D is now smaller, an OLS regression

             of d ln L D on d ln M will not produce a causal estimate. When ICT innovations are the source of

             import shocks, OLS will under-estimate the negative impact of imports on skilled labour. The

             solution to this problem is easy. ICT-based measures of d ln β should not be used as instruments;

             rather, such measures should be the empirical counterpart to d ln a and thus included directly in

             the second-stage equation (5).

                  To summarize, a regression of d ln L D on d ln M without controls for demand and ICT shocks

             produces OLS estimates that are biased towards zero. One solution implied by the theory is to

             instrument d ln M by changes in effective foreign wages d ln w∗ a∗ . Another solution is to include

             demand and ICT shocks (d ln D and d ln a) directly into the second-stage equation (5). We will find

             empirically that when demand and ICT shocks are included, the IV estimates are only modestly

             larger (in absolute value) than the OLS estimates and the differences are not statistically significant.
                 15 We focus on skilled labour because, as shown in online appendix table B.2, offshorable jobs are highly skill-intensive.

C. The Offshoring of Tasks in General Equilibrium: Worker Sorting

We turn now to the occupational choices of workers. Let k = 1, . . . K index occupations. We

assume that there are K products or industries and each is produced using a unique occupation.

As in Ventura (1997), this eliminates a useless layer of complexity. All the industry-level partial

equilibrium variables now require k subscripts e.g., wages per unit of labour wk and the supply of

units of labour LSk (wk ).

   Workers are heterogeneous. Following Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007), each worker is endowed

with a pair of attributes ( H,U ) ∈ R2+ that is used to produce tasks according to Fk ( H,U ) =

H φk U 1−φk . Fk is measured in units of task. We need two attributes so that we can discuss the

endogenous selection of workers across occupations based both on observables (Human capital)

and Unobservables. In this setup our key assumption is the Roy (1951) assumption that the Fk vary

across occupations. The assumption of constant returns to scale simplifies the sorting rule while

the Cobb-Douglas (log-linearity) assumption can be dispensed with. We label occupations so that

φk is increasing in k i.e., φk > φk−1 for all k. This is a labelling convention, not an assumption.

   In what follows it will be easier to work with the transformed attributes h ≡ ln H and u ≡ ln U.

Let f k (h,u) ≡ Fk ( H,U ) be the output of tasks in (h,u) space. Then f k (0,0) = Fk (1,1) = 1 i.e., a

type-(0,0) worker supplies one unit of labour. H and U will not be seen again in this paper. We

assume that there is a unit mass of workers in the economy and that the distribution of worker

types is described by a continuous density function g(h,u).

   Workers in occupation k can produce any of the continuum of tasks i ∈ [0,1] required to produce

good k. Since workers are perfectly substitutable in the production of tasks, in order to know the

supply of tasks it is enough to know the supply of units of labour i.e., one does not need to know

how these units are distributed across worker types. We therefore turn to the supply of units of

labour LSk (wk ).

   From the partial equilibrium model, the cost and hence earnings of a unit of labour is wk . A

worker is paid the value of her marginal product (equal to her average product). Let Wk (h,u) be

the earnings of a type-(h,u) worker in occupation k . A type-(0,0) worker supplies one unit of

labour and earns Wk (0,0) = wk . A type-(h,u) worker supplies f k (h,u) units of labour and earns

or, since ln f k (h,u) = φk h + (1 − φk )u = φk (h − u) + u,


                                                                  ln Wk (h,u) = ln wk + φk (h − u) + u.                             (6)


Equation (6) establishes that the entire occupation-k earnings schedule Wk (·,·) is pinned down by

the wk from the partial equilibrium trade-in-tasks model.

   A type-(h,u) worker chooses the occupation k that maximizes ln Wk (h,u) of equation (6). Figure

4 characterizes the sorting rule. It plots ln Wk (h,u) against s ≡ h − u. There are three solid lines,

which correspond to occupations k − 1, k, and k + 1. The slopes are given by the φk and are thus

increasing in k.16 The sorting rule is fully characterized by the values of s at which the lines cross.

Using equation (6), these crossing points are:

                                                                    ln(wk−1 /wk )                 ln(wk /wk+1 )

                                                                      φk − φk−1                     φk+1 − φk

A type-(h,u) worker chooses occupation k if and only if sk−1 < h − u < sk .17

   To calculate the mass or units of labour that are supplied to occupation k, note that the workers

selecting into k satisfy sk−1 < h − u < sk or h − sk < u < h − sk−1 or, from equation (7), h −
  16 That is, ∂ ln W /∂s is increasing in k. This is the familiar single-crossing or supermodularity property used for

assortative matching.
  17 Without loss of generality we assume that there is positive employment in all occupations. It is then straightforward

to show that in equilibrium (a) sk−1 < sk for all k and (b) in the interval (sk−1 ,sk ), there is no occupation k0 (k0 6= k) whose
earnings profile lies above that of occupation k.


                                                                                     12

A fall in wk is shown in figure 4 as the dashed line. It shifts the boundaries sk−1 and sk inwards,

that is, it reduces the number of workers who choose occupation k. More formally, by inspection

of equation (8), LSk is increasing in wk . Thus, we have endogenously derived the upward-sloping

supply function LSk (wk ) used in the partial equilibrium analysis. In its derivation, we have built on

insights by (Mussa, 1982, section 4).

   The sorting of workers across occupations/industries is the key general equilibrium result that

we will exploit in our empirical work. Since we will not be exploiting empirically any other

feature of general equilibrium — notably the determination of foreign wages wk∗ or income effects

operating through the trade balance — we relegate a complete specification of the model and the

definition of general equilibrium to appendix 2.


D. Implications for the Estimation of Occupational Switching

In this section we derive the probability of switching up and down in response to shocks. These

probabilities are our estimating equations. Consider an occupation-k shock that lowers wk , as in

figure 4. We wish to know the probability that a worker switches out of occupation k given that

u is not observed by the econometrician. Let Gu|h (u | h) be the cumulative distribution function

for the distribution of u conditional on h. Then the probability of switching down, conditional on

observables h, is18
                                                                                                      
                                                                        d ln wk−1    d ln wk
                 Pk−   ≡ Gu|h (h − sk−1 | h) − Gu|h        h − s k −1 −           +           |h                       (9)
                                                                        φk − φk−1   φk − φk−1

Throughout, ‘−’ and‘ +’ superscripts refer to switching down and up, respectively.

   We linearize this expression in order to derive our estimating equation. In the expression for

Pk− , the term h − sk−1 appears twice and is identified only off of the curvature of Gu|h .19 Hence,

the term is too subtle for our empirical work and is ignored.20 We are interested in the effects of a

shock that originates in occupation k. Its first-order effects are felt in occupation k (d ln wk 6= 0) and
  18 To  derive this equation note that workers who switch down satisfy sk−1 < h − u < sk−1 + dsk−1 or, conditioning on
h, h − sk−1 − dsk−1 < u < h − sk−1 . Using equation (7), we define dsk−1 ≡ d ln wk−1 /(φk − φk−1 ) − d ln wk /(φk − φk−1 ),
from which the equation follows.
   19 For example, if u | h is uniformly distributed so that G
                                                              u|h is linear, then the two h − sk −1 terms cancel.
  20 This is a manifestation of a more general point by Heckman and Honoré (1990) about the sensitivity of the predic-
tions of the Roy model to curvature.

we temporarily ignore its second-order effects on all other industries (d ln wk−1 = d ln wk+1 = 0).21

With these assumptions, the linearization of Pk− in equation (9) is

                                           Pk− = θ0− + γh− h − θw− d ln wk                                          (10)

where θw− > 0.22

   Setting LSk (wk ) = LkD , defining the elasticity of labour supply ηkS ≡ ∂ ln LSk (wk )/∂ ln wk > 0, and

using equation (5) we have

             d ln wk = (ηkS )−1 d ln LkD = (ηkS )−1 [−θ M d ln M + θ X d ln X + θ D d ln D + d ln a] .              (11)

Plugging this into equation (10) yields our switching-down estimating equation:

                       Pk− = θ0− + γh− h + θ −            −            −            −

where θ −     − −             −
        M , θ X , θ D , and θ a are all positive.
                                                 23


   By a symmetric argument, our switching-up estimating equation is:

                       Pk+ = θ0+ + γh+ h + θ +            +            +            +
                                             M d ln M − θ X d ln X − θ D d ln D − θ a d ln a                        (13)

where θ +     + +             +
        M , θ X , θ D , and θ a are all positive.
                                                 24


   We have not yet discussed the signs of γh+ and γh− . Pk+ and Pk− depend on h in two ways. The

first, already mentioned, operates through the curvature of Gu|h , and cannot be signed without

strong functional-form assumptions.25 The second operates via the conditioning statement u|h. Its

sign depends on the correlation between h and u or equivalently, on the correlation between h and

s = h − u.26 Suppose that h and s are positively correlated and consider two workers who initially

choose k. The worker with the higher h has a higher s probabilistically. Hence, the high-h worker
  21 We  have extensively explored ways of introducing d ln wk−1 and d ln wk+1 into our empirical work but have
found nothing of interest. This is discussed in our section on sensitivity analysis where d ln wk−1 and d ln wk+1 are
re-introduced.

  24 Proof: From figure 4,the probability of switching up is the probability that u satisfies sk + dsk < h − u < sk or
h − sk < u < h − sk − dsk where dsk ≡ d ln wk /(φk+1 − φk ) − d ln wk+1 /(φk+1 − φk ). Hence,

Applying the discussion surrounding equations (10)–(12) to this equation yields equation (13).
  25 Again, this is a manifestation of the point about curvature in Heckman and Honoré (1990).
  26 The importance of the sign of this correlation has been fully discussed in the Roy literature and the case where the

correlation is positive is what Heckman and Honoré (1990, page 1126) call the ‘standard’ case. This correlation features
prominently in Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007).

is less likely to be in the switching-down interval (sk−1 ,sk−1 + dsk−1 ) and more likely to be in the

switching-up interval (sk + dsk ,sk ). That is, γh− < 0 < γh+ .

   Stepping outside of the model, education may lead to an occupational license (e.g., a law degree)

and hence to less switching. Criscuolo and Garicano (2010) show this to be empirically important

in an offshoring context. This consideration implies that both γh− and γh+ will be negative. How-

ever, it will remain true that γh− < γh+ . This is a feature of sorting models that has not previously

been exploited to our knowledge. It will be a feature of our empirical findings.

   Finally, the implications of the model for earnings will be developed below, in section 7.


3. Data

A. U.S. International Trade in White Collar Services

We use the official U.S. balance of payments data, which documents cross-border service trans-

actions. See Borga and Mann (2004) for data details. In these data, imports are international

transactions involving the sale of a foreign-produced service to a U.S. party. Conversely, exports

are international transactions involving the sale of a U.S.-produced service to a foreign party. As

is standard in the offshoring literature, we only consider services within the BEA category “other

private services.” These are the 10 services listed in table 2. We henceforth refer to these as tradable

white collar services.

   The balance of payments data report bilateral trade flows by service category only for the larger

U.S. trading partners. Among developing countries, India and China are by far the largest and also

the most interesting. As we shall see, including the other low-wage countries for which we have

bilateral trade data makes no difference to our estimates. See row 2 of table 13 below. Following

the suggestion in Feenstra, Lipsey, Deng, Ma and Mo (2005), we include Hong Kong in the Chinese

data.

   We use trade data for the period 1995-2005. 1995 is a good starting date both because it comes

during the early years of the Chinese and Indian liberalizations and because U.S. service trade with

these two countries was at low levels then.27 We stop in 2005 because of a structural break in the

balance of payments data.
  27 Offshoring of services to India came to prominence during the Y2K scare of the late 1990s. China became a major
player in service trade only more recently.




                                                        15
   Trade in white collar services is large, but not nearly as large as trade in manufactures. However,

this is partly an artifact of measurement: merchandise trade data measure sales whereas service

data primarily measure value added. Using U.S. input-output tables, we calculate that in 2002 the

value added embodied in service trade was already 21% of that in manufacturing trade. Also, the

growth of tradable services far outstripped that of manufacturing. Between 1995 and 2005, white

collar service trade grew almost exactly log linearly at 0.15 log points a year for exports and 0.14

log points for imports. See online appendix figure B.2. Thus, tradable white collar services is a

significant new development.

   Table 2 provides some basic statistics on white collar service trade. Columns 1–2 report the

average annual log change in U.S. imports over the 1995–2005 period for China plus India and for

the richest countries (the G8, excluding Russia). Columns 3–4 report the corresponding growth

rates of U.S. exports. Two features of the table stand out. First, U.S. imports from China and

India have been growing spectacularly in some sectors e.g., averaging 0.36 log points per year

over 10 years in computer and information services. Second, columns 1 and 2 are correlated, but

the correlation is far from perfect. (Likewise for columns 3 and 4.) This means that the factors

driving rich-country service trade growth are not the same as those driving Sino-Indian service

trade growth. While ICT improvements (d ln β) are an important driver of rich-country trade

growth, Sino-Indian trade growth is in addition driven (1) by economic reforms that have raised

productivity (d ln(1/a∗ )) and (2) by increased openness that has improved access to their low-wage

labour (d ln w∗ ). The exogeneity of these two factors feeds into our identification strategy.


B. Matched CPS Data

We match individuals across consecutive March CPS surveys from 1996 to 2007 in order to extract

longitudinal information about work histories. We start the matching procedure by extracting the

subsample of all civilian adults who were surveyed in March of year t. We then apply Madrian and

Lefgren’s (2000) two-stage matching algorithm to find a match in the March survey of year t + 1. In

the first or ‘naive’ stage, individuals are matched based on three variables: a household identifier,

a household number, and an individual line number within a household. If all three variables are

the same in two consecutive March surveys then a naive match is made. In the second stage, a

naive match is discarded if it fails the ‘S|R|A’ merge criterion i.e., if in the two consecutive March

surveys the individual’s sex changes, the individual’s race changes, or the individual’s age changes


                                                  16
inappropriately.28 The naive and final match rates for each year appear in online appendix table

B.1. Averaging across all years, the naive match rate is 66%, the S|R|A discard rate is 5%, and

the final match rate is 63% (0.66×(1 − 0.05) = 0.63). Note that for 2001–2007 we also discard

oversamples in the State Children Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) extended sample files. Our

final match rate is similar to the rates of 62% in Goldberg and Tracy (2003) and 67% in Madrian

and Lefgren (2000) .

   Since the actual match rate is lower than the match rate of 100% that would obtain in the

absence of mortality, migration, non-response and recording errors, there is obviously a selection

issue associated with using matched CPS data. Neumark and Kawaguchi (2004) partly dispel this

selection concern by comparing the estimation results based on matched CPS data to results based

on the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) which follows individuals who move.

Nevertheless, in section 9.A below we explicitly model selection out of our matched sample. This

has no effect on our conclusions.


C. Linking CPS Data to Service Trade Data

Using CPS data on workers’ occupations, each worker in the CPS sample can be linked to one of

the 10 BEA white collar service sectors of table 2. We do this in two steps. First, we manually map

occupation codes into BEA service codes. By way of examples, the occupation ‘Computer scientists

and systems analysts’ is mapped into the service ‘Computer and information services’ and the

occupation ‘Financial analysts’ is mapped into the service ‘Finance.’ In contrast, ‘Taxi drivers and

chauffeurs’ does not match into any of the 10 BEA codes and so is classified as a non-tradable

occupation. Where there is any doubt about the mapping we rely on (i) the detailed descriptions

of each CPS occupation that appear in the 2000 SOC manual and (ii) the detailed information about

the coverage of each type of BEA service trade from Borga and Mann (2004) and U.S. Department

of Commerce (1998). The mapping appears in online appendix table B.3.

   In the second stage, which turns out to be unimportant empirically, we apply Blinder’s (2007)

Offshorability Index to those occupations that were matched to one of the 10 BEA white collar

services. For example, insurance sales agents are mapped into the insurance service, but it is

unlikely that such a sales occupation will be offshored. Blinder’s index is constructed as follows.
  28 FollowingMadrian and Lefgren (2000) , an inappropriate age change is less than -1 or more than 3. See Madrian
and Lefgren (2000) for more detailed information about the matching algorithm.




                                                       17
For each occupation, Blinder examines the answers to two O*NET questions: “Must the job be

physically close to a specific U.S. work location?” and (ii) “Must the job unit be at a U.S. location?”

Based on the answers, Blinder subjectively assigns the occupation a number between 0 and 100. In

our insurance example, sales must be done in a U.S. location so that the Blinder index is 0 and sales

are deemed not offshorable. We assume that an occupation is tradable if its Blinder Offshorability

Index exceeds 50.

   To summarize, a white collar service occupation is deemed tradable if (1) it can be linked to one

of our 10 BEA white collar services and (2) it is offshorable in Blinder’s sense. It turns out that the

Blinder offshorability criterion is not important for our results: we obtain similar results when the

criterion is not used. See row 5 of table 13 below.

   We have 172,994 workers in our matched CPS sample. 105,751 of these are in private white collar

service occupations (Census major occupation codes 1, 2, 4, and 5). 38,719 of these 105,751 workers

are in tradable white collar services i.e., in services that meet our two criteria. The remaining 67,032

workers (= 105,751 − 38,719) are in non-tradable white collar services.

   In our sample, 22% of all workers are in tradable white collar service occupations (0.22 =

38,719/172,994). This is reassuringly comparable to what has been found elsewhere.29 Also note

that 49.4% of workers in the tradable-occupations sample completed a college degree, so this is a

very educated group. See online appendix table B.2.

   Table 3 may help the reader to better understand the mapping between BEA trade flows and

CPS data. For each industry, the table reports the share of workers who are engaged in a tradable

white collar service occupation. For example, 24% of workers in manufacturing are in tradable

white collar service occupations. It may surprise the reader that manufacturing jobs are in our

sample. However, many workers in manufacturing are service providers e.g., computer program-

mers and accountants. Thus, while we are only considering CPS workers in tradable white collar

service occupations, these workers appear throughout all industries in the economy.
  29 Blinder (2007) estimates that 22% of U.S. employment is potentially offshorable. van Welsum and Vickery (2005)

estimate that 20% of U.S. jobs are exposed to service offshoring. Jensen and Kletzer (2002) argue that a service-based
occupation is offshorable if within the United States it is highly concentrated geographically. They find that about 28%
of U.S. employment is offshorable. These estimates are very similar to our own estimate of 22%.

4. Variable Definitions and a Simple Difference-in-Differences Analysis

Before presenting our regression-based estimates of the impact of white collar service trade, we

present a simple difference-in-differences analysis that compares the labour market outcomes of

workers in tradable versus non-tradable white collar service occupations.

   The theory requires us to distinguish between switching up and switching down. As discussed

in the introduction, we therefore need to calculate inter-occupational wage differentials (IOWDs).

We do this as follows. Using the 1996-2007 unmatched CPS data (N = 295,082), we regress

a worker’s earnings on her observed worker characteristics (education, experience, experience

squared, marital status, sex, race, and state of residence), year fixed effects, and 4-digit COC

occupation fixed effects. The latter are the inter-occupational wage differentials.

   We will need to define occupational switching. Consider a worker who is matched across two

consecutive March CPS surveys. In both March surveys the worker is asked about her occupation

in the longest job held in the last calendar year. For example, a worker surveyed in March of 2001 is

describing her occupation in the longest job held in 2000. Since we will have to match the CPS data

with calendar-year data from the BEA, we refer to data reported in the March 2001 survey as 2000

data. More generally, data relating to the longest job held last year that comes from the March CPS

of year t will be referred to as data from year t − 1. Applying this to the 1996–2007 March surveys,

we have workers who switched between 1995–1996, between 1996–1997, etc. until 2005–2006. That

is, we have 11 years of switching.

   A worker is a 4-digit occupational switcher if in the two March surveys her occupation in the

longest job held last year changes.30 This raw switching rate is known to be noisy. We thus filter it

as suggested by Moscarini and Thomsson (2006). To be a valid switch, the worker must also have

changed her CPS class or looked for a job last year. See appendix 3.A for details. Our occupational

switching rates at the 1- and 2-digit levels are 0.17 and 0.20, respectively. These are similar to the

corresponding 0.16 and 0.18 rates reported in the more careful, PSID-based study by Kambourov

and Manovskii (2008) who use 1996 PSID data.31                32   In our baseline results, we focus on 4-digit

occupational switching because it gives us the most refined definition of an occupation (especially
  30 Note that a worker can only be a switcher if she worked in both years. We will come to unemployment later.
  31 Note that while switching rates calculated from the CPS are upward biased, it is essential to remember that we
are not interested in switching rates, but in how switching rates change in response to trade shocks. We do not expect
changes in occupation miscoding to vary systematically with changes in trade shocks.
  32 We are indebted to Gueorgui Kambourov for help with defining occupational switching.




                                                         19
in services jobs). We also report 2-digit switching results in row 12 of table 13 below.

   The first row of table 4 deals with workers who switched down, that is, who switched to an

occupation with a lower IOWD. In the first column we pool workers who switched between 1995

and 1996 and workers who switched between 1996 and 1997. We then look only at the subset of

these workers who were in tradable service occupations. 19.4% of these workers switched to an

occupation with a lower IOWD. The remaining columns repeat this exercise for workers in other

pairs of years. Looking across columns in row 1, there is a slight upward trend in switching rates.

This may mean that import competition led to more switching. However, switching rates were

also rising in non-tradable services. In the ‘Tradable – Non-tradable’ row we report the difference

in switching rates between tradables and non-tradables. In the years 1995 and 1996, switching was

2.0 percentage points higher in tradables and, a decade later in 2004–2005, this gap was virtually

unchanged (2.2 percentage points). We conclude from this that the surge of imports in tradable

occupations had no effect on downward switching rates. From the second set of results in table 4,

the same applies to workers who switched up into occupations with higher IOWDs.

   The third set of results in table 4 deals with transitions from employment to unemployment.33

Transitions into unemployment fell over time in tradable services, but fell faster in non-tradable

services so that the difference rose by 0.3 percentage points (from 0.0% to 0.3%). That is, transi-

tions into unemployment rose in tradables relative to non-tradables. This rise in unemployment

transitions is economically large; however, it is not statistically significant (t = 1.10).

   The fourth set of results in table 4 deals with earnings. Annual earnings are defined as CPI-

deflated annual income from wages and salaries. Earnings rose faster in tradables than in non-

tradables. Non-tradables paid 3.2% more in the initial period, but 3.2% less in the last period, a

statistically significant 6.4% improvement in tradable earnings relative to non-tradable earnings.

As discussed below, the theory is clear that it is best to look at earnings changes and these results

appear in the last three blocks of table 4. Relative to non-tradables, stayers in tradables did very

well, an improvement in annual earnings growth of 3.2% [= 1.8% – (–1.5%)]. In contrast, downward

switchers did worse (though not statistically so) and, somewhat puzzlingly, upward switchers did
  33 As in Murphy and Topel (1987), we operationalize this as follows. A worker is employed in the first of her two CPS

years if she was a full-year worker (i.e., worked at least 50 weeks last year) or she was a part-year worker (i.e., worked
between 1 and 49 weeks) who neither looked for a job last year nor was laid off. A worker is unemployed in the second
of her two CPS years if the worker never had a job in the past year or was a part-year worker who either looked for a
job or was laid off. Below we also discuss alternative definitions of both unemployment. These all yield very similar
conclusions.




                                                           20
much worse.

   Many studies of the impact of service trade have failed to use any trade data. Instead, they

rely on a division of services into tradables and non-tradables. Using this division, we fail to find

any negative impacts of rising service tradability on occupational switching or earnings. (The one

exception is upward switchers.) We turn to an analysis that actually uses trade data.


5. An Econometric Analysis of Occupational Switching

In this section we estimate our theory-based switching-down and switching-up equations (equa-

tions 12 and 13). In our regression setting, each observation will correspond to a unique individual

i. For an individual whose first of two March CPS surveys is in year t+1, let k be her occupation in
                                                 −
the longest job held last year (year t) and let yikt equal 1 if the worker switched down between t and
                                                                +
t + 1 and 0 if the worker did not switch. Correspondingly, let yikt equal 1 if the worker switched

up and 0 if the worker did not switch. These are our dependent variables.

   Our section 3.C ‘crosswalk’ allows us to link each occupation k with a BEA service sector. Equa-

tions (12) and (13) require four variables at the service sector level: U.S. imports from China and

India (Mkt ), U.S. exports to China and India (Xkt ), domestic demand or sales (Dkt ), and technology

(ICTkt ). Dkt is defined as total sales less exports. ICTkt is defined as the share of investment in

ICT equipment and software divided by total equipment and software investment. This measure

is used by Bartel and Sicherman (2005). Data sources are described in appendix 3. Since many

individuals share the same occupation, the Mkt , Xkt , Dkt and ICTkt are repeated across individuals.

We therefore cluster standard errors by occupation and year.

   Column 1 of table 5 reports OLS estimates of our switching-down equation (equation 12). The

sample is the set of workers in white collar service occupations that either switched down or were
                                                 −
occupational stayers. The dependent variable is yikt . The regression includes the listed individual

characteristics such as education, as well as state and year fixed effects. The sector-level regressors

are the annual log changes in Mkt , Xkt , Dkt , and ICTkt . We lag these changes by one year e.g.,

ln Mkt − ln Mk,t−1 . The coefficients on imports and exports are statistically significant and have the

expected signs.

   The two rows in table 5 that appear in italics translate the coefficients on imports and exports

into economically meaningful magnitudes. Recall from table 2 that the most dynamic — and

threatening — sector for service offshoring to China and India is in business, professional and

                                                  21
technical services where for the last decade imports and exports have been growing annually by

0.18 and 0.15 log points, respectively. We therefore multiply the import coefficient by 0.18 to obtain

0.007 (= 0.18×0.039) and the export coefficient by 0.15 to obtain –0.013 (= 0.15×(–0.084)). This

means that over the past decade U.S. service imports from China and India have increased the

incidence of downward switching by 0.7 percentage points, from 20% to 20.7%, while U.S. service

exports to China and India have reduced the incidence of downward switching by 1.3 percentage

points. The net effect of imports and exports is thus a reduction in switching of 0.6 (= 1.3 – 0.7)

percentage points.

   The sample includes workers who are in both tradable and non-tradable white collar service

occupations. For those in non-tradable occupations, the log change in imports and exports have

been set to 0 and a dummy for being in a non-tradable occupation has been added (I NT ). The

logic for including workers in the non-tradable sector is identical to that which motivated our

difference-in-differences analysis of table 4. Specifically, in column 1 we interact I NT with year-pair

dummies.34 As in table 4, a negative coefficient on an interaction term means that the average

switching rate in non-tradables has declined relative to tradables. Given the rapid rise of service

trade, we expect negative estimates of the interaction terms. In fact, they are all statistically

insignificant and slightly positive. Thus, rising service trade has not led to more occupational

switching in tradables relative to non-tradables. This result is rock solid and holds for the many

specifications and dependent variables reviewed in this paper.

   Column 1 has imbedded in it a large number of specification choices. Many of these choices do

no matter; a few matter a lot. Section 9 below reports on an extensive set of alternative specifica-

tions that imply very similar conclusions to those in table 5. To give the reader a quick preview of

section 9, the statistically significant downward switching effects of rising imports from China and

India appear even when the following specification changes are made. (1) Use contemporaneous

import changes rather than lagged import changes. (2) Restrict the sample to consist only of those

workers in tradable occupations. (3) Use a probit or logit specification. (4) Estimate a multinomial

logit with four choices: stay, switch up, switch down, or transition into unemployment. (5) Include

U.S. imports from other poor countries. (6) The most obvious alternative specification is one that

includes two additional regressions, the log change in imports and the log change in exports from
  34 We use dummies for pairs of years rather than for individual years both to save space in the tables and to increase

the precision of the estimates of the interaction terms.

G8 partners of the United States. As shown in table 12 below, adding these does not alter our

conclusions. For example, with G8 import and export regressors added, the coefficient on imports

in column 1 of table 5 becomes 0.040 (from 0.039) and the coefficient on exports becomes -0.092

(from -0.084).

   In contrast to this robustness, there is one specification choice that is terribly important. In

column 1, Mkt , Xkt , Dkt and ICTkt are in annual log changes. Yet it may be that worker switching

decisions and/or firm firing decisions are determined by longer-run changes in these variables.

It turns out that our results are very sensitive to the choice of lag length. To see the source of

the sensitivity, consider figure 5. The left panel plots ln Mkt for two service sectors, Computer

and Information Services (solid line) and Construction, Architectural and Engineering Services

(dashed line). The former has been trending up steadily while the latter has stayed at a low level

for most of our period. Clearly, Computer and Information Services is the more trade-impacted of

the two sectors. Yet the right panel of figure 5, which displays ln Mkt in annual changes, paints a

very different picture: the two sectors appear as equally impacted. The very significant difference

in trends up to 2003 is not apparent at all and has been swamped by high-frequency variation. This

is a pervasive feature of our data. The sectors with the lowest levels of imports tend to have very

large annual changes. The same is true for exports.

   For any lag length l, let (ln Mkt − ln Mk,t−l )/l be the l-year average annual log change in


                                                                              23
imports. In columns 2–4 of table 5, we report results with Mkt , Xkt , Dkt and ICTkt appearing as 3-,

5-, and 7-year average annual log changes. The impact of imports increases with the lag length: at

7 years, we estimate that rising Sino-Indian imports increased the incidence of switching down by

3.9 percentage points. A key argument for focussing on longer lags is apparent from the coefficient

on ICTkt . The ICT coefficient only becomes statistically significant at longer lag lengths, which

means that skill-biased technical change and hence service trade take time for their effects to be

felt.

   The theory is not silent on the lag length. The longer the lag, the more likely that the change

in imports is a sector characteristic and hence the more likely it is that imports are correlated with

unobserved worker characteristics. In column 5 of table 5 we deal with this by introducing the

Mkt , Xkt , Dkt and ICTkt in log levels and adding BEA-level sector fixed effects. The interpretation

is that we are now looking at long-run deviations of ln Mkt , ln Xkt , ln Dkt and ln ICTkt from their

sector means. We refer to this as the ‘level fixed effects’ specification.

   Coefficient magnitudes for the four service characteristics are not comparable across the log

change and level fixed effect specifications. For comparability one must multiply the latter coef-

ficients by 10 e.g., the column 4 import coefficient of 0.215 should be compared to the column 5

import coefficient times 10 so that 0.215 is compared to 0.19. Comparing the 7-year change results

to the level fixed effect results (columns 4 and 5), two very general conclusions emerge. First,

import coefficients are very similar across the two specifications. Second, the export coefficient

is not statistically significant in the level fixed effect specification. These two conclusions appear

throughout the paper.

   Turning to the economic size of the level fixed effect specification, the magnitudes in italics are

the import coefficient times 0.18×10 and the export coefficient times 0.15×10. The most important

conclusion from table 5 is the economic impact of imports. From the level fixed effect specification

(our preferred specification), 10 years of service offshoring to China and India has increased

downward occupational switching by 3.4 percentage points, from 20% to 23.4%. This is a 17%

increase and represents a large effect.

   Another way of thinking about magnitudes is to compare the results above with comparable

results for manufacturing. Following Ebenstein et al. (2011), we create occupation-specific trade

variables that measures the degree of occupational exposure to manufacturing trade with China

and India. Details appear in appendix 3.B. We then link this occupational exposure measure to


                                                   24
each CPS worker using the worker’s occupation in the longest job held last year (as answered in

the first of the worker’s two March CPS responses). The results appear in columns 10 and column

11 of table 5. The specifications in columns 1 and 10 (or 5 and 11) differ only in terms of the sample

of workers and the definition of imports and exports (i.e., imports and exports of services versus

occupational exposure to manufacturing imports and exports). Based on column 11, the import

coefficient is 0.036. Since manufacturing imports from China and India have grown by about 15%

a year, this implies a 5.3% increase in switching down. We conclude from this that manufacturing

has been harder hit than services by imports from China and India. We also conclude that our

specification has a degree of ‘external validity’ in that it yields sensible results when applied to a

very different data set.


A. Switching Up

We next turn to estimates of the switching-up equation (13). Table 6 repeats the exercise of table 5,

but for the sample of workers that either switched up or stayed. The dependent variable equals 1

if the worker switched up and 0 if the worker stayed. The results are now much less significant.

In our baseline level fixed effect specification (column 5), the decadal impact of service imports

from China and India is 0.7 percentage points. However, it is economically small and statistically

insignificant.

   A prediciton of the theory is that the coefficient on schooling is more negative for those that

switch down than for those that switch up. Comparing column 1 in tables 5 and 6, the schooling

coefficient is –0.13 for downward switchers and –0.008 for upward switchers. The difference of

–0.005 is economically large and statistically significant (χ21 = 15.11, p <.0001). The corresponding

numbers for the fixed effect specification (column 5) is even more dramatic, –0.014 for downward

switchers and 0.000 for upward switchers. The difference of –0.014 is very significant (χ21 = 93.11,

p <.0001). This suggests that sorting is indeed an important feature of the data.


B. Transitions to Unemployment

Table 7 reports results using transitions to unemployment as a binary dependent variable. The

precise definition of unemployment appears in footnote 33 above. The sample consists of workers

who experienced no unemployment during the first of their two CPS years. The estimates are

sensitive to the choice of lag length. In our baseline level fixed effects specification (column


                                                 25
5), imports from China and India raised transitions to unemployment by 0.9 percentage points,

from 3.8% to 4.7%. This is a large impact. The impact of manufacturing imports from China and

India is even larger: From column 11, these imports increased the probability of transitioning into

unemployment by 1.6 percentage points.

   As shown in section 9, we estimate somewhat smaller unemployment impacts when measuring

these as the change in weeks unemployed relative to weeks in the labour force. See row 13 of table

13 below. We also find that service imports from China and India reduced the number of weeks

worked by one-third of a week. See row 14 of table 13 below. Summarizing, service imports has

had consequential impacts on unemployment.


6. Instrumental Variables

Imports and exports are endogenous. In presenting the partial equilibrium model we discussed
     ∗ a∗ is an instrument for imports. We did not, however, discuss an instrument for exports.
how wkt kt

An increase in Sino-Indian income raises Sino-Indian demand for U.S. exports Xkt and thus serves

as an instrument. Unfortunately, the elasticity of Xkt with respect to Sino-Indian income varies

by sector k. We could deal with this by interacting a measure of Sino-Indian GDP with a set of

sectoral dummies. However, this would lead to a proliferation of instruments and the familiar

weak instruments problem (e.g. Staiger and Stock, 1997). We thus estimate export elasticities by

sector from an external data source. Using U.S. exports to 28 countries over the 1995–2005 period,

we estimate a gravity equation separately for each of our 10 service sectors.35 Specifically, let Xckt

be U.S. exports to country c in sector k in year t, let Yct be GDP, and let Lct be population. We

regress ln Xckt on ln Yct /Lct , ln Lct , and country fixed effects. The fixed effects ensure that we are

estimating the effect of rising income, which is what the model requires, and not estimating the

effect of cross-country differences in income. The gravity estimates by sector appear in appendix

table A.1.

   To understand how we translate the gravity estimates into instruments, consider the case where

the coefficient on log population is set to zero. Then the estimated elasticity of exports with respect

to income (η̂kX ) is just the OLS estimate of the coefficient on ln Yct /Lct . In the level fixed effects
  35 Thechoice of countries is determined by the availability of disaggregated BEA data and, in order to avoid contami-
nating our instrument with Sino-Indian import data, we omit China and India.

   Turning to the endogeneity of imports, we proxy wkt kt

outlined above for exports can be repeated for imports. First, we estimate gravity equations for

U.S. imports in order to obtain import elasticities η̂kM . See appendix table A.1. Second, in equations

(14)–(15) we replace the η̂kX with η̂kM in order to build an instrument Zkt
                                                                         M.

              M 6 = Z X only because η̂ M 6 = η̂ X . Since the η̂ M and η̂ X are not all that much different

from one another, it is advisable to find another instrument. Fortunately, this is easy. While the

model allows for only one foreign country (China-India), in practice we can build an instrument

by combining the gravity estimates η̂kX and η̂kM with GDP per capita from the G8 countries (less the

United States and Russia). Let YtR /LtR be the gravity-consistent aggregator of the GDP per capitas

of these countries. Then in the level fixed effect specification two more instruments are

display much of the high-frequency variation displayed in figure 5. This is evident in the last row

of appendix table A.2, which reports the F-test for the joint significance of the instruments. For

the 1-year change specification the instruments are not jointly significant and for the 3-year change

specification the instruments do not pass the Stock-Yogo criterion. As a result, we do not report IV

results for the 1-year change specification and caution the reader about the validity of the results

for the 3-year change specification.

   Tables 5–8 report the IV results. The IV estimates are always larger than the OLS results, exactly

as predicted by the theory. Also, the Hausman test rejects endogeneity in every case. Using the

theory, we interpret this to mean that, after controlling for domestic demand shocks (Dkt ) and

technology shocks (ICTkt ), the variation in service trade with China and India has been driven (1)

by economic reforms that have raised productivity (−d ln a∗ ) and (2) by increased openness that

improved access to Chinese and Indian low-wage labour (d ln w∗ ). The exogeneity of these two

factors means that much of the movement in U.S. service trade with China and India has been

uncorrelated with shocks that have had direct impacts on U.S. labour markets.


7. Average Annual Earnings

A. Theory

From equation (6), log earnings can be expressed as (dropping t subscripts)


                               ln Wk (h,u) = ln wk + φk h + (1 − φk )u                           (18)


where (1 − φk )u is a residual and, as in the levels version of equation (11), wk depends on imports

Mk , exports Xk , domestic demand Dk , and technology ICTk . For brevity, assume that ln wk can be

expressed as a linear function of ln Mk and ignore the Xk , Dk , and ICTk terms. That is,


                                         ln wk = −ψM ln Mk                                       (19)


where ψM > 0. Then from equations (18)–(19),


                            ln Wk (h,u) = −ψM ln Mk + φk h + (1 − φk )u.                         (20)


This is a difficult equation to estimate because worker sorting induces a correlation between u and

occupational characteristic Mk .



                                                 28
   This point will be very familiar to labour economists but perhaps less familiar to trade

economists. At risk of stretching the patience of labour economists, we formalize the point using

our model. Let IOWDk be the inter-occupational wage differential for occupation k. The IOWDk

are defined as the OLS estimates of the occupation fixed effects in an earnings regression. In our

model this earnings regression has the form ln Wk = αk + φh + e so that

            IOWDk ≡ αk = E[ln Wk (h,u) | sk−1 < h − u < sk ] − φ E[h | sk−1 < h − u < sk ]

where the expectation is over those workers who sort into occupation k. (See equation 7.)

   Using equation (20) to substitute out ln Wk (h,u),

   IOWDk = −ψM ln Mk + (φk − φ)E[h | sk−1 < h − u < sk ] + (1 − φk )E[u | sk−1 < h − u < sk ] .

The first term is an occupational characteristic (imports) and corresponds at least empirically to

a notion of ‘good’ jobs. The second term is fundamental to sorting because it stems from the

fact that returns to worker characteristics vary across sectors i.e., φk 6= φ. For manufacturing it

is commonly argued that workers in high-Mk industries have low values of observables h and

sort into industries with low returns to schooling so that this second term is negatively correlated

with imports. The third term depends on the average level of the unobservable characteristics of

workers who sort into k. Thus, the IOWDk capture both good jobs (the first term) and the sorting of

heterogeneous workers (the second and third terms). Re-stated, estimation of equation (20) yields

aψ
 bM that captures the impact on wages both of imports (good jobs) and of worker sorting.

   One famous solution to this identification problem is to look at earnings changes (Krueger

and Summers 1988, Gibbons and Katz 1992, and Gibbons et al. 2005). Earnings changes for

occupational stayers are (adding time subscripts)

                                ln Wk,t+1 − ln Wk,t = −ψM (ln Mk,t+1 − ln Mkt )                                      (21)

so that the problematic (1 − φk )u term disappears.38


B. Earnings Changes of Stayers

Table 8 reports the results of our standard specification, but with the dependent variable now the

log change in annual earnings and the sample restricted to occupational stayers. The coefficients
  38 In order to difference out (1 − φk )u we have implicitly assumed that there is no time variation in worker character-
istic u and or its returns (1 − φk ) .


                                                           29
are statistically insignificant and the economic magnitudes are small. Using 1-year changes, im-

ports of services from China and India reduce the earnings growth of stayers by 0.02% per year (=

–0.001×0.18). Over 10 years, during which service tradablility rose rapidly, this translates into a

decadal effect of a mere 0.2%. Decadal effects are reported in italics in the table. The decadal effect

is largest for the 5-year change specification (9.2%); however, this is not statistically significant and

falls to 2.3% for the statistically significant level fixed effect specification. These results for annual

earnings hold both for weekly wages and hourly wages. See rows 16 and 17 of sensitivity table 13.

In short, there is little evidence of a large impact of service trade on stayers.39

   Importantly, a very different conclusion emerges for manufacturing. In the 1-year changes

specification the decadal impact on earnings is a massive –20.4%.


C. Earnings Changes of Switchers: The Homogeneous Case

The earnings change for a worker that switches from occupation k to k0 is


              ln Wk0 ,t+1 − ln Wk,t = −ψM (ln Mk0 ,t+1 − ln Mkt ) − (φk − φk0 )h + (φk − φk0 )u.                   (22)


Thus, differencing does not eliminate the offending correlation between imports and the residual

(φk − φk0 )u. We do not have an instrumental variables strategy to deal with this famous problem.
However, we can look for informal bounds on the ψ
                                                bM .

   The correlation between imports and the residual goes to 0 in one of two cases. (1) If workers

are homogeneous so that u = u is the same for all workers then the residual can be absorbed by

fixed effects for the old occupation k and the new occupation k0 . This kills the correlation. (2) If

the returns to unobservables are the same across occupations, φk = φk0 , then the residual and the

correlation vanish. Suppose that conditions (1) or (2) hold so that worker sorting has no impact on

earnings changes. Then the impact of switching is the same for all shocks (trade shocks, domestic

shocks, and technology shocks): What matters is whether workers switch, not why they switch.

This motivates the type of regression examined by Ebenstein et al. (2011) for manufacturing in

which earnings changes are regressed on a dummy for switching. We implement their regression

as follows.
  39 Intable 8, the interaction of the non-tradable occupation dummy with the year dummies is declining over time,
indicating that earnings growth in non-tradable occupations has been slow relative to tradable occupations. This mirrors
what we showed in the raw data (row 5 of table 4.) Thus, there is no evidence that tradable occupations have suffered
relative to non-tradable occupations as a result of the rising tradability of services.




                                                          30
     In column 1 of table 9 we consider the sample consisting of stayers and downward switchers.

We regress earnings changes on a ‘switching down’ dummy that equals 1 for downward switch-

ers and 0 for stayers. The regression also includes our usual worker characteristics and 4-digit

occupation fixed effects.40 All other occupation-level variables (e.g., imports) are excluded. The

estimated coefficient of 0.139 indicates that, even after controlling for observable characteristics,

downward switching is associated with an earnings cut of 13.9%. Column 5 reports the results for

the sample consisting of stayers and upward switchers. The estimated coefficient on the ‘switching

up’ dummy indicates that upward switching is associated with an earnings increase of 12.1%.

     In columns 9 and 10 we repeat what Ebenstein et al. (2011) have already done for manufacturing

and find very similar estimates. The coefficients for manufacturing are surprising in that they are

very similar to those for services.


D. Earnings Changes of Switchers: The Heterogeneous Case

The assumption that (1) workers have identical unobservables or (2) that returns to worker char-

acteristics are the same across occupations are potentially very strong. How does one interpret the

previous regressions when both these assumptions are violated so that sorting matters? Consider

estimating inter-occupational wage differentials using data only for workers who switch down:
                             −
ln Wkt = IOWDk− + φ h + e− . Differencing this yields


                                      ln Wk0 ,t+1 − ln Wkt = IOWDk−0 − IOWDk− .                                       (23)


Note that the right-hand side is 0 for stayers (k0 = k). Thus, if one estimated this equation using

a dummy for switching down, the estimated coefficient would be the average of the IOWDk−0 −

IOWDk− .41 Symmetric comments hold for switching up. If this interpretation is correct, then the

Ebenstein et al. switching dummies of columns 1, 5, 9, and 10 produce estimates that suffer from

the same problems associated with IOWDs, namely, that they do not distinguish between the role

of ‘good jobs’ and worker sorting.

     To establish that our concern is appropriate, recall that IOWDk is the inter-occupational wage

differential estimated off of the full sample. For a worker that switches from k to k0 we can attach

to this worker a IOWDk0 − IOWDk . We then add this variable to the column 1 and 5 regressions.
   40 The   results are very similar with or without worker characteristics and/or 4-digit fixed effects.
   41 Specifically,  Σk,k0 ( IOWDk−0 − IOWDk− )nk,k0 where nk,k0 is the proportion of downward switchers that switch from k
to k0 .


                                                             31
The result appear in column 2 for switching down and column 6 for switching up. With this

variable included, the switching dummies are no longer economically or statistically significant.

This confirms our interpretation.

   The coefficients on IOWDk0 − IOWDk in columns 2 and 6 are very close to 0.5 for both upward

and downward switchers. This mirrors the results in rows 1 and 2 of table 1 and is related to a

point made by Gibbons and Katz (1992) that inter-occupational wage differentials estimated from

all workers tend to be similar to those estimated from switchers. Gibbons and Katz find that in a

regression of switcher IOWDs on full-sample IOWDs, the regression coefficient is not much below

unity. We find that it is close to 0.5. This suggests that the role of worker sorting is more important

in our sample than in theirs. Thus, individual worker characteristics matter.

   If sorting matters then workers who are induced to switch because of trade shocks have very

different earnings responses than those of the average switcher. We do not have anything new

to add to the large literature on identifying earnings impacts when workers endogenously switch

based on unobservables. However, we can directly examine within a (biased) OLS setting whether

switching due to trade shocks has the same impacts as switching due to all causes. To this end, we

estimate our standard regression of earnings changes on import changes separately for downward

switchers and for upwards switchers. (Stayers are not included in either sample.) The results

for downward switchers appear in columns 2–3 of table 9. Column 3 reports the 1-year changes

specification and column 4 reports the level fixed effect specification. In both cases, the coefficient

on imports is statistically insignificant and economically small (decadal impacts on earnings of at

most –0.2%). Thus, either the impacts of trade-induced switching are significantly smaller than

the impacts of switching from all sources or there is sorting-induced endogeneity in all of the

coefficients reported in table 9.

   Columns 7–8 report the results for the switching-up sample. These effects are economically

large (decadal impacts on earnings of between –5.1% and –10.3%), but only marginally significant

at best.42

   Summarizing, we have seen that the effects of trade on stayers is very small. The effects on

the earnings of switchers may be large, but absent an instrument for dealing with the correlation

between switching and unobservables or between imports and unobservables, it is hard to know
  42 Jacobson et al. (1993) examine earnings impacts for a particularly severe trade shock – the collapse of Pennsylvania

steel. They estimate earnings losses of as high as 25%, which is much larger than what we find. This is consistent with
the model. As figure 4 shows, the larger the shock, the more workers there will be with large earnings cuts.


                                                           32
whether these large effects are due to ‘good jobs’ or the sorting of heterogeneous workers across

occupations that have heterogeneous returns to worker skills and abilities.


8. Results by Routinization, Education, and Age

In this section we examine the impact of service offshoring for sub-populations defined by ed-

ucation, age, and the routineness of occupations. Following Autor et al. (2003), we use O*NET

information to measure the routineness of tasks associated with each of approximately 700 Stan-

dard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes. We define ‘routine cognitiveness’ as the importance

of ‘repeating the same task’ divided by the importance of ‘thinking creatively’. We then classify

each occupation as ‘routine’ or ‘non-routine’ depending on whether the occupation’s ‘routine

cognitiveness’ is above or below the median across all occupations covered in our sample.

   In panel A of table 10, we re-estimate our core specifications separately for workers in routine

and non-routine occupations. Only a few coefficients are reported.43 As expected, the effects

of service imports from China and India are most adverse for workers in routine occupations.

This evidence is consistent with what has been repeatedly found in the literature e.g., Ebenstein

et al. (2011) and, for service trade, Crino (2009). It is also consistent with the Firpo et al. (2010)

analysis of the determinants of inequality trends. One note of caution is necessary. The row ‘Chi2

test for Imports’ reports a test statistic for the difference in the estimated coefficients on imports

in the routine and non-routine samples. This difference is never significant at the 1% level. In

contrast, the difference in the estimated coefficients on schooling are often significantly different,

with schooling being relatively more important in non-routine occupations.

   In panel B of table 10 we re-estimate our core specifications separately for those with at least

some high school and those with at least some college. We find little evidence of the differential

effects that have been found in other studies. This may be due to our sample — half the workers

in our tradable sample completed a college degree. See online appendix table B.2.

   In panel C of table 10 we re-estimate our core specifications separately for workers who are

under and over 40 years of age. As expected, the effects of service imports are most adverse for

older workers, though the differential effect is never significant at the 1% level.
  43 The specifications in table 10 are the same as those in columns 1 and 5 of table 5 (switching down), table 6 (switching

up), table 7 (transitions to unemployment), and table 8 (earnings changes of stayers). For example, the first two columns
in table 10 correspond to column 1 (1-year change) of table 5 and the next two columns correspond to column 5 (level
fixed effect) of table 5.



                                                            33
9. Sensitivity

There are a myriad of alternative, a priori sensible specifications that the reader will undoubtedly

want to see before being persuaded of our results. We have literally tried thousands of these

specifications. None of these matter beyond what we have already shown. We review these here.


A. CPS Sample Selection

To be in our matched sample a worker must remain in the same dwelling from March of year

t to March of year t + 1. Since service offshoring may encourage workers to move in search

of jobs, our sample may not be randomly chosen and our estimates may be tainted by sample

selection bias. See Neumark and Kawaguchi (2004) and Goldberg and Tracy (2003). Following

Goldberg and Tracy, in this subsection we use maximum likelihood to simultaneously estimate

two equations, a selection equation and a second-stage equation (switching up, switching down,

transitions to unemployment or earnings changes of stayers). Our specification of the selection

equation borrows from the migration literature which shows that mobility is strongly tied to family

characteristics that have been excluded from our second-stage equations. These are family size,

number of children, home ownership and whether the individual has a recent history of moving

as proxied by whether the individual lived in the same house last year.44 These instruments are

drawn from responses in the first of the two March surveys.

   The estimates appear in table 11. Estimates of the second-stage equations appear in the top

panel while estimates of the selection equation appear in the bottom panel. The Wald test for

selection is reported in the row labeled ‘Wald test of indep. eqns.’ and indicates that in almost

every case selection bias cannot be rejected.45 Selection affects the fixed effects and the worker-

characteristic coefficients, but barely affects our estimates of service imports and exports.


B. Including Rich-Country Service Trade

Our paper focuses on the impact of trade in services with China and India. In table 12 we include

the imports and exports of services between the United States and her G8 partners. These rich
  44 In the first of the two March surveys the individual is asked if he or she lived in the same house last year. The

correlation of this response with whether the individual is matched across March surveys is 0.14. This is a small
correlation and our results are unchanged when this variable is removed from the instrument set. Note that this is
our only excluded variable not suggested by Goldberg and Tracy.
  45 The Wald test is calculated by comparing the results in table 11 with the results of fitting the second-stage equation

without a selection correction.


                                                            34
countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. (Russia is excluded.)

The even-numbered columns repeat our baseline results from tables 5–8. The odd-numbered

columns add imports and exports from the G8. The G8 variables are rarely significant and, more

importantly, their inclusion does not affect the coefficients on imports and exports with China

and India. For example, with the two G8 regressors added, the coefficient on Chinese and Indian

imports in our baseline downward-switching specification moves slightly from 0.039 to 0.040 and

the coefficient on Chinese and India exports moves slightly from -0.084 to -0.092.


C. Other Sensitivity Analysis

Table 13 reports a large number of additional specifications. The first row repeats our baseline

specification i.e., the level fixed effect OLS results from column 5 in tables 5–8. We only report

the coefficient on imports and its decadal impact i.e., the number in italics in tables 5–8. Since

coefficient magnitudes are not comparable across rows, the reader should focus on the ‘Decadal

Impacts’ columns. A quick perusal of these columns shows that none of what we are about to

report overly matters for our conclusions.

   Service Trade with All Low-Wage Countries (Row 2): When it comes to U.S. trade in services,

China and India are by far the major low-wage trading partners. The BEA also publishes bilateral

service trade data for all countries that have significant service trade with the United States.

Among low-wage countries, data are available for China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines

and Thailand. We therefore include all of these in our definitions of ln Mkt and ln Xkt .

   Excluding Non-tradable Service Occupations (Row 3): In this row we only consider workers

in tradable occupations.

   Only Business, Professional and Technical (BPT) Services (Row 4): Much of the press about

offshoring focuses on BPT services to the exclusion of the other service categories in table 2

such as financial and insurance services. That is, the press focuses on services for which U.S.

comparative advantage is relatively weak. Table 13 presents estimates when only the eight BPT

service subcategories are included in the analysis.

   Ignore the Blinder Offshorability Criterion (Row 5): Recall that in building a crosswalk in

section 3.C we attached a service trade flow to a worker only if the Blinder offshorability criterion

was met. In row 5 we attach a service trade flow to a worker even if the Blinder offshorability

criterion is not met.


                                                 35
   Omit the Technology Bubble Years (Row 6): NASDAQ began its precipitous decline in March

2000 and continued to decline until mid-2002. To eliminate the effects of the bubble we delete all

data for the years 2000 and 2001.

   Drop Domestic Demand and ICT (Row 7): Dropping Dkt and ICTkt has very little effect on our

results.

   Alternative Functional Forms for Imports and Exports (Row 8): Rather than introducing

imports and exports in log changes and log levels, we could have introduced them as a fraction of

domestic sales: Mkt /Dkt and Xkt /Dkt . This is done in row 8.

   Probit, Logit and Multinomial Logit Regression Results (Rows 9–11): We used the OLS

estimator even though switching down, switching up, and transitions to unemployment are binary

dependent variables. In rows 9 and 10 we report probit and logit estimates, respectively. Also, one

can model the worker’s decision as a four-way decision: switch down, switch up, transition to

unemployment, or stay. (We have modelled it as a two-way decision: stay or switch down in table

5; stay or switch up in table 6; stay employed or transition to unemployment in table 7.) In row 11

we model the decision as a four-way decision using a multinomial logit.

   2-Digit Switching (Row 12): All of our switching results are based on 4-digit COC (occupation)

switching. In row 12 we report results for 2-digit switching. Not surprisingly, in percentage point

terms the decadal impacts are smaller because 2-digit switching is much less common. However,

in percentage terms, 2- and 4-digit decadal impacts on downward switching are similar. The 2-

digit downward switching rate is 14% so that the decadal impact in percentage terms is 15.7% (=

0.022/0.14). This is very similar to the decadal impact of 17% for 4-digit switching.

   Weeks Unemployed and Employed (Rows 13–14): Rather than working with a binary transi-

tion to unemployment, in row 13 we examine changes in the proportion of labour-force hours spent

unemployed. Consistent with our results for transitions into unemployment, service imports are

associated with small increases in the proportion of labour-force hours spent unemployed. On the

flip side, we also use the change of weeks worked as a dependent variable and find that service

imports slightly decrease weeks worked.

   Weekly and Hourly Earnings (Rows 15–16): Rather than using the change in real annual

earnings, in rows 15–16 we use the change in real weekly wages and real hourly wages as the

dependent variables. Weekly wages are defined as real annual earnings divided by weeks worked

last year. Hourly wages are defined as real annual earnings divided by hours worked last year.


                                                 36
Hours worked last year is weeks worked last year times hours worked each week. The results are

vary similar to those for changes in real annual earnings.

   In summary, our results hold for a large set of alternative specifications.


10. Conclusions

The rise of service offshoring to China and India has brought with it something new – for the

first time ever, educated U.S. workers are competing with educated but low-paid foreign workers.

Despite the public concern about this development, there has been very little econometric work

quantifying the adjustment costs for American workers. We developed a model that explicitly

deals with both the endogeneity of imports and the role of worker sorting, both key features of

the data. Combining matched CPS data for 1996–2007 with BEA data on U.S. service trade with

China and India, we found the following cumulative 10-year impacts of this trade. (1) Down-

ward and upward occupational switching increased by 17% and 4%, respectively. (2) Transitions

to unemployment increased by a large 0.9 percentage points. (3) The earnings of occupational

‘stayers’ fell by a tiny 2.3%. (4) Matched CPS data does not allow us to identify earnings impacts

for occupational switchers unless an assumption is made about how unobservable worker charac-

teristics affect worker sorting. Under the assumption of no worker sorting, downward switching

was associated with an annual earnings hit of -13.9% and upward switching was associated with an

annual earnings gain of +12.1%. Under the assumption of worker sorting, trade-induced switching

had no statistically significant impact on earnings. These numbers are from our baseline level fixed

effect specification. In summary, service offshoring to China and India has had its adverse effects

— and while these effects are smaller than one would obtain by ignoring worker sorting, they are

not small enough that they can be ignored.

Notes: This table reports on 4-digit occupational switching. The first column reports means for the sample of stayers.
Rows 1, 2, and 4 are calculated from a regression of the indicated variable on a dummy for switching up, a dummy
for switching down, and a full set of 4-digit occupational dummies for the worker’s initial occupation. Rows 3 and 5
are the means for the three samples. Standard errors are in parentheses. An asterisk (*) indicates a difference between
switchers and stayers that is statistically significant at the 1% level.

     Notes: The dependent variable equals 1 if the worker switched down (to an occupation with a lower inter-occupational wage differential) and 0 if the worker stayed in the
     same occupation. In columns 1–9 the sample is the set of workers in white collar services that either switched down or stayed. All specifications include year and state
     fixed effects. The difference between columns 1 through 5 is in the treatment of the four service characteristics. For example, let [ln Mkt − ln Mk,t−l ]/l be the average annual
     change in imports over l years. The lag length appears in the column header e.g., l = 1 in column 1 and l = 7 in column 4. In column 5 the four service characteristics are
     entered in log levels and BEA service sector fixed effects are added. Columns 6–9 are the IV counterparts to columns 2–5. Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. Columns
     10 and 11 are the counterparts to columns 1 and 5, but using manufacturing rather than services. Standard errors clustered at the BEA and year levels appear in parentheses.
     ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

     Notes: The dependent variable equals 1 if the worker switched up (to an occupation with a higher inter-occupational wage differential) and 0 if the worker stayed in the
     same occupation. In columns 1–9 the sample is the set of workers in white collar services that either switched up or stayed. The table is otherwise identical to table 5. See
     table 5 for all other details. Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. Standard errors clustered at the BEA and year levels appear in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical
     significance at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

     Notes: The dependent variable equals 1 if the worker transitioned into unemployment and 0 if the worker stayed employed. In columns 1–9 the sample is the set of workers
     in white collar services that experienced no unemployment in the first of their two periods. The table is otherwise identical to table 5. See table 5 for all other details.
     Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. Standard errors clustered at the BEA and year levels appear in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and
     5% levels, respectively.

     Notes: The dependent variable is the change in the log of CPI-deflated annual earnings. In columns 1–9 the sample is the set of workers in white collar services that did not
     switch occupations i.e., stayers. In calculating the decadal impact of imports and exports (the numbers in italics) we multiply the coefficients, respectively, by 1.8 (= 0.18×10)
     and 1.5 (= 0.15×10). The table is otherwise identical to table 5. See table 5 for all other details. Standard errors clustered at the BEA and year levels appear in parentheses. **
     and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

     Notes: The dependent variable is the change in the log of CPI-deflated annual earnings. In columns 1–4 the sample is the set of workers in white collar services that either
     switched down or stayed. ‘Switching down’ equals 1 for downward switchers and 0 for stayers. ‘Change in IOWD’ is the difference between the IOWD in the worker’s
     initial and final occupations. Except for the sample, the specifications in columns 3 and 4 are identical to those in columns 1 and 5, respectively, of table 8. Columns 4–8
     mirror columns 1–4, but with downward switching replaced by upward switching everywhere i.e., in defining the sample and in defining the switching dummy. See table
     5 for all other details. Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. Standard errors clustered at the BEA and year levels appear in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical
     significance at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

     Notes: The specifications in this table are the same as the specifications in table 5. To save space, we only report the coefficients for imports, schooling and I NT I2004−2005 . OLS
     coefficients are reported with standard errors, clustered at the BEA-year level, in parentheses. Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. ** and * indicate statistical significance
     at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

Notes: The specifications for the second-stage regressions in this table are the same as the corresponding specifications in
tables 5–8. The selection equations also include all the variables in the second-stage regressions. To save space, we only
report the coefficients for the excluded regressors. Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. Standard errors clustered at
the BEA-year level are in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

     specifications two more regressors: imports and exports of services with the G8. OLS coefficients are reported. Numbers in italics are decadal impacts. Standard errors,
     clustered at the BEA-year level, appear in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively.

1. Mathematical Appendix

In this appendix we fully work out the comparative statics of the model. Since we never separately

examined changes in the domestic and foreign demand shifters δD and δX , we combine them here.

That is, let δD = δX = δ and define Q( p,δ) = D ( p,δ) + X ( p,δ).

   Substituting the equilibrium conditions L D = LS (w) and Q = Q( p,δ) into equation (3) and

substituting equation (2) into (4), one can re-write equations (2)–(4) as

                                  wa = w∗ a∗ βt( I )

                              LS (w) = a(1 − I ) Q( p,δ)
                                                               Z I        

2. Definition of General Equilibrium

In order to define general equilibrium in our model we require three additional components. First,

we need to describe the foreign labour market. This can be done as in Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007)

who model the foreign and domestic labour markets in the same way, but with different distribu-

tions of worker types (g(h,u) and g∗ (h,u). Second, demand functions Dk ( pk ,δDk ) and Xk ( pk ,δXk )

do not depend on income. We must therefore specify homothetic utility functions and derive these

demands (including their dependence on income) from consumer optimization. Third, we require

a balanced-trade condition. A competitive equilibrium is then a set of prices { pk ,wk }kK=1 that clear

the global market for each product k = 1, . . . ,K and clear the national markets for workers subject


                                                      A.2
to optimal occupational choice. The allocation of labour to sectors LS (wk ) is given by the sorting

rule in equation (7) and the labour supply schedule in equation (8). The earnings of workers in

occupation k is given by Wk (h,u) in equation (6). Output Qk and trade flows Ik (or Mk ≡ Ik Qk )

for each sector and each country follow from the sector/occupation supply functions described by

equations (2)–(4).


3. Data Appendix

In 2003, the CPS updated its occupation and industry classifications from 1990 Census codes to

2002 Census codes. To ensure that codes are consistent over our entire sample we converted the

1990 Census codes into 2002 Census codes. We then linked 2002 Census occupation codes with

the 10 BEA service trade sectors. In order to do this as accurately as possible we used (i) the 2002

NAICS manual for detailed industry definitions and the 2000 SOC manual for detailed occupation

definitions, and (ii) Borga and Mann (2004) and U.S. Department of Commerce (1998) for detailed

information about the coverage of each type of trade in services.

   All service trade data are from the “other private services” category of the BEA database. We

exclude (i) Installation, maintenance, and repair of equipment, (ii) Education, (iii) Telecommunica-

tion, and (iiii) Other because these categories are difficult to concord into offshorable occupations.

   Our measures of service imports and exports come from published BEA data on U.S. interna-

tional services cross-border trade and sales through affiliates. Data for early years are sporadically

missing. This could either be because values of less than 0.5 million dollars are suppressed or

because of disclosure concerns. The two likely go hand in hand: even a quick look through the

data for each sector shows that when data are missing in a year there are usually neighbouring

years with data and these data involve very small values of trade. We therefore used linear inter-

polation to fill in missing data. However, none of our results change when we restrict ourselves to

non-imputed data.

   The BEA service-trade surveys differ across sectors in whether they report total trade or just

unaffiliated trade. Total trade is available for 5 of our 10 sectors and unaffiliated trade is available

for the remaining 5 sectors. Given our log specification, this will matter only if the ratio of

unaffiliated to total trade is trending. This is not the case. In the 4 sectors for which we have

both types of trade, there is no trend. Further, in Liu and Trefler (2008) we obtained identical

results using unaffiliated trade in 9 of the 10 sectors for which unaffiliated trade is available.

                                                  A.3
   Dkt is constructed as total sales Qkt less exports Xkt . Qkt is calculated from the BEA table ‘GDP

by Industry: 1998-2005.’ We use linear interpolation to fill in missing data for 1995-1997. Data

for ICTkt are from the BEA table of ‘Historical-Cost Investment in Private Nonresidential Fixed

Assets.’ Both Dkt and ICTkt are from the BEA and are available at a finer level of aggregation than

is the service trade data.


A. Switching

Responses to questions about occupation and industry in the longest job held last year are known

to be frequently miscoded. This leads to over-estimation of switching. We therefore clean up the

raw switching data using the yearly equivalent of the criteria in Moscarini and Thomsson (2006).

Specifically, a switch is valid only if at least one of the following three events occurred. (1) The class

of worker changed.1 (2) There was job search during the period.2 (3) For an occupation (industry)

switch the industry (occupation) changed. Note that in most cases, criterion (3) was satisfied only

when either (1) or (2) were satisfied. That is, criterion (3) has almost no bite and excluding it has

no effect on our results.

   If in the first of the two CPS surveys a worker does not report a longest job held last year then

she is deleted from the sample.


B. Occupation Exposure to Manufacturing Trade

In order to examine the impact of service offshoring on white collar jobs, we have linked the BEA

service trade data to offshorable white collar occupations and run the baseline estimations. To be

comparable with our service results, we need to construct variables that measure the occupational

exposure to manufacturing trade. To do so, we follow Ebenstein et al. (2011). Specifically, we have

converted the industry exposure to manufacturing trade into occupation exposure to manufactur-

ing trade as follows,

                                                Mo,t =   ∑ so,j Mj,t .                                          (33)
                                                          j

where so,j = Eo,j /Eo is the share of workers in occupation o and industry j over all workers across

all industries in occupation o in year 1992. We calculated this ratio using 1993 March CPS data. M jt
   1 There are three classes of workers: (i) private, which includes working in a private for-profit company or being

self-employed and incorporated; (ii) self-employed but not incorporated; and (iii) government employee.
   2 In the variable coding of LOOKED, a worker looked for a job last year if she worked last year (WORKYN = 1), was

a part-year worker (1 <= WKSLYR <= 51) and looked for work last year (LKEDPY = 0).

is imports of manufacturing industry j in year t. The industry-level manufacturing trade data is

from Peter Schott’s website. Occupation-specific measures of export variables are also converted

in the same fashion.

and hence more imports from China and India. To get a good sense of how the instruments are

performing, online appendix figure B.1 presents the four partial regression plots for the import

Notes : 'Naïve Match' is the proportion of all civilian
adults in March of the indicated year who can be
matched to an individual in March of the subsequent
year. The naïve match is based on a household identifier,
a household number, and an individual line number
within a household. 'Valid Match' is the percentage of
naïve matches that survive the S|R|A (sex, race, age)
merge criterion. 'Final Match' is the final match rate and
equals (naïve match)x(valid match).
