This article reviews the recent literature on the determinants of college major choices. We first
highlight long-term trends and persistent differences in college major choices by gender, race,
and family background. We then review the existing research in six key areas: expected earnings
and ability sorting, learning, subjective expectations, non-pecuniary considerations, peer and
family effects, and supply side factors. We examine and compare the various approaches
employed by previous research and highlight key areas for future research.

1     Introduction
College major choice and its relationship with labor market outcomes has long been a topic
of study for social scientists. For college graduates, major choice is often directly related
to occupation choices, particularly in occupations which require a substantial investment in
occupation-specific human capital, such as Engineering. A number of studies have demon-
strated that the choice of post-secondary field is a key determinant of future earnings, and
that the demographic composition of college major choice may be a key factor in explaining
earnings differences across demographic groups, such as by gender (Grogger and Eide (1995);
Brown and Corcoran (1997); Weinberger (1998); Gemici and Wiswall (2014)).
    Beyond individual welfare, the choice of major is important for many reasons. Major
choice affects the skill composition of the workforce, making an understanding of how major
choices are affected by changes in skill demand important to research on the dynamics in
the overall economy. And, as we review below, policymakers have used various supply side
policies­tuition, admissions criteria, and targeted aid­to alter the composition of college
majors in the economy.
    In this article, we review the current literature on college major choice. We begin by
documenting long term trends in college major and divergence in these trends by gender and
race, in Section 2. We also describe patterns in the relationship between major choice, family
background, and labor market outcomes. Motivated by this evidence, we then discuss work
on the determinants of college major choice. A vast literature has studied the relationship
between expected earnings and human capital investments. Since at least Willis and Rosen
(1979), this research has come a long way in understanding the impact of expected earnings
on various aspects of college choice. Most of these studies have focused on the decision
to enroll in college. However, with increasing educational attainment and specialization of
the workforce, the focus has moved towards the type of education. As we document below
using recent ACS data, and has been noted in several other papers using data from earlier
periods (Daymont and Andrisani, 1984; Grogger and Eide, 1995; James et al., 1989; Loury
and Garman, 1995; Gemici and Wiswall, 2014), there are large differences in earnings across
majors. A natural question then emerges is the extent to which expected future earnings


                                              1
affect major choice. In Section 3, we outline how researchers have used several different
approaches to estimate the elasticity of college major choice with respect to earnings.
   Much of the earlier work treated college major choice as a static decision with little
uncertainty. However, since the early work on major choice, researchers have attempted
to incorporate more realistic processes of major selection, incorporating uncertainty about
future outcomes (graduation and post-graduation), and learning about own ability and the
characteristics of majors. In one of the earliest innovations in this dimension, Altonji (1993)
allowed for uncertainty over educational outcomes including major completion, although
the completion probability is constant across majors. Montmarquette et al. (2002) further
relaxed this assumption by allowing completion probabilities to be individual and major
specific. In recent years, a number of studies have shed some light on the dynamics of the
choice and how students learn. Improvements in computational methods, the availability of
rich and high frequency data on student choices and beliefs, and field experiments that shock
students' information sets have enabled substantial progress on these questions. We review
this strand of the literature in Section 4. It is worth noting that past reviews by Altonji
et al. (2012, 2016) has extensively reviewed the work on this area of research. Altonji et al.
(2012) review the literature while providing a dynamic model of education and occupation
choice. They emphasize the importance of high school curriculum and its link to college
major choice. Adding to this work, Altonji et al. (2016) discusses models of college major
choice and the econometric methods used to obtain causal effects of majors on earnings.
They highlight graduate school as a new area of research.
   One area that has seen explosive growth is the use of subjective expectations in study-
ing major choice. Historically, research on college major choice assumes that expectations
are either rational or myopic, and then uses observed choices and earnings to identify pa-
rameters (Freeman (1971); Siow (1984); Zarkin (1985); Bamberger (1988); Berger (1988);
Flyer (1997); Eide and Waehrer (1998); Montmarquette et al. (2002) ; Arcidiacono (2004)).
This approach is limited: observed choices can be consistent with many different combina-
tions of expectations and preferences (Manski (1993)). Moreover, strong assumptions on
the structure of expectations can bias inferences about decision rules. For these reasons,
a more recent literature uses subjective expectations data, rather than choice data alone,


                                              2
to understand decision-making under uncertainty in the context of schooling choices. We
review this nascent but growing literature in Section 5. This body of work has established
that students have heterogeneous beliefs about various considerations that can affect their
schooling choice. This includes the probability of getting into a selective school, expected
earnings after graduating from a major and beliefs about own ability (e.g., Giustinelli (2016);
Kaufmann (2014); Ruder and Van Noy (2017); Attanasio and Kaufmann (2017)).
    A theme that emerges from much of the recent work, reviewed in Section 3, is that
earnings are certainly not the sole determinant of college majors, and there is likely a large
role for non-pecuniary considerations. A growing body of research investigates non-pecuniary
considerations in the context of major choice. We review this literature in Section 6. This line
of work has been facilitated by the availability of subjective data on non-pecuniary factors,
that are otherwise hard to quantify using observational data. The standard approach has
been to subsume all unobserved factors into a "taste" term. However, in recent years, richer
data on non-pecuniary factors (such as work-family balance, parental approval, marriage
market considerations) has allowed for considerable progress towards unpacking the black
box of tastes.
    We also highlight the recent work on supply side considerations in Section 8. And, finally,
we discuss work on field of study in graduate degrees other than undergraduate degrees in
Section 9. We conclude by highlighting some emerging areas of work that merit further
research.



2     Trends and Recent Patterns
We motivate our review of the existing research by first describing broad patterns in educa-
tional attainment and college major choice. We conclude this section by describing recent
employment and earnings patterns by major.


2.1    College Attainment

Over the last few decades, the United States has seen a significant increase in educational
attainment. Panel A of Figure 1 reports the trend in college degree attainment. As described

                                               3

         Source.-- American Community Survey (ACS) and Decennial Census.
         Note.-- This figure reports the fraction of population with 4 or more years of college. The sample
         includes the population between ages 25 and 49 surveyed in the American Community Survey (ACS)
         from 2008-2018 and the 1960-2000 Decennial Censuses.


                                 Figure 1: Trends in Schooling Years


in more detail in the Data Appendix, we pool the population surveyed in the American
Community Survey (ACS) from 2008-2018 and the 1960-2000 Decennial Censuses, and define
college degree as 4 or more years of college, to be consistent across the data sources. Note


                                                         4
that to minimize completion and mortality effects, we limit our sample to respondents aged
25 to 49 in each survey year.
   There is a steady increase in the fraction with 16 or more years of schooling, from 10
percent for the 1920 birth cohort to about 34 percent for the population born in 1990 and
graduating from college in the 2010s. As is well known, Panel B shows that women overtake
men starting with the 1960s birth cohorts (graduating in the 1980s), and for the most recent
birth cohorts there is about an 8 percent gap in college attainment between women and
men (38 versus 30 percent). Similar gaps between black women and men opened up at the
same time, although both black women and men substantially lag white women and men in
educational attainment (Panel C).


2.2    College Majors

Looking beyond college attainment, we use the more recent ACS data to construct the
fraction of undergraduate degrees in various majors by birth cohort. Figure 2 plots the trends
in majors for birth cohorts from 1940 to 1993, where we group college/undergraduate majors
into three broad categories: (i) Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM),
(ii) Business or Economics, and (iii) Humanities, Social Science, and Education. Note that
this figure plots undergraduate majors for all college educated respondents, regardless of
whether they later complete a graduate degree.
   Figure 2 shows substantial change in major composition across birth cohorts. The most
substantial change is the reduction in the fraction of degrees in Humanities, Social Science, or
Education for women and the concomitant increase in the fraction of other degrees, especially
Business and Economics. The fraction of Humanities, Social Science, and Education degrees
declined from nearly 70 percent for the 1940s cohorts to about 40 percent for the 1960s
cohorts, with much of the increase in Business or Economics degrees, and some in STEM.
Changes for men followed the same direction but were smaller in magnitude. The figure
shows some notable early convergence in majors by gender, but the male and female trends
are largely parallel, and there is still a sizable gap, for the later cohorts.

complete a graduate degree.

2.3    Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees by Family Background

An under-explored aspect of major choice is how major choice varies by the socioeconomic
status of parents. We use data from National Survey of Graduates (NCSG), a nationally
representative survey of college graduates for the years 1993, 2003 and 2010, to examine
how undergraduate and graduate degrees vary by the education of the parents (the only
measure of family background or parental socioeconomic status (SES) provided). Although
college attainment by family background and in particular for first generation students has
been extensively studied (Bailey and Dynarski, 2011; Bound and Turner, 2011), less is known
about their college major choice. Given the connection between degree field and earnings, the
existence of substantial differences by family background may have important implications
for inter-generational mobility.
   Table 1 shows how major choice varies by parental education. Column I reports the
average years of education (averaged across both parents or only the mother if the father's
education is missing) by various undergraduate and graduate fields. Columns II and III
report the percent chance of graduating with a particular major for first generation students
and students with both parents having a college degree, respectively. Columns IV reports
the difference between columns II and III as a percent of column II (with column V reporting
the p-value). Column VI reports the corresponding percent difference controlling for race,
gender, birth year, survey year and birth cohort (with column VII reporting the p-value).
   All these measures indicate substantial differences in college major choice by parental
education. The first column shows that the majors whose graduates have the highest average
parental education are fine arts and physics, and the ones with lowest parental education
are Social Work, Business fields, Nursing and Education. Individuals with graduate degrees
also tend to have more educated parents than those without, and Law and Medical School
graduates have the highest parental years of education. Another way of looking at these
differences is the probability of graduating with a major conditional on parental education.
Columns (II) and (III) show that there are substantial differences in major choice between
students with neither parent having a college degree and those with both parents with college
degrees. These gaps are persistent even with a fairly rich set of controls (column VI). Fine

2.4    Employment and Earnings by College Major

Next, we examine basic patterns in employment and earnings by undergraduate majors. We
do so in part as motivation: if there were limited differences in employment and earnings, one
of the key rationale for studying major differences (rather than simply education differences)
would be missing. Note that our descriptive analysis does not necessarily reflect the "causal"
impact of majors on these labor market outcomes. A rich literature, which we summarize
below, has studied this issue, and uses various methods to understand selection into majors.
   We use information from the 2016-18 ACS. The Data Appendix provides more detail on
sample construction. Table 2 reports the labor force participation rate, the unemployment
rate and the earnings by major and age categories. To provide some context, we include
statistics for individuals with some college education but no bachelor's degree, including
individuals with associates and other two year degrees. This group is labeled as "No Grad"
in the table.
   In general, we find small differences in labor force participation and unemployment across
majors at younger ages. The differences in participation rates and unemployment rates are
quite sizable at later ages. We see that among students with a bachelor's degree, starting at
age 35, labor force participation rates are lower for those with a major in the Humanities,
Social Science or Education and unemployment rates are higher. Notably, we see that
individuals without degrees but some college have an unemployment rate about twice as
high as that of college graduates.
   Next, we explore earnings differences. We focus on the population working full year (50-
52 weeks) and full time (at least 35 hours). The mean and median earnings by major and age
groups are reported in Table 2, and Figure 3 displays the mean age earnings profile. There
are significant differences in earnings across majors and these differences increase with age.
Graduates with STEM degrees have the highest average and median earnings, and those with

in college major choice, a rich literature has carefully studied the extent to which these
differences reflect sorting into majors, as opposed to higher returns to certain fields. We
describe this literature in the following sections.



3     Labor Market Earnings
We begin our overview of the existing research on the determinants of college major choices
with labor market earnings.


3.1    Early Work

Although there was some earlier related work by Freeman (1971, 1999); Siow (1984); Zarkin
(1985) on selection into particular college educated occupations (lawyers, engineers, teach-
ers), which we briefly review below, Berger (1988) was one of the first papers to study this
question specifically in regard to college majors. Using a rational expectations approach,
Berger (1988) assumes that utility from each major is a function of the discounted value
of lifetime expected earnings and a non-pecuniary major specific component. Identification
comes from some key assumptions. First, he assumes that agents have rational expectations.
Second, agents are uncertain about future earnings streams but there is no uncertainty re-
garding college completion. Third, all time variation in college major choice across cohorts
is coming from variation in the monetary returns. Berger (1988) finds that students are
influenced by the future flow of earnings rather than just the initial earnings when they are
choosing their college major. Subsequent research has gradually relaxed these assumptions,
and generalized the model of major choice. We discuss these innovations below. First, we
review an area of research that has received a lot of attention, the role of pre-college ability
in earnings determination and college major decisions.


3.2    Ability

It is likely that a key determinant of college major choice and its consequent labor market
returns is student ability established prior to college. Past work has established that there


                                               12
are large differences in ability at college entrance across majors (measured with test scores
such as SAT math and verbal scores) (Turner and Bowen, 1999).
   Motivated by large earnings and ability differences across major as well as the compli-
mentarities between them, researchers have been trying to understand the extent to which
earnings differentials are driven by sorting by ability. For example, does the wage premium
for an Engineering degree remain if students were identical in their ability across majors.
Sorting on ability is an issue that has been foundational to research on schooling deci-
sions, and early papers by Altonji (1993) and Keane and Wolpin (1997) have used dynamic
structural models of schooling to address selection, allowing for heterogeneity along various
dimensions. Altonji (1993) in particular was the first to incorporate college major choice in
this context. Since then, a number of papers have used a similar methodology to develop
and study dynamic models of college major choice (Arcidiacono, 2004; Beffy et al., 2012;
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2012). According to the estimates of Arcidiacono (2004),
most of the ability sorting occurs due to preferences for majors and the workplace rather than
differences in pecuniary returns. Further, the earnings differences persist even after control-
ling for selection. An additional advantage of dynamic structural models is the ability to
model detailed aspects of the decision of choosing major by school year. This is particularly
important since major switching in college is fairly common in the US (Arcidiacono, 2004;
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2012, 2014a,b).
   Related to this body of work, several studies have explored another measure of pre-college
ability, namely high school preparedness. These studies have studied the role of high school
curriculum in college major choice, particularly in explaining gender differences in STEM
majors. Aucejo and James (2019) study the role of high school preparation in the gender
gap in STEM majors. Specifically, they estimate a dynamic production function of math
and verbal skills and their role in explaining gender differences in college education and
major choice. They implement this method on a rich panel database in the UK that follows
students from elementary school to university. They find that verbal skills play a greater role
in university enrollment than math skills, and that women have a comparative advantage
in verbal skills. This has implications for the gender gap in STEM majors. Similarly, using
rich administrative data from high school students in Ontario along with data from the


                                              13
province's university admission system, Card and Payne (2017) find that the main source of
the gender gap in STEM major choice is the lower overall rate of university attendance by
men. Differences in high school course-taking patterns and preferences for STEM, conditional
on readiness, explain part of the gender gap in major choice. Humphries et al. (2019) use
rich Swedish administrative data to study the role of multidimensional ability and secondary
school track choice on college preparedness and labor market outcomes. They find strong
complementarities between high school decisions and college and post-college outcomes.2


3.3       Earnings Uncertainty

Although a large literature has looked at how the level of earnings is related to college
major choice, less is known about its relationship to the uncertainty in earnings. Several
decades of research has emphasized the importance of earnings risk and life-cycle earnings
growth in understanding human capital investment choices. One strand of this past work
suggests that lifetime earnings risk varies significantly across education and occupations, and
that these differences are an important driver of choices (Flyer (1997); Nielsen and Vissing-
Jorgensen (2006); Bonin et al. (2007); De Paola and Gioia (2012); Belzil and Leonardi (2013);
Fouarge et al. (2014); Barth et al. (2017); Dillon (2018)). Educational investment can be
viewed as a risky investment and therefore agents may demand a higher premium for careers
with more risk. Using this framework, Saks and Shore (2005)) focus on the relationship
between earnings risk and major choice and find that Education, Health and Engineering
are "safe" investments whereas Business, Sales and Entertainment related majors are more
risky. Additionally, they find evidence of sorting by wealth into these high-risk majors,
particularly Business.


3.4       Identifying the Labor Market Returns to Major Choice

A related literature focuses on methods of identifying the labor market returns to college
major choice. The key econometric problem is that college majors are self-selected, and
  2
      Jain et al. (2018) study STEM high school track choice and its relationship to earnings in India. They
show that studying Science in high school is associated with 22 percent higher earnings than studying
Business or Humanities.

                                                     14
there can be sorting into majors based on factors that affect the labor market return. For
example, there could be sorting on comparative advantage whereby students who choose to
study Engineering tend to be good at Engineering relative to teaching, and therefore have a
higher labor market return to an Engineering degree relative to a degree in teaching. For this
reason, the observed earnings differences by major (as we show above) would be a biased
estimate of the labor market return. There can also be sorting on absolute advantage as
potential labor market earnings could be correlated with unobserved skills or non-pecuniary
tastes which affect major choices. For example, if students with greater overall labor market
ability have preferences for non-pecuniary characteristics of Business majors, they would
sort by absolute advantage into Business. Once again, this would result in biased estimates
of the returns to a Business major.
   Several recent papers have used variation in demand side driven labor market returns to
study the responsiveness of college major choices to earnings. Beffy et al. (2012) estimate
the earnings elasticity using a sequential model of schooling. They exploit variation in the
French business cycle to identify earnings elasticities. More recently, Long et al. (2015),
using descriptive analysis, find a significant relationship between lagged occupation-specific
wages and college major choice in related fields. This relationship is stronger for fields that
are closely connected to specific occupations. There is also evidence that exposure to higher
unemployment rates makes students choose majors with higher earnings (Blom et al., 2019;
Bedard and Herman, 2008). Similarly, in a recent paper, Abramitzky et al. (2019) take
advantage of a unique setting in traditional Israeli communities, where Israeli kibbutzim
shifted from their traditional policy of equal sharing to productivity-based wages. In this
setting of very low initial returns to education, they find that the large increase in the rate of
return and its sharp variation across fields of study led to a large increase in the probability
of receiving a Bachelor's degree (by 3.3 percentage points), especially in fields of study with
high financial returns, such as STEM (3.8 percentage point increase).
   Other studies have tried to address the selection issue using rich measures of otherwise un-
observed determinants. Many studies use various measures and correlates of ability, including
demographic characteristics, test scores, high school GPA, parental income and education.
Additionally, some research includes measures of college quality (Loury and Garman, 1995;


                                               15
Rumberger and Thomas, 1993), high school curriculum (Altonji, 1993; James et al., 1989),
personality traits (Webber, 2014), and course content (Hamermesh and Donald, 2008). The
methods used range from regressions with rich sets of control variables, to more sophisticated
methods correcting for selection, including Webber (2014) who implements the approach by
Altonji et al. (2005) and control function approaches (Berger, 1988). However, as is typical,
crucial to a credible identification strategy is the presence of an exclusion restriction. In
practice, variables that affect the choice of major but do not affect wages are hard to come
by.
      A branch of the literature has exploited eligibility requirements in various countries to
implement a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design (Bertrand et al., 2010; Hastings et al.,
2013; Kirkeboen et al., 2016; Andrews et al., 2017). Many countries allocate students to
majors competitively based on various admissions criteria. Students provide a ranking of
the programs, and a centralized system allocates students to their most preferred choice
conditional on qualifying for the program. RD designs compare students who were just
above the admissions threshold to those who were just below the threshold, provided there
are sufficient number of observations around the cutoff. A challenge for implementing this
design in the context of major choices is that choices are multiple and unordered. For this
reason, the treatment effect of choosing a major is relative to a mixture of students who
chose all other majors. In order to identify the treatment effect of choosing a major relative
to a second major, studies make further assumptions (Hastings et al., 2013) or use additional
information on rankings (Kirkeboen et al., 2016).
      The post-secondary system in Chile has score-based admissions rules which allows Hast-
ings et al. (2013) to estimate the returns to various degree programs using an RD approach.
They parameterize earnings as a linear function of comparative advantage in each major
and absolute advantage. Their RD design eliminates selection on absolute advantage. They
then express the comparative advantage as a function of observables and assume that there
is no selection into fields based on unobservables that influence earnings for those near the
cutoff. This allows them to calculate the field specific premia for those near the threshold
for particular values of the observables. They find heterogeneous returns and particularly
high returns to selective degrees such as Health, Science and Social Science.


                                               16
   Kirkeboen et al. (2016) use data from Norway where a similar centralized process for
admission into most universities exists. They use information on course rankings and dis-
continuity in cutoffs to implement a next-best alternative identification strategy. This ap-
proach identifies the returns to a chosen field relative to a next best alternative, allowing
for heterogeneity in returns along this dimension. They find that different fields have widely
different payoffs depending on alternatives. For example, by choosing Science instead of
Humanities, individuals vastly increase their earnings early in their working career, whereas
if they choose Science instead of Engineering, they have a low return to their major.
   Eckardt (2020) is one of the first papers to estimate the returns to various combinations of
college majors and occupations, in a particular context of apprenticeships in Germany. She
takes advantage of detailed administrative data on German apprentices, which links training
and occupations. She links this database to historical data on occupation specific vacancies,
which serve as close proxies for occupation specific labor demand. She then uses expected
vacancies in occupations other than the chosen training occupation as instruments for a
particular training choice. Similarly, she uses shocks to these expectations in occupations
other than the chosen one as instruments for a particular occupation choice. Eckardt (2020)
finds that workers employed in occupations related to their training earn 10 to 12 percent
more than those who are employed in occupations different from their training. This suggests
that there are positive returns to specialization in such a system.
   The choice of occupation closely mediates this relationship between earnings and ma-
jor choice and so, researchers have been looking at various methods of understanding this
mapping.


3.5    Majors and Occupations

There is an emerging literature that studies the relationship between college major choice
and occupations. Several papers have shown the degree to which majors are concentrated in
certain occupations (Ransom et al., 2014; Black et al., 2003; Altonji et al., 2012; Lemieux,
2014; Ransom, 2016). In a recent paper, Sloane et al. (2019) document these mappings
and substantial gender differences in these choices. Even conditional on major, women
systematically choose lower potential wage and lower potential hours-worked occupations

                                              17
than men. There is also research that has examined the extent to which workers report that
their work activities are unrelated to the college major (Robst, 2007).
   Past work has modified structural models of human capital investment to account for
the specificity of skill gained by specialization in college. Kinsler and Pavan (2015) , in
their structural model of human capital, allow for both skill uncertainty and differential
accumulation of human capital across majors. The model is a dynamic Roy Model where
workers select into their major, and then their job type. Both the math and verbal human
capital evolve and students observe noisy signals about their human capital during college
but learn about their true human capital in the labor market when they choose a job.
Their findings indicate that the average returns to obtaining a Business or Science degree,
although quite large, are smaller than the raw gaps would indicate. The combination of skill
uncertainty and the specificity of the return appear to make majoring in a Science related
field less attractive.
   Related work by Arcidiacono et al. (2017) has used extensive data on subjective expecta-
tions, especially on outcomes from counterfactual choices and choice probabilities of majors
and occupations. By explicitly eliciting beliefs about probabilities and expected returns to
particular majors and occupations from Duke University undergraduate students, they are
able to identify a model of occupational choice with minimal assumptions on beliefs and
preferences. They find large differences in expected earnings across occupations, and com-
plementarities between majors and occupations. They find that sorting is largely driven by
non-monetary factors. Recognizing the multidimensional nature of skills (Heckman et al.,
1998; Keane and Wolpin, 1997), an alternative "task-based" approach has been employed by
Stinebrickner et al. (2020) to study the role of differences in task-specific skill accumulation
for explaining the gender wage gap. Importantly, by collecting longitudinal job-level task in-
formation as well as explicit time allocation information to circumvent issues typically faced
by the literature, they find that (1) majors are strongly related to current period tasks. For
example, business majors spend over 33 percent more time in high skilled tasks that interact
with information than Humanities majors; (2) there is also substantial variation in these task
specific measures by gender, within major. For example, women in Social Science majors
spend 21 percent less time on high skilled tasks that interact with information than men.


                                              18
These task measures, in turn, account for a considerable fraction of the gender wage gap.
This emphasizes the need for more research on understanding the determinants of major
and occupation choice, and the role of pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors in the decision
process.



4     Learning and Dynamics
A stream of research has tried to rationalize major switching by modeling the process by
which a student chooses her college major. The choice of major can be viewed as the outcome
of a learning process through which an individual gradually learns his or her "match quality"
with the major. This approach is in the spirit of learning models used in the context of other
educational outcomes (Manski, 1989; Altonji, 1993), where students learn not only about
their own ability in school but also about their labor market returns from graduating with
the majors.
    Arcidiacono (2004) incorporates learning in a dynamic model of college major choice
where the uncertainty emerges from imperfect information about ability. He finds that this
is particularly important in the context of major switches and drop out decisions. For
example, students who perform poorly may find it beneficial to switch into a less difficult
major or to drop out altogether. Related to this, Stange (2012) studies the option value
of college attendance using a dynamic structural model. He models the decision to enroll
in two-year or four-year college as well as enrollment and grade outcomes. Enrollment, in
his model, has value because it resolves uncertainty along various dimensions: collegiate
aptitude, non-persistent shocks to the relative cost of college, and finally uncertainty related
to wage outcomes. Arcidiacono et al. (2016a) build on the previous work and allows for
imperfect information about schooling ability as well as labor market productivity. Their
innovation is to allow for correlated learning through college grades and wages, whereby
individuals may leave or re-enter college as a result of the arrival of new information on their
ability and productivity. Their findings stress the importance of informational frictions.
    A body of work collects panel data from currently enrolled college students about their
expectations regarding completing various majors and outcomes (such as earnings). Stine-


                                              19
brickner and Stinebrickner (2012, 2014a,b) use data from their Berea Panel Study and find
that students are over-optimistic about attaining a Science degree, and a large number of
those students eventually switch out of those majors. The over-optimism can be attributed
to biased beliefs about own ability to perform well in Science courses. Similarly, in a different
paper, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2014a) find that 45 percent of dropouts that occur
in the first two years of college can be attributed to what students learn about their academic
performance, but that this type of learning becomes a less important determinant of dropout
after the midpoint of college. In their unique setting in Berea College, students receive a
full tuition subsidy (and a large room and board subsidy). This allows them to focus on
non-financial explanations for dropping out, namely learning about academic performance.
Finally, Gong et al. (2019b) investigate how uncertainty about future income is resolved in
college. They find that roughly a third of the income uncertainty present at the time of
entrance is resolved by the end of college, primarily through factors such as college GPA and
major.
   Zafar (2011) studies expectations formation using a sample of sophomore students in
Northwestern University and finds that students do have biased beliefs about their own major
specific ability. Students are likely to overestimate their own future academic performance.
However, he finds that students revise their expectations in a way that is consistent with
Bayesian updating. Other work using subjective expectations surveys such as Arcidiacono
et al. (2012a) at Duke University also finds a similar overestimation of self ability.
   Similarly, Wiswall and Zafar (2015) conduct an information experiment on undergraduate
students at New York University and collect beliefs about their own earnings at various
points in the life cycle as well as population earnings (that is, the students' beliefs about
the earnings of current college graduates). Using this rich panel of beliefs, they study the
extent to which students are biased in their beliefs about population earnings as well as their
responsiveness to information about these earnings. Their findings indicate that students
have biased beliefs about earnings and there is considerable heterogeneity in errors, which is
uncorrelated with observable characteristics. Unique to their study, they are able to study
how students revise their self beliefs, and find substantial heterogeneity in the students'
updating heuristics.


                                               20
   The importance of information frictions has also been studied by complementing experi-
mental variation with large scale surveys by Hastings et al. (2015). Information on earnings
and cost outcomes by major, provided to college applicants in Chile, caused low income
students to reduce their demand for low return degrees. They find that these interventions
are important for reducing uncertainty about college outcomes.
   Finally, Conlon (2019), in a field experiment at a flagship state university, finds that
students, on average, underestimate mean salaries by majors. However, he finds large het-
erogeneity in beliefs across students, similar to other research. Importantly, he finds that
students who are treated with earnings information about a given field are significantly more
likely to major in that field. Thus, existing evidence shows that information frictions are
important in this context, and that simple information interventions can have meaningful
impacts on beliefs and major choice.
   Looking beyond earnings information, there are now several papers that explore other
interventions or natural variation to investigate student-major mismatch. Fricke et al. (2018)
exploit a natural experiment in a Swiss university that allows them to test whether exposure
to a field (in the form of a research term paper in the first year of studies) influences major
choice. They find compelling evidence that writing in the field increases share of students
in that major. Likewise, Patterson et al. (2019) find that students at the United States
Military Academy who are randomly assigned to take certain courses during (as opposed to
after) the semester when they have to select a major are more likely to choose a major that
corresponds to the course. Given the low switching costs, this is a puzzle and suggests that
timing of exposure to subject content can be a crucial aspect of major choice--something
that is not very well understood. Arcidiacono et al. (2016b) studies the implications of better
matching for minority Science graduation rates at University of California campuses. Less
prepared minorities at higher ranked campuses had lower persistence rates in Science and
took longer to graduate. Additionally, they stress the importance of information and better
matching of students to courses and universities for improving persistence rates.
   Relatedly, Bordon and Fu (2015) study the possibilities of student-major mismatches
using college-major-specific admissions policies in post-secondary education in Chile. They
study the equilibrium effects of postponing student choice of major using a model that al-


                                              21
lows for match uncertainty and peer effects. Their estimates indicate that allowing students
to postpone their major choice leads to an increase in average student welfare. In a com-
plimentary paper, Malamud (2011) also examines the effects of changes in the timing of
specialization, exploiting variation in the British system of specialization in England and
Scotland. The outcome of interest in his setting is whether students switch to an occupa-
tion unrelated to their specialization. Interestingly, he finds that individuals in England
who specialize early are more likely to switch to an unrelated occupation. However, higher
wage growth among those who switch eliminates the wage differences between Scotland and
England after several years.



5     Subjective Expectations
The studies that we have reviewed in Section 3 use revealed preference data to understand
the drivers of major choice. The goal for the researcher is to recover parameters of the
utility function from actual observed data. In general, this requires three additional layers of
assumptions: i) an assumed mapping between revealed or actual post-graduation earnings to
beliefs about earnings (or any other elements of post-graduation utility) for the major that is
chosen, ii) an assumed model for counterfactual beliefs about earnings (or any other elements
of post-graduation utility) in majors not chosen, and iii) an assumed distribution of tastes
for all majors. The prior literature makes various types of (implicit or explicit) assumptions
along these dimensions. This approach overlooks the fact that subjective expectations may
be different from objective measures, assumes that formation of expectations is homogeneous
(conditional on some observables), and uses choice data to infer decision rules conditional
on maintained assumptions on expectations. This can be problematic since observed choices
might be consistent with several combinations of expectations and preferences, and the list
of underlying assumptions may not be valid. This identification challenge has been outlined
by (Manski (1993)), and has spurred a large literature on the direct elicitation of subjective
expectations (see Manski (2004) for a review of earlier work in this space.
    In order to understand the determinants of college major choice, a growing body of
research has incorporated subjective expectations and, in some cases, exploited information


                                              22
experiments. These studies use information about expectations about earnings (as well as
other outcomes) conditional on graduating with a major and the probability of pursuing
each of these majors. Importantly, to estimate choice models, the researcher needs to elicit
expectations not only for the chosen major but also the counterfactual majors. This approach
requires the researcher to collect their own data and is typically restricted to one academic
institution.
       The earliest attempt that we are aware of that collects subjective expectations data in
the context of college majors is the Berea Panel Study (BPS). The BPS, starting in the
early 2000s, collected detailed information from Berea College students, every semester, re-
garding their expectations over outcomes, such as college major choice, as well as potential
determinants of these outcomes. These data, for example, are useful in understanding how
students learn and resolve uncertainty about major choice over the course of their studies
(Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2014b). Other papers that have used this dataset include
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008, 2012, 2014b). This high-frequency data is valuable
in characterizing uncertainty at various stages in college, that might be important for deter-
mining the timing of information interventions.
       Zafar (2013) is the first effort that uses subjective expectations data, collected from
Northwestern University undergraduate students, to directly estimate a model of college
major choice.3 His results point to low earnings elasticities, as is the case with previous papers
(Arcidiacono, 2004). Arcidiacono et al. (2012b) collect similar data from Duke undergraduate
male students, and similarly find that both expected earnings and ability are important
drivers of major choice. They also document substantial errors in students' perceptions
of major-specific earnings in the population. Their simulations show that a non-trivial
proportion of students would switch majors if they had accurate perceptions. Wiswall and
Zafar (2015) further use an information experiment and a panel of beliefs to difference out
major-specific tastes, that may be correlated with expected earnings. The argument being
that students who have positive tastes for a given major may also expect to earn more in
that major. Accounting for this, they find that earnings elasticities are even smaller. The
   3
       Beyond the choice of college majors, Delavande (2008) is the first paper that estimates a random utility
choice model using solely subjective expectations data. Their application is the choice of birth control.



                                                       23
methodological innovation in this approach is to elicit a panel of choice probabilities as well
beliefs about the potential determinants of these choices before and after an experimental
intervention. By creating this panel over a short time period, this approach creates a setting
where there are minimal changes in the environment and therefore any changes in choices can
be credibly attributed to the intervention. This approach has spurred a literature that has
increasingly employed information interventions to understand the formation of expectations
and the link with behavior, in other contexts (for example, see Armona et al. (2019) in the
context of home price expectations and Coibion et al. (2020) in the context of inflation
expectations.
   Most of the papers on college major choice do not elicit beliefs regarding occupation
characteristics after graduating from a particular major. However, as mentioned earlier,
Arcidiacono et al. (2017) elicits additional beliefs on occupation-specific probabilities condi-
tional on pursuing a major as well as expected earnings for each of those major-occupation
pairs. The study finds a large role of non-pecuniary factors in occupation choice.
   Another advantage of collecting subjective expectations data directly from individuals
at a stage prior to their major choice is that the data can be used to directly recover ex
ante treatment effects, that is, how the student believes the college major will affect their
future outcomes. This concept is distinct from ex post treatment effects of majors. It is,
after all, the ex ante beliefs, and not ex post outcomes, that are relevant for understanding
behavior. Data on ex-ante expectations also allow the researcher to characterize the nature
of sorting. Both Wiswall and Zafar (2019) and Arcidiacono et al. (2017) show evidence of
students sorting based on ex ante returns into majors and occupations, respectively.
   It is also worth noting that several papers in this growing literature have followed these
students over time, and validated that subjective expectations are indeed predictive of fu-
ture outcomes (Arcidiacono et al. (2017); Wiswall and Zafar (2019); Gong et al. (2019a);
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2014b)).
   Finally, many papers in this area have employed the estimates from these choice models to
understand gender differences in college major choice. They find that most of the differences
in college major choice by gender can be attributed to differences in "tastes" (Zafar, 2013;
Wiswall and Zafar, 2018). Zafar (2013) finds that even though enjoying coursework and


                                              24
gaining parental approval are the most important determinants of major choice for both
genders, the two genders differ in various other preferences. Men care about pecuniary
outcomes to a much larger degree than women. Several consequent studies have tried to
understand this "taste" component (Wiswall and Zafar, 2019, 2018). We explore these
explanations in more detail in the next few sections.
   Although recent advances allow researchers more flexibility to estimate models without
making strong assumptions about students' expectations at the time of the decision, the
data available to researchers typically do not allow them to incorporate individual-specific
risk and discounting components into utility. And, as a consequence, past research instead
typically assumes particular functional forms for utility and imposes homogeneity. This is
despite the well-documented heterogeneity of risk aversion and discounting across individuals
(see Niederle (2014) for a review) and the evidence suggesting that these measures are related
to educational sorting.
   Some recent progress in this area is Patnaik et al. (2020), who use a unique dataset of
beliefs of NYU students with three key features: a) individual beliefs about the level of earn-
ings, earnings growth, and earnings uncertainty for a set of possible college major choices,
b) survey-based individual measures of risk tolerance and patience, and c) an experimental
component. This is the same dataset used by Wiswall and Zafar (2015). Consistent with
prior literature, they find that women, on average, are more risk averse and patient than
men and that there is substantial heterogeneity in these measures within gender. The pa-
per's methodological innovation is to use these individual-specific measures on time and risk
preferences in a life-cycle model of college major choice, while imposing limited structure on
the choice problem. They find that models which assume standard, homogeneous levels of
discounting and risk aversion are likely to overestimate how sensitive students' college major
choices are to expected earnings.
   Additionally, some recent work has explored the role of other traits in explaining gender
differences in major choice. Buser et al. (2014), for example, find that secondary school boys
in the Netherlands are substantially more competitive than girls. Their experimental mea-
sure of competitiveness is positively correlated with choosing a more prestigious high school
academic track. Importantly, it can explain nearly a fifth of the gender gap in track choice.


                                              25
Similarly , Reuben et al. (2017) use an experiment to measure competitiveness and overcon-
fidence among NYU undergraduate students, and link these measures to expectations about
earnings and major choice. They find gender differences in competitiveness and overconfi-
dence. Notably, they find that both overconfidence and competitiveness are systematically
related to earnings expectations, but neither seems to explain college major choice.



6     Non-Wage Considerations
The existing major choice literature has found that while choices are responsive to expected
future earnings, the choice elasticity is relatively low, suggestive of non-pecuniary consid-
erations potentially being quite important. In college, these non-pecuniary concerns may
include the enjoyability of courses, something that has been found to be important for ma-
jor choice (Zafar, 2013), as well as for explaining socioeconomic gaps in college attendance
(Boneva and Rauh, 2019).
    The non-pecuniary concerns post college can include how major choice affects job ameni-
ties and various family domains (marriage, spouses, children). Several studies have doc-
umented the relationship between educational attainment and marriage market prospects
and the implications for inter-generational mobility. For example, Eika et al. (2019) show
descriptive evidence on assortative mating from Denmark, Germany, Norway, the United
Kingdom, and the United States to document the degree of educational assortative mating.
Recent papers have analyzed the role of marriage market returns in human capital invest-
ment (Iyigun and Walsh, 2007; Ge, 2011; Attanasio and Kaufmann, 2017; Kaufmann, 2014;
Lafortune, 2013; Chiappori et al., 2009, 2017). Studies have further looked at the returns to
the quality of human capital investment: Kaufmann et al. (2013) focuses on estimating the
marriage market return of attending an elite university. In an RD design which exploits the
centralized admission system in Chile, they find that attending a higher ranked university
program has positive returns in terms of partner quality (as measured by the partner's test
scores and socioeconomic background), and in terms of children's test scores. Similarly, a
different line of research studies the role of job amenities associated with careers and the im-
plications for human capital decisions (Bertrand et al., 2010; Goldin and Katz, 2011; Flabbi


                                              26
and Moro, 2012; Goldin, 2014; Kleven et al., 2019). This concern is particularly relevant for
studying gender gaps in career choices and labor market outcomes, where we might expect
that certain job amenities such as workplace hours flexibility is particularly important to
women who anticipate labor market disruptions due to childcare.
   Wiswall and Zafar (2019) and Gong et al. (2019a) study the relationship between major
choice and expectations about marriage and labor supply by directly collecting subjective
expectations data from college students. In their sample of NYU students, Wiswall and Zafar
(2019) find that both men and women in their sample anticipate that the choice of major
would have a large impact on marriage timing, spousal quality, fertility timing, as well as
the number of children. For example, both men and women perceive a positive return in the
marriage market from completing their degree, with men on average perceiving their chance
of being married to be over 35 percent higher, and women perceiving it to be 13 percent
higher. Additionally, female students perceive a marriage penalty to completing a degree in
Science and Business, believing that if they complete these degrees it would delay marriage.
Overall, they find that "family" considerations ­ marriage, spousal earnings, and fertility
­ are economically and statistically significant correlates of major choice, but primarily for
women. They also show that omission of these variables biases upwards the importance of
earnings in major choice.
   A growing body of research uses observational data to investigate non-pecuniary con-
siderations in the context of major choice. Bronson (2014) shows the importance of work
hours flexibility and changes in divorce laws and divorce risk in explaining longer term trends
in major choices. She provides reduced-form evidence that higher earning degrees provide
insurance for women, especially in the case of divorce. Additionally, majors differ substan-
tially in the degree of "work-family flexibility they offer, such as the size of wage penalties for
temporary reductions in labor supply. She then uses a structural model to test the effects of
educational and work-family flexibility policies on educational choices, and finds that some
"family-friendly" policies, such as extended maternity leaves, increase the gender gap in ma-
jors further, while part-time work entitlements and child care subsidies have the potential to
reduce the gap. Similarly, Wasserman (2015) uses data on US medical school graduates to
study the relationship between workplace characteristics and women's fertility choices. The


                                                27
author investigates this question by studying a 2003 policy that capped the average work
week for medical residents at 80 hours. She finds that when a specialty reduces its weekly
hours, more women enter the specialty. More recently, Artmann et al. (2018) estimate the
causal effects of field of study on a variety of family outcomes such as having a partner,
own earnings, partner and household earnings, and number and "quality" of children. They
exploit admissions lotteries for 16 cohorts in universities in the Netherlands and compare
students who won the lottery and majored in their preferred field with students who did not
win and entered their next best field. Their evidence supports the hypothesis that field of
study matters for partner choice, although they do not find any effect on fertility.
    Finally, Wiswall and Zafar (2018) use a hypothetical choice methodology to estimate pref-
erences for workplace attributes from their sample of high-ability undergraduates attending
NYU. They estimate that women on average have a higher willingness-to-pay (WTP) for
jobs with greater work flexibility and job stability, and men have a higher WTP for jobs
with higher earnings growth. In their sample, students perceive jobs to differ along these
dimensions. And because students anticipate that majors are linked to certain jobs, these
job preferences affect college major choices. Providing some validation of the data collection,
they also show that these preferences elicited in college are related with characteristics of
actual workplaces reported in a follow-up survey four years after graduation. They conclude
that in this sample, gender differences in preferences for non-wage amenities explain at least
a quarter of the early career gender wage gap.



7     Family, Peers, and Role Models
A sizable literature has examined the impact of family, peers, and role models on major
choice. This literature often finds important effects, and can provide a partial explanation
for the (gender, race, and SES) gaps observed in major choice. In this section, we review
this strand of the literature.




                                              28
7.1    Decision Making within the Family

Some work has explored the role of family in college major choice. Although most of the
literature has looked at college major choice as an individual choice problem, the choice of
major can also be viewed as an outcome of interactive decision making within the family,
including the student's parents or siblings. There is some innovative work that has stud-
ied group decision making under uncertainty in the context of education (Giustinelli, 2016;
Attanasio and Kaufmann, 2014). Zafar (2012, 2013) uses unique data on subjective expecta-
tions gathered from undergraduate students in Northwestern University and finds that that
parental approval is an important factor for choosing majors, particularly in the context of
double majors. Students believe that their parents are more likely to approve of majors
associated with high social status and high returns in the labor market. Xia (2016) shows
that students learn about earnings in different majors through the wages of their parents
and older siblings. In addition, she shows that the probability of a student choosing a major
related to the occupation of a close family member is strongly correlated with the family
member's wages at the time the student is choosing the major. This suggests a family-based
wage information channel. Oguzoglu and Ozbeklik (2016) show that, in families with a father
in a STEM occupation, the likelihood of a woman choosing a STEM major is significantly
lower if she has brothers. This points to some interesting transmission of information and/or
preferences within the family that depends on household composition. More recently, Neil-
son et al. (2020) shows causal evidence from Chile, Croatia, and Sweden that the college
and major choice of younger siblings is significantly affected by their older siblings' choices.
Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits the centralized admissions systems in
these countries, they show that younger siblings in each country are significantly more likely
to apply and enroll in the same college and major that their older sibling was assigned to.
   These papers suggest that dynamics within the family matter in the choice of major.
Evidence indicates that this is, partly, due to inter- and intra- generational transfer of in-
formation and preferences. However, we have a limited understanding of the underlying
mechanisms. Similar conclusions are reached by Giustinelli and Manski (2018) in their re-
view of family decision-making in the context of secondary schooling.



                                              29
7.2      Peers

In recent years, a large literature has emerged that investigates the role of peers in major
choice. Sacerdote (2001) exploits the random assignment of freshman year roommates at
Dartmouth College to study the effects of peers in student outcomes. While he finds evidence
of peers affecting grade point averages and social activities of students, he finds no evidence
of major choice being impacted by peers. De Giorgi et al. (2010), exploiting the random
assignment of students to sections in mandatory courses in the initial semesters at Bocconi
University, finds that students are more likely to choose a major that their peers choose.
   Peer effects have also been explored as a possible explanation for the gender gap in
major choice. Feld and Z¨
                        olitz (2018), using an identification strategy similar to De Giorgi
et al. (2010), find that high-achieving male peers increase (decrease) the likelihood of male
(female) students taking Math courses. Similarly, Z¨
                                                   olitz and Feld (2019) look at peer effects
for women in Business school. Interestingly, they find that women who are randomly assigned
to teaching sections with more female peers are less likely to choose majors such as finance,
which have a large proportion of men. Additionally, having more female peers also causes
women to choose lower paying jobs with fewer hours. Likewise, Griffith and Main (2019) use
data on first year Engineering students in a large selective Engineering school to show that
both race and gender of peers affects grades and persistence in Engineering. They find that
having more peers from minorities improves grades of minorities.


7.3      Professors and Role Models

There is also a literature that has focused on understanding the effects of role models and
professors in major choice, in particular the choice of STEM majors. There is a body of
work that has explored the effect of professor gender or race on various academic outcomes
in college (Canes and Rosen, 1995; Canaan and Mouganie, 2019; Bettinger and Long, 2005;
Hoffman and Oreopoulos, 2007; Fairlie et al., 2014; Kato and Song, 2018; Kofoed et al.,
2019).
   Carrell et al. (2010) studies the role of instructor gender in explaining the gender gap in
STEM majors. They exploit the random assignment of students to professors in mandatory


                                              30
courses at the U.S. Air Force Academy, and find that professor gender has a significant
effect on female students' performance , their likelihood of taking STEM courses as well as
graduating with a STEM degree. In a recent paper, Mansour et al. (2020) also use data
from the US Air Force Academy and exploit the random assignment of students in their
mandatory freshman Math and Science courses to study the effects of professor gender on
post-graduation outcomes such as post-graduate education and the choice of occupation.
Using a panel that tracks students for at least 8 years after graduation, they find that for
high ability female students, exposure to female Math and Science professors is associated
with increases in the probability of graduating with a STEM degree, working in a STEM
occupation, and receiving a STEM masters degree.
        Some recent work has focused on understanding the absence of role models as a possible
explanation for the gender gap in Economics majors.4 Porter and Serra (2019) use a field
experiment where they randomly expose introductory Economics students to role models,
who they characterize as charismatic and successful women alumni. They find that exposure
to successful role models has large effects on interest in pursuing Economics, increasing
enrollment in Economics for female students by 8 percentage points. Similarly, Li (2018)
examines whether mentoring, the provision of additional information, and nudges help reduce
the gender gap in economics majors via a randomized controlled experiment conducted in
introductory economics classes at a large, public, four-year institution. The treatments
substantially increase female students' probability of majoring in economics. The results
show that the treatment effects are heterogeneous and have the most significant impact on
female students with grades above the median.



8         Supply Considerations
So far our discussion of the determinants of college major choice has focused on student level
factors that can influence the demand for majors. However, the choice of major also depends
on various supply side factors determined by universities. We consider three factors that have
    4
        In other work, Bayer et al. (2020) have recently analyzed the pedagogical approach and coursework in
the introductory courses in Economics.



                                                      31
been the focus of recent research: major specific costs/pricing, differences in grading policies
across majors and, finally, local variation in course offerings.


8.1    Pricing

Motivated by the increase in field-specific surcharges levied in a number of public universities
in response to cuts in state funding, a recent body of research considers the effects of major
specific costs on college major choice. Most of these policies have been implemented in high
return majors such as Engineering, Business and Nursing. Some of these differences may
simply be reflecting field specific teaching costs. Using detailed administrative data from
the Florida public university system, Altonji and Zimmerman (2017) report that the costs of
producing graduates in Engineering is almost double of that of producing Business graduates
(a low-cost major).
   The literature, as of now, has found mixed effects of these differential pricing policies
on major choice. Using the staggered adoption of these policies across universities, Stange
(2015) finds a significant decline in the shares of students declaring Engineering in response
to higher costs, and a similar (although noisy) decline in share of students declaring Business.
   One might be inclined to think that most of this effect may be coming from the higher
price responsiveness of the choices of low-income students. However, Evans (2017) finds that
financial aid geared towards STEM majors, in the form of Science and Mathematics Access
to Retain Talent (SMART) grants in the state of Ohio, has a small effect on increasing
the likelihood of students declaring STEM majors. In a recent paper, Andrews and Stange
(2019) studies a major price deregulation policy introduced in Texas in 2003, and finds that
poor students are more likely to major in these high sticker price-high return majors. They
explain these results due to the increased price discrimination which translated to higher
grant aid for poor students. If we believe that low income students are the most price
sensitive students, it is interesting that increased grant aid would increase the likelihood of
majoring in STEM in one setting and have a negligible effect on the other. There is clearly
more to be learned about these policies and the importance of the institutional setting.




                                               32
8.2        Grading and Difficulty

Next, we delve into grading policies and the difficulty of course material, another supply
side consideration that could influences the choice of major. There is evidence that points
to both the existence of differences in grading standards (Dickson, 1984; Freeman, 1999;
Johnson, 2006) and the responsiveness of students to these differences (Butcher et al., 2014).
Majors that have high returns (and have a high demand) such as Engineering also have
lower grades (Sabot and Wakeman-Linn, 1991). Studies have pointed to several possible
explanations for the differences in average grades. On the one hand, faculty may provide
higher grades to increase the demand for courses, particularly in low return majors such as
Humanities majors. On the other hand, instructors in STEM courses (that are often high
demand courses) also demand higher workloads from students (Arcidiacono et al., 2012a).
       Do these grading policies affect major choices? Recent work by Ahn et al. (2019) studies
the relationship between study effort, grading policies, and female interest in STEM majors.
To do this, they build and estimate a structural model of student effort and course choice.
Ahn et al. (2019) shows that these strict grading policies in STEM disproportionately affect
women, contributing to the gender gap in STEM majors.5


8.3        Admissions and Capacity Constraints

Finally, universities often have capacity constraints that limit the number of courses or
majors that they can offer. These capacity constraints can operate through faculty-student
ratios, or constraints on the infrastructure. For example, courses in Engineering often require
lab equipment. Similarly, high demand courses such as Business are constrained by the
number of faculty who are available to teach courses. Universities often employ rationing
devices such as eligibility rules and GPA cutoffs to allot students to majors. There has been
considerable policy debate about how universities should allocate students across majors and
how important the timing of specialization is.
       Researchers have exploited different settings of the post-secondary system to study the
   5
       There is related work on study effort and college outcomes, including a series of papers by Stinebrickner
and Stinebrickner (2003, 2004, 2006, 2008).



                                                        33
implications of admissions policies and capacity constraints in programs. In countries such
as Chile, India and Norway, where majors are decided at the time of admission, there are
cutoffs based on a national exam for admission into programs (combinations of college and
majors). Several studies have exploited these cutoffs as an exogenous variation in the access
to the major to determine the returns to various majors. Bertrand et al. (2010); Hastings
et al. (2013); Kirkeboen et al. (2016) have implemented Regression Discontinuity designs
using this approach in India, Chile and Norway, respectively. Some of these papers have
been discussed in Section 3.
       In countries like the United States, students usually do not choose majors at the time
of admission. In majors with high demand, such as Business, there are typically university
GPA cutoffs to determine entry. Andrews et al. (2017) uses these GPA cutoffs in the state of
Texas to implement an RD design. They find that 60 percent of marginal Business students
would have otherwise majored in STEM fields. They also find that earnings twelve years
after college graduation are higher by 80-120 percent for those induced by the GPA cutoff
rules to major in Business. Similarly, in a more recent paper, Bleemer and Mehta (2020) take
advantage of GPA eligibility requirements in introductory Economics courses for declaring
Economics major in University of California- Santa Cruz. They implement a similar RD
design to estimate the returns to an Economics major and find that for students near the
threshold, declaring a major in Economics increased their annual earnings by $ 22,000 (58
percent).
       In contrast to highly selective universities, some regional universities are unwilling to
offer certain courses, particularly for low-demand courses such as Humanities, as was the
case at the University of Wisconsin- Stevens Point 6 . There has been an emerging literature
that studies such supply side constraints. Bianchi (2019) uses an educational expansion
of Italian STEM course offerings and exploits the selective eligibility of this expansion to
understand how changes in the access to education can change peer effects, school quality,
and the returns to skill.
       Finally, Cook (2020) studies these supply-side constraints in the context of an equilibrium

model of the college market. Universities compete on prices, admissions criteria, as well as
the number of majors offered. Students choose where to apply as well as where to enroll
conditional on receiving an offer. She finds that student willingness-to-pay (WTP) is over
$100 per year for each major offered, although this WTP differs depending on the type of
major.



9     Beyond Undergraduate Degrees
Although most of the work studying specialization in college considers four-year bachelor's
degrees, there is a line of research that focuses on community college and associates degrees
and the returns to those degrees, as well as work on graduate degrees.


9.1      Associates Degrees and Community Colleges

Community college degrees are becoming increasingly common in the US with community
college students comprising 40 percent of the total undergraduate enrollment (Ma and Baum,
2016). The labor market outcomes become even more important in the context of associates
and community college degrees since many of these courses are geared towards training
students for a specific career. Further, a large proportion of these students are likely to be
first generation students and from disadvantaged populations. Understanding labor market
outcomes for these degrees is therefore likely important for understanding social mobility.
    Recent work on the returns to community college programs report strong positive returns
(see Belfield and Bailey (2017) for a detailed review article). Jepsen et al. (2014) uses
administrative data from the state of Kentucky and provides estimates of the labor-market
returns (in terms of quarterly earnings) to community college certificates and diplomas, as
well as estimates of the returns to the more commonly studied associate's degrees. They
use a student fixed effects model that exploits within-student variation (and hence requires
data on earnings from individuals both prior to and after enrolling in a community college ­
something that is typically not readily available), and compare the outcomes of students who
received a community college degree to those who dropped out. The implicit assumption
being that the time-invariant fixed effect adequately controls for selection into who completes

                                              35
the degree. They find that associates degrees and diplomas have quarterly earnings returns
of nearly $2,400 for women and $1,500 for men, compared with much smaller returns for
certificates. There is substantial heterogeneity in returns across fields of study. Similarly,
Liu et al. (2015) examine the relative labor market gains for first-time college students who
entered the North Carolina Community College System. They also find that associate and
bachelor's degrees yield high returns compared to the returns to certificates and diplomas.
Interestingly, they find that even small accumulations of some college credits have returns
in the labor market. Bahr et al. (2015) relaxes the assumption of constant returns over
time to find that the returns to associate degrees are the most durable over time, while
returns to short- and long-term certificates and low-credit awards are strong initially but
begin to flatten or decline by seven years after the award. They find evidence for the need
to distinguish returns after a credential is awarded from returns after a student has finished
(or otherwise left) post-secondary education.
   Community colleges have long been centers for retraining displaced workers. Jacobson
et al. (2005) focuses on the effectiveness of community college training for these workers and
finds large effects. The equivalent of an academic year of community college schooling raises
the long-term earnings of displaced workers by an average of about 9 percent for men and
about 13 percent for women with substantial heterogeneity depending on the course.
   Although subjective expectations have long been studied in the context of four-year
bachelor's degrees (see section 4 for a review of this literature), there is very little evidence
about the extent of bias in perceptions about earnings of community college students. In
a recent paper, Baker et al. (2018) studies students' subjective expectations over earnings
after graduating with a community college degree and use an information experiment along
the lines of Wiswall and Zafar (2015). They find evidence of over-optimism: students believe
that salaries are 13 percent higher than they actually are, on average, and students under-
estimate the probability of being employed by almost 25 percent. They also show that a 10
percent increase in salary leads to a 14 to 18 percent increase in the probability of choosing
a major, which is a much larger elasticity than the estimates for four year undergraduate
students.



                                               36
9.2    Graduate Degrees

There is a great deal of interest in the choice to enroll in a graduate degree and the returns to
various graduate degrees, particularly with the rise in the number of graduate degree holders
over the past few years. Altonji et al. (2016) discusses the increase in the number of graduate
degree holders as well as the importance of studying the returns to these degrees. We discuss
some of their key findings here. Interested readers are referred to Altonji et al. (2016) for an
in-depth discussion of graduate degrees. They report that the share of individuals getting a
master's degree, for the population of US citizens and residents, has increased dramatically
by 240 percent between 1985 and 2013, and this is not entirely due to the increase in the
number of undergraduate degree holders over the same time period. Graduate degrees are
quite heterogeneous in their duration as well as returns. Among students who graduate with
a master's degree, Education and Business are the most popular majors. They collectively
account for 50 percent of the master's degrees over the same time period. Although less
common, Ph.D. degrees have also been increasing in number over the same time period.
   There have been studies that have focused on a particular field. For example, the return
to MBA degrees has been studied by Arcidiacono et al. (2008), using panel data from the
pool of students registered to take the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) in
1990. They find that controlling for individual fixed effects substantially reduced the returns
to an MBA, particularly for schools in the top 25. Similarly, there has been research on the
return to medical degrees (Bhattacharya, 2005; Chen and Chevalier, 2012; Ketel et al., 2016;
Wasserman, 2015). Bhattacharya (2005) finds that there are large returns to specialization of
medical school. Similarly, Chen and Chevalier (2012) study the penalty of long work hours
for women in high income specialties. They find that women would have higher lifetime
earnings if they were physician assistants than family practitioners because they would have
spent less time in medical school and residency programs and would not have faced the
penalty for working fewer hours than their male counterparts.
   Altonji and Zhong (2019) are the first to study a broad set of graduate degrees and
provide estimates for the returns to these degrees. In order to estimate returns to specific
graduate degrees, they use an approach that they call F E - cg approach, which is fixed



                                               37
effects for whether an individual has obtained a particular combination of college major c
and graduate field g . While this approach allows the authors to use all individuals with
earnings observed before the advanced degree and all individuals observed with earnings
after the advanced degree (without imposing that an individual appear both before and
after, as would be required for an individual FE approach), the approach requires that the
ability and preference distributions do not depend on the timing of labor force participation
(whether the individual is observed in the labor market only before, only after, or both before
and after graduate study). They find that the estimated return for law and medicine is 52
percent and 77.5 percent, respectively. The return to an MBA is only 10.1 percent.
   Graduate degrees have been studied to some degree in the context of immigration pol-
icy (Ganguli et al., 2020). Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2019) examine whether a 2008 policy
extending the Optional Practical Training (OPT) period for STEM graduates affected in-
ternational students' propensities to major in a STEM field. They find that foreign born
students are in fact highly responsive in terms of their major choice to immigration policy
that improves their job finding rates in the United States.



10      Conclusion
Given the choice of major is an important determinant of future earnings and welfare, and
a factor in influencing the overall economy, a growing literature has examined factors that
affect college major choice. We highlight key findings that emerge from this literature. One,
earnings differentials remain even after controlling for selection, although the responsiveness
of students to earnings is very low. This is consistent across various studies and institutional
settings. Two, there is a role of learning about one's own ability in determining the final
major choice. Three, sorting in majors is primarily driven by non-pecuniary components,
often interpreted as "tastes" for majors. This has spurred a recent literature that studies
several non-pecuniary considerations that can demystify the "taste" component. This in-
cludes marriage and fertility considerations as well as workplace characteristics, particularly
in the context of understanding gender gaps in major choice. Researchers have also explored
differences in risk and time preferences, the lack of role models as well as differences in confi-


                                               38
dence and optimism to study these gaps. Fourth, researchers have stressed the importance of
not assuming full information or rational expectations, as subjective expectations data has
revealed substantial bias in students' beliefs and that students logically update their beliefs
in response to experimentally provided information. Finally, an emerging literature studies
several supply side factors that can affect major choice and serve as some policy levers to
change the major composition.
   Several avenues emerge for future research, and we list here a few key areas. First,
there is still important work to be done in understanding the role of college majors in the
labor market. This relates to an understudied area: the relationship between majors and
occupations. Although there is some recent work on mapping majors to occupations, there is
surprisingly scarce evidence on how firms value students with different majors for a particular
occupation and the extent to which the major serves as a productive type of human capital
versus a signal of ability. For example, why do firms often hire engineer undergraduates for
management consultancy jobs? This relates to specificity of skills in majors and its mapping
to occupations.
   Another area we foresee as an important area of future research is how family back-
ground induces sorting into college majors, since that has the potential to have important
implications for inter-generational mobility. Although a large literature has studied the role
of family income on college attendance and completion, there is little work (descriptive or
otherwise) on how family income affects major choice. As we show, there is a systematic
relationship between parental education and college major choice, and this correlational pat-
tern is consistent with Ma (2009), who finds that lower-SES children are more likely to major
in lucrative college majors. However, we do not know the mechanisms through which family
background influences major choice. Recent work on patterns of major switching by minori-
ties and the effect of programs like the Texas Top Ten Percent program on major choice
(Arcidiacono et al., 2016b; Baird et al., 2016; Black et al., 2020) suggest that this will be an
important area for future work.
   Understanding how the choice of major may be impacted by the increasing cost of a col-
lege education (hence increasing student debt) is another important area for future research.
This is partly because the rise in student debt is a relatively recent phenomenon: student


                                              39
debt has more than tripled since 2006.7 Rothstein and Rouse (2011) find that a policy that
replaced loans in financial aid packages with grants at a highly selective university had an
impact on the kinds of jobs students chose after graduation, but had no meaningful impact
on major choice (though their estimate is quite imprecise). Likewise, students with debt are
increasingly enrolling in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which set monthly payments
to a fixed proportion of the borrower's income and forgive the remaining balance after a
certain number of years. Such plans have been shown to increase the financial health of stu-
dent loan borrowers (Herbst, 2020). But, at this stage, we do not know how such plans may
affect the choice of major of students. In addition, in recent years, a number of universities
have implemented income-share agreements (ISA) with terms of repayment that depend on
college major. ISA is essentially a "human capital" contract in which the student agrees to
pay a fixed percentage of future earnings for a fixed time period in exchange for payment of
college tuition today. In this way, the university provides insurance against future income
risk. Mumford (2018) uses administrative data from Purdue University to estimate the ex-
tent of selection into ISA. He finds that selection into ISA is mostly a function of parental
characteristics, salary differences across majors, and location preferences and so far, there is
no evidence of adverse selection on ability. These programs are quite new and much more
research is needed to understand the impact of these programs on college major choice and
the optimal design and implementation of such income share agreements.
      Finally, the gender gap in major choice remains a dynamic area of research. We know
that gender differences in college preparedness cannot explain this gap: girls perform at least
as well, if not better, than boys in school in both math and non-math fields (Goldin et al.,
2006). Gender differences in preferences for non-pecuniary factors and tastes remains the
main explanation for gender gaps in major choice. In this review article, we have mentioned
studies that try to unpack the black box of tastes. Work that makes further progress on this
front will be valuable.
      We do not yet know the answers to arguably first-order questions. For example, students
who intend to major in Business and Economics majors tend to have higher risk tolerance,
whereas students who major in Engineering and Natural Sciences are less risk averse (Pat-
  7

naik et al., 2020). However, the extent to which this reflects sorting into majors along this
dimension versus a causal impact of training in these fields onto these traits is not known.
Likewise, STEM jobs have been argued to require higher cognitive skills but not necessar-
ily higher social skills or creativity, which seem to be more important for later-life career
trajectories (Deming and Noray, 2019). Again, the extent to which different majors foster
soft skills remains unknown. Given the socioeconomic patterns of sorting into majors that
we have described earlier ­ with students from higher SES backgrounds being more likely
to sort into the liberal arts majors ­ the extent to which this pattern is driven by selection
is unclear. Thus, given the sequential nature of educational choices, data collection efforts
that start at earlier ages of children (and collect data on soft skills, behavioral traits, and
cognitive measures) and then follow them over time would be particularly valuable.
   In short, as this review shows, research on college major choice has been increasing rapidly
in the last decade or so. However, there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered and
we hope that researchers continue their work on this exciting area of research.

Appendices
A     Data Description
This appendix provides an overview of the data and the sample construction. We use 3 data
sources: decennial Census, American Community Survey (ACS), and the National Survey
of College Graduates (NSCG). All data sources were accessed from the IPUMS database.


A.1     Decennial Census

To compute college attainment by birth cohort, we use data from decennial Census for years
1960-2000. To minimize completion effects at earlier ages and mortality effects at later
ages, we limit the sample to respondents aged 25-49 in each data sample. We define college
attainment consistently across years by defining college as 4 or more years of college (16
or more years of schooling). This sample includes respondents with a bachelor's degree, a
master's degree, a professional degree beyond a bachelor's degree or a doctoral degree. This
sample would necessarily also include individuals with 4 years of college but did not complete
a college degree.


A.2     American Community Survey

We use annual ACS data from 2008 to 2018. We form 3 samples for specific purposes.
    We form two samples from the ACS to track educational attainment by birth cohort.
The first ACS sample is used to compute college attainment. We follow our construction
of the Census sample and restrict this sample to those aged 25-49 in each survey year. We
define college attainment following the Census sample, and this sample necessarily includes
some respondents with 4 years of college but no degree.
    The second ACS sample is used to compute undergraduate majors. We restrict this
sample to those who hold a bachelors degree or higher, including those holding a masters
degree, a professional degree beyond a bachelor's degree, or a doctoral degree. Because
mortality differences by major within the college educated population are likely minimal, we


                                             60
include all respondents aged 25-90 in each survey year.
   The ACS contains rich information on the field in which the person received a Bachelor's
degree. We pool data from the ACS for the samples from 2009 to 2018 for which the field of
study was collected. The data contains a very fine categorization of majors upto four digit
CIP codes. For some purposes, we group these majors to three broad categories:

   · Humanities / Social Science / Education

   · STEM (Excluding Business and Economics)

   · Business / Economics

   Table A-1 provides a detailed list of the majors included in these categories.
   We form a third ACS sample to examine recent patterns in employment and earnings
by major. We limit this sample to the population aged 25 to 65 who report having at least
some college. We then define a "no degree" or "No Grad" group as having some college but
no bachelor or higher degree. The major fields are for the bachelor's degree.
   We focus on annualized wage earnings of full-time and full-year workers. Full time is
defined as working at least 35 hours a week and full year as working between 50-52 weeks
a year. We pool ACS data for 2016, 17, and 18. All earnings values are deflated to 2018$.
Earnings are bottom coded at $ 12,293 and top coded at $ 190,000.


A.3     National Survey of College Graduates

The NSCG is a nationally representative survey of college graduates currently residing in the
United States. The NSCG contains detailed classification of the field of study, both at the
undergraduate and graduate levels that allows us to observe parental education gradients in
major choice by detailed major categories.
   We pool the sample of cohorts surveyed in 1993, 2003 and 2010. We restrict the sample
to individuals born in 1970 or later, and older than age 25 at the time of the survey. We
also restrict the sample to college graduates who attended high school in the United States
and those for whom mother's education or field of degree is not missing.
