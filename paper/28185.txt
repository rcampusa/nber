Firms' Exposures to Geographic Risks

                                           ABSTRACT

The distinction between domicile and place of business is becoming more and more relevant as a
growing number of firms have activities abroad. In most statistical studies of international stock
returns, a firm is included in a country's index if its headquarters are located in that country. This
classification scheme ignores the operations of the firm. We propose, instead, to measure the
firms' exposures to "geographic zones" according to the place where they conduct business. As a
representation of "geographic risks", we synthesize zone factors from all firms in the dataset, be
they domestic firms or multinationals. And we show the properties of the exposures to the zone
factors.

         "What is changing is that corporations are becoming more and
      more global in their business activities through increased exports
      and cross-border M&A." Diermeier and Solnik (2001)


     How can one estimate the business risks of operating in one country? If a
country were completely closed to the outside world, the stock returns of ...rms
in that country would provide a good measure of the risks of operating there.
But in an interconnected world, it is not clear which stock returns one should
turn to. The traditional way to measure the business risks in a country is to
use the stock returns of ...rms with headquarters in that country. But some
...rms domiciled in a country may have the bulk of their activities outside of
that country. For instance, the index of the Amsterdam stock exchange, where
many "Dutch" multinationals are traded, is not representative of the risks and
returns attached to investing in operations taking place in the Netherlands.
These national stock indexes, therefore, re     ect the business risks of operating
in many countries, not the risks of that single country. National stock indexes
also leave out ...rms based elsewhere that sell and produce goods in that country,
even though their stock prices also re   ect the business risks of operating in that
country. Furthermore, as time goes by, the composition of commonly available
country indexes evolves not just as to the list of ...rms included in the index but
also as to the locus of the business conducted by the ...rms that are included. We
aim to use the information on the stock returns of all ...rms, not just domestic
ones, to construct a new type of country stock market index. We develop a way
to put together stock market data and data on the ...rms'operations to create
such indexes. We synthesize purely domestic ...rms from all ...rms in the dataset.
So our geographic indexes are quite di¤erent from national stock indexes that
include ...rms in one country on the basis not of their operations, but of their
domicile. We will later compare our indexes with indexes of "national ...rms"
based on a given ISIN country label.1 We adopt our new indexes as de...nitions
of "geographic risks" and estimate individual ...rms' exposures to (or loadings
on) them.
     To measure the business risks of operating in a given geographic location,
we use the information each ...rm provides on the share of revenues earned in
that location. Admittedly, it should not be the share of revenues alone that
serves to measure business risks stemming from that location. We should use
the share of free cash     ows generated there. But that data, unfortunately, is
not available to anyone. Revenues are at best a proxy. For that proxy to be
valid at least approximately when capturing the risks of growth rates, we have
to be assuming that most operating costs are occurring in the same countries
and regions where there are revenues. In that case, the distribution of revenues
across countries and regions will be a proxy for the distribution of free cash
   ows. In short, it is simply assumed, for lack of a better way, that the free cash
   1 The International Securities Identi...cation Number (ISIN) system assigns a two-letter

country label to each ...rm's stock based on their headquarters.

   ows of a ...rm reect only the risks of the places to which it sells its products,
irrespective of its domicile.
     In the geographical segment tables that are required in annual reports, ...rms
choose the way to segment their sales internationally. They might choose to
identify their main trading partners, but they often group other revenues by
region rather than country and sometimes refer to a residual category like "rest
of Europe"or "rest of the world"      . After standardization, we refer to destinations
of sales, which are countries or regions, by the generic term "zones."As discussed
below, we use whatever information is available to place equality and inequality
constraints on some of the loadings of the ...rms on these zones while we estimate
the other loadings. The econometric method is discussed in detail in later
sections. Its role is to ...ll in whichever information on revenues is not available
directly.
     Our reconstruction should be relevant for at least two purposes. First and
principally, corporations contemplating a capital investment in a production or
distribution facility in a particular country need to have a proper description
of the risks inherent in operating facilities in that country, and not of the risks
inherent to being domiciled in the corresponding country.2 Second, a portfolio
manager making an investment decision often does so because he wants to take
a view concerning the economic prospects of a country. He may, for instance,
see higher growth prospects in that country than other investors do and may
accordingly want to pursue a strategy of investing in companies that do business
in that country. Investing in the corresponding country'        s stock market index
is not a clean way to implement that strategy if the companies traded on the
country'  s exchange conduct a good deal of business outside the country. In the
reverse, an investor may want to invest in a country but fear the form of trading
taking place in that country'     s stock market (insider trading, preferential trades
and other corrupt practices). In that case, "investing by proxy"may be a good
alternative. The investor can choose companies in another country that do a
lot of business in the country that is targeted, taking care to hedge away the
business that these companies conduct at home and in other countries.3
     We stress that in the present paper, except for one generic asset-pricing
assumption, which we spell out in Section 3, we make no speci...c assumption
about asset pricing and/or about the degree of integration of ...nancial markets.
And we do not investigate average returns, as would be needed to test a partic-
ular asset-pricing model. We only estimate the zone risk factors ­making some
statistical assumptions to be stated below ­and their correlations, as well as the
...rms' exposures to them. Asset pricing theories that have been developed in
other papers may come into play when interpreting these correlations. Ours is
purely a descriptive statistical model. We are not implying that the risk factors
   2 We  are not denying that there may also exist risk premia for being listed in one country.
See Froot and Dabora (1999) and Chaieb et al. (2020). At present, we do not have a model
to explain such "local-pricing," if it exists. But see the role of "foreign sentiment" in Dumas
et al. (2017).
   3 Subsidiarily, our undertaking may enhance the meaningfulness of cross-country correlation

studies. See Section 7.2.



                                              3
we identify are priced factors under any particular asset-pricing theory.4
      The word "descriptive"is apt. Although the econometric technique we use is
powerful enough to allow us to estimate the factor loadings for several thousands
of ...rms each year, statistical tests to accept or reject the model as a whole are
out of reach because of sheer size, and would not reject any particular hypoth-
esis about the loadings given the large number of parameters being estimated.
Instead, we show that the zone factors themselves are economically reasonable
and meaningful and we run several statistical tests to show that the indexes we
construct do re    ect underlying economic variables signi...cantly.
      Three antecedent articles are close to ours in their method and their goals.
First in chronological order, Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) estimated a factor
model that decomposed each ...rm'      s return into the sum of a country and an
industry factor.5 The loadings only take values of 0 or 1, depending on which
country and which industry it belonged to. We use additional, more continuous
and quantitative data on revenues, thereby allowing loadings to take values
between 0 and 1.
      A second reference is Diermeier and Solnik (2001) which examined monthly
stock returns of 1; 213 individual companies listed in eight large country stock
markets (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, United King-
dom and United States) from July 1989 to January 1999. They have available
data on stock returns, of course, but also data on the shares of activity (i.e., rev-
enues) of ...rms in the domestic country and in the three regions of the globe that
they have chosen to consider.6 The statistical analysis can be described as com-
prising three stages. In a ...rst stage, they construct a domestic market index for
each country as a value-weighted average return of ...rms with mostly domestic
activities. From these they also calculate regional returns as the value-weighted
average of country stock returns and currency returns for countries that belong
to a region. In a second stage, they run exposure regressions on all three types
of indexes. In the third stage of their study, they ask the key question that
motivates the whole undertaking: do these statistical exposures resemble the
shares of revenues?
      The study by Diermeier and Solnik hits the nail on the head but it has
two drawbacks. First, it uses a limited number of ...rms in a limited number of
countries. Developing countries in particular are not covered. Second, and more
importantly, it is implemented in stages. The stage that serves to de...ne pure
domestic indexes only uses the ...rms that have a large share of their activity at
home, and a later stage relates the stock-market statistical exposures (mostly
of the other ...rms) to their share of foreign activity. From the point of view of
statistical theory, it would be more e¢ cient to use all ...rms to do everything in
a single estimation. That is, knowing the geographic distribution of activities
of each ...rm, one should use all the information on all the ...rms to identify the
pure country factors. A Japanese ...rm, to the degree that it conducts operations
   4 Thus, what we do is not incompatible with the existence of extra risk premia not related

to the risks we identify, as in Barrot et al. (2019) or Hoberg and Moon (2019).

   6 There are three regions: Asia, Europe and the United States.

in Switzerland, should also help in identifying the Swiss zone factor.
     A third reference that is germane to our paper is Brooks and Del Negro (2006,
alternatively, 2004). These authors re-estimated the Heston and Rouwenhorst
factor model constraining again the loadings of a ...rm that belonged to a country
and an industry to be equal to 1 on those two factors but leaving the other
loadings unconstrained and, therefore, not necessarily equal to 0. The resulting
number of loadings to be estimated was large. Crucially for us, this feature
led the authors to propose a method that could be calculated ...rm by ...rm, as
opposed to globally for all ...rms, namely the Expectation-Maximization way of
maximizing likelihood (referred to as EM below).
     We expand their work by introducing a more        exible factor model that we
estimate by means of an innovative econometric approach: using revenue data
provided by each ...rm, we add constraints to the EM algorithm in order to
restrict the estimation of factor returns. In that way, our loadings are neither
arbitrarily set equal to 0 or 1, nor for all of them mere statistical estimates;
many of our loadings re     ect actual economic data coming from annual reports.
Because of the constraints, our factors are not orthogonal: geographic risks
are not independent of each other, so that we can meaningfully discuss their
correlations.
     Further a...eld, several authors have, like we do and like the three previous
references did, utilized data beyond stock returns to explain their correlation
structure. A few studies such as Ammer and Wei (1996), Baele and Soriano
(2010), Viceira and Wang (2018), and Akbari et al. (2019) have sought to dis-
tinguish between a common cash-      ow dynamic (interpreted as economic integra-
tion) and a common risk-pricing dynamic (interpreted as ...nancial integration).
Viceira and Wang (2018), for example, ...nd that the increase in correlations
between stocks cannot be attributed to increased correlation between cash       ow
shocks and would, therefore, plausibly come from discount rate shocks. The
geographic origin of the cash       ows is not investigated whereas the origin of
revenues is our main focus. Cavaglia et al. (2004) shows that the increased cor-
relation between countries is due to country factors becoming more correlated as
opposed to industry factors becoming more so.7 A pair of studies by Bekaert et
al. (2011, 2013) took a di¤erent approach by examining di¤erences in earnings
yields rather than their correlations or correlations of stock returns.8 Finally,
Bae et al. (2019) use bilateral export date from developed countries to form
emerging market country indexes based on the share prices of developed country
...rms that sell to emerging markets. The revenue data that we use are broader
than export data (because a multinational'     s foreign sales to an emerging mar-
ket need not involve any exports at all or at least any exports from its country
   7 Heston  and Rouwenhorst (1994) indicate that, even between European ...nancial markets,
which were presumably fairly well integrated, country factors as compared to industry factors
o¤er the higher diversi...cation potential. Goetzman et al. (2005) shows that the correlation
has been present mostly between "core" (basically developed) countries as opposed to other
countries.
   8 They ...nd evidence that markets are becoming more correlated, but like Goetzman et al.,

they ...nd that is truer for developed than for emerging markets.

of domicile). As Bae et al. explain, however, revenue data are not generally
available on a bilateral basis for many countries, so they could not use those to
form emerging market country indexes using their method.9
    The balance of the paper is organized as follows: Sections 1 and 2 describe
the dataset of the ...rms'geographic segments and the di¤erences between tra-
ditional indexes and indexes based on sales. Section 3 outlines the statistical
model to identify pure country indexes. The statistical technique that will serve
to estimate the parameters of the model, namely the EM algorithm, is reviewed
and extended in Section 4. Section 5 addresses the problem of data imbalance.
Section 6 analyzes the composition of the geographic indexes, while Section 7.1
compares the behavior of the geographic and traditional indexes across coun-
tries and Section 7.2 compares the geographic and traditional indexes across
years. Section 8 highlights two key features of the exposures revealed by the
geographic indexes. Section 9 states the conclusions.


1       The dataset on ...rms'geographic segments
The World Vest Base (WVB) database transcribes annual report information for
a very large number of ...rms worldwide. The owner of the database provided us
with data on the distribution of the ...rms'revenues across geographic segments.
We elected to study all the ...rms in the database provided that the Datastream
database contained stock return data for them. Our study covers the years 1999-
2014 inclusive. Unfortunately, annual reports do not contain information on the
distribution of the ...rms'purchases across geographic segments. Only revenues
are reported, with few exceptions.
     The selection and ...ltering of ...rms based on geographic-segment data and
stock-return data is explained in detail in Appendix A. The merging of the two
datasets is explained in the same appendix. The most important ...lter applied to
the original dataset deleted all microcaps. That ...lter alone reduced the number
of securities in 2014 from 17,678 to 6,690. The ...ltering process gave us a set of
...rms that grows from 1,797 in 1999 to 6,335 in 2014.
     A note on vocabulary is needed before we go on. We call "segments " or
destinations, such as countries or regions, the geographic entities that are vari-
ously referred to by ...rms themselves in the geographical segment tables of their
annual reports, as transcribed in the database. The segment information was
the hardest to interpret in the empirical application, due to the non standard-
ized description of regions in the revenues database. Firms often list speci...c
countries responsible for major portions of their revenues (e.g., a French ...rm
listing revenues earned in Germany and the U.S.). But ...rms also list whole re-
gions rather than countries (e.g., Asia). And ...rms often list "Rest of"segments
including "Rest of Europe" in the case of a French ...rm or "Rest of World"       ,
containing countries that the ...rm has not referred to explicitly among its seg-
ments. Typically, the annual report also refers to a country called "Home" or
to "Domestic revenues"    .
    9 See   also Bodnar and Marston (2002) and Bodnar et al. (2002).


                                               6
    By way of contrast, we call "zones " standard geographic entities de...ned by
us that are uniform across all the ...rms of our sample. Twelve of these zones are
countries in our sample that are commonly cited by ...rms in their geographical
segment tables. A thirteenth zone is "Rest of World" that contains countries
for which we have not de...ned a speci...c zone. In 2014, the stock markets of
the twelve countries speci...cally identi...ed as zones comprised 74.8% of the total
capitalization of the world'   s stock markets.10 As an example of the way these
zones are referred to in annual reports, consider a ...rm that has an ISIN starting
with the pre...x "US" and indicates that its geographic segments are Canada,
Mexico, China, and Rest of World. Canada and China are among our twelve
zones, and the Rest of World is our residual zone. Since Mexico is not included
among our twelve zones, we will classify its revenues as being generated in the
"Rest of World" zone.
    We compile a large "dictionary" that serves to map the very large number
of segments or destinations of sales posted in the various annual reports into
our standard zones.
    The choice of zones to be considered as operating-risk factors is a delicate
matter. The purpose of our study is to let data on revenues sharpen (or restrict)
the estimation of factor returns. The ...rms from the developed countries have
revenues that are more diversi...ed than those from developing countries. When a
country has few ...rms, that does not imply that the corresponding zone'   s index is
computed on the basis of these ...rms only. The algorithm takes into consideration
the returns of the ...rms from other countries that sell in the designated zone.
For instance, there are few ...rms domiciled in Australia in our ...ltered sample
(164 in 2006), but quite a few other ...rms cite Australia as a sales destination.
All the ...rms that sell in that zone contribute somewhat to the calculation
of the zone index. Such is the virtue of the algorithm. For that reason, we
want to choose zones for which we have su¢ cient revenue information. Table 1
provides a description of the database. It indicates, for each zone, the number
of companies year after year that derive more than 10% of their revenue from
that zone, explicitly so. For many countries this number is quite di¤erent from
the number of ...rms domiciled in that country. For instance, in 2006, Singapore
has 86 ...rms in our ...ltered database, but there are another 35 ...rms that derive
10% or more of their revenues from Singapore. So those multinational ...rms
help to determine the Singapore zone factor. In the same year, 105 ...rms in
the database are domiciled in Germany, but there are another 88 ...rms with a
fraction 10% or higher of their revenues from Germany. So, for Germany, there
is quite a bit of information coming from non-German multinational ...rms.
    For purposes of estimation reliability, it would be best to let the set of
zones vary from year to year. However, since we want to examine the factor
correlations and exposures over the years, it is imperative that we maintain the
same set of zones throughout, which implies a compromise. We choose a set of
zones such that for each zone, we have in the database at least 50 ...rms selling
  1 0 The source of the world's stock market capitalizations is the World Federation of Ex-
changes database.



                                            7
to that zone in all or most years. For the entire paper, we adopt a permanent
list of thirteen zones : France, Germany, Great Britain, Brazil, United States,
Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Japan, India and the Rest of
the World.
    Looking at Table 1 row-wise, we also notice that, unfortunately, our dataset
is very unbalanced: many more ...rms sell to the United States and to Japan
than to European countries. The ...ltered database favors the US and Asia and
is less dense on Europe.11 We return to that problem in Section 5 below.


2      National indexes vs. indexes based on rev-
       enues
A stock security'  s exposure to risks requires obviously a de...nition of the risk
factors, here "geographic risks." For that we need stock market indexes that
capture those risks meaningfully.
     As mentioned in the introduction, classical stock market indexes such as the
world and regional indexes published by Datastream and MSCI are based on a
company'   s headquarters: a ...rm is included in the index of a country when it
is domiciled in that country. These indexes are explicit (as opposed to the one
we develop here, which are latent or implicit) and come in two forms: equally
weighted and value weighted. In this paper, we focus exclusively on equally
weighted indexes. We use the stocks in our database to mimic equally weighted
listing-based indexes, using the two-letter pre...x of a stock' s ISIN number as
proxy for place of domicile.12 We call these "ISIN " or "national" indexes and
we refer to all ...rms domiciled in one country as "national ...rms." As noted,
they present the drawback of not accurately re     ecting the risk of operating in
the country.
     Other explicit indexes can be constructed from individual stock returns on
the basis of revenue data. We construct a second index, which we call the "70%"
index consisting of ...rms (which we call "domestic ...rms") with 70% or more of
their revenues derived explicitly from one country (which is almost always the
country where the ...rm is domiciled).
     Both the national and domestic indexes have the drawback of using fragmen-
tary information. The national indexes are based on the ...rm'     s domicile only,
while the domestic indexes ignore information about the ...rms'foreign revenues.
We aim to show now that these indexes are not good enough for gauging expo-
sure to geographic risks. First, we show in Table 2 that domestic and national
indexes are, indeed, di¤erent by displaying the correlation between them year
after year and country by country. The reporting habits that explain these corre-
lations are easy to imagine. The correlations are extremely high for, e.g., Brazil

prepared by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This code is assigned
according to the location of a company'    s head o¢ ce."In Appendix A we describe how multiple
listings of a ...rm's securities are eliminated from the database.

    than 10 percent of their revenues from that zone.
and Malaysia because the ...rms domiciled in Brazil (Malaysia, respectively) are
the only ones reporting Brazil (Malaysia) as a 70% sales destination and vice
versa. They are a bit lower for France and Germany, for instance, because there
are ...rms not domiciled in the respective country that report sales to it (such
as French ...rms reporting sales to Germany and vice versa). Furthermore, these
correlations would have been lower if we had constructed the domestic indexes
from sales levels below 70%. Even when some indexes are highly correlated with
each other they can lead to quite di¤erent exposure coe¢ cients, as we shall see
in Section 8. Roll (1977) ...rst pointed out that point of algebra apropos the
estimation of the beta of a security against a market index proxy.
     Second, as a way to show the potential bene...ts of using revenue information
to inform a risk-factor model, ­ which the national indexes do not do ­           , we
present in Table 3 the fraction of national ...rms relative to all ...rms selling to a
zone. The trend is clear in almost all zones: over time the proportion of national
...rms is falling. For example, in the case of France the percentage of French ...rms
selling to the French zone declines from 52:0% to 36:0% between 2000 and 2014.
This trend makes it increasingly imperative to control for revenues in setting up
zone indexes. The table also shows that some zones remain more national than
others. In Malaysia, Japan, and India in 2014, over 70% of the ...rms selling
in those zones are national. In India, for example, there is a trend towards
more foreign ...rms selling to India, but the country'  s sales remain dominated by
Indian ...rms.
     Third, the 70% indexes do capture revenue information, but only the infor-
mation coming from domestic ...rms. Below we aim to utilize as well the infor-
mation from more diversi...ed ...rms (multinationals) both domestic and foreign,
at all levels and not just the 70% level.
     The statistical index to be developed in the next sections will allow us to
put together all geographic information coming from both stock-returns and
revenues, whatever be the form in which revenues are reported: speci...c desti-
nation countries or, in less detail, destination regions such as "Europe"   , "Middle
East" etc..


3     A model of risk exposure
If information were available giving for each ...rm its share of revenues from each
zone, our goal could simply be reached by computing the (generalized) inverse
of a huge matrix or, equivalently, by running a cross-sectional regression of
...rms'returns on ...rms'revenue fractions. That matrix inversion would directly
construct the zone returns from the company returns. In practice, however,
the information about geographic segments is not exhaustive. Because of the
missing information, the zone returns cannot be measured directly, they have to
be considered as latent (or unobserved, or implicit) factors and the estimation
has to be viewed as an exercise in factor analysis.
     The following factor model is a signi...cant elaboration over Brooks and Del
Negro (2004). They considered a model with country factors (and a separate

world factor, which we do not need here since our zone factors are not assumed
to be independent), but with restrictions on the loadings (contained in the
matrix B below) that di¤er from ours. They ...x the loadings on foreign factors
at 0 and they force the country factors to be independent of each other so that
all common movements in countries take place through the world factor.13
    Our model speci...es the structure from which geographic-zone index returns
C and loadings B will be calculated:

                                     Rt = B        Ct + et                                 (1)

where Rt is the realization at time t of the N -vector of time-series demeaned
rates of returns (all measured in a common currency) for N stock securities, B
is the N K matrix that contains the loadings of all ...rms on all K geographic-
zone factors, Ct is the realization at time t of the K 1 vector of zero-mean
returns of unobserved or latent zone factors, K being the number of zones and
et is the realization at time t of the vector of unsystematic residuals of the stock
returns. We list below the constraints on B that will enable us to calculate C
as a latent factor.
    In the model, we identify the exposures of the growth rate of free cash
  ows to shareholders with the exposures of stock returns. Since stock returns
and, therefore, stock prices are involved, we need a generic asset-pricing con-
text that will relate the second moments of returns to the second moments of
cash-   ow growth. For that we refer to the approximate identity of Campbell
and Shiller (1988), which decomposes stock returns into news about cash          ows
  1 3 Similarly, Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) ...x the loading of a ...rm on its country to be

equal to 1.



                                              12
("dividends"   ) and news about future returns, the latter being a factor common
to all securities.14 Our model (1) being a factor model, we endeavor to explain,
subject to the constraints, as much as possible of the variance of Rt by means
of the second moments of the factors Ct . When we do that, we shall make the
assumption that the variance-covariance D of et is diagonal, so that, technically,
an additional common factor is ruled out. However, the estimated et will still
contain a very large amount of residual commonality.15
    Our measurement is not otherwise tied to a particular asset-pricing setting.
In particular, we leave aside the implications of the framework for the ...rst
moments of returns and we make no assumption about the integration of ...-
nancial markets, as the framework is equally valid under integration and under
segmentation.16
    We use whatever information we have on ...rms' activities to set some of
the elements of B equal to the corresponding shares of activities. We assume
in the model that the (deleveraged) stock returns of a ...rm re      ect the risks
of the zones to which it sells its products, irrespective of its domicile. That
assumption is motivated by the previous study of Diermeier and Solnik (2001).
In a speci...c example of their third-stage result, Diermeier and Solnik cite the
example of SmithKline Beecham, a "British" multinational, which has stock-
market statistical exposures equal to :17, :08, :31 and :55, respectively, to the
UK pure factor, to the Asia factor, to the Europe ex UK factor and to the North
American factor. They ask whether statistical exposures to country factors
resemble the shares of revenues that SmithKline Beecham receives from the
various geographic segments. The ...rm receives 8% of its revenues from the UK,
12% from Asia, 23:5% from Europe-ex-UK and 46:1% from North America. It
seems that the stock market is broadly aware of the geographic distribution of
the activities of the ...rm.
    Speci...cally, the constraints we impose on the statistical estimation are as
follows:

Assumption 1 The loading of a single zone j or the sum of the loadings of
a multiple-zone region j of a speci...c ...rm i is equal to the percentage Ai;j of
revenues from that zone or region
                                X
                                      bi;k = Ai;j                              (2)
                                        k j

  1 4 With recursive utilities, Restoy and Weil (2011) in the domestic context and Dumas et

al. (1993) in the international context relate news about future returns to news about future
consumption. See Equations (10) and (17) in Dumas et al. (1993).
  1 5 This remark is relevant because the extant literature shows that the changes in correlations

between stock market indices are mainly driven by unobservable factors rather than observable
macroeconomic variables (see, e.g., King et al. (1994), Karolyi and Stulz (1996), Ammer
and Mei (1996), and Bekaert et al. (2011)). Here we use individual-...rm stock returns and
revenues, which are microeconomic variables. But we can also expect commonality in the
estimated residuals.
  1 6 See Dumas et al. (1993) for the appplication of the framework separately to the case of

integration and to the case of segmentation, the only di¤erence between the two being the
consumption terms of the households of each country.


                                               13
    The assumption captures whatever information about country and regional
revenues is given in annual reports. For example, bi;k=i0 s country = Ai;k=i0 s country :
the ...rm'
         s loading on one particular zone factor called "home"is assumed equal
to the share of revenues generated at home. But the home country does not play
a unique role, as the general form (2) of the restriction shows.17 Assumption (2)
is the statistical rendition of the economic "proxy" assumption that we stated
in the introduction: the free cash     ows of a ...rm re   ect only the risks of the
zones to which it sells its products, irrespective of its domicile.

Assumption 2 The loadings of a ...rm i on all the zone factors are non negative

                                           bi;k     0

   In other words, if the revenues of a ...rm coming from a particular source
grow more than expected, everything else equal, its stock return is higher than
expected.

Assumption 3 The sum of the loadings of a ...rm i equal 1
                                         K
                                         X
                                               bi;k = 1
                                         k=1

    Admittedly, ...rms could be leveraged operationally so that their total risk
would be more than what is captured simply by revenues.18 The assumption
holds if costs are almost entirely variable. Since the shares of revenues sum to
1, Assumption 1 forces us to assume that the loadings must sum to 1 as well.19
    As a result of these assumptions and restrictions, some of the elements of
the matrix B are observed or "explicit"  . The others have to be estimated.


4     Implementation: the EM indexes
The statistical implementation of the model (1) is close in spirit to that of
Brooks and Del Negro (2004). The technical aspects are, however, quite in-
novative since we implement the EM technique in the presence of constraints,
including inequality constraints. Appendix B develops the econometric theory
under constraints in general terms.20
    We have described the constraints in Section 3. Because of their presence,
zone factors are not independent of each other (which is the reason for which we
  1 7 For "Rest of" zones, the equality constraint is replaced by an inequality because the

information in the annual reports often refers to one of the several countries of the zone.
  1 8 Financial leverage is taken care of, albeit imperfectly, by deleveraging the stock returns.

See Appendix A.
  1 9 By comparing in Section 8 the exposures in the form of the constrained loadings to less

constrained exposures, we shall have an opportunity to gauge the reasonableness of these
restrictions.
  2 0 There are very few antecedents of estimation of factor models with constraints; see Lawley

and Maxwell (1971).

do not need a world factor). We call the covariance matrix of the unobserved
zone factors C and we assume that C and e are independent of each other. The
variance-covariance matrix of e, assumed to be diagonal, is denoted D.21 Were it
not for the constraints on B , zone factors could be rede...ned to be orthogonal to
each other. The separate identi...cations of B and , therefore, is based entirely
on the constraints on B; while is chosen freely.22
   Since EM is a form of likelihood maximizations, the following is needed:

Assumption 4 All random variables are multivariate IID normal within a
year.

  The full log-likelihood L , ln p (R; B; D; ) of observing R according to the
model follows from the multivariate normal distribution, as in Lehmann and
Modest (2005):
                                   NT                T                T               1

where:

                            R    =    [Rt ; t = 1; ::T ]
                               , B B| + D
                                 1

   Direct maximization, by equating to zero the gradient of L with respect
to the parameters, yields a huge system of N (K 1) + K (K 1) =2 +
N equations that is nonlinear and hard to solve. Instead, we use an iterative
method called the EM algorithm, which was ...rst proposed to solve missing-data
problems by Dempster et al. (1977) and then applied to latent-factor models
by Rubin and Thayer (1982).23 As was pointed out by Brooks and Del Negro
(2004), the technique brings one very big algorithmic bene...t: it allows likelihood
optimization, at each stage of the iteration, to be applied to each ...rm one after
the other, as opposed to all of them globally, which would be infeasible. Our
  2 1 Although the estimation will attempt to make the model ...t these assumptions, they will

not hold for the model estimated from the data. The number of zone factors C is much smaller
than the number of ...rms, so that the estimated variance-covariance matrix of e will not be
diagonal. This is standard in factor analysis. Furthermore, the constraints imposed on B by
the estimation algorithm will make it impossible to achieve orthogonality between e and C ,
which is less standard.
  2 2 Unfortunately, we are not able to provide su¢ cient conditions for identi...cation. But we

verify that the matrix B B | is of rank K .
  2 3 E stands for "expectation"and M for "maximization". The meaning of that riddle becomes

clear below. We apply the EM algorithm to estimate the latent factors but also to handle
missing (i.e., zero-return) data, as explained in Appendix C.


                                              15
challenge is to extend the technique to the case in which the factors are not
independent of each other and in which, instead, there are restrictions on the
loadings, giving rise to a covariance matrix of zone factors.
    The EM method consists in comparing the log-likelihood (3) of R, ln p (R; B; D; ),
to the joint log-likelihood of R and C , ln p (R; C ; B; D; ), and in showing that,
at any given value of the parameters, the gradient of the log-likelihood ln p (R)
with respect to parameters is equal to the expected value of the gradient of the
log-likelihood ln p (R; C ) under the probability distribution of C given R.24
    Imagining that the latent factors C were observed, the joint log likelihood
LL , ln p (R; C ) is based on the assumption that both e and C are multivariate
normal (see Rubin and Thayer (1982)):

   t=1 E [Ct jRt ] and  t=1 E [Ct Ct jRt ]. We compute them in Appendix D, on
the basis of the model.
    In the M step of the algorithm, the function (5) is maximized with respect
to D; B and , keeping X and Y ...xed as computed from the values of the para-
meters of the previous iteration. At the next iteration, X and Y are recomputed
(this is the E step) from (6) and (7), and the M part is run anew.
    The ...rst-order condition with respect to B need not be written down as,
in any case, that optimization is to be done under the constraints of Section
3, by means of a numerical quadratic-optimization algorithm. The ...rst-order
condition with respect to D is simply:

                          D = diagonal [S           2XB | + BY B | ]

As noted, the optimization with respect to the elements of B and D can for-
tunately be performed individually ...rm by ...rm.25 That is the major bene...t of
the EM algorithm.
   With these de...nitions of X and Y , the estimate of is simply:

                                                =Y

Indeed, the ...rst-order condition is:26

    During the execution of the EM steps, the full likelihood (3) is calculated
periodically to verify that it keeps increasing. That calculation is computation-
ally intensive. EM theory guarantees that a local maximum is reached. No
likelihood maximization algorithm ­except in very simple, quadratic cases such
as OLS ­ever guarantees that a global one is reached.

                                          1             1       1         1
                     E [Ct jRt ] =                          B                 Rt            (8)

except for the fact that Rt , in this de...nition, contains the individual ...rm re-
turns, not demeaned. This de...nition allows us to obtain a measure of the zone
indexes at daily frequency.
    Using daily stock returns, we perform the estimation year by year (from
1999 to 2014) assuming that all loadings, which are the elements of the matrix
B , are constant within a year (Assumption 4 above).
    The convergence of the EM algorithm is considered to be achieved whenever
the largest absolute value of the elasticity of the likelihood (or, equivalently, the
relative gradient of the log-likelihood) with respect to any parameter is lower
  2 5 These optimizations, except for the constraints, are analogous to a time-series regression

run for each ...rm.

than 10 2 .27 The maximum number of iterations allowed is 500. For the year
2013, we experimented with a larger number of iterations equal to 1000. The
gain in the stability of the estimates was close to null.28
    Because of time di¤erences around the globe, one might object to the analy-
sis of covariations being conducted on daily stock- return indexes. For that
reason, we have entirely redone the estimation for the year 2013, assembling
daily returns into non overlapping three-day returns. We could not detect any
di¤erence in the results that are reported below.


5     The problem of data imbalance
As noted above, our dataset is not balanced: many more ...rms sell to the United
States and to Japan than to European countries, especially since there are so
many listed ...rms from the U.S. and Japan in the database, some of them selling
to their own country.
     As in any factor analysis, the likelihood maximization itself aims to explain
as much of the variance of individual stock returns as possible. That is true
also under constraints. If we implemented the procedure just described without
change, the number of individual ...rm constraints pertaining to each zone would
play a critical role in pushing the total return variance into one zone or the
other. For instance, since the database contains too little ...rm information about
revenues from Europe, the volatility of returns of European zones would end up
being abnormally large. When we initially ran the algorithm, the volatility of
the German zone turned out to be much larger than that of other developed
countries and larger than that of some developing countries.
     In order to remedy that problem, we resort to subsampling, a technique
that has gained a lot of ground in the area of machine learning. See the very
lucid survey article by He and Garcia (2009) and also the article by Chen et al.
(2013).
     Instead of running it once on the whole dataset of each year, we run the
algorithm on one hundred subsamples. Each subsample is chosen randomly in
a strati...ed manner. First, for each zone, we count the number of ...rms for which
we have explicit data with a fraction of sales to that destination greater than
x% (with x being successively 70%, 50%, 30% and 10%). For each x% level, we
compute across all zones the minimum number of ...rms with explicit data, and
then randomly select from the ...rms of the more populated zones a number of
...rms equal to the minimum number. In this way, each subsample contains an
approximately equal number of ...rms selling to each and every zone, at each x%
level. We have reproduced in Appendix E the actual set of MatLab instructions
that was used.
     After that is done, the estimates of the zone indexes C , as per Equation (8),
  2 7 In that gradient we include the Lagrange multiplier terms, which are due to the con-

straints; see Appendix B. The log-likelihood is of the order of magnitude of 106 .
  2 8 We keep available upon request descriptive statistics on the variability of the estimates of

the loadings, compared between the ...rst 500 iterations and the subsequent ones.



                                               18
are averaged across the subsamples and a single additional iteration of the M
step run on the entire sample produces our estimates of the loadings B .


6     The composition of EM indexes
The EM indexes that we obtain on the basis of revenues, di¤er markedly from
the national ISIN indexes based on domicile. Table 4 displays, for each zone
and each year, the correlations between the two types of indexes. Some of the
correlations are far from being equal to 1 and they are not uniform across coun-
tries. Below we devote several sections to a comparison of indexes of di¤erent
types. In this section, we comment on the composition of the EM indexes. That
will help in understanding di¤erences in their behavior.
    Consider the model (1). If Ct were already calculated, one could obtain B
by time-series regressions of Rt on Ct . If B were already calculated, on could
obtain Ct by cross-sectional regressions of Rt on B . Brooks and Del Negro (2004,
2006) pointed out that the M step of the algorithm is essentially the within-year
(constrained) time-series regression run for each ...rm, which alternates with the
E step, which is essentially the cross-sectional regression. This section focuses
on the latter aspect, while section 8 below focuses on the former.
    The composition of the indexes Ct refers to the weight given to each ...rm
in the calculation of the estimated zone indexes. It is dictated by formula (8),
which we reproduce here:

                                             + B|D                B|D
                                         1            1       1         1
                      E [Ct jRt ] =                       B                 Rt

and which can be compared with cross-sectional Generalized Least Squares:
               1 |
 B|D 1B         B D 1 Rt . The term B | D 1 Rt is the weighted covariance at time
t of the B loadings of the ...rms on their stock return, and the term B | D 1 B +
    1
       can be interpreted as the variance-covariance across ...rms of the B coe¢ -
cients.29
    Thus, the weights of the various securities in the various EM indexes are
                      1 |
      1
        + B|D 1B       B D 1 .30 These weights do not sum to one over securities.
           1
If the       term were absent (i.e., in the GLS case), a weighted sum of them ­
where the weights in the sum are incorporated by postmultiplication by own B
                                   1 |
­ would sum to 1: B | D 1 B          B D 1 B = I . The deviation from 1 of the
sum allows the algorithm to adjust the variance of the indexes C .
    2 9 As Brooks and Del Negro (2004) put it, the di¤erence "arises because the E step estimator

treats Ct as a random variable with prior variance          while the GLS estimator treats the
factor(s) as unknown but ...xed coe¢ cients," where "...xed" means "non random". Symbols
adapted by us.
    3 0 The weights of the ...rms in the indexes (a matrix with as many rows as there are zones

and as many columns as there are ...rms) should not be confused with the loadings B of the
...rms on the indexes (a matrix with as many rows as there are ...rms and as many columns
as there are zones). The loadings satisfy a number of constraints, which we have indicated,
including non negativity constraints. The weights can be of any sign, some ...rms receiving a
negative weight in some zone indexes, for reasons to be explained below.

Table 5: Sums of ...rms'loadings (Canada, 2014) weighted by the weight
in the Canadian EM index: ...rms with positive weights in the ...rst row; ...rms
with negative weights in the second row.


    The formula indicates that the relation between the composition of the index
                                                                           1
and the loadings B is non linear. Imagining we ...xed      1
                                                             + B|D 1B        , the
weights would be proportional to the loadings. But some of the loadings are given
explicitly by the revenue database while others are estimated, which complicates
the relation between the weights and explicit revenues.
    Intuitively, we expect the EM index of a zone to be composed of a combina-
tion of ...rms'returns in three tiers:

      The stock returns of "domestic"...rms that sell almost entirely to the zone.
      The returns of other (i.e., "multinational") ...rms that sell to the zone to
      varying degrees. These ...rms bring to the make up of the index their
      information about revenues from the zone. But, because they sell to other
      zones as well, they also introduce into the index the in     uence of stock
      returns that are not related to that zone.
      The returns of yet other multinationals that may not sell anything to the
      zone but serve to o¤set, by means of a negative weight, the in   uence of
      the unrelated returns of the second tier.

     To illustrate the role of the third tier and ...rms receiving a negative weight,
consider the example of the Canadian zone in 2014. Canadian and non Canadian
...rms that receive a positive weight in the index load (in the sense of the B
loadings) on zones other than Canada. The ...rst row of Table 5 gives the sum of
these loadings weighted by the ...rms'weight in the index. Without some o¤set,
the Canada EM index would be unduly in           uenced by the non-Canadian sales
of multinational ...rms, as it would contain, for instance, a large total loading of
14% on the U.S. Such is the purpose of the (non Canadian) ...rms that receive a
negative weight (a total of 5220 ...rms), some of them very small. Their weighted
loadings are shown in the second row of the table. By comparing the two rows,
one can remark how the algorithm has been able to choose weights that cancel
the unwanted loadings and to focus on Canada alone.

7     The behavior of EM vs. ISIN indexes
In the coming sections, we produce a series of arguments and statistical tests
that show that the zone factors themselves are economically reasonable and
meaningful. This is in lieu of formal tests ­ such as likelihood-ratio tests ­ of
the model as a whole or of speci...c hypotheses, which are out of reach for lack
of knowledge of the sampling distributions and, in any case, would not reject
any hypothesis about the loadings because of the sheer number of parameters
being estimated.
    The purpose of this ...rst section is to show that EM indexes do capture
"geographic risks". To do that, we compare them across zones and we examine
their behavior over time.

7.1    Comparisons across zones
The EM indexes di¤er from traditional indexes primarily because they incorpo-
rate information from the geographic revenue data of each ...rm. To the extent
that ...rms sell abroad, their stock returns should be sensitive to those zone in-
dexes where the sales occur rather than to the zone index where the ...rms are
domiciled. EM and ISIN indexes of a zone di¤er from each other to the degree
that national ...rms and ...rms selling there are not the same.
     The EM indexes should di¤er the most for countries where international sales
are most important. Countries like France and Canada have many ...rms with
substantial sales abroad. In 2014, for example, 47:7% of Canadian ...rms had
more than 30% of their revenues from outside Canada. In other countries like
India and Malaysia, more ...rms receive domestic revenues primarily. In India,
for example, only 30:1% of the ...rms receive substantial revenues from abroad
in 2014. In Japan in that same year, over 84% of ...rms selling in Japan were
Japanese. For this reason, we should ...nd that the EM method makes the most
di¤erence for countries with many internationally oriented ...rms and with many
foreign ...rms selling in that country.
     This section will explore how international revenue data reported by national
...rms in  uence the EM indexes. To show how revenue data a¤ect the EM
indexes, consider two measures of the openness of a country to international
sales:

      The ratio of the number of national ...rms selling domestically to the total
      number of ...rms selling to that zone (foreign presence). In the case of
      Canada in 2014, for example, 43:9% of the ...rms selling in Canada were
      Canadian. Call this ratio "Inward" .

      The ratio of the number of national ...rms with foreign revenues equal
      to 30% or more of total revenues to the total number of national ...rms
      (foreign activity). In the case of Canada in 2014, 47:7% of its ...rms are
      "multinational,"de...ned as ...rms with 30% or more of their revenues from
      abroad. Call this ratio "Outward"   .


                                       22
   If a country has many foreign ...rms selling to it, the EM index should re ect
the in  uence of these sales on that country'  s EM index. If a country has many
national ...rms selling abroad, these ...rms should exert in    uence on the EM
indexes for other zones. In both cases, the correlation between the EM and
ISIN indexes should be relatively low.
   To illustrate how international revenues in    uence the EM indexes, consider
the link between revenue patterns and the EM vs. ISIN correlations. The
higher the ratio of national ...rms to all ...rms selling to that zone the higher
should be the correlation between the EM and ISIN indexes. So the revenue
pattern should be positively correlated with the correction between the EM and
ISIN indexes. The regression line for the pooled sixteen years across the twelve
zones (not including RoW) is

             corrEM;ISIN;j;t = 0:8575 + 0:1062        Inwardj;t + "j;t
                                            (3:507)

where j is a subscript for zones and t a subscript for years. The t statistic
in parentheses indicates that the slope is signi...cantly di¤erent from zero and
positive.
    To make better sense of this data, let us focus on two zones with markedly
di¤erent behavior, Canada and India. Figure 1 shows the data for these two
countries only. In Canada, the percentage of national ...rms selling in Canada
is only 50:1% on average over the sample period, 1999 to 2014. In India, that
percentage is 85:1%. As a result, the correlation between the EM and ISIN
indexes should be lower for Canada than for India. Indeed, that is the case since
Canada has an average correlation of 0.865 in contrast to a 0.965 correlation for
India. The sixteen observations for India are clustered in the northeast quadrant
of the diagram while the Canada observations are clustered in the center of the
chart. So the EM method makes more di¤erence for a country like Canada
where sales by foreign ...rms are relatively important.
    Sales by national ...rms to foreign markets are also important in making the
EM indexes di¤erent from the ISIN indexes. The higher the ratio of multina-
tionals ­the Outward ratio ­   , the lower should be the correlation between that
zone's EM index and the corresponding ISIN index.
    The regression line is

            corrEM;ISIN;j;t = 0:9471     0:0844       Outwardj;t + "j;t
                                        ( 3:0810)

with a signi...cant slope again.
    Let us again just compare Canada and India, without a ...gure. In Canada
over the sample period, 43:6% of ...rms can be described as multinational with
30% or more of their revenues from abroad. In India, only 17:9% of ...rms are
multinational. The correlation between the EM and ISIN indexes for Canada
is accordingly lower for Canada (0:865) than it is for India (0:965).
    For the twelve zones, we also run a multiple regression on both ratios:

The slopes are both signi...cant.
    As the section on the yearly variations approaches, it becomes clear that it
is unwarranted to keep the intercept of these regressions the same from one year
to the next. Doing so might bias the slopes. When we add control dummies for
years, the result is

corrEM;ISIN;j;t = interceptt + 0:1307     Inwardj;t    0:0508     Outwardj;t + "j;t
                               (4:8777)               ( 2:1816)

   Under all speci...cations, it is clear that the EM index di¤ers from the ISIN
index in the direction that gives it a geographic meaning that ISIN lacks.

7.2    Comparisons across years
The graphs in Figure 2 compare over the years and across countries the second
moments of the EM indexes with those of the ISIN and 70% indexes. For each
year, we obtain a cross-section of standard deviations and pairwise correlations
of individual zone returns and display the mean and the median. The second
moments of all three indexes are obtained from the daily returns.
    The pair of graphs at the top of the ...gure displays the three pairwise corre-
lations between the daily stock returns of the three indexes, the mean and the
median being calculated over the thirteen zones. The three indexes are strongly
correlated with each other. They become more so around 2008, as can be ex-
pected on the occasion of a market crash (although the opposite seems to occur
in 2000 for two of the three pairwise correlations). But they drop again.
    The middle pair of graphs in Figure 2 is based on the thirteen standard
deviations of daily stock returns of which, each year, we take the mean and
the median. Not surprisingly all the volatilities rise with the two stock market
crashes of 2001 and 2008. The two graphs reveal that, for most countries, it is
the case that the EM indexes are less volatile than the two explicit indexes. This
comes as a surprise since the observed indexes are diversi...ed across zones while
the EM indexes, by construction, are focused on one zone each. One interpreta-
tion is that some of the volatility of developed-country stock exchange indexes
(which are more numerous in our sample) arises from their ...rms'involvement
in developing country zones, which are more volatile. Indeed, most of the in-
crease in internationalization re  ects the penetration of developing markets by
developed-country ...rms.
    Finally, the bottom graphs of Figure 2 display mean and median statistics
of the pairwise correlations between zones for EM zone indexes on the one
hand and for the two explicit country indexes on the other. The di¤erence
tends to be negative: EM indexes are less correlated across zones than are
the explicit indexes. The EM algorithm has been able to remove an undue
amount of correlation caused by revenues from common foreign countries. This
is consistent with the hypothesis that some of the correlation between traditional
stock market indexes arises from the interpenetration of corporate activity across
countries. We have achieved the goal of our exercise, which was to deconstruct
that interpenetration.

Figure 2: Comparison and evolution of second-moment properties of EM;
ISIN and 70% indexes. For each year, we obtain the daily standard deviations
and pairwise correlations (across indexes in the top pair of graphs, across zones
in the bottom pair), of the thirteen zone indexes, of which we take the mean
and the median.
                                       26
    We now show evidence that this reduction in zone correlations for the EM
indexes is related to the Inward foreign-presence and Outward foreign-activity
ratios introduced earlier. Both ratios capture ways in which ...rms domiciled
in one country generate revenues outside their country thereby causing ISIN
indexes to di¤er from indexes re    ecting activities in one country alone. We will
show that both of these ratios have less in    uence on the cross-zone correlations
in the EM regressions than the correlations in the ISIN regressions because
the EM indexes are designed to be more distinctly zone-speci...c.
    In Table 6, we report regressions of the ISIN and EM cross-zone correlations
on the Inward and Outward measures pooling across all years. Consider ...rst
the ISIN regressions. Suppose that we compare two country pairs: India and
Malaysia, on the one hand, the Inward ratios of which are high and the Outward
ratios of which are low; Canada and Singapore, on the other hand, the Inward
ratios of which are lower and the Outward ratios are higher. As we move from
the second country pair to the ...rst one, the correlation across zones should drop
since the economies of the ...rst type are less correlated. We expect the slope
coe¢ cients of the Inward ratios to be negative and the slope coe¢ cients of the
Outward ratios to be positive. The regressions for ISIN in Table 6 exhibit
these very signs.
    For the EM indexes, these e¤ects should be less pronounced since we have
constructed the EM indexes so that they are more distinctly zone-speci...c than
the ISIN ones, EM having been purged to some extent of the in       uence of foreign
presence and foreign activity. In other words, the EM cross-zone correlations
should be less dependent on the ratios than the ISIN correlations. We do ...nd
that the R2 for EM is lower than the one for ISIN . We also ...nd that the
absolute values of three of the four Inward and Outward coe¢ cients are lower
in the EM regressions.31
    Figure 2 shows that traditional ISIN indexes exhibit an upward trend and
then a downward trend in their correlations. After we have controlled for changes
in cash   ows ­ revenues as a proxy ­    , the rise and fall of correlations is still
present.
    Asset pricing would come into play when interpreting these correlations as
being indications of the degree of integration of ...nancial markets.32 In this
  3 1 And two of these three show a signi...cant di¤erence between the two index types (third

column). These are the slopes on the Outward ratios. The Outward ratios measuring foreign
presence in a zone seem to matter the most in distinguishing the EM from the ISIN indexes.
That is consistent with the signi...cance of the slopes in the regressions of Section 7.1.
  3 2 One must beware that di¤erent assets could be driven by di¤erent factors, and thus

possibly be little correlated, without implying segmentation. It is true, based on dynamic
models of international ...nancial-market equilibrium, that, cash ows being kept the same,
cross-country correlations are higher if the ...nancial markets are integrated (i.e., if movements
of capital take place between countries the same way they do within countries) than if they are
segmented. See Dumas et al. (2003). Bekaert et al. (2011) present a similar dynamic model
but do not examine correlations of stock returns. For that reason, correlations have been used
not only to measure diversi...cation potential (Solnik (1974), Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994),
Cavaglia et al. (2004)) but also to measure the degree of integration between markets (e.g.,
Bekaert and Mehl (2019)). The catch is the proviso "cash ows being kept the same" As
noted in the introduction, as time goes by, the composition of commonly available country

paper, as noted in the introduction, we have made no assumption about asset

stated above.


8     The statistical exposures revealed by EM in-
      dexes
In this section, we examine ...rms' exposures to geographic risks. One would
justi...ably consider to be exposures the loadings, which are contained in the
matrix B and which are constrained by Assumptions 1 to 3. However, in the
tradition of factor models, it is customary to regress freely the return of a
security on a number of factors, thus obtaining its "exposures" , in a meaning
of the word that is purely based on returns and not on revenues or income.33
To compare and contrast these two de...nitons of exposure, we now take the
zone indexes ­ including the EM indexes ­ as being given and regress ...rms'
stock returns on them. To maintain the di¤erentiation with the loadings, we
call "statistical exposures" the slope coe¢ cients so obtained.
indexes evolves not just as to the list of ...rms included in the index but also as to the locus of
the business conducted by the ...rms that are included.
  3 3 See Adler and Dumas (1984).




                                                28
    We regress separately each security'   s daily return on the daily returns of EM,
ISIN and 70% indexes. Even though we know that ...rms could very well be
negatively exposed to a risk factor, we keep the non negativity constraint in place
for all indexes, in order to take into account the fact that, in the construction
of EM indexes, we have only been able to use information about ...rms'revenues
and not about pro...ts or free cash    ows. Without the non negativity constraints,
the exposures would not be comparable. But, non negativity is now the only set
of constraints. Other constraints stated in Assumption 1, relating to sales, and
Assumption 3 (summation to 1) are now relaxed. The only information on sales
that still plays a role in statistical exposures is encapsulated in the EM indexes,
the composition of which has been designed to re          ect sales information (see
Section 6), but which contain stock returns only. The calculation of statistical
exposures is done yearly by constrained maximum likelihood, the likelihood
function being similar to (3) above (but with regressors explicitly given, as
opposed to factors to be estimated), where the coe¢ cients of the regression are
constrained to be non negative.34
    We ...rst want to determine whether EM zone indexes are successful in cap-
turing sales information. To what degree is it true that the sensitivities of stock
returns of a ...rm re  ect the risks of the zones to which it sells its products? To
answer that question, we compare to actual sales the statistical exposures to
twelve EM zone indexes (ignoring the "rest-of-the-world" zone). This is a gen-
eralization of the third-stage comparison performed by Diermeier and Solnik
(2001). We do that by regressing the statistical exposures on the composition
of sales, using all data points of all ...rms and all years (75264 observations).35
The resulting slope coe¢ cient is striking:36

           ExposureEM;i;j;t = Interceptt + 0:93774              Salesi;j;t + "i;j;t
                                                    (145:78)

where i is a subscript for ...rms, j is one for zones and t is one for years. The
t-statistic of the slope in a test against the value zero is indicated in parentheses
and the R2 is equal to 0:238. We did not expect exposures to re              ect sales
so starkly as to be equal to them. Indeed, fractions of sales have to be less
than 1 while exposures may be above, since constraints have been removed
from their estimation, ­ many de...nitely are. Furthermore, on the left-hand
side of the equation are the exposures to twelve factors only, which are the
only messengers of sales information, whereas the right-hand side draws on
thousands upon thousands of ...rms, each with its own sales information. Also,
as was explained in Section 3, the construction of the EM index has used regional
information, which could not be included on the right-hand side of the present
  3 4 We caution that the constraints cause the estimated residuals not to be orthogonal to the

regressors. But we do not decompose variance.
  3 5 Here we use the observation points for which we have an explicit observation of sales to

one of the twelve zones.

                                               70%;i;j;t to the domestic indexes would yield a
slope equal to 0:8082, which means that the 70% exposures are lower than what is indicated
by sales. But the R2 would be slightly higher than that of the exposures to the EM index:
0:29.

Table 7: Exposures to foreign zones in regressions on EM , ISIN and
70% indexes: Regressions of stock returns of national ...rms of one country on
all EM , ISIN or 70% indexes. In the ...rst three columns, the table shows the
sum of the foreign slope coe¢ cients of a ...rm, averaged across ...rms and years.
The last three columns show the sum of the foreign slope coe¢ cients, averaged
across ...rms and years, divided by the sum of all slope coe¢ cients, averaged
across ...rms and years. The second set of regressions for the European countries
(marked with an asterisk) shows coe¢ cients for foreign countries outside Europe.


regression. All this notwithstanding, the slope in that regression is found to be
strikingly close to 1.37
    As our second investigation in this section, we resolve an empirical anomaly
of international stock returns. In most empirical estimations, it is found that the
returns of ...rm domiciled in a country generate a statistical exposure to their
national stock market index that is much larger than the one to the world stock
market. That strikes one as odd in a globalized world. One reason could be that
the country'  s index is improperly de...ned. We now examine the statistical ex-
posures that are generated from EM indexes, instead of national ISIN indexes
or domestic 70% indexes.
    The question we focus on is whether, in the EM regressions, the exposures
to the foreign factors play a greater role than they do in the ISIN and 70%
  3 7 The t-statistic in a test of equality of the slope coe¢ cient to the number 1 is equal to

 9:73, thus formally rejecting equality. However, one should keep in mind the very large
number of observations.

regressions. Table 7 compares the sum of the foreign coe¢ cients for the EM,
ISIN and 70% regressions, averaging over all national ...rms of a country. The
table shows the coe¢ cients averaged over the sixteen years of our sample, 1999-
2014.38 The results are clear-cut. The EM exposures give a much larger role
to foreign indexes than do those using the traditional ISIN index or the 70%
index. For example, in the U.S. regressions, the average foreign coe¢ cients
increase from 0:334 in the ISIN regressions to 0:356 in the 70% regressions
to 0:869 in the EM regressions. Table 7 also shows how much larger a role
the foreign factors play relative to the domestic factors in the EM regressions
compared with the two more conventional regressions. The last three columns
of the table report the ratios of the average foreign coe¢ cients to the average
foreign and domestic coe¢ cients combined. The ratios are larger for the EM
regressions except in the cases of Brazil and China. So, the EM indexes succeed
in highlighting the importance of foreign in  uences on stock returns. That is to
be expected since the EM indexes re    ect the importance of foreign revenues of
many of these ...rms.


9     Conclusion
We have developed, and demonstrated the relevance of, a new technique to
identify some of the operational risks that a ...rm faces. The technique can be
useful to corporate managers and asset managers. It is based on the assumption
that the free cash      ows of a ...rm and its stock returns re ect the risks of the
places to which it sells its products, irrespective of its domicile.
     Using the expectations-maximization (EM) method of likelihood maximiza-
tion, we have generated implicit or latent stock index factor returns based on
the geographic zones from which ...rms receive their free cash      ows (proxied by
revenues), as opposed to traditional indexes based on ...rms'headquarters. In an
increasingly integrated world economy, commercially speaking, it makes sense
to take into account where ...rms do business rather than just where ...rms locate
their headquarters. As a way better to isolate the risks attached to one zone,
the portfolio composition of the EM index of a zone utilizes information from
all ...rms, be they domestic or multinational, and goes as far as to place some
moderately negative weights on some ...rms that do not sell to that zone.
     The resulting indexes di¤er in their behavior from traditional indexes in
accordance with their design and purpose. First, the correlations between the
EM indexes and traditional indexes are lower for a country with many foreign
...rms selling to it (foreign presence). That is because the revenues of the foreign
...rms in   uence that zone'   s EM index. Secondly, these correlations are also
lower for countries where there are many national ...rms selling multinationally
to foreign countries (foreign activity). That is because the EM index is able to
  3 8 The three EM European zone indices for France, Germany, and Great Britain are highly

correlated. So the returns of ...rms in those zones tend to load on all three zone indexes rather
than primarily on the own index. To adjust for this phenomenon, Table 7 also reports for the
European regressions the exposures to zones outside Western Europe.



                                               31
separate the role of revenues coming from one zone. Thirdly, we show that the
EM indexes are less correlated across zones than traditional indexes. The EM
algorithm has been able to remove an undue amount of correlation caused by
revenues from common foreign countries.
     Fourthly, we examine the statistical exposures of ...rms by regressing freely
their stock returns on the EM zone indexes, and verify that they faithfully re  ect
the ...rms' foreign revenues. Finally, the ...rms' statistical exposure coe¢ cients
falling on foreign zones are higher in regressions of stock returns on the EM
indexes than in regressions on traditional indexes. That is because the foreign
revenues of domestic ...rms help to determine the foreign EM indexes.
     The EM factors, therefore, represent a new type of stock index that better
re  ects the business risks of one geographic zone vs. another.
     This work opens the way to more complete factor models that should be
investigated. The ...rst priority would be to add to geographic factors local-
pricing factors that would capture the eventuality that securities listed on the
same stock market correlate excessively.39 The second priority would be to add
industry factors and to test the hypothesis that zones are no more than portfolios
of industries, as they should be in a world that is integrated commercially.40
  3 9 See Chaieb et al. (2020). When attempting to exhibit local pricing, it is important to

control for the geographic distribution of sources of revenues.
  4 0 One more topic of research should be contemplated. We would need a technique to

introduce a weighting of the ...rms so that one could compare, for instance, value-weighted
indexes of the explicit and implicit kinds. It is straightforward to introduce a weighting in
the likelihood function. But the way to weigh the constraints pertaining to the various ...rms
has escaped us.

A         Description of data ...ltering
The proxy for foreign sales activity of ...rms is the geographical breakdown of
revenues. World Vest Base has extensive information about sales activities
of a large number of companies (98% of global capitalization in 2003) and is
our source of the revenue breakdown information. The data on geographical
distribution of revenues was given to us in 2016 for the years 1999-2014. A
total of 77,184 security ISINs is available. In some cases, it is impossible to
interpret a sales destination reported in WVB. Additionally there are numerous
negative, zero and missing revenue values. To circumvent the ...rst problem,
we restrict the analysis to a list of 937 sales destinations that unambiguously
refer to countries or geographical regions. We address the second problem by
eliminating the records which correspond to negative, zero or missing revenue
values. The ...ltering is done in the following steps:

    1. First, ...rms are selected from the entire multi-year sample on the basis of
       permanent (static) properties obtained from Datastream.
       For ISINs in the WVB database, a "static" download from Datastream
       is performed. It contains ...rst the stock type ("ordinary" vs. others) ac-
       cording to Worldscope. When that piece of data is "NA"        , the security is
       deleted; that leaves 47,370 ISINs. Second, it contains the average market
       capitalization over all the years. When that piece of data is "NA"    , the se-
       curity is deleted; that leaves 34,460 ISINs. Third, it contains the "TRCS
       code," which is one indication on security type. When that piece of data
       is "NA"    , the security is deleted; that leaves 27,391 ISINs. Based on the
       TRCS code, a number of security categories (other than ordinary shares)
       are deleted;41 that leaves 26,738 securities. Then we restrict securities by
       their country of origin as indicated in the ...rst two letters of their ISIN;
       the restriction is to 56 countries;42 that leaves 25,441 securities. Then,
       based on the Worldscope type, Chinese A shares are deleted;43 that leaves
       24,105 securities. Fourth the download contains the name of the company.

       A ...rst general cleaning recommended by Gri¢ n et al. (2010) based on
       the name eliminates 5 securities. But a more comprehensive cleaning also
       recommended by Gri¢ n et al. (2010) eliminates country-speci...c types,
       which are too many to list; that leaves 23,588 securities.

   2. Further selection is based on properties that vary year by year but are
      assumed to stay the same within a year
      For each year, data are extracted from WVB: the list of ISIN numbers
      for the companies that are present during that year, the names of these
      companies, the year end of their annual report, the sales destinations,
      the revenues from each of the sales destinations, the currency unit in
      which these revenues are expressed and the report type.44 For the ...ltered
      WVB sample of company ISINs of each year, data is downloaded from
      Datastream regarding market capitalization and leverage at the beginning
      of the year. The number of securities available in each year is indicated in
      column (2) of Table 8. When "NA" appears for the market capitalization
      or leverage entry of security, that security is dropped; that leaves each
      year the number of securities indicated in column (3). Securities that in
      each country have a market capitalization below the 97th percentile of the
      country' s capitalizations are eliminated as "microcaps;" that leaves each
      year the number of securities indicated in column (4).

   3. A selection that requires stock returns is performed.
      Securities' daily return indexes during the year were downloaded from
      Datastream. For each stock we get the total return index in both the
      US dollar and the home currency. While the estimation is done using
      the dollar returns, the home currency returns are used for ...ltering. The
      reason behind this choice is that our ...ltering requires calculation of the
      number of non-zero returns and the dollar non-zero returns may be a
      result of the exchange rate variation rather than the price variation. A few
      securities su¤er from an entry of "NA" or "#ERROR" in this download;
      the number of remaining securities is indicated in column (5). Daily rates
      of return are calculated in US dollar and deleveraged, so that rates of
      return from now on are rates of returns on companies'assets. If the rate
      of return in original-currency unit is equal to zero, this is an indication
      of thin trading; within each year, we delete securities for which there are
      abnormally high returns and for which there are days of thin trading;45
      the number of remaining securities is indicated in column (6). We remove
      holidays common to most of the countries: based on the dollar returns,
      we count the number of zero returns for each day and remove the whole
      string of returns for this day if the number of zero returns exceeded a third
  4 4 According   to the WVB Data Manual, multiple records with di¤erent report types may
exist due to a change in the accounting standards, in the income statement format, due to
reclassi...cation of items or to changes in the ...scal year end. See Table 10.
  4 5 We divide a year into sub-periods of 20 trading days (with the last two sub-periods

overlapping) and require all stocks in the sample to have at least one non-zero return within
each of the sub-periods with zero-returns calculated on the basis of home currency prices.



                                             37
   of the total number of stocks. While the number of days in a year with
   an observation is reduced, the number of securities is not a¤ected.
4. Finally, we merge into one dataset per year the data on revenues and the
   data on rates of return. Selection is then done on the basis of revenue
   data.
   In the process, some securities are lost for some years because WVB,
   while showing the revenues of a particular company for some years, may
   not show them for a speci...c year; the number of securities remaining is
   shown in column (2) of Table 9. Some more ...ltering is performed. based
   on revenue data. First we choose "report type." A ...rm may restate or
   reclassify its revenues within a year. Once the information is available,
   WVB updates the records on the revenue breakdown and, at the same
   time, retains the old records. As a result, a given ...rm may have multiple
   records. Therefore, using the data without additional ...ltering may bias
   the geographical distribution of the sales activities. We try to solve this
   problem by a ...ltering procedure elaborated below. According to the WVB
   Data Manual, multiple records may exist due to a change in the accounting
   standards, in the income statement format, due to reclassi...cation of items
   or to changes in the ...scal year end. Consequently, for ...ltering we use
   information on the report type, currency and on the ...scal year end. Using
   the report type code, we select the report that belongs to I, II priority
   groups in Table 10. In order to keep the maximum number of records, for
   a given ...rm we choose the most detailed ...nancial record type. Moreover,
   if the number of records grouped by the ...nancial data header is the same,
   we choose the one that is preferred according to the rule set up in Table 10
   (the most preferred report type being at the top of the list and the least
   preferred at the bottom). We then look at the ...rms which have multiple
   records corresponding to the same geographical regions and choose the
   records with the latest ...scal year end date. Some ...rms have multiple
   records from the same report type and ...scal year end date but stated
   in di¤erent currencies. For these ...rms we keep revenues stated in one
   arbitrarily chosen currency. Finally, to control for a possibility that a
   ...rm without multiple records referring to the same geographical segment,
   reports revenues in di¤erent currencies, we convert revenue data into US
   dollar. That process leaves the number of ...rms indicated in column (3) of
   Table 9. Then we eliminate any repeated sales destinations, which does not
   a¤ect the number of securities. That process may leave some companies
   with no explicit sales exposure to any of the sales destinations; these
   are eliminated; column (4) indicates how many remain. Finally, several
   securities with di¤erent ISINs have the same name. These are multiple
   listings. We choose the ISIN that has the largest market cap. That leaves
   the ...nal number of securities in each indicated in column (5).

B      EM theory with (possibly inequality) constraints
Call     the collection of parameters to be estimated. The constraints we are
considering are constraints on the values of some parameters. Lagrange multi-
pliers are special "parameters". Let the constraints be g ( ) 0. Our goal is to
maximize
                        L (R; ; ) , ln p (R; )       g( )
But:

          L (R ; ; )    =       ln p (C; R; )         ln p (C jR; )          g( )
                                                            @
        @                        @                         @    p (C jR; )           @
          L (R ; ; )    =          ln p (C; R; )                                       g( )

   Now, take the expected value under the conditional probability distribution
                                            R
with any given parameter value ~ (naturally, p C jR; ~ dC = 1):

At each stage, the maximization in the EM algorithm picks the value ^ and ^

provides two alternative ways to compute the value of the gradients that is
reached at the end of each iteration. The expression on the right-hand side is
very convenient because the Lagrange multipliers can be easily substituted out
of it. Indeed, based on (10):
                              Z
           @                       @

                                Z
                                      @
                                          ln p C; R; ^   p C jR; ~ dC
                                     @

To perform that calculation, the only step needed is the updating of the expected
value that is the ...rst term on the right-hand side.


C      Gradients for missing data using the expected
       value of the joint log-likelihood
Let R be now a matrix of returns that are actually observed, with zeros where the
missing values are located, and let R be a matrix containing zeros everywhere
except where there are missing values, which are entered as unknowns. Then
the matrix of return is R + R so that:
                               1
                     S    =      (RR| + RR| + RR| + RR| )

Besides, the partial derivatives of the ln j j term are equal to zero.
   However, most of the elements of R are constants. For a single element (i; t),

Imagine only one missing (i) at time t:

                                                                                     i

If there are several missing (fig) at time t:

                  1                    1 fig
        fig           Rt + fig                 Rfig;t       =      0
                                                                                                        1
                                                                                         1 fig                    1
                                               Rfig;t       =          fig                                  fig       Rt

What is the purpose of the minus sign? It is to o¤set the deviations from of
the other elements of S . However, changing one element will change the mean:
                                                            !

        trace S        =                    Rk;t        Rk;
                            T t        j
                                                   T
                                   k
                                                        !
                                 1            1X
                            k      j
                                       Rj;t         Rj;
                                              T
                                                                       !
      @ trace S 1            2       1 X         1           1X
                       =       1            i       j
                                                       Rj;t        Rj;
            Ri;t            T        T    j
                                                            T

That makes no di¤erence to the replacement rule. But we make sure that R
contains zero at the missing values.

the great bene...t of this transformation being that the matrix to be inverted is
only as large as the number of zones, as opposed to being as large as the number
of ...rms.
