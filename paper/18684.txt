                                              ABSTRACT

Health information technology (IT) adoption, it is argued, will dramatically improve patient care. We
study the impact of hospital IT adoption on patient outcomes focusing on the roles of technological
and organizational complements in affecting IT's value and explore underlying mechanisms through
which IT facilitates the coordination of labor inputs. We link detailed hospital discharge data on all
Medicare fee-for-service admissions from 2002-2007 to detailed hospital-level IT adoption information.
We employ a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the parameters of interest. For all IT sensitive
conditions we find that health IT adoption reduces mortality for the most complex patients but does
not affect outcomes for the median patient. This implies that the benefits from IT adoption are skewed
to large institutions with a severe case mix. We decompose the impact of health IT into care coordination,
clinical information management, and other components. The benefits from health IT are primarily
experienced by patients whose diagnoses require cross-specialty care coordination and extensive clinical
information management.

1         Introduction
The US health care system is often criticized as fragmented and uncoordinated. The conse-
quences of this poorly integrated system are stark, leading to a large number of preventable
medical errors and wasteful resource allocation. The cost of medical errors are famously
large with some estimates attributing over 44,000 deaths annually to inpatient hospital er-
rors (IOM, 1999). Faced with a health care system that appears far from optimized many
health policy analysts have placed the diffusion of health information technology (IT) as the
centerpiece of their program to improve care continuity and coordination (IOM, 1999, 2001;
Buntin et al., 2011). Recent improvements in health IT and the growth of IT investments in
other sectors of the economy suggest that health IT can dramatically improve the practice
of medicine.
        The potential for health IT to transform health care has placed it near the top of the
health policy agenda. Presidents from both parties made health IT a budgetary priority.1
The recent HITECH Act (2009) commits an estimated $34 billion in subsidies for private
health care providers to adopt and utilize health IT systems. While health IT’s potential is
clear, these technologies are not without their critics and the ultimate economic and clinical
impact of widespread health IT adoption remains uncertain.2
        In this paper, we analyze the impact of hospitals’ adoptions of different types of health
IT applications on the outcomes of millions of Medicare patients. Our data span a period
of rapid IT adoption. The volume and quality of our data allow us explore heterogeneity
in IT’s impact across organizations and patients which, in turn, illuminates the underlying
mechanisms through which health IT acts.
        This study contributes to a growing economic literature on the value and impact of IT.
Information technologies have reduced the costs of coordinating production, communication,
and information processing, leading to a substantial increase in productivity (Stiroh, 2002;
    1
     In his January 3, 2009 radio address, President Obama stated, “We will update and computerize our
health care system to cut red tape, prevent medical mistakes, and help reduce health care costs by billions
of dollars each year.”
   2
     Black et al. (2011), for example, provide a broad review of the literature and suggest that the relationship
between IT and health care quality is unclear.

Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2003). However, the benefits of IT are not evenly distributed across
organizations as the gains from these technologies depend upon both organizational and labor
complementarities (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2002). For example, Bartel et al. (2007) find that
IT-enabled manufacturing equipment increased productivity, dramatically increased product
customization, and increased machine operator skill levels. Bloom et al. (2012) find that the
US-based firms operating in the UK earned higher returns from IT investments than non-
US based firms. These high returns are a consequence of US firms’ internal organizational
structures that complemented IT investments. Similarly, Autor et al. (1998) uncover strong
evidence of skill-biased IT and labor complementarity. Other studies emphasize the role of
task-level complementarities between IT and and labor inputs (Hubbard, 2003; Baker and
Hubbard, 2003; Autor et al., 2003; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011).
       Health care is an interesting environment to study the roles of organizational and task-
based complementarities in IT. Each patient’s diagnoses represent a set of tasks which may
be suited to guideline-based decision support or may require different levels of information
management and care coordination. We use very detailed patient-level data to estimate the
impact of hospital IT adoption on patient outcomes (mortality, length-of-stay, and hospital
readmission) focusing on the role of heterogeneity along both organizational and patient do-
mains. Like many other sectors of the economy, the health care sector has also expanded its
reliance on IT over the last two decades.3 The increasing importance of IT is not surprising.
Healthcare production requires the management, coordination, and communication of large
amounts of information and these tasks are precisely what information systems are designed
to facilitate. Many health care policy commentators contend that electronic medical record
(EMR) technologies will transform medicine by facilitating better and more coordinated care.
Health IT may also enable the creation of new provider systems like Accountable Care Or-
ganizations (ACOs) (Hillestad et al., 2005; Buntin et al., 2010). However, the ability of
health IT to transform medicine likely depends upon how IT performs in a specific organiza-
tional context and the underlying mechanisms through which it affects outcomes. It is those
   3
    Lee et al. (2012) document that from 1997 to 2007, California hospitals increased the stock of health IT
capital by 180%– a much greater increase than conventional capital and labor inputs.



                                                     2
questions that we address in this paper.
      Hospitals utilize many different types of health information technologies. These systems
are based on a core set of complementary applications. The electronic medical record (EMR)
provides the foundation for health information systems. EMRs systematically collect pa-
tients’ health information replacing traditional medical charts. Computerized provider order
entry (CPOE) capabilities allow providers to electronically enter medical orders for patient
services and medications. Through direct physician order entry, CPOE reduces opportunities
for miscommunication between disparate care providers. These technologies also serve as a
platform for decision support functions which may reduce prescribing errors and improve
clinical guideline compliance. Our analysis primarily (but not exclusively) focuses on these
core clinical applications.
      Health IT’s value may depend upon organizational and technological complements as
well as the information content of tasks. EMR systems may be used to automate standard-
ized treatment guidelines and implement rules-based procedures to prevent common errors.
This combination of technological and organizational capabilities is commonly referred to
as “Meaningful Use” - these guideline mechanisms are emphasized in both the policy and
informatics literatures. If this aspect of health IT is important, then adoption should yield
expected outcome improvements across the general inpatient population. Health IT might
also facilitate complex decision-making and communications problems.4 In particular, health
IT may help manage patients with particularly difficult clinical data management problems.
Similarly, health IT may help coordinate care for patients being treated by multiple clinical
specialties where communication between providers can be important and in practice is often
less than necessary to achieve the best patient outcomes. If these aspects of IT are impor-
tant, then adoption should affect outcomes for patients for which communication and/or
information management is most important.
      We acquire detailed, hospital-level, health IT adoption information from the Health In-
formation Management System Society (HIMSS) for all general, acute care, non-federal US
  4
    This distinction between rules-based guideline effects and complex decision making is similar to the
framework described by Autor et al. (2003).



                                                   3
hospitals from 2002-2007, a period of rapid technology diffusion. These data are merged with
hospital organization and location information from the American Hospital Association. The
number of hospitals adopting EMR increased from 16% to 33% while CPOE increased from
1% to over 16% over this time frame. These data contain information on the types and timing
of information systems installed by the organization. We merged the hospital IT adoption
data to inpatient discharge records on every Medicare, fee-for-service (FFS) patient admit-
ted for one of four high-mortality conditions we study – acute myocardial infarction (AMI),
congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary atherosclerosis (CA), and pneumonia. These data
are large with over 6,600,000 observations. We view AMI as a control diagnoses for these
analysis capturing time varying changes to hospital quality initiatives that may be correlated
with IT adoption. AMI is condition for which EMR adoption is unlikely to directly impact
outcomes as its widely accepted diagnostic and treatment protocols require rapid execution
with limited time for interaction with information systems.
       The discharge data contain detailed information on patients’ demographics, comorbidi-
ties, types of services, and procedures provided. We use these data to construct patient
severity measures. Patient severity is then decomposed into components that capture the
information management and coordination requirements resulting from each patient’s di-
agnoses. Decomposing these information and coordination requirements allows us a deep
look into the mechanisms though which IT effects the clinical production process. We use
a difference-in-difference identification strategy to remove unobserved hospital heterogeneity
that may be correlated with both health IT adoption and patient outcomes.5
       Our parameter estimates suggest that health IT does not affect patient outcomes for pa-
tients with mean severity. We examine whether this null findings is the result of uncontrolled
differences in hospitals’ uses of IT (as measured by Meaningful Use) or the adoption of com-
plementary technologies. Neither the adoption of complimentary technologies nor complying
with Meaningful Use standards affect patient outcomes. These results imply that automated
treatment guidelines and rules-based decision support systems have limited clinical benefits
   5
    Our estimates indicate that the bias from this type of endogeneity is modest - a result that is consistent
with McCullough et al. (2010) and Agha (2011).



                                                      4
for the outcomes and conditions of the average patient.
   If health IT principally affects the health production process through better clinical data
management and/or reducing the cost of coordinating care across providers, then health IT
adoption should affect outcomes for the most severely ill. We test this proposition and find
that the impact of IT is increasing in patient severity, reducing mortality for the highest
risk patients for all conditions except our control condition, AMI. These effects are precisely
estimated and are robust to multiple refutation tests. We also explored potential complemen-
tarities between health IT and the information content of tasks at a patient level. We find
strong evidence that IT adoption reduces mortality for those pneumonia patients requiring
more care coordination and those with greater information management requirements. For
the other conditions we study, the parameter estimates are not as precisely estimated but
nonetheless hint that health IT similarly affects high-severity patients by facilitating cross-
provider communication and helping hospital staff manage clinical information. Accounting
for this heterogeneous response, our parameter estimates imply that across our IT sensitive
diagnoses, mortality falls by a modest 200 deaths per 100,000 admissions after a hospital
adopts both EMR and CPOE. Importantly, the benefits of IT adoption skew towards larger
hospitals with a more severe case mix.
   The detail in our data allows us to address several other longstanding questions on the
impact of IT adoption. In other contexts, network externalities have been found to af-
fect technology adoption directly, through interoperable technologies, and indirectly through
learning spillovers. One important justification for the broad role of the federal government
in promoting health IT adoption is the presence of network externalities. If there are network
effects in hospital IT adoption they are almost surely local as health care is, in general, locally
delivered. We test for the presence of network effect by estimating the impact of neighboring
hospitals’ IT adoptions on patient outcomes controlling for unobservable and time-invariant
hospital heterogeneity. Here we find no evidence for network externalities in hospital IT
adoption. The literature has also emphasized the role of technological improvements which
may deter adoptions of current technologies as organizations delay adoption waiting for bet-
ter technologies to become available in the future as well as the importance of organizational

                                                5
learning following IT adoption. We find no evidence that the later adoption leads to bet-
ter mean outcomes or meaningful IT learning effects, nor do we find that compliance with
Meaningful Use affects mean patient outcomes.
      The role of health IT is the focus of a large literature that principally relies on pre-post
designs from the adoption by large, academic centers. In general, these studies find a large
impact of IT adoption.6 However, these large effects have not been found in the more modest
number of econometric analyses estimating the impact of health IT across a large number of
hospitals. Our work is most closely related to McCullough et al. (2010), Agha (2011) and
Miller and Tucker (2011). McCullough et al. (2010) and Agha (2011) estimates the impact of
IT adoption using a hospital-level panel where the principle dependent variables are process
quality and mortality respectively. They find that IT has little or no impact on average
hospital quality. Miller and Tucker (2011) link birth certificate records to county-level health
IT adoption rates and find that increased health IT penetration is associated with a modest
but meaningful decline in infant mortality rates.7 Dranove et al. (2012) find considerable
heterogeneity in the impact of health IT adoption on hospital cost structure. The relative
contribution of our work is the focus on the heterogeneous responses across patients and
organizations to IT adoption which is central to understanding both the impact of IT and
the underlying mechanisms.
      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the contex-
tual background of health IT and describes in detail the mechanisms through which health
IT can impact patient outcomes. Section 3 describes the data and the adoption patterns and
summary statistics are presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents our results and Section 6
concludes.

2         Background and Mechanisms
While hospitals have employed IT since the 1960s (Borzekowski, 2002), it is only during
the past decade that clinical activities have been widely automated. The Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) is the foundation of these new health information systems. The EMR replaces
traditional paper charts and documents a wide range of patient and diagnostic information.
EMRs also capture crucial clinical data such as prescriptions and lab results. EMR adoption
is, ideally, accompanied by complementary technological and organizational investments.
Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) allows providers to interact with EMR data
while making decisions in real time. Providers may use CPOE to view patient information,
laboratory results, or notes from other providers. Furthermore, CPOE may be used when
ordering prescriptions, tests, and radiological images.
        Health IT systems vary in their functionality and use. Complementary applications may
extend the effective reach of EMR and CPOE, facilitating communication across the dis-
parate components of a care provider team. Two important applications are the electronic
medication administration records (eMAR) and picture archiving communications systems
(PACS). The eMAR helps close-the-loop in medication ordering and dispensing by connecting
pharmacists, who fill prescriptions, to nurses, who administer prescriptions, at the patient’s
bedside.8 Similarly, PACS facilitates communications with radiologists, potentially increasing
the speed and quality of radiology consultations.
        Health IT may improve clinical quality through a variety of mechanisms. These technolo-
gies may be used to automate routine, rules-based, clinical processes. Treatment guidelines or
protocols may be embedded within health information systems. These protocols use patient-
level EMR data to prompt providers with suggestions or raise flags regarding potentially
risky interventions. These effects should be largest for patients facing common, standardized
problems that conform to well-accepted care guidelines; furthermore, these effects should
    8
     Many additional technologies are used with prescription pharmaceuticals such as electronic prescribing,
designated pharmacy systems, automated dispensing, etc. We focus on EMR, CPOE, and eMAR as they
are major investments and there was limited variation in the diffusion of these other technologies during our
study period (e.g., automated dispensing remained rare while pharmacy management systems were widely
diffused prior to our study period).



                                                     7
be critically dependent on the sophistication and use of health IT (Buntin et al., 2010; Jha
et al., 2009). This form of direct clinical decision support is, arguably, the most emphasized
mechanism in the health informatics and policy literature. Furthermore, the adoption and
utilization of clinical decision support systems form the key requirements for federal subsidies
under the 2009 HITECH Act.
   Health IT may also effect quality in complicated cases that would not conform to stan-
dardized care guidelines. Many severely ill patients require extensive monitoring and testing.
Health IT might improve information management and lead to improved treatment quality.
Similarly, complex patients may require care from a wide range of clinical specialists that do
not regularly coordinate care. Health IT may be particularly important for care coordination
in complex patients.
   These mechanisms are similar to those described in Autor et al. (2003). They find that IT
substituted for labor involving rules-based tasks and complemented labor involving complex
communications and decision making. Hospitals are an excellent environment for studying IT
complementarities as the information content of tasks depends upon each patient’s diagnoses.
We build on this literature by exploring a rich set of technology adoption as well as patient-
level diagnostic and treatment information.


2.1    Clinical Decision Support

Health IT may be used to provide direct clinical decision support. National provider orga-
nizations have developed treatment protocols for a wide range of common conditions with
widely accepted standards of care. These rules-based protocols may be incorporated into a
hospital’s EMR and CPOE applications. The most common forms of decision support are
treatment guideline automation and prescribing error checks.
   Treatment guidelines recommend a set of care processes for patients with common diag-
noses. Guidelines may recommend a series of tests and medications to improve diagnosis and
treatment. Surgical patients, for example, are at high risk for both infections and blood clots
(i.e., deep vein thrombosis). Problems that may be prevented through the administration of



                                               8
antibiotics and heparin respectively. Decision support systems could, for example, prompt
physicians to prescribe these drugs for surgical patients. Decision support systems may also
be used to prevent prescribing errors. Common errors include prescribing multiple drugs
with adverse interactions, drugs for which patients have a known allergy, and drug dosing
errors9 . Decision support systems may automatically check for known drug-drug interactions
or allergies recorded in a patient’s EMR. While physicians may deviate from these protocols
with good reason, automated decision support systems may prevent random errors which,
according to the IOM (1999, 2001), are quite common.
       Organizational and technological complements may be critical to achieving decision sup-
port effects. Decision support benefits from the adoption of EMR and CPOE along with
the automation of care protocols. Furthermore, providers must enter orders electronically
(e.g., electronic prescribing) to be influenced by these support systems. The benefits of these
support systems are most likely to be realized by patients of moderate to low complexity.
Standardized treatment guidelines are rarely implemented for complex combinations of di-
agnoses.10
       Finally AMI serves as an interesting control condition. Similar to the other conditions we
study, AMI is a common condition with widely accepted diagnostic and treatment protocols.
However, these protocols are learned by rote, implemented rapidly, and the key tests and
orders involve little interaction with information systems. Consequently, the effect of health
IT on AMI outcomes should be lower than for other conditions. AMI patients may, however,
benefit from a wide range of unobserved quality improvement initiatives (e.g, infection con-
trol, guideline implementation, etc.). In effect, AMI patients serve as a test for the validity
of our identification strategy.
   9
     Dosing errors are more common in children, but also occur in adult populations.
  10
     Patients with numerous and severe comorbidities often require drug combinations that would not be used
in typical patients.




                                                    9
2.2    Information Management and Care Coordination

Health IT may support clinical information management and care coordination. Many con-
ditions require extensive monitoring and testing, generating large quantities of clinical in-
formation. Health IT may be used to capture and organize these data, thus expediting and
improving treatment decisions. For example, renal failure affects a wide range of fluid and
electrolyte levels. Providers must monitor and adjust these levels on an ongoing basis. For
other conditions, monitoring of respiration and cardiac function may be crucial. Based on
our discussion with physicians, we identified five conditions that require extensive informa-
tion management. These include renal failure, diabetes, hypotension, sepsis, and hypoxia.
Treatment for each of these conditions require monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, and/or oxygen
levels. Furthermore, they involve a variety of lab tests. The monitoring process for each
of these conditions generates a large volume of data that must be repeatedly evaluated by
providers.
   Health IT may also improve care coordination and communication. Many patients suffer
from multiple conditions requiring treatment from a number of different clinical specialists.
Most specialists treat a large number of patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings
making regular communication costly. Physicians may also lack detailed knowledge of their
colleagues’ care plans. Health IT may reduce coordination and communication costs, pro-
viding physicians with easy access to their colleagues’ treatment decisions.
   We explore the roles of information management and coordination effects by allowing
the impact of health IT adoption to differ based on the set patient diagnoses. Information
management effects would lead to higher health IT benefits for patients with monitoring-
intensive diagnoses. Similarly, care coordination effects would result in the benefits from
health IT increasing in the number of clinical specialties. The construction of these measures
is further described in the data and methods sections below.




                                             10
3     Data
To perform our analyses, we combine detailed hospital IT adoption data with detailed
hospital- and patient-level information from 2002-2007. Hospital IT data are drawn from
the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics database
and the 2007 American Hospital Association’s Health IT Supplement. These data are com-
bined with the American Hospital Association’s (AHA’s) annual survey, and the MEDPAR
100% inpatient Medicare claims data (2002-2007). Earlier years of these data sources, 1998-
2001, are also used for some robustness tests. We also bring into the analysis the 5% Medicare
Standard Analytic file of physician claims for 2007 and 2008.
    The MEDPAR data provide detailed patient-level information for approximately 45 mil-
lion aged Medicare beneficiaries with inpatient admissions. These data capture patient demo-
graphics, diagnosis and severity metrics, and outcomes. Patient-level severity and outcome
measures are crucial for separating heterogeneity in clinical risk from the effects of health
IT. Furthermore, these measures are important for discerning the mechanisms through which
health IT effects outcomes. We employ three primary quality measures, sixty-day all-cause
mortality, thirty-day readmissions (conditional upon survival) and length of stay. Other
mortality and readmission durations are explored in robustness tests.
    We focus on four high-frequency and high-severity diagnoses: acute myocardial infarction
(AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary atherosclerosis (CA) and pneumonia. These
conditions were selected because they are common, mortality is a common outcome and
health IT can plausibly reduce medical errors and improve the quality of care. Models are
estimated separately by primary diagnosis. As discussed above, health IT should, however,
have a smaller effect on AMI patients.
    CHF is a condition in which the heart can no longer pump enough blood to the rest of the
body. It is the most common diagnoses for the Medicare population. Inpatient treatment
can involve surgery or medical interventions. Coronary atherosclerosis is often treated by
open heart surgery in which arteries or veins from elsewhere in the patient’s body are grafted
to the coronary arteries to bypass atherosclerotic narrowings and improve the blood supply


                                             11
to the coronary circulation supplying the myocardium. Patients generally spend 4 to 5 days
recovering from the surgery in which the medical staff administer several different drugs and
monitor the patient for fluid buildup and symptoms of pneumonia. Pneumonia is a lung
infection where treatment requires prompt blood culture testing to determine the type of
bacteria and the administration of the appropriate antibiotics. Acute myocardial infarction,
commonly called a heart attack, results from the interruption of blood supply to a part of
the heart, causing heart cells to die. AMI is leading cause of death in the US. Treatment can
include drug therapy, percutaneous coronary interventions or coronary artery bypass grafts.
Sample sizes range from 945,380 admissions for AMI to 2,476,543 for CHF.
   The MEDPAR data do not contain significant detail on the identity of the physicians
participating in the treatment during an inpatient stay. In order to construct our measure of
the demand for care coordination described below we turn to the Medicare Standard Analytic
5% physician claims data. These data contain the claims submitted by physicians caring for
patients during an inpatient episode. We use these data to identify the physician’s primary
speciality which is the critical input into calculating the expected number of unique clinical
specialties participating in the treatment of each patient.
   The HIMSS data include a rich set of information regarding hospitals’ adoption and use
of numerous HIT applications. We focus on two specific applications, CPOE and EMR,
although we explore the role of other technologies such as eMAR and PACS. The HIMSS
data describe each application’s adoption date and whether it is in use rather than being
installed.
   The HIMSS Analytics data represent a large national panel of about 4,000 hospitals.
With the exception of some small rural institutions, HIMSS Analytics forms a near census of
acute care non-federal hospitals. This sample is remarkably stable across our study period.
We matched more than 95% of hospitals from year-to-year across our sample. This suggests
that our results are representative of most types of US hospitals; however, we exclude Critical
Access, veterans, psychiatric and sub-acute hospitals.
   Our data allow us to investigate a somewhat ancillary but important issue in health IT
adoption: the role of network externalities from competitors’ technology adoption. This

                                              12
exercise requires us to construct measures of neighboring hospital health IT adoption. Using
the AHA latitude and longitude measures we construct distances between each hospital
pair in our data. Hospital specific markets are defined as all other hospitals within a 20-
mile radius of a given hospital. The number and proportion of neighboring hospitals with
EMR and CPOE at t − 1 are calculated for each hospital-specific market and is used as
the primary right-hand side variable in the network externality analysis. While neighbors’
EMR and CPOE adoption does not necessarily reflect an interoperable network it may well
be correlated with the sharing of clinical data, the use of outpatient EMR systems, or skill
spillovers in the provider labor market.
       The AHA data complement the HIMSS data by describing hospitals characteristics. Im-
portant characteristics include: adjusted admissions, bed size, service scope, payer mix,
multi-hospital system membership, and ownership status.


3.1       Meaningful Use Measures

The presence of health IT does not mean a hospital is using the technology in a meaningful
way. In particular, guideline automation and electronic prescribing may be necessary to
improve quality. In order to assess whether variation in IT utilization effects patient outcomes
we construct meaningful use measures. To formulate this measure, we rely on the responses
from 2007 AHA Annual Survey Information Technology Supplement. The HITECH Act
(2009) contains provisions that will reward hospitals for the “meaningful use” of health IT.
We construct our measure by mapping Stage I meaningful use criteria from the 2010 federal
rule to the AHA IT supplement.
       We construct and test six separate measures of Meaningful Use; however, we present
two exemplar measures. The first examines the percent of 11 criteria that are fully imple-
mented across all units and the second describes the percentage of medication orders written
electronically. These criteria are drawn from three categories: electronic clinical documenta-
tion, computerized provider order entry for medications, and decision support.11 The second
  11
    Electronic clinical documentation criteria require that systems capture patient demographics, capture
nursing assessment, keep problem lists, generate medication lists, and produce discharge summaries. Specific


                                                    13
measure is the percent of prescription orders entered electronically. Other measures are not
reported but use more or less restrictive sets of criteria. These alternative measures yield
results similar to the above Meaningful Use variables.


3.2     Measuring Clinical Information Management and Coordina-
        tion

Health IT may be particularly valuable for managing complex clinical information. We
identify five diagnoses that require extensive information management: renal failure, diabetes,
hypotension, sepsis, and hypoxia. We denote these diagnoses IM conditions. These conditions
require ongoing monitoring of fluid and electrolyte levels, frequent lab tests, and may require
further monitoring of respiration or dialysis. Indicators for these conditions are based on
the following ICD-9 codes: renal failure (584-586); diabetes (249-250); hypotension (458 and
796.3); sepsis including septicemia and bacteremia (038, 790.7, 995.91, and 995.92); and
hypoxia (411.89, 799, and 997.01). Interviews with physicians further suggest that in the
case of cardiovascular patients (i.e. patients with a primary diagnosis of CHF, CA, or AMI)
the information management problems from sepsis are concentrated among patients also
suffering from hypotension.
   Health IT may facilitate care coordination across providers for a given patient. Care
coordination difficulties are likely most acute when information needs to be shared across
physicians who practice in different specialties. Using the Medicare Standard Analytic file,
we select claims for inpatient treatment and calculate the distribution of physician specialties
treating each diagnosis.12
   Given these data, we construct an index of expected number of unique types of specialists
that treat a patent with a given set of diagnoses. Let Di denote the vector of patient i’s
diagnosis where Di is an ni × 1 vector. Let the shares of specialist type g for diagnosis d
be denoted by sgd . This is simply the share of patients with an ICD-9 diagnosis code, d,
decision support criteria include: drug-drug interaction alerts, drug-allergy alerts, drug-dosing supports,
clinical guidelines, and clinical reminders.
   12
      For this exercise we link the physician inpatient claims to Medicare’s data on physician specialty.



                                                    14
with a claim from a specialist of type g. For patient i, Ci is the expected number of unique
specialists that will treat the patient and it is defined as:

                                      1 X X      XX 
                               Ci =          sgd           sgl .                             (1)
                                      ni d g     l6=d g6=k
                                          i



In constructing Ci we are assuming that conditional on a given diagnoses, the distribution of
specialist probabilities are independent across diagnoses. This is an important assumption
and a limitation of this measure.
   The structure of ICD-9 codes provides an additional measure of clinical scope. Diagnostic
codes are organized by major classification of disease (MDC). We count the distinct MDC
categories spanned by a patient’s diagnoses as an additional measure of patient-level clinical
coordination.


3.3    Severity Adjustment

Severity adjustment variables are used to control for patient-level heterogeneity and to explore
the mechanisms through which health IT affects patient outcomes. Severity metrics are
based on patients’ demographics, admission type, current diagnoses, and treatment history.
Demographic controls include age, gender, race, interactions between these groups and a
third-order polynomial of age. Admission type indicators control for urgent, emergent, and
transfer patients. Diagnostic measures include a weighted count of advanced diagnostic
groups (ADGs) (Weiner, 1991), secondary diagnosis indicators (AMI, CHF, CA, PN, and
diabetes), and indicators for the primary diagnosis subcategories. The primary diagnostic
subcategories are based on fourth-digit ICD-9 codes except in the case of pneumonia where
third-digit indicators were employed as it spans multiple 3-digit ICD9 codes. Finally, prior
treatment controls capture whether a patient has been hospitalized in the past 6-months and
the weighted ADG for the most recent admission within that period.
   For some models we collapse all severity controls into a single linear index, sijt for patient
i at hospital j at time t. This is accomplished by regressing outcome Yijt on observable



                                               15
                          1
patient characteristics, Xijt , and a vector of time indicators τ1t :

                                                 1
                                     Yijt = µ + Xijt λ1 + τ1t + νijt .                                   (2)


It is important to note that this equation does not include IT variables or hospital indicators
as these variables would introduce endogeneity. Parameters are estimated by linear probabil-
ity model13 and then used to calculate a severity index, sijt = E[Yijt |Xijt , µ̂, λˆ1 , τˆ1t ]. In effect,
sijt is simply the national average mortality rate for patients with observed characteristics,
Xijt , at time t.14
       We also use severity to normalize our metrics of information management and clinical co-
ordination. Mortality is regressed on a vector of information management indicators (Mijt ),
the clinical coordination and MDC count indices (Cijt ), and other demographic and comor-
                  2
bidity controls (Xijt ),15

                                     2
                         Yijt = µ + Xijt λ21 + Cijt λ22 + Mijt λ23 + τ2t + νijt .                        (3)


Parameter from (3) are then used to construct severity-normalized coordination (scijt =
Cijt λ̂22 ), severity-normalized information management (sm
                                                          ijt = Mijt λ̂23 ), and other severity

(soijt = Ŷijt − scijt − sm
                          ijt ). Since Cijt and Mijt do not capture all diagnoses requiring clinical co-

ordination and information management, our empirical models will be biased against finding
information and coordination effects from health IT.
  13
     We have confirmed that results are quite similar when using probits but focus on LPM for computational
tractability when boot-strapping standard errors.
  14
     The severity measure and subsequent model results are nearly identical if parameters are allowed to vary
across time.
  15
     Note that the current weighted ADG score and the secondary diagnosis indicators (PN, CHF, CA,
                            2
AMI) are excluded from Xijt    because of partial multicollinearity (e.g., the ADG score is based, in part,
on our information management indicators) and their conceptually ambiguous relationship to information
management and clinical coordination.




                                                     16
4     Empirical Strategy
Our empirical strategy is straightforward. We estimate the impact of hospital health IT
adoption on patient outcomes for patients with different sets of diagnoses and severities of
illness. When the outcomes are discrete, we estimate the parameters using linear probabilities
models with hospital fixed effects including a very rich set of patient demographics and
seventy of illness controls.16 The hospital fixed effects control for time invariant differences
in hospital quality of care that may be correlated with IT adoption. That is, we use a
difference-in-difference identification strategy relying on variation in the timing of adoption
to pin down the parameters of interest. As we document below, there is significant variation
in the timing of adoption of health IT across hospitals.
    If hospitals experience time-varying quality shocks that are correlated with IT adoption,
then our estimates will be biased. We employ a number of robustness checks to test the
likelihood that correlated, time varying shocks are present. To summarize, we find little
evidence to suggest that hospitals that adopt health IT (or do so earlier) have differential
quality (either time invariant or time varying) than non- or late adopters. We also test the
robustness of our findings to different definitions of health IT adoption and its utilization.
    Much of the focus of this paper is devoted to estimating heterogeneous health IT effects
in order to uncover the mechanisms through which IT affects outcomes. We estimate those
effects within the linear probability models discussed above by including interactions between
different patient severity measures and health IT adoption. We test the robustness of these
models by allowing the heterogeneity to enter flexibly. Below we provide more detail on
specific models.
    Base Model: We model the latent health state for patient i at time t within hospital
    ∗                                                                                      ∗
j, Mijt , as a function of patient characteristics and hospital factors. Higher values of Mijt
correspond to poorer health. For two out of three outcomes and for the outcome that is our
                                  ∗
central focus, we do not observe Mijt . When the outcome of interest is discrete (e.g. 60-day
                         ∗
mortality), Mijt = 1 if Mijt > 0 and 0 otherwise. If the outcome is approximately continuous
  16
     We also estimated the models using probits and the results we essentially identical but we had difficulty
computing standard errors for marginal effects in the nonlinear specifications.


                                                     17
                                   ∗
(i.e. length of stay) then Mijt = Mijt . Patient characteristics include demographic and
severity measures (Xijt ) from (2) above.
       The focus here is on the impact of the impact of health IT on health. We begin by
defining Tjt−1 as an indicator equal to one if a hospital has both EMR and CPOE at time
t − 1. This definition is a simplification and implicitly assumes that the adoption of these two
applications represents a substantial increase in a hospital’s health IT. Furthermore, the lag
(t − 1) implies that the benefits of health IT follow adoption by 1-year - these assumptions
are tested in subsequent analysis.
       Our base empirical specification is:

                               ∗
                              Mijt = αj + Xijt β1 + Tjt−1 γ1 + τt + ijt ,                              (4)


where αj is a time invariant hospital-specific outcome effect that may be correlated with
the other right-hand side variables. In this framework, γ1 measures the average change
in the patient’s health state resulting from health IT adoption. The terms β1 and τt are
other parameters to be estimated, τt is a set of time indicators and ijt is an error term.17
We estimate a linear probability model using the usual linear fixed effects transformation.18
Equation 4 is estimated separately for patients with a primary diagnosis of AMI, CHF, CA,
and PN. These equations are estimated using three different outcome measures, mortality
within 60-days of admission, readmission within 30-days of discharge, and length of stay.
       Technological and Organizational Complementarities: Hospitals exhibit variation
in both the capability and utilization of their EHR systems. The returns to health IT may
depend on complementary technological and organizational investments. In particular, rules-
based decision support systems require a sophisticated set of IT applications, automated
treatment guidelines, and the use of electronic prescribing. We estimate a series of models
to test whether complementary organizational inputs affect the effectiveness of health IT.
  17
     While we do not index the error terms by equation, the error terms in each equation are unique to the
equation.
  18
     Errors are clustered by hospital to address correlation across patients within the hospital and for the
same hospital across time. The errors also are heteroskedasticity robust.




                                                    18
Finally, using this basic framework we test for the potential role of cross-hospital spillovers
or network effects in health IT adoption by including neighboring hospitals’ adoption of IT
as a regressor.
   We utilize data from the 2007 AHA EMR supplement to measure complementary orga-
nizational inputs. We denote organizational inputs by Oj and estimate parameters from the
following equation:

                         ∗
                        Mijt = αj + Xijt β3 + Tjt−1 γ3 + Oj Tjt−1 δ3 + τt + ijt .             (5)


The parameters in Equation 5 are estimated using two alternative utilization measures, the
first describes the percent of 11 key capabilities used to support decision support algorithms
while the second describes the percent of pharmacy orders entered electronically. For the
sake of brevity, in these and the rest of the models in the paper, mortality is the primary
outcome variable.
   Severity, Information Management, and Coordination: The benefits from health
IT adoption may be heterogeneous across both patients and hospitals. Health IT’s data
collection capabilities might better capture and reduce the cost of communicating clinical in-
formation, and this information may be particularly useful for treating complex, high-severity
patients. For ease of interpretation, we collapse our demographic and severity adjustment
variables into a single index, sijt , described in Equation 2. We then measure the effect of
health IT allowing information effects to depend on patient severity:

                   ∗
                  Mijt = αj + Xijt β4 + sijt γ4 + Tjt−1 δ4 + f (sijt , Tjt−1 ) + τt + ijt ,   (6)


where γ4 , δ4 , and the function f capture the effect of IT on the patient’s health state and
how it varies with patient severity. The function f is estimated using both simple (linear)
parametric and a flexible four knot cubic spline methods.
   As discussed above, health IT can facilitate nurses’ and physicians’ abilities to man-
age, process and ultimately act upon the large amounts of information the care of complex,



                                                     19
severely ill patients requires. Health IT also may reduce the cost of communicating informa-
tion across different actors in the patient care process. Most Medicare patients are admitted
with multiple diagnoses. Different conditions require differing amounts of information pro-
cessing and care coordination. As discussed in Section 3, using Equation (3) this variation
allows us to decompose patient severity into components that require information manage-
ment (sm                          c                          o
       ijt ), care coordination (sijt ), and other factors (sijt ). We then estimate the parameters

from the following equation to better understand the underlying mechanisms through which
IT affects patient health,

  ∗
 Mijt = αj + Xijt β5 + sijt γ5 + Tjt−1 δ5 + sm                c                o
                                             ijt Tjt−1 δ51 + sijt Tjt−1 δ52 + sijt Tjt−1 δ53 + τt + ijt . (7)



The parameters δ51 , δ52 and δ53 capture the impact of health IT adoption on the management
of patient information, care coordination and all other components of severity, respectively.
The variables sijt , sm      c          o
                      ijt , sijt , and sijt in Equations (6) and (7) are all estimated thus we need

to adjust the standard errors to account for this. We block bootstrap the standard errors
reestimating Equations (4) and (5) and recalculating the different sijt ’s in each iteration.
    Learning and Innovation: Information technology and its value may evolve over time
as IT manufacturers leverage improvements in computing power and reductions in the cost
of data storage and invest in improving the functionality and ease of use of their systems. If
innovation in these technologies is meaningful, the patient benefits from IT may improve over
time. Conversely, learning might increase the effective value of older information systems.
We explore vintage affects of health IT adoption by letting the value of IT depend on the
year of adoption. This provides a simple test of learning and innovation effects.



5     Adoption Patterns and Summary Statistics
Figure 1 graphs the cumulative adoption rates of different health IT systems from 1998 to
2007. Recall that our patient level data span 2002 to 2007. At the beginning of our data only
16% of hospitals had installed an EMR and 1% of hospitals had acquired a CPOE system.


                                                     20
eMAR system were almost never present in 2002. By the end of the sample, approximately
33% of hospitals had adopted an EMR, 28% had installed an eMAR and 17% had acquired
a CPOE system.
   Basic patient-level summary statistics by primary diagnoses are presented in Table 1. Not
surprisingly, the sample is predominately white and elderly with the mean age between 75
and 80 years old, depending on the primary diagnoses. The average patient in our sample
are quite ill, and this can been seen in several of the variables. Across the diagnoses, the
weighted ADGs are between 4.5 and 6.2. The average number of unique MDCs is over three
for all primary diagnoses and the average number of expected, unique specialists that these
patients see given their set of diagnoses is over three for all conditions. While the typical
patient is quite ill there are large variations in the severity of illness across patients for all
our primary diagnoses. Across the diagnoses, the coefficient of variation ranges between .38
and .30.
   Given that the average patient patient in our sample is very sick, it not surprising that
the outcomes for three of the four primary diagnoses are poor. Ignoring CA, 60-day mortality
rates range from 16% for pneumonia and CHF to 24% for AMI. The mortality rate for CA is
a much more modest 3.6%. The typical length of stay is between 4.5 and 6 days with large
variations across patients in the amount of time they spend in the hospital. Readmission is
common. Twenty-two percent of CHF patients are readmitted within 30 days while 15% of
pneumonia patents are readmitted in 30-days. Readmission rates for AMI and CA fall in
between those extremes.
   Tables 2 and 3 present mean patient and hospital characteristics by hospitals’ final IT
adoption status. Patient characteristics of adopters and non-adopters are very similar with
few exceptions. That is, there is little evidence that patents are sorting to adopting and non-
adopting hospitals based on observable severity measures. Interestingly, there is virtually
no difference in mean mortality, readmission or length of stay between adopters and non-
adopters. However, hospitals that adopt health IT are notably different than non-adopters.
Adopters are, on average, slightly larger, more likely to be nonprofit institutions and less
likely to be a member of a multi-hospital system. As we include hospital fixed effects in the

                                               21
estimation, the validity of our approach will turn on whether shocks to hospital outcomes
are correlated with the adoption of health IT. As discussed above with the results presented
below, we do not find evidence suggesting that this is the case.



6        Results

6.1       Base Model of Health IT and Health Outcomes

Equation 4 results are reported in Table 4. We find no effect of health IT adoption on either
mortality or length of stay although we do observe a very small increase in length of stay
for CHF and a small reduction in readmissions for CA. In only two of the 12 regressions
is the coefficient of interest significantly different from zero and in those cases it is small in
magnitude. It is important to note that the statistical insignificance does not reflect imprecise
estimates; rather, we have precisely measured parameters that are extremely close to zero.
The 95% confidence interval does not include a 1% mortality reduction for most diagnosis. In
the Appendix we present results from a simple OLS model without fixed effects but include
hospital characteristics to the set of independent variables. Interestingly, results from this
specification are essentially identical to those in Table 4 suggesting that hospital health IT
adoption is not correlated with time-invariant hospital unobservables.
       The results in Table 4 are noteworthy. They provide strong evidence that the average
treatment effect of health IT is near zero. While consistent with McCullough et al. (2010) and
Agha (2011) these findings differ from much of the health informatics and medical literatures
(Buntin et al., 2011).19 Taken by themselves, these findings suggest that there is no there
there for health IT and that policies designed to increase the diffusion of health IT will have
little impact on patient outcomes. However, as we show below, the actual impact of health
IT adoption on patient outcomes is more subtle. We attribute the differences in our results
from the broad informatics literature to our study design. We analyze the outcomes for all
FFS Medicare inpatient admissions (subject to the exclusion criteria described in the Data
  19
    These results are not sensitive to other patient outcome measures. McCullough et al. (2010) uses patient
safety indicators as the dependent variable and finds similar results.


                                                    22
section) and control for time invariant differences in hospital quality performance. The vast
majority of the studies in the informatics literature are single (or few) sites studies relying
on a pre/post design and with few exceptions the literature does not address the potential
endogeneity of health IT adoption.
   The results presented in Table 4 are robust to alternative measures of health IT. We
estimate the parameters of Equation 4 using both more and less restrictive definitions of
health IT adoption. Parameter estimates from alternative definitions do not change the
basic conclusion. In Panel A of Table 5 we present results from one alternative model defining
health IT adoption has having installed four major IT components: EMR, CPOE, eMAR
and PACS. As in Table 4, parameter estimates are all small and insignificantly different from
zero implying that our null results is not a consequence of our specific definition of health IT
adoption.
   Technological and Organizational Complementarities: One concern is that our
null finding could be biased as our specifications fail to account for the role of unobserved
technological and organizational inputs. In particular, Equation 4 does not measure the
inputs required to implement rules-based decision support capabilities. Beyond addressing
a potential omitted variables issue, understanding the role of organizational heterogeneity
in the use of technology on its effectiveness is a longstanding question we can examine. To
investigate this possibility, we estimate the parameters in Equation (5) using a variety of
alternative organizational and technological input measures.
   Table 5 Panel B allows the effect of health IT adoption to depend on an index of meaning-
ful use criteria. This index captures the use of automated treatment guidelines and related
technological inputs. Similarly, the results reported in Panel C allow the benefits to depend
on physicians’ actual use of electronic prescribing (i.e., the percent of pharmacy orders made
electronically). We find no evidence that the effect of health IT depend upon complementary
organizational and technological inputs. This null result was robust to alternative patient
outcome measures as well as a wide range of alternative specifications and meaningful use
metrics.
   Health IT value could also depend upon the local IT infrastructure. That is, there could be

                                              23
spillovers from network externalities or IT labor agglomeration economies. Ideally, patients’
clinical histories would be available in an interoperable electronic health record system. While
such systems remain quite rare, neighboring providers’ health IT adoption may generate
spillovers through PACS systems, electronic lab result communication, or even providers’
acceptance of and skill in health IT utilization. We allow the effect of health IT to depend
on neighboring hospitals’ health IT adoption. Table 5 shows that EMR & CPOE are not
more effective when the percent of neighboring hospitals with EMR & CPOE increase. We
obtain the same result for the number of neighboring hospitals, using more flexible functions
of neighboring hospitals’ adoption, or using alternative outcome measures.
       Severity, Information Management and Coordination: We next explore potential
heterogeneity in the impact of health IT as a function of patient seventy by estimating the
parameters from Equation (6). We estimate f , the function that relates severity and health
IT adoption to mortality, using two different approaches. The first parameterization is a
simple interaction between Tjt−1 and sijt . Panel A in Table 6 presents the results from
this specification. We find that health IT has a significant effect on mortality but that
the effect is small (or even positive) for low-severity patients and that the benefits from IT
adoption increase with severity. While the parameters are difficult to interpret directly, the
marginal effects at the mean severity are -0.5% for PN, -0.01% for CHF, -0.01% for CA, and
-0.0001% for AMI. However, this linear functional specification for f is rather restrictive.
Our next model allows severity and its interaction with health IT to follow a more flexible
specification. We employ a four-knot cubic spline of severity and interact this function with
health IT adoption in the linear probability model.20
       Table 6, Panel B presents parameter estimates from this spline specification. While the
parameter estimates are difficult to interpret directly, Figure 2 graphs the marginal effects
of health IT and their 95% confidence intervals by decile of severity implied by this spline
specification. While health IT has no measurable benefit for relatively healthy patients, it
  20
     We employed a variety of specifications and found found that they yielded similar results to those de-
scribed in Figure 2, below. Knots were placed equally across the marginal distribution of s, see Harrell (2001)
for further details.

significantly decreases mortality for relatively high-risk PN, CHF, and CA patients.21 Adop-
tion decreases mortality in the 60th decile of severity and higher and significantly decreases
mortality among CHF and CA patients in the highest severity decile. Qualitative work sug-
gests that the relatively large PN effect may be due to the increased role of medical (as
opposed to surgical) treatment and the important role played by lab result monitoring and
nutrition coordination for high-risk patients. The AMI estimates are an order of magnitude
lower than those for other conditions and not statistically significant at any severity level.
       Integrating the IT adoption effects over the severity distributions corresponds to averting
0.83 deaths per hospital per year. While the average effect is modest, adoption at hospitals
with large and complex patient populations avert as many as 8 deaths per year. The ben-
efits are most notable for pneumonia and CHF, where health IT adoption reduces 60-day
mortality by 0.67 and 0.12 deaths per hospital per year respectively. These diagnoses are
frequent, high-risk, and sensitive to health IT adoption. Adoption has a smaller effect on
CA patients, averting 0.04 deaths per hospital per year, as this diagnosis has a much lower
average mortality rate. The point estimates imply that health IT adoption has almost no
effect on aggregate AMI mortality (-0.0006).
       The estimated mortality reduction aligns with the results in Miller and Tucker (2011).
They find that EMR adoption reduces infant mortality by approximately 13 deaths per
100,000 births. We are examining the impact of health IT on the opposite end of the life
cycle spectrum with a patient population that is more severely ill with a much higher base-
line mortality rate. Thus our estimates should differ in magnitude from Miller and Tucker
(2011).22 Across the conditions we study, we find an average mortality reduction of approx-
imately 200 deaths per 100,000 admissions from IT adoption. The impact is largest for PN
where IT adoption is estimated to prevent 500 deaths per 100,000 admissions while IT adop-
  21
     It is important to note that in nearly all specifications we find that health IT adoption is associated
with a small decrease in quality for low-risk patients. These effects are always small and usually statistically
insignificant. They may, however, reflect difficulties that may arise from using EMR & CPOE systems with
imperfect interface design. The effort required to use such systems could degrade average quality while the
benefits from information management and care coordination would only accrue to higher-risk patients.
  22
     Our IT sensitive measures have an average 60-day mortality rate of 15% while child birth has an average
7-day mortality rate of 0.5%.




                                                      25
tion reduces approximately 10 deaths per 100,000 admissions for both CA and CHF. Health
IT’s effect on AMI mortality is approximately zero.
   One concern is that health IT adoption could be correlated with other organizational
and health care process change in the hospital and that our estimates are reflective of these
changes and not capturing the real health IT impact of adoption. Recall that AMI is our
control condition. Our priors are that health IT should not affect health for those patients.
The lack of an effect for AMI patients suggests that our estimates are capturing true health
IT adoption effects rather than unobserved quality improvement initiatives that may be
correlated with IT investments.
   We dive deeper into the data in order to understand the mechanisms behind IT’s hetero-
geneous treatment effects. To do this we estimate the relationship between health IT and
the presence of complex, clinical information and the requirements to coordinate patient care
across specialists. We do this by estimating the parameters from Equation (7). Table 7 re-
ports results for this model for the four separate primary diagnoses. As expected, each of the
component severity metrics has a parameter of approximately 1. The parameter estimates
of the health IT interactions with the different components of severity, with one exception,
are all negative.
   The parameters for scijt and sm
                                 ijt are most precisely estimated for PN patients. Here health

IT facilitate both care coordination and information management. An increase in expected
mortality associated with care coordination is reduced by 8.8% and an increase in mortal-
ity associated with information management is reduced by 11% for PN if the hospital has
adopted Health IT. Health IT has a significant effect for CHF patients with care coordination
problems. For CA patients, IT has its largest impact on patients with conditions requiring
greater information management. While health IT does not affect mortality for the average
patient, it has striking benefits for patients whose diagnoses span other clinical specialties;
essentially, health IT does not affect outcomes for the typical AMI patient, but when they do
realize mortality reductions when their secondary diagnoses require coordination with other
clinical specialties.
   For three of the four primary diagnoses, the sum of the coefficients on the health IT

                                              26
interactions for care coordination and information management are notably larger than the
coefficient on the interaction with other factors that drive severity. That is, the estimates
point to health IT affecting high-severity patients by facilitating cross-provider communi-
cation and helping hospital staff manage clinical information. The roles that IT plays in
these task appears to vary across primary diagnoses. Finally, these estimates likely under-
state information and coordination effects as so certainly includes some variation based on
information management and care coordination problems.
       These results emphasize the importance of task-level complementarities between IT and
and labor inputs (Autor et al., 2003; Hubbard, 2003; Baker and Hubbard, 2003; Acemoglu and
Autor, 2011). In particular, Autor et al. (2003) argue that IT facilitates complex coordination
and problem solving tasks when used in high-skill settings. Our findings demonstrate that
within firms the benefits from IT depend on the information content of tasks, especially the
need for labor coordination and information management. Despite the emphasis of the health
informatics and health policy literatures, we find little support for the hypothesis that health
IT improves quality through rules-based decision support. This may be due to the tremendous
complexity of medical decision making. Clinical decisions should be especially difficult to
automate. While our results do not emphasize the role of complementary organizational
inputs, other studies suggest that these issues are relevant to health IT utilization and value
(McCullough and Snir, 2010; Dranove et al., 2012).
       Learning and Innovation: Results from a sample test model are reported in Table
8.23 We find no evidence that IT value changes significantly over time. While innovation
and learning certainly matter, the relatively small magnitude is unsurprising. The wider IT
and productivity literature finds IT value grows slowly and is difficult to detect empirically
(Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2003; Stiroh, 2002). Lee et al. (2012) find that hospital IT investments
productivity effects mirror other industries and are stable over time. Furthermore, time
motion studies of health IT value often find learning effects, but these effects occur in less
than 1 year.
  23
     Although not reported here, we explore a series of related tests for identifying learning and innovation
effects. To date, all tests suggest that these effects are too small to be detected.

6.2        Robustness

Our ability to estimate causal relationships between IT adoption and health outcomes is
dependent upon the validity of our difference-in-differences identification strategy. For this
strategy to be valid, unobserved changes in hospital quality must be uncorrelated with the
adoption of health IT. Clearly, there are plausible threats to this identification strategy.
Hospitals could, for example, adopt IT in response to identified quality problems. Hospi-
tals might also simultaneously invest in other, unobserved, quality-improvement initiatives.
Finally health IT could change the distribution of patient severity.
       We construct a series of tests for these potential threats to identification. If health IT
were adopted in response to quality problems then leads of health IT adoption (e.g., health
IT adoption at t + 1 and t + 2) would appear to decrease quality. We estimate models with
indicators for the two periods preceding IT adoption. These results are reported in Table 8
Panel C. We find that future adoption is uncorrelated with current quality while lagged IT
adoption continues to improve quality for high-risk patients. We also estimated this model
interacting the technology adoption lead indicators with patient severity. The adoption lead
effects continued to be small and insignificant although lagged IT effects were no longer
statistically significant.
       The AMI effect provides an additional identification test. AMI involves less medical
management and fewer medical record (paper or electronic) interactions during the initial
and critical steps of treatment. Health IT should have a smaller effect on AMI although it
may be sensitive to other quality improvement initiatives. Health IT effects are between 5-
and 20-times larger for CHF, CA, and PN than for AMI (see Table 6). We also estimate
Equations 4-6 using patient safety indicators (PSIs) that should not be sensitive to health
IT. Health IT should not affect the rate of accidental punctures, foreign bodies left during
procedures, or postoperative hip fractures.24 Health IT has no effect on these non-sensitive
quality metrics.
       We also considered the possibility that health IT adoption could effect the distribution of
  24

                                                       28
patient severity. Health IT could alter severity measurement through coding changes and it
could effect physician and patient preferences across hospitals. We found that patient severity
was uncorrelated with IT adoption. We also estimated our models separately for elective and
emergent admissions as emergent admissions as selection based on severity should be more
prevalent for elective admissions. We found similar results across these different admissions
types.
       We explore many alternatives specifications for Equations 4 - 7.25 Time trends, captured
by τt could be heterogeneous. While models with hospital-specific time trends did not con-
verge we achieved similar results by allowing time trends to differ across groups of hospitals
(e.g., those who ever adopted and those who never adopted). Correlation between controls
(Xijt ) and the construction of sijt could bias the standard errors of the marginal effects of
Tt−1 . Alternative specifications replacing Xijt with flexible functions of sijt yielded similar
results. Ultimately, the finding that health IT improves outcomes for high-severity patients
is remarkably consistent across all the specifications we estimated. We also explored the
implications of our assumed linear probability model. We confirmed our results using probits
and logits.26



7        Conclusion
We measure the effect of health IT on inpatient clinical outcomes using a difference-in-
differences identification strategy and detailed patient-level data. While we find no relation-
ship between IT and quality for the average patient, IT does improve outcomes for patients
with complex, high-severity, diagnoses. The total effect is modest. Health IT adoption averts
  25
     We have estimated many specifications reflecting a variety of alternative hypotheses as well as robustness
tests and repeated tests of the same hypotheses. The large number of regressions does create the potential
for spurious correlation on occasion to appear significant. We believe this is unlikely given the consistency
of results within hypotheses. However, we employed a retention sample to guard against this possibility.
We first estimated Equations 4-6 for a wide range of specifications using a 20% subsample. We then then
confirmed these findings with a separate 20% subsample and then the full sample. Results were similar across
samples in each case.
  26
     We note however that the standard errors for the marginal effects of Tt−1 did not converge when using
the delta method in some non-linear specifications.

200 deaths per 100,000 admissions across the IT sensitive conditions we examine.27 We find
no relationship between health IT and either readmissions or length of stay.
      The health IT policy literature and the first-stage Meaningful Use rules emphasize the
role of clinical decision support systems. These systems implement rules-based algorithms to
prevent and correct clinical errors. Our results do not suggest that health IT improves quality
through rules-based decision support systems. Rather, we find that health IT improves qual-
ity by facilitating coordination and communication across providers and by helping providers
manage clinical information. These mechanisms lead to relatively high benefits among high-
risk patients. These mechanisms are often overlooked in the health IT debate but play an
important role in the broader IT and economics literature (Autor et al., 2003; Acemoglu and
Autor, 2011).
      These findings may also offer an explanation regarding why economic studies of health
IT and health outcomes (McCullough et al., 2010; Agha, 2011; Miller and Tucker, 2011) are
often less optimistic than studies in the clinical and informatics literature (Hillestad et al.,
2005; Buntin et al., 2011). Most studies of health IT value are performed at large academic
medical centers - institutions that specialize in complex cases. The effect of health IT on
quality should be higher at these institutions. These findings further suggest that the high
returns from academic institutions should be difficult to duplicate at the average US hospital
even with the adoption and utilization of sophisticated decision support systems.
      An important limitation of our study is that our data do not include the effects of newer,
potentially better, information systems. However, our results suggest a slow rate of effective
innovation for health IT. More recent technologies are correlated with larger mortality reduc-
tions, but these effects are quite small and not statistically significant. This apparently slow
productivity growth rate is similarly to the evolution of average IT value in other industries
(Stiroh, 2002; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2003) and of health IT on general productivity (Lee
et al., 2012). Similarly, learning effects and cross-hospital adoption spillovers appear to have
little effect on the health IT and quality relationship.
 27
  These numbers only reflect the FFS Medicare population diagnosed with pneumonia, CHF, CA, and
AMI, total mortality reductions would be larger.



                                                30
   While we include measures of health IT utilization our results should not be interpreted as
measuring the consequences of Meaningful Use from the HITECH Act. Rather, we employ
cross-sectional Meaningful Use data to provide evidence that our estimates are robust to
health IT measurement error. The value of Meaningful Use merits further study.
   A further limitation is that our data do not capture all of health IT’s potential benefits.
Information technology might enhance quality of care and the patient experience without
effecting mortality, readmissions, or length of stay. We have, however, found similar results
when studying patient safety indicators. Other studies using panel data techniques have
found only small changes in process quality measures (McCullough et al., 2010; Jones et al.,
2010) following health IT adoption. Health IT may also effect the efficiency of health care
delivery systems (Borzekowski, 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Agha, 2011; Dranove et al., 2012).
Ultimately, our estimates likely underestimate the welfare effects from health IT adoption
and largely ignore potential cost reducing benefits.

       clustered by hospital. Difference-in-differences identification. The terms
       f1 (si ), f2 (si ), and f3 (si ) are generated by a fourth-order cubic spline of
       severity. These terms allow severity to have a flexible effect on mortality.
       Their interactions with EMR & CPOE adoption allow for heterogeneity in
       the effect of health IT on quality over the observable dimensions of severity.

     demographic controls: female, white, female×white, age, age2, age3,
     white×age, female×age. Diagnosis-based controls include: weighted
     count of ADGs, weighted count of ADGs for prior admission
     (conditional upon an admission within the past 6 months), primary
     diagnosis subcategory indicators (4-digit ICD-9 for AMI, CA, and
     CHF, and 3-digit for PN), and secondary diagnosis indicators (AMI,
     PN, CA, CHF, diabetes, renal failure). Admission type indicators
     included: emergent, urgent, and transfer. Hospital controls included
     adjusted admissions and multi-hospital system membership.
