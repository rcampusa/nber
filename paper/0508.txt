                    State and Local Taxes and the Rate of Return
                         on Non—Financial Corporate Capital



                                     ABSTRACT



     Although   states and localities collect a substantial amount of revenue from

corporate profits taxes and property taxes on corporate capital, these taxes

have been inadequately reflected in previous calculations of the effective

corporate tax rate and the pretax rate of return to corporate capital. The

present study focuses on non—financial corporations and begins by estimating

the profits taxes and property taxes which these corporations pay to state and

local governments. These estimates are then used to calculate the pretax rate

of return on non—financial corporate capital; the results suggest that the

conventional omission of state—local property taxes leads to an understatement

of this rate of return by about one percentage point. The effective tax rate

on non—financial corporate profits is also computed, taking account of state—

local taxes. These taxes amount to approximately sixteen percent of the pretax

profits of non—financial corporations. The total effective tax rate on these

corporations is shown to have risen substantially during the past two decades;

it averaged more than seventy percent in the most recent five—year period.

     The series for the rate of return and effective tax rate are used to compute

the real after—tax rate of return on non—financial corporate capital. The

calculations show that this number has declined recently, reaching 2.3 percent

in 1979. This is to be contrasted with after—tax returns of over five percent

which prevailed during the mid—1960s.

        In measuring corporate profits, the national income and product accounts

treat state and local property taxes very differently from the profits taxes

levied by all levels of government. Pretax profits are defined as profits

before corporate income taxes but after all of the state and local property

taxes paid by corporations.1 We believe that this method is conceptually

incorrect and that it significantly distorts the measurement of the national

rate of return on additions to the stock of corporate capital.

         Although all of the taxes paid by corporations are costs from the

private viewpoint of the shareholders, these taxes do not represent social

costs. From a national or social viewpoint, the marginal product of capital

is the total addition to national output and not the addition net of the taxes

levied on capital or capital income.2 A correct measure of capital productivity

therefore requires adding the state and local property taxes to the national

  as well as property taxes. We are grateful to John Gorrnan of the Bureau of

  larger than profits taxes, the error did not lead to any incorrect qualitative

income account measure of pretax income.1 The present paper presents alter-
native estimates of the state and local property taxes paid by nonfinancial cor-

porations and the implied total pretax profits.

           In 1979, state and local governments collected more than $33 billion

in   taxes on   the   capital   or capital income of nonfinancial corporations. This

includes   the state personal income taxes on the dividends of shareholders as

well as the state and local taxes on corporate property and        profits.   State

and local taxes on the capital income of nonfinancial corporations now exceed

16 percent of real pretax capital income and 60 percent of that income net of

all federal, state and local taxes. It is clear from these figures alone that

recognizing state and local taxes is important for calculating the total

effective tax rate on capital income as well as for assessing the pretax rate

of return on corporate capital.

           Section one of the present paper presents annual estimates of the state

and local taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations for the years l948 through

1979. Because of the difficulty of calculating the property tax paid by non-

financial corporations, three alternative estimates are presented. Section two

uses these tax estimates to calculate expanded profits and the implied rate Of

return on nonfinancial corporate capital. The third section then calculates

the effective tax rate on the capital income of the nonfinancial corporate sector.

This effective tax rate reflects the federal, state and local taxes paid by

corporations, shareholders and creditors. There is a brief concluding section.



1 This expanded pretax profits differs from the social product of capital
  if there are externalities, economic rents, nonconstant returns to scale, or
  monopoly power. This distinction will be ignored in the current paper.

1. State and Local Taxes Paid by Nonfinancial Corporations

             Nonfinancial corporations pay two basic types of state and local taxes

that are based on capital or capital income: corporate profits taxes and

property taxes. There are 'no official estimates of either type of tax paid

by nonfinancial corporations. This section presents our own estimates of the

annual values of both taxes for the period since 19148.

             The total corporate profits tax accruals of state and local governments

for all types of corporations is calculated by the Department of Commerce and

published in the National Income and Product Accounts.1 The preliminary

value for 1979 is l14.3 billion. We divide this amount between nonfinancial

and financial corporations in the same ratio as the federal corporate income tax

accruals are divided between these two types of corporations. In 1979, for

example, nonfinancial corporations accounted for 81 percent of total federal

corporate tax liabilities.2 On the basis of this information, we estimate that

the state and local corporate tax liability for nonfinancial corporations as

$11.6 billion. Similar values for other years since 19148 are shown in column 1

of Table 1. Note that the tax rose from only $1.0 billion in 1960 to $2.9

billion in 1970 and $11.6 billion in 1979.

             The total value of state and local property tax collections appears

    ment receipts.

    The total corporate profits tax liability is reported in Table B—l9
    of the 1980 Economic Report while the corresponding figure for nonfinancial
    corporations is reported in Table B—il. The 1979 figures are preliminary.
    The Department of Commerce follows the same procedure, based on the NFC's share
    of federal profits, for allocating state and local profits taxes. Therefore,
    the profits tax liabilities data reported, which include federal, state and
    local taxes, reflect the share of NFC federal profit taxes in total profit
    taxes.

in the national income and product accounts- but no distinction is made between

the taxes levied on the property of nonfinancial corporations and the taxes

levied on the property of households, unincorporated business and financial cor-

porations. The total state and local property tax receipts for 1979 were $63.9

billion. Because calculating the share of property taxes levied on nonfinacial

corporations is difficult, we present three different estimates based on three

different assumptions. All three estimates are based on the Department of

Commerce    series of the replacement value of stocks of reproducible   physical

assets   and   the Federal Reserve estimates of the current market value of land

holding.2

           More specifically, the total value of property that is subject to

state and local property tax is calculated as the sum of plant and equipment,

land, and residential structures minus the amounts of those types of assets

owned by nonprofit institutions.3 The total value of taxable property estimated

for 1979 was $5,516 billion. Within this total, nonfinancial corporate business

  periodical document of the Division of Research and Statistics of the Board
  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The figures used in the calculation
  presented in this paper are from the version dated February, 1980.

3 Data on land and reproducible fixed assets are presented in the table
  "Tangible Asset Allocations"of the document cited in the previous footnote.
  For 1979, the total value (including that held by tax—exempt non—profit
  institutions) was $5683 billion. State and local jurisdictions differ in
  their treatment of inventories; to be conservative, we exclude inventories
  from the tax base and thereby reduce the fraction of property taxes assigned
  to nonfinancial corporations.

accounted for $1,670 billion or 30 percent of the total taxable capital stock.1

Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 present the two series of taxable capital stocks.

         If all jurisdictions taxed all property at the same effective tax

rate, it would be appropriate to assign state and local property taxes in the

same ratio as the value of the property itself. In fact, however, effective tax

rates differ substantially among jurisdictions and among property classes within

jurisdictions. Within jurisdictions, business property tends to be taxed more

heavily than residential property or agricultural land2; this implies that

nonfinancial corporations bear more than a proportionate share of the total

property tax. The variation in effective tax rates among jurisdictions could

either strengthen this tendency or reverse it. Because of this uncertainty,

we present three separate calculations. The first assigns property taxes in the

same ratio as the value of the property; if the variation in tax rates among

jurisdictions is uncorrelated with the mix of property types, this "equal tax"

assignment is a conservative understatement of the property tax paid by non-

financial corporations. The second and third calculations are almost certain to

bound the true value. The second method assumes that the effective tax rate on

nonfinancial corporate property is three times the effective tax rate on other


1 Including inventories would raise the total taxable capital stock by $635
  billion to $6151 billion; for nonfinancial corporations, the increase would be
  $522 billion to $2192 billion. This expanded definition would raise the share
  of nonfinancial corporate property from 0.30 to 0.36.

2 The effective tax rate has two components: the assessment—price ratio and the
  tax rate on assessed value. The 1977 Census of Governments Taxable Property
  Values and Assessment—Sales Price Ratios reports the assessment price ratio on
  commercial and industrial property to be higher than that on any other class
  of property. Netzer's (1973) comments based on his analysis of the evidence
  indicate that the equal—effective—tax—rate assumption is probably conser-
  vative.
                                             —7—

property.1 The third method assumes the opposite imbalance: the effective

tax rate on other property is three times the rate on the property of non-

financial corporations. For 1979, these two assumptions imply that nonfinancial

corporations may pay as much as 56.1 percent of the total state and local

property tax or as little as 12.7 percent.

            Column 4   of   Table 1 reports the total state and local property tax

collections2 while columns 5, 6 and 7 report the property taxes assigned to

nonfinancial corporations by the three assumptions. Note that the basic

assumption of method 1 (i.e. the assumption that nonfinancial corporations

pay the same effective tax rate as other property owners) implies that NFCs paid

$19.3 billion in property taxes during 1979.


2. Expanded Profits and the Rate of Return on Capital

            Several    recent studies have estimated the total pretax return to
capital with appropriate adjustment for the effects of inflation on the
traditional    accounting measures of corporate income.3 The common procedure

in all of these studies is to define total capital income as the sum of (1)

corporate interest payments and (2) corporate profits with a capital consumption

adjustment and inventory valuation adjustment. The rate of profit            is then
calculated    as the ratio of this measure of total capital income to the

--
     This implies that, for 1979, nonfinancial corporations paid 56.7 percent
     of the property tax even though they only had 30.3 percent of taxable
     property.

3 See Nordhaus (191I), Feldstein and Summers (1971)        and   Holland and Myers (1979).

     There is no need to adjust for changes in the real value of corporate debt
     (due to inflation or interest rate changes) since any gain by the equity
     owners represents an equal loss to the creditors and leaves total capital
     income unchanged.

replacement value of the corporate capital stock defined to include fixed
capital, inventories and land)-

          These   estimates rely on the work by the Department of Commerce during
the past decade that led to their publication of estimates of economic
depreciation   and of the replacement cost of fixed business capital.2 The

Federal Reserve Board's "Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy" incorporate

these Commerce Department estimates and also provide unpublished Commerce

Department estimate,s   of the market value of inventories and their own     estimates

of the market value of land. The capital stock is       defined on a "net"   basis   3 and

capital   income is defined in the corresponding way.

          Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 present this conventional measure of total

corporate income and the implied net rate of return. Column 3 expands the

measure of total corporate income by including the estimate of the state and

local property taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations on the assumption of,

equal effective rates of property tax on all types of property, i.e., column 3



1 Land is, of course, included at an estimated market value. Lovell (1978)
  presents estimated profit rates that include only plant and equipment in the
  capital stock; since inventories and land represent about 35 percent of the
  total NFC capital stock, this measure is very seriously incorrect.

2 These data are    more fully described in the April, 1976 issue of the Survey
  of   Current Business.
3 The capital stock is measured net of depreciation in contrast to a gross
  capital stock from which scrapping is deducted. All of the estimates in the
  present paper are therefore comparable to the "net" profitability series in
  Feldstein and Summers (1977) and not to the "gross" profitability series.

14 These figures differ from the rN series in Feldstein and Summers (1977) only
  because of data revisions. Data revisions affect the earlier years in the
  series because of the new estimates of the values of land and inventories.

is   the sum of column 1 of Table 2 plus column 5   of   Table 1. The corresponding
rate of return, calculated by dividing column 3 by the same capital stock
series that   is used to go from column 1 to column 2, is presented in column 14•

           For the 30 year period from 19148 through 1919,   the total pretax rate of
return (column 14) averages 11.4 percent. By contrast, the conventional return

based on capital income after state and local property tax payments is only 10.2

percent. The failure to add state and local property taxes back into the total

return to capital caused previous estimates to understate the rate of return by

about 1.2 percentage points or nearly 11 percent. The estimates for overlapping

decades (also shown in Table 2) indicate that this difference has      remained
fairly constant over the post—war period with some tendency for a larger gap in

the second half of the period than in the first half.

           Columns 5 and 6 present alternative estimates of the net rate of return

based on the two extreme assumptions about the property tax rates on nonfinan-

cial corporations and other types of property. The assumption that the non-

financial corporations pay a property tax rate equal to three times the rate paid

on other property yields the series shown in column 5 and implies that the

conventional estimate of the rate of return understates the true value by

about 2.1 percentage points. Conversely, the extreme assumption of 'under—

taxat ion' of nonfinacial corporate property implies that the conventional

estimate understates the true rate of return by about 0.5 percentage points

(column 6). It seems safe to conclude that the truth lies somewhere between

these extremes and that the conventional estimate of the rate of return has been

too low by between one and two percentage points, implying that the true value

exceeds the conventional estimate by between 10 and 20 percent.

3. Effective Tax Rates

          The effective tax rate on the capital income of nonfinancial

corporations depends on the federal, state and local taxes that are paid

by the corporation itself and by the corporation's shareholders and creditors.

These include the corporate income taxes, the property tax, the personal tax

on dividends and capital gains, and the personal and corporate taxes on the

interest income received by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporationsJ

          In an earlier paper, Feldstein and Summers (1979) calculated the

effective tax rate on the capital income of nonfinancial corporations. In contrast

to previous studies that were limited to the corporate rate, the Feldstein—Summers

analysis included also the federal taxes on dividends, capital gains and

interest. They defined the effective tax rate as the ratio of the combined

tax   liability to the real pretax capital income. The present study redefines
this tax rate in two fundamental ways.    The   total tax burden is expanded to
include   the state and local taxes discussed in Section 2 as well as the state

and local taxes paid by shareholders and creditors. The real capital income

of the nonfinancial corporations is also expanded by including the state and

local property taxes. Since the effective tax ratio is less than one, adding



1 The logic of this calculation implies that it would also be appropriate
 to include sales taxes to the extent that they represent a tax on the
 consumption financed by the dividends, interest and capital gains of non-
 financial corporations, i.e., to the extent that these sales taxes are a
 substitute for personal income taxes. It would not be appropriate to include
 the sales taxes paid by nonfinancial corporation as such or the tax that they
 pay based on their payroll. This classification of taxes is equivalent to
 basing the effective tax rate on the taxes that would be borne by corporate
 capital if there were no change in the capital—labor ratio or the allocation
 of   capital in response to the taxes themselves.
                                       —12—




equal   amounts to the numerator and denominator would   raise   the ratio. In fact,

the numerator is increased by more than the denominator so the effective tax

ratio rises even more. In addition to this fundamental change in the definition

of the effective tax rate, we also take this opportunity to make several smaller

improvements in the previous Feldstein —Summers procedure.

          Table 3 presents each of the components of the total effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate is expressed as a percentage of what we shall call the

"adjusted real capital income" of the nonfinancial corporations. This adjusted

income is the total pretax capital income of the nonfinancial corporations

adjusted for tbe corporation's losses on non—interezt bearing financial assets

(cash, demand deposits arid net trade credit). These losses are calculated as

the product of the percentage change in the personal consumption deflator and

the total value of these non—interest bearing assets.1 We adjust these for

inflation because they represent a real loss to the corporation without being

a real gain to any explicit provider of corporate capital; i.e., the loss on

net trade credit is similar to a price reduction, the loss on cash is a gain

to the government, and the loss on demand deposits is a gain to commercial banks.

          The adjusted real capital income series presented in the first column

of Table 3 is based on the assumption of equal effective property tax      rates.
This series therefore differs from the figures in column 3 of Table 2 only



1 Annual series for these assets, calculated from the Federal Reserve "Balance
  Sheets", are presented in columns 1 and 2 of Appendix table A—l. The inflation
  rate for each year is computed as the January—to—January change in the personal
  consumption expenditure deflator.

because of the inflation adjustment. A comparison of these two series

shows that the adjustment reduces the measure of real corporate income

by about seven percent.

           Colwnn 2 presents the NFC federal corporate income tax payments as

a percentage of this adjusted real capital income. The corresponding state and

local corporate tax payments are shown in column 3. It is noteworthy that      the
state and local payments were only about five percent of the federal payment in

the 1950's but have recently risen to eighteen percent of the federal tax.

Column 4 presents the state and local property tax payments (based on the equal

effective rate assumption). The series shows a general upward trend but appears

to have peaked    in   the early seventies and to be in decline since then. These

three   taxes have been grouped together because they are all collected   directly

from the corporation. The combined tax rate for these three types of taxes

has dropped from 58.3 percent of adjusted real capital income in the first five

years of this sample1 (1953 through 1951) to 49.5 percent in the five years

ending in 1979.

          The effective tax rate on dividends depends on the distribution of

dividends among different classes of investors (households, pension funds,

life insurance companies, etc.) and the average effective tax rate for each

class of investor. The present study uses the flow of Funds data on equity

ownership to distribute dividends among classes of investors for each year



1 Data limitations on the marginal tax rate series used later in the calculation
  precluded extension of the effective tax rate series to the years before 1953.

since 1953-. Brinrier and Brooks (1979) have calculated the tax rate on divi-

dends received by individuals, including the state and local taxes; this rate

averaged 43.2 percent for the years 1953 through 1979 and was 49 percent for

1979.2 Individuals account for approximately 93 percent of the equity that the

Flow of Funds sector statements of assets and liabilities classify as belonging

to   "householdstt; the remaining "household" equity is owned by nonprofit organi-
zations ( foundations, universities, etc.) and trusts.3 We make the conser-
vative assumption that the dividends received by these "other household
institutions" are untaxed. For the remaining dividend recipients, we follow the

procedure of Feldstein and Summers (1979) and assume that insurance companies

and banks pay a tax rate equal to fifteen percent of the corporate tax




1 This represents an improvement over Feldstein and Summers (1979) which used
  the 1976 pattern of ownership to assign dividends in all years of the sample
  period. This assignment assumes that equity in nonfinancial corporations is
  distributed in the same way as total equity and that dividends are distributed
  in proportion to total equity.

2 To compute the federal tax on dividends, Brinner and Brooks constructed a
  weighted average of individual taxrates, using the fraction of dividends
  received by each taxable income class each year and the corresponding statu-
  tory marginal rates. State dividend taxes are estimated by assuming that the
  marginal rate on dividends is 1.5 times the average state personal tax rate,
  which can be computed from NIPA aggregates. Columns 3 and 4 of Appendix table
  A—i provide the separate series for the federal and state taxes, which were
  kindly provided by Brinner and Brooks.

3 The 93 percent refers to 1975 and is based on a calculation in Feldstein and
  Summers (1979); see Securities and Exchange Commission (1977), p. 11. Our
  calculation assumes 93 percent   for all
                                         years.

rate1 (i.e., 0.069 for 1919) and that pension funds, foreign equity owners,

and other miscellaneous investors pay no tax. The relevant weighted average

of these tax rates implies an overall tax rate on dividend income in 1919 of

314.9 percent.2 Since the ratio of dividends to "adjusted real capital income"

was 25.5 percent in 1979, the taxes on dividends added 8.9 percentage points

(0.3149 x 0.255 =   0.089) to the total tax as a percentage of adjusted real
capital income. The series for all years is presented in column 5 of Table 3.

The relative stability of this tax component reflects the underlying stability

of the dividend—income ratio and the effective tax rate on dividends.3

         The appropriate effective rate of capital gains tax reflects the

distribution of equity ownership among different classes of investors and the

fact that the capital gains tax is payable only when the asset is sold. The

distribution of equity ownership has already been described in the previous

paragraph. For the sample years before 1969, individual capital gains were

taxed at half the individual's statutory rate on dividends, but subject to an

"alternative" maximum rate of 25 percent. However, gains are taxed only if

realized and the effective tax rate is reduced by the postponement of



1 In calculating their taxable income, corporations are allowed to exclude
  85 percent of the dividends received from other corporations.

2 The complete series of dividend tax rates is presented in column 5 of
  Appendix table A—i.

3 There is, of course, some decrease in the series after the tax cuts of 1963
  and 19614 but the difference is quite small.

realization.1   For the period between 1969 and   1918,   the effective tax rate

on capital gains was raised in a number of ways: the use of the alternative

tax was limited, the value of the loss offset was reduced, the "untaxed"

portion of capital gains was subject to a minimum tax, and the amount of income

qualifying for the maximum tax on personal services income was reduced. There

is no way to provide an accurate evaluation of the weighted average capital

gains tax rate for each year in our series. Instead, we shall make what we

regard as the quite conservative assumption that households paid an effective

rate of tax of only 5 percent on accruing capital gains except during the years

1969 through 1918 when the rate was 1.5 percent. Insurance companies and banks

are taxed at a 30 percent statutory rate on capital gains realizations. We

assume an effective rate of 15 percent on accruing gains because of the effect

of deferral. Finally, we assume that pensions, foreign shareholders, and other

"miscellaneous" investors pay no tax on capital gains. The overall effective

tax rate on capital gains implied by these values was .0147 in 1979 and .066 in

1978 (before the tax change).2

         The capital gains tax rate must be applied to two kinds of capital

gains: the rise in the real value that results from retained earnings and the



1 A gain can permanently escape being "realized" for tax purposes if the
  asset is bequeathed since the new owner is permitted to "step us" his
  basis for future tax liabilities to the market value at the time that the
  asset is received.

2 A complete series of capital gains tax rates is shown in column 6 of Appendix
  table A—i.
                                      —18—

rise in the nominal value that results from the general increase in the

price level. The national income account. estimate of retained earnings is

deficient because it ignores the real gain that the equity owners make at the

expense of the creditors. For example at the beginning of 1919 the net debt

of nonfinancial corporations3- was $738.2 billion. The 9.9 percent rise in the

personal consumption expenditure deflator implied a gain to the equity owners of

$73.1 and an equal loss to the creditors.2 The gain on outstanding debt must be

added to real retained earnings3 for each year to calculate the real increase in

equity value.4 I1ultiplying this real increase in equity values by the capital

gains tax rate and dividing the product by adjusted real capital income gives

the additional tax component shown in column 6 of Table 3. This source of tax

is responsible for only between one percentage point and two percentage points

of the total effective tax rate.

         An additional   capital gains tax liability results from the nominal
increase in   the value of corporate assets that accompanies a general rise in

the price level. We abstract from the year—to year stock market fluctuations


1 Computed from the Flow of Funds tables published by the Federal Reserve Board.

2 Of course, the equity owners "paid for" some of this gain in the form of
  higher interest rates and, to that extent, national income account profits
  are lower. The issue here is clarifying the real allocation of the income
  between debt and equity and identifying the way in which this extra component
  of real income is taxed.

3 The real retained earnings are, of course, after the inventory valuation
  and capital consumption allowance adjustments.

  This real increase in equity value is presented in column 7 of Appendix table
  A—i. We assume that an extra dollar of real retained earnings raises the
  market value of equities by one dollar. This abstracts from year—to—year
  fluctuations in stock market   valuation. It alsoignores the arguments of
  Auerbach (1978), Bradford (1979) and King (1977) that the capitalization of
  future tax liabilities may cause a dollar of retained earnings to raise share
  prices by less than one dollar.
                                           —19—


and calculate the nominal rise in the value of the capital stock as the product
of the capital stock at the beginning of the year and the rise in        the GNP

deflator   during the year.1 Multiplying this nominal increase in equity values

by the capital gains tax rate and dividing the product by the adjusted real

capital income gives the additional tax component shown in column 7        of   Table

3. This source of tax was responsible for less than 1.5 percentage points of

effective tax rate until the late 1960's but the rise in inflation since then

has made this a more significant factor. In the five years ending in 1979, the

accrued capital gains tax on this nominal increase was equivalent to an average

tax on total income of 4•1 percent.

           The final component of'   the   total effective tax rate is the tax

borne by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations. Although there are

federal,   state, and in some cases, local taxes on interest income, we follow
the very conservative procedure of including only the federal tax.2 Feldstein
and Swnmers (1979) used the flow—of—Funds accounts for 1976       to   estimate the

distribution of the net liabilities of nonfinancial corporations among house-

holds, pensions, commercial banks, savings banks, life insurance companies,

government accounts, and a number of smaller categories. We use the relative


1 The GNP deflator is too broad an index while the fixed nonresidential
  investment deflator is too narrow (because it excludes inventories and land);
  however both indices rose almost exactly the same amount over the 27 year
  period and behaved quite similarly from year to year. Note that the equity
  owners receive the nominal gain on the entire capital stock and not just on
  the equity fraction. The value of the beginning—of—year capital stock for
  each year, found in the "Balance Sheets" document, is presented in column 8
  of Appendix table A—l. The calculation abstracts from the depressing effect on
  share prices of unanticipated changes in inflation; see Feldstein (1980) and
  the other research cited therein.
2 We do this because of the difficulty of calculating the state and local
  taxes in interest income, especially the taxes paid by financial corporations.
                                     —20--


weights implied by this analysis and also follow Feldstein—Sumraers in setting

the household tax rate on this interest income at 35 percent, the mutual savings

bank rate at 21 percent, and the rate for private pensions, government accounts,

and "miscellaneous" creditors at zero. Life insurance companies are taxed

under a special set of tax rules that make their effective rate depend

essentially on the yield on their portfolio as well as the statutory corporate

tax rate. We apply these rules to calculate a different tax rate for every year

based on the prevailing Baa bond rate.1 For commercial banks, nonliI'e insurance

companies, and finance companies, we make the conservative assumption that one—

third of their interest income is completely sheltered from all corporate

taxes.2 The combined tax rate on interest income3 multiplied by the annual

interest payments of nonfinancial corporations and the product divided by their

adjusted real capital income gives the interest component of the total effective

tax rate that is presented in column 8 of Table 3. This component contributed

less than two percentage points to the total effective tax rate until 1966

but the rising interest rates since then raised this component to more than

seven percentage points in 1919.

         The combined total effective tax rate on the capital income of the


1 These rules (known as the tvlenge formula) imply that there is one marginal
  tax rate on the increase in income that occurs when interest rates rise and a
  different and lower marginal tax rate on the increase in income from an in-
  crease in the size of the portfolio. Because of their focus on the effect
  of inflation, Feldstein and Summers calculated the former; we calculate the
  latter.

2 This is equivalent to assuming that a larger portion is converted to capital
  gains or just postponed. The untaxed income is, of course, subject to
  further tax as the dividends and retained earnings of these financial
  corporations. We assume the same dividend—payout ratio, .1461, as Feldstein
  and Summers.

3 This rate is presented in Column 9 of Appendix Table A—i.
                                                   —21—

nonfinancial corporate sector —            i.e.,   the sum of federal, state, and local

taxes on capital and capital income divided by the adjusted real capital

income —   is   shown   in   column 9. This tax rate reached 714.5 percent in 1919;

taxes took nearly three—fourths of the total pretax income. Since 1973, the

rate has exceeded 65 percent every year. By comparison, the rate was as low as

55percent in the mid—1960's. The effective tax rates in the period from 1975 to

1979 were back to the same high level that prevailed in the early 1950's before

accelerated depreciation, the investment tax credit, rate reductions, etc. This

increase in effective tax rates occurred because of the interaction of infla-

tion with existing tax rules         and   despite several statutory changes that, in

themselves, would reduce the effective tax rate.1

           Table 14 compares alternative effective tax rates and the implied net

rate of return. Column 1 represents the combined effective tax rate from

column 9 of Table 3. The real net rate of return on nonfinancial corporate

capital is equal    to   the product of the pretax rate of return on capital

(presented in column 4 of Table 2) and one minus the effective tax rate. This

return is shown in column 2 of Table 14. The real net rate of return for 1979

was only 2.3 percent. For the most recent five years, it averaged only 2.7 per-

cent. The contrast with the ntid—1960's is striking; in the five years from 1963

through 1961, the real net return averaged 5.9 percent. Columns 3 and 4 show

the effective tax rates corresponding to the two alternative assumptions about

state and local property taxes.2 If the property of nonfinancial corporations


1 The, nature of the interaction between inflation and effective tax rates is
  discussed in Feldstein (1979) and Feldstein and Summers (1979).

2 These alternative assumptions require changes in both the numerator, for taxes
  paid, and the denominator, for pre—tax income, of the effective tax rate ratios.
                                        —22—

is taxed more heavily then other property (column 3), the estimated effective

tax rate rises by about two percentage points. Conversely, if nonfinancial

corporations are taxed more lightly than other property (column ), the

effective tax rate falls by about one and one—half percentage points.1

           The   last column of Table   ignores state and local taxes completely
and reports the effective federal tax rate defined as the ratio of the total
federal   tax to the real capital income net of the state and local taxes paid

by the corporations.2 This effective federal rate shows the same general

movement over time as the effective total rate. In the five years ending in

1919, the rate averaged 61 percent —    twelve   percentage points higher than in

the years 1963 through 1967.


I. Conclusion

           This   paper has reported new estimates of four important time series.
The first is the amount of state and local taxes levied on the capital or
capital income of nonfinancial     corporations. The principal estimate showed

that   these taxes now represent about sixteen percent of the total before tax
returns   to capital of nonfinancial corporations and that this percentage has

been generally increasing over the past 30 years.

           Adding an estimate of the state and local property taxes paid by non-

financial corporations to the national income account estimates of corporate

interest payments and real corporate profits before income taxes provides a



1 Note that the real net rate of return of column 2 is independent of the
  assumption about the effective property tax rate.

2 This is an updated version of the effective tax rate series reported in Feldstein
  and Summers (1979), Table 5, with state and local profit taxes subtracted.

measure of the total return to capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector.

Since 19)48, the total return has averaged ii.)4 percent of the real capital stock

of these nonfinancial corporations (including land and inventories as well

as plant and equipment).

         The effective tax rate on nonfinancial corporate capital is the ratio

of the total taxes —     federal,   state and local paid by corporations, shareholders

and creditors —   to   the total real pretax income of capital. For the period from

1953 through 1919, this effective tax rate averaged 61.1 percent. In the five

years ending in 1979, the rate was an unusually high 71.1 percent, primarily a

reflection of the impact of inflation with existing tax rules.

         Finally, the effective tax rate and the pretax real return can be

combined to obtain a real after—tax return on the capital of nonfinancial

corporations. This is the total real net return earned by the providers of

capital, both creditors and shareholders, and including retained earnings

as well as dividends. This total real net return averaged 3.3 percent for

the period from 1953 through 1959, )4.9 percent from 1960 through 1969, and

only 2.7 percent from 1970 through 1979.
