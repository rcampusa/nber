Secular Stagnation in the Open Economy

Conditions of secular stagnation - low interest rates, below target inflation, and sluggish output
growth – now characterize much of the global economy. We consider a simple two-country
textbook model to examine how capital markets transmit secular stagnation and to study policy
externalities across countries. We find capital flows transmit recessions in a world with low
interest rates and that policies that trigger current account surpluses are beggar-thy-neighbor.
Monetary expansion cannot eliminate a secular stagnation and may have beggar-thy-neighbor
effects, while sufficiently large fiscal interventions can eliminate a secular stagnation and carry
positive externalities.

  The disappointing recovery of the US and other advanced economies in the wake of the Great

Recession and the tendency for periods of adequate growth to involve unstable finance has

resurrected interest in Alvin Hansen’s idea of secular stagnation (Summers (2014)). The

argument is that the industrial world is plagued by an increasing propensity to save and a

declining propensity to invest. The result is a declining equilibrium real interest rate, a tendency

for lower bounds on interest rates to constrain their ability to find equilibrium levels, and a

consequent persistence of inadequate demand leading to slow growth, sub-target inflation, and

excessive non-employment. A defining element of secular stagnation theories is that, unlike the

many analyses of liquidity trap situations in the tradition of Krugman (1998) in which it is

assumed, there is no deus ex machina that will return the economy to a situation of positive real

interest rates at some future point. This now appears highly plausible. Average long-term

interest rates around the industrial world are now lower than they were five years ago in the

immediate aftermath of the crisis.

As this is written, financial markets suggest that inflation is expected to remain well below its 2

percent target for well over a decade in the United States, Europe and Japan, and that real interest
rates are likely to remain well below 1 percent into the indefinite future. Figure 1 shows the

continuous drop in longer-term interest rate over the past quarter of a century.2

  Much of the discussion of secular stagnation has taken place in the context of closed economy

models. Yet declining real interest rates have been observed throughout the industrialized world

as illustrated in Figure 1, and it is clear that capital flows to and from developing markets are

large enough to impact their level on a global basis. Figure 2 illustrates that the decline in

interest rate across the globe has been associated with large swings in the current account across

countries, with the US being the largest deficit country. There is some recent indication, as

illustrated in Figure 3, that capital flight from emerging markets has increased recently. So it

seems important to understand issues related to secular stagnation in a global context.

which equilibrium real interest rates can permanently be negative. They consider the impacts of

various kinds of shocks to saving and investment in an international context and note how the

assets rather than an excess of saving.

  With the comfort provided by this earlier work in the context of optimizing models, this paper

takes up the policy implications of secular stagnation in the open economy in the context of a

textbook IS-MP model similar to the one introduced by Romer (2013). We reach two primary

conclusions. First, secular stagnation risks magnifying the importance of international linkages

and the gains from policy coordination. In particular we show that capital inflows can have

strong negative externalities for a country constrained by the zero lower bound, a result

reminiscent of neo-merchantilism. Second, recognizing open economy considerations reinforces

the case for primary reliance on fiscal rather than monetary policies in combatting secular

stagnation.

      Section I sketches the model. Section II uses the model to consider a range of shocks and

policy changes. Section III addresses possible objections and generalizations and considers the

current policy context.
   I. A Simple Model

   We consider a simple variation of a two country IS-MP framework focusing on the case where

interest rates in at least one country are constrained by the zero bound. There are two countries,

home and foreign each satisfying an investment-savings (IS) equation, a monetary policy Taylor

rule (MP) augmented by the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate (ZLB), and an

aggregate supply equation (AS): 3

where !!! !! !!! !! !! ! ! ! and !! ! ! are parameters, ! is the inflation target, ! is output, ! is

the short-term nominal interest rate, ! is inflation, ! is government spending, ! is the real

exchange rate, ! ! !is the real value of the assets of foreigners in the domestic economy, ! ! is

government debt and IR is international reserves of the foreign government held in domestic

government bonds. For now, the domestic real interest rate, ! ! ! ! ! , is assumed to be higher

than the foreign real interest rate ! ! , hence private savings are flowing from abroad to the home

country. ! ! and !! are the real interest rate and output consistent with full employment, often

referred to as natural or neutral rates. While !! is a fixed constant, ! ! depends on exogenous and

policy variables and is determined by the IS equation by setting ! ! !! . ! is a composite of

secular terms.4




   3
     While largely analogous to the textbook setup, this set of equations can be derived by a log-linearization of the steady state of the model in
EMSS if changes in public debt or government spending are financed by a tax on the working age population and the real exchange rate is fixed.
Note that once the real exchange rate is endogenous, one needs one additional equation to close the model, which in textbook treatments is
typically a balance of payments equation.
   4
     Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014), for example, show how lower population or productivity growth, an increase in income inequality, a
debt deleveraging shock, or a fall in the relative price of investment goods can generate this shock.
  The foreign economy satisfies the same set of equations where we denote each variable by *

except that the signs in front of ! and ! ! are now positive. We generally think of ! ! as an

increasing function of the spread between the two interest rates: ! ! ! !!! ! ! ! !.5 In the

equations above, we assume interest rates are higher at home; if they are instead higher abroad,

then capital flows from home to abroad so that ! ! ! !.

  Figure 4 plots the aggregate demand (AD) curve - MP and IS combined - and the aggregate

supply (AS) curve for the domestic economy taking ! ! and ! as given. When the nominal

interest rate is positive, the AD curve is downward sloping, as the central bank cuts the nominal

interest rate more than one to one in response to inflation below target, lowering real rates and

increasing demand. However, there is a limit to how far the central bank can lower rates due to

the ZLB. At the ZLB, the AD curve kinks and becomes upward sloping. Since nominal rates are

stuck at zero, lower inflation now raises real interest rates, thereby reducing demand. The AS

curve is relatively standard: there is a trade-off between inflation and output until full

employment is reached and output equals its full employment level.6 If the domestic natural

interest rate is sufficient high (! ! ! !!), the AD and AS curves intersect on the vertical segment

of the AS curve (point A), with a positive nominal rate, output at its full-employment level, and

inflation at target. However, if the natural rate is too low, this intersection point falls on the other

side of the kink point (B); the domestic economy finds itself in secular stagnation – a steady state

characterized by a binding ZLB, inflation below target, and a persistent output gap.

  How does an economy find itself in a secular stagnation? The IS curve determines the

equilibrium real interest rate in the domestic bond market for a given level of output. A secular

stagnation occurs when the real interest rate with output at full employment - the natural rate of

interest - is sufficiently negative so that the ZLB is binding (! ! ! !!). Forces that increase loan

supply shift back the IS curve and lower the natural rate of interest, e.g., foreign capital inflows.

Forces that reduce loan demand shift back the IS curve by reducing the natural rate of interest,

e.g., tighter fiscal policy.

  A useful way to think about a secular stagnation is that it corresponds to a situation in which

the desired savings at full employment outpace desired investment. The ZLB prevents the

equilibrium real rate from falling to its natural rate where desired savings are equated to

investment at full employment, and, therefore, output and inflation fall below their full

employment level to restore equilibrium.

  Can secular stagnation be transmitted across borders? Figure 5 shows the scenario when the

foreign economy is in a secular stagnation, while home is not. Consider now the effect of higher

capital flows from foreign to home. An increase in capital flows to the domestic economy shifts

inward the AD curve; for a given level of output, the real rate needs to be lower to accommodate

the extra supply of savings. For a small enough change, monetary policy in the home country

lowers rates to maintain full employment (point B in the left panel of Figure 5).7 For the foreign

economy, the capital outflow raises their natural rate alleviating secular stagnation (point B* in

right panel of Figure 5). However, this process can go too far. Further capital flows can drag the

domestic economy into secular stagnation (point C) as well. Rather than propagating low interest

rates, capital flows instead propagate a recession once the ZLB becomes binding.

  More broadly, Figure 5 illustrates that in a global secular stagnation, neo-mercantilist policies –

policies that attempt to improve one country’s net foreign asset position relative to another or run

persistent current account surpluses – are beggar-thy-neighbor. Neo-mercantilist policies

alleviate the secular stagnation of the country pursuing them by exporting savings, but at the

expense of the trading partner.

  The real exchange rate is a second channel that can transmit secular stagnation, independently

of the capital flows. To the extent that a secular stagnation abroad translates into a higher real

exchange rate at home, this directly reduces the natural rate of interest at home, as net export

decreases, shifting the AD curve inward. If strong enough, this effect may also lead to a secular

stagnation.

   II. International Dimension of Policy in a Secular Stagnation

   In a secular stagnation, each country’s policy choices have strong externalities on their trading

partners, either positive or negative, beyond normal circumstances due to the ZLB. Expansionary

introduce a balance of payments equation.
monetary policy, or alternatively currency depreciation, tends to generate negative externalities.

Expansionary fiscal policy tends to generate positive externalities.

 Expansionary monetary policy, shown in the left panel of Figure 6 is an increase in the inflation

target !. This leads to an upward shift in the kink point in the AD curve from ADSS to ADM; now

the segment of the AD curve consistent with positive interest rates intersects the AS curve on the

vertical segment at B. Two insights emerge: first, while the full employment equilibrium is a

possibility, an increase in the inflation target does not exclude secular stagnation. It is perfectly

rational for households to ignore the new inflation announcement of the central bank and the

economy then remains mired in stagnation. Moreover, an increase in the inflation target must be

sufficiently aggressive. Otherwise, the kink point will not shift enough, and the AD curve does

not intersect the AS curve at B.

Second, conditional on realizing the inflation target, a successful monetary easing has negative

spillovers on the trading partner via two channels. By generating a negative real interest rate for

the domestic economy, the higher inflation target triggers a reversal of capital flows, worsening

the mismatch between the desired saving and investment abroad, shifting AD* to B* in the right
panel of Figure 6. Moreover, to the extent expansionary monetary policy depreciates the real

exchange rate, this too, reduces demand abroad.8,9

  Expansionary fiscal policy is shown in the left panel of Figure 6. This policy shifts the entire

AD schedule to the right from ADSS to ADF (not just the kink point) with two important

implications. First, if policy is aggressive enough, it eliminates the possibility of a secular

stagnation altogether at home and ensures full employment. Second, the success of this policy is

not contingent on reducing equilibrium real interest rates! !, or, more generally, the real exchange

rate. Instead, it is an expenditure boosting policy that relies on increasing the natural interest rate

! ! , which closes the output gap since the degree of slack in a secular stagnation depends on the

gap: ! ! ! !. Thus, if fiscal policy is aggressive enough, it not only eliminates stagnation, it also

moves the economy off the ZLB. Fiscal policy, in contrast to monetary policy, may increase the

domestic real interest rate, leading to capital inflows from abroad yielding positive externalities

for trading partners as shown by point C* in the right panel of Figure 6. Moreover, to the extent

that the real exchange rate in the country undertaking the fiscal expansion appreciates, this leads

to further beneficial spillovers via trade. 10

  III: Outlook for Global Economic Growth

  Our analysis has disturbing implications for growth going forward.                                     If as many believe

reductions in confidence in a range of emerging markets will drive a reduction in capital inflows

and an increase in capital outflows going forward, the result will be unambiguously

contractionary for the industrialized world as the increase in the trade deficit cannot be

significantly mitigated by reductions in interest rates given that they are close to their lower


  8
      If monetary policy is successful, the outflow of capital from the domestic economy increases demand in the domestic
economy. This has no effect on !!or !, but it raises the ! ! , so we omit it from the graph.
   9
     A full reversal of capital flows is not needed to generate this result since the capital flow depends on the spread between the
interest rates of the two countries. Moreover this result holds even under perfect capital market integration as shown in EMSS.
   10
      If the fiscal policy response is not strong enough to increase real interest rate, but instead decreases rates as happens for a
small fiscal expansion, then whether there are positive spillovers depends on a horse race between the stimulative effect real
appreciation vs. the negative effect of lower real interest rate.In the case of fully integrated capital market as in EMSS, fiscal
policy always has positive spillovers and the sign is unambiguous.
bound. It is likely that increased capital flight from emerging markets will also be associated

with a weakening of their economies, leading to a currency appreciation in the industrial world.

The upshot is that capital mobility may be associated with a generalized weakening of the global

economy.

  This situation is quite different from the situation at other moments like the Latin American

debt crisis of the 1980s or the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s when capital outflows from

emerging markets coincided with reductions in US interest rates and a resulting increase in asset

values. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the US stock market seems more sensitive to

developments in China than would be implied by historical experience or traditional open

economy models.

  Our analysis also carries implications for international economic policy. For the industrial

world, capital inflows are likely to be contractionary in a way that cannot be offset by monetary

policy. The implication is that policies to maintain the flow of capital to emerging markets

through encouragement of structural reforms, provision of official finance, and debt relief are

more important for domestic prosperity than is the case when secular stagnation is not an issue.

The irony of course is that maintaining political support for such policies becomes more difficult

in difficult times at home.

  A further implication of our analysis is that, in the presence of secular stagnation, there will be

a systematic tendency for countries to rely excessively on monetary stimulus relative to fiscal

stimulus. To see this, imagine that a country is at the margin indifferent between fiscal and

monetary stimulus taking account of all domestic considerations. What would be the preferences

of its trading partners? Clearly they would prefer fiscal stimulus which can be expansionary

because it (i) falls partially on goods that will be imported and (ii) may lead to an increase in the

real interest rate that attract foreign capital, reducing the excessive savings problem of the

trading partner. Meanwhile, monetary policy will be expansionary for the country undertaking it
via an increase in competitiveness and/or lower real interest rates that trigger capital outflows,

with both channels working at the trading partner’s expense.

  This observation resonates with the widespread view of central bankers that they are being

asked to carry too much of the burden of restoring growth in the industrial world and with

widespread fears about “currency wars”. Cooperative efforts to internalize these externalities

and achieve more significant fiscal expansion have the potential to achieve greater gains in

output and to help countries achieve their national economic objectives.

  In EMSS we take up the concern that fiscal policy is infeasible because of government budget

constraints and questions of fiscal sustainability by making the point that, following the analysis

of Delong and Summers (2012), fiscal policy may actually reduce debt to GDP ratios, and by

noting that even temporary fiscal expansions of sufficient magnitude will, under plausible

assumptions, move economies in secular stagnation into normal conditions.

  Ultimately the relevance of the analysis in this paper depends on the plausibility of secular

stagnation concerns. This of course is a matter of judgment. We conclude by observing that the

combination of the long term downward trend in real interest rates, the continuation of very

sluggish growth even in the presence of zero rates, market forecasts that that neither real interest

rates nor inflation will normalize over periods of more than a decade anywhere in the industrial

world, and growing concerns about the sustainability of even the slow recovery from the

financial crisis in the United States make us believe that economists and policymakers need to

give substantial weight to the possibility that secular stagnation will be the defining economic

challenge for macroeconomic policy over the next decade.
