We estimate the causal effect of wealth on stock market participation using administrative data on
Swedish lottery players. A $150,000 windfall gain increases stock ownership probability among pre-lottery
non-participants by 12 percentage points, while pre-lottery stock holders are unaffected. The effect
is immediate, seemingly permanent and heterogeneous in intuitive ways. Standard lifecycle models
predict wealth effects far too large to match our causal estimates under common calibrations. Additional
analyses suggest a limited role for explanations such as procrastination or real-estate investment. Overall,
results suggest that “nonstandard” beliefs or preferences contribute to the nonparticipation of households
across many demographic groups.

         Windfall Gains and Stock Market Participation∗
                   By Joseph Briggs,† David Cesarini, Erik Lindqvist, and Robert Östling


       We estimate the causal effect of wealth on stock market participation using administrative data
       on Swedish lottery players. A $150,000 windfall gain increases stock ownership probability
       among pre-lottery non-participants by 12 percentage points, while pre-lottery stock holders are
       unaffected. The effect is immediate, seemingly permanent and heterogeneous in intuitive ways.
       Standard lifecycle models predict wealth effects far too large to match our causal estimates
       under common calibrations. Additional analyses suggest a limited role for explanations such as
       procrastination or real-estate investment. Overall, results suggest that “nonstandard” beliefs or
       preferences contribute to the nonparticipation of households across many demographic groups.


   “The ideal experiment to answer the causality question would be to exogenously dump a
   large amount of wealth on a random sample of households and examine the effect... on their
   risk-taking behavior.” - Carroll (2002)

     Canonical life-cycle models of consumption and savings predict all individuals should invest
a positive fraction of their wealth in equities (Samuelson (1969); Merton (1971)). However, a
sizeable fraction of households in developed countries do not own equity (Guiso, Haliassos and
Jappelli (2002)). A large literature in household finance formulates and tests hypotheses about
the causes of what has been dubbed the “non-participation puzzle” (Haliassos and Bertaut (1995);
Vissing-Jørgensen (2003); Campbell (2006); Guiso and Sodini (2013)). Insights into the causes of
non-participation may guide efforts to more effectively promote efficient financial decision making
(Campbell (2006)).
     Limited stock market participation is often analyzed in models where agents weigh the bene-
fits of participation against its costs (Mulligan and Sala-i Martin (2000); Vissing-Jørgensen (2002);
Vissing-Jørgensen (2003); Paiella (2007); Attanasio and Paiella (2011)). A pioneer in this literature
was Vissing-Jørgensen (2003), who proposed a simple framework with two types of fixed costs:

per-period participation costs and a one-time entry cost. Since the gains from participation are
increasing in wealth, whereas the costs are assumed fixed, these models provide a simple and plau-
sible structural interpretation of the robustly documented positive correlation between wealth and
stock market participation (Mankiw and Zeldes (1991); Poterba and Samwick (2003); Campbell
(2006)). Vissing-Jørgensen (2003) showed that in a model calibrated using the US cross-sectional
wealth distribution, per-period participation costs of a magnitude comparable to realistic estimates
of the direct financial costs of participation could account for the majority of the non-participation
of all but the wealthiest households.
    This framework has proven to be a valuable foundation for subsequent work, much of which
extends and refines the theory along several dimensions. Housing (Cocco (2005); Flavin and Ya-
mashita (2011); Vestman (2013)) and outstanding debt (Davis, Kubler and Willen (2006); Becker
and Shabani (2010)) reduce benefits of participation by providing a potentially preferred invest-
ment. Private business equity (Heaton and Lucas (2000a)) and stochastic labor income (Viceira
(2001)) increase background risk and may be positively correlated with equity returns, thus reduc-
ing benefits of participation.
    Though many portfolio theories make precise, quantitative predictions about the effect of a
windfall gain on risk-taking behavior, credibly testing these predictions is difficult, as the open-
ing quote by Carroll illustrates. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of wealth on stock
market participation by exploiting the randomized assignment of wealth in three Swedish samples
of lottery players who have been matched to administrative records with high-quality information
about financial portfolios. The sample has a number of desirable characteristics. First, we observe
the factors (e.g., number of tickets owned) conditional on which the lottery wealth is randomly
assigned. Second, because the size of the prize pool is over 500 million dollars, our study has ex-
cellent power to detect even modest effects of wealth on participation over various time horizons.
Third, the prizes won by the players in our sample vary in magnitude, allowing us to explore and
characterize nonlinear effects of wealth. Finally, because our lottery and financial data are drawn
from administrative records, our sample is virtually free from attrition.
    Our analyses proceed in two stages. We begin by reporting the results from a set of reduced-
form analyses of how wealth affects participation. On average, a positive net wealth shock of 1M
SEK (approximately 150K USD) increases the participation probability in post-lottery years by 4
percentage points.1 This effect is accounted for entirely by a 12 percentage-point increase in the
stock market participation of households that did not participate in equity markets at the time of
the lottery. The positive effect in these households is precisely estimated, immediate, seemingly
permanent, and heterogeneous in directions that are easy to reconcile qualitatively with the predic-
   1
    All monetary variables presented in this paper are reported in year-2010 prices. When converting to USD, we use
the Dec. 31, 2010 exchange rate of 6.72 SEK/1 USD.

tions of standard models: wealth effects are larger in households who are poorer, college-educated,
debt-free, not self-employed, and win during a period of positive returns. We also document that
in nonparticipants, the effect of wealth on bond-market entry is greater than its effect on equity
entry, both on the intensive and extensive margin.
    In the second stage, we examine how our results help narrow the set of hypotheses about the
causes of non-participation. We show in a model validation exercise that under a wide range of
calibrations, a standard life-cycle model systematically predicts effects of windfall gains on par-
ticipation substantially larger than those we estimate. We also estimate the fixed entry and partici-
pation costs needed to match our causal estimates. Our primary conclusion is that over 45 percent
of nonparticipants are estimated to have entry costs greater than 1M SEK (150K USD), whereas
per-period participation costs are quite modest and exhibit little variation across households. When
we introduce heterogeneity by pre-lottery characteristics, we find that in all subpopulations con-
sidered, the median entry costs are much larger than typical estimates in the structural literature
(e.g., Gomes and Michaelides (2005); Cocco (2005); Alan (2006); Khorunzhina (2013)).
    A first contribution of this paper is to provide credible and precise estimates of how large wealth
shocks affect stock market participation. Researchers interested in the relationship between wealth
and participation are usually confined to studying observational data (Calvet, Campbell and Sodini
(2007); Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008); Calvet and Sodini (2014)) where, even applying the best
methods, it is difficult to completely eliminate concerns about omitted variables and simultane-
ity. Our research design allows us to closely approximate Carroll’s ideal experiment: prizes are
randomly assigned conditional on factors that we can observe and the identifying variation primar-
ily comes from large wealth shocks. This approach is most similar to a quasi-experimental study
by Andersen and Nielsen (2011), which uses Danish data on inheritances due to sudden parental
deaths as a source of wealth variation.2 Despite differences in sample and research design, our
reduced-form estimates are broadly similar to theirs.
    A second contribution is our use of a structural model to estimate the costs needed to rationalize
observed participation responses. This exercise facilitates the quantitative comparison of our quasi-
experimental estimates to a comprehensive body of structural work (e.g., Gomes and Michaelides
(2005); Cocco (2005); Alan (2006); Khorunzhina (2013); Fagereng, Gottlieb and Guiso (2015)).
Looking at patterns and magnitudes of the estimated costs may help refine theories of participation,
evaluate the quantitative importance of various mechanisms that have been proposed, and provide
cues about promising avenues for future modeling efforts.
    Non-participation of the wealthiest households has been previously described as a significant
   2
     Lotteries provide a source of variation that is unlikely to be correlated with other significant life events that could
influence financial choices. In contrast, sudden parental death generates an initial wealth shock, but also eliminates
any future intergenerational transfers, including future inheritance.

challenge to financial theory" (Campbell (2006), p. 1564) because, under standard calibrations,
most models imply that households forgo large welfare gains by declining to own stocks. Our
results suggest that the challenge extends to a substantial fraction of non-wealthy households too.
Even windfall gains in excess of 2M SEK (300K USD) do not cause a majority of nonparticipating
households to enter equity markets, and an unwillingness to enter is pervasive across all considered
subpopulations. Accounting for this non-participation requires costs much larger than are typically
considered in the structural literature. Additional analyses suggest that many previously hypothe-
sized extensions, such as allowing for uninsurable income risk, housing, and procrastination, are
unlikely to fully explain our results. Overall, our results suggest that cognitive constraints or “non-
standard” beliefs and preferences are likely to play an important role in explaining the behavior of
nonparticipating households (Vissing-Jørgensen (2003); Ang, Bekaert and Liu (2005); Barberis,
Huang and Thaler (2006); Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2008); Biais, Bossaerts and Spatt (2010);
Campanale (2011); Grinblatt, Keloharju and Linnainmaa (2011)).
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the lottery and wealth
data, our identification strategy, and addresses several issues regarding external validity that are of-
ten raised about studies of lottery players. In Section 2, we report the results from our reduced-form
analyses. Section 3 presents a structural model of life-cycle asset market participation, examines
its ability to account for our causal estimates, and estimates the distribution of entry and partic-
ipation costs implied by our variation in wealth. Finally, Section 4 discusses our findings in the
context of the literature on nonparticipation and concludes.

1     Data and Identification Strategy
Our analyses are conducted in a sample of lottery players who have been matched to administrative
demographic and financial records using players’ personal identification numbers (PINs).

1.1    Register Data
Our outcome variables are all derived from the Swedish Wealth Register, which contains high-
quality information about the financial portfolios of all Swedes. The register was discontinued
when Sweden abolished its wealth tax, but has annual year-end financial information for 1999-
2007. This information includes aggregate assets and debt, and relevant subcategories such as bank
account balances, mutual funds, directly held stocks, bonds, money market funds, debt, residential
and commercial real estate, and other financial and real assets. The data have proven valuable in
household-finance research beginning with a landmark paper by Calvet et al. (2007). The quality
of the Wealth Register compares favorably to other data sources, as it is not subject to attrition
and included variables are likely measured with minimal error. Calvet et al. (2007) estimate that
included variables account for approximately 86% of wealth in Sweden.


                                                   4
    We supplement the portfolio data from the Wealth Register with basic demographic information
available in the Statistics Sweden administered database LISA. Our analyses are conducted at the
household level, with a household defined as the observed winner and, if present, his or her spouse.
We choose this definition because the wealth of spouses of winning players increases by about 10%
of the prize won following the lottery event, thus suggesting some joint control over assets. All
our analyses are based on players aged 18 and above, and we restrict the sample to lottery draws
conducted no later than 2007, the last year for which we have financial data. In addition, given that
we consider a maximum horizon of 10 years and wealth data is only available starting in 1999, we
restrict our sample to prize winners after 1989.

1.2    Lottery Data
Our basic identification strategy is to use the available data and knowledge about the institutional
details of each of the lotteries to define cells within which the lottery wealth is randomly assigned.
We then control for these cell-fixed effects in our analyses, thus ensuring all identifying variation
comes from players in the same cell. Because the exact construction of the cells varies across
lotteries, we describe each lottery separately. For a detailed description of how the original lottery
data were preprocessed and quality-controlled, we refer the reader to the Online Appendix of
Cesarini, Lindqvist, Östling and Wallace (2015).
Kombi – Kombi is a monthly subscription lottery whose proceeds are given to the Swedish Social
Democratic Party, Sweden’s main political party during the post-war era. Subscribers choose their
desired number of subscription tickets and are billed monthly, usually by direct debit. Kombi
provided us with a longitudinal data set with information about all draws conducted between 1998
and 2010. For each draw, the panel contains an entry per lottery participant, with information about
the number of tickets held, any large prizes won, and the player’s PIN.
    The Kombi rules are simple. In a given draw, each prize is awarded by randomly selecting
a unique ticket. Two individuals who purchased the same number of tickets are equally likely
to win a large prize. To construct the cells, each winning player is matched to (up to) 100 non-
winning players with the same number of tickets in the month of the draw. To improve precision,
we choose controls similar to the winner on sex and age whenever more than 100 matches are
available. This matching procedure leaves a sample of 349 large prize-winners, matched to a total
of 34,852 controls.
Triss – The second sample is a scratch-ticket lottery run since 1986 by Svenska Spel, the Swedish
government-owned gambling company. Since 1994, Triss lottery players can win the opportunity
to participate in a TV show where they can win substantial prizes. In a typical month, 25 Triss
winners appear on the show and draw a prize by selecting a ticket from a stack. The tickets are and
shuffled and look identical. The prizes are distributed according to a known prize plan with prizes

                                                  5
varying from 50K SEK to 5M SEK. The prize plan is subject to occasional revision.
    Svenska Spel supplied the basic demographic information (name, age, region of residence,
and often also the names of close relatives) about all individuals who participated in the TV show
between 1994 and 2010. With the help of Statistics Sweden, we were able to reliably identify
the PINs of 99% of show participants. Svenska Spel also listed cases in which the player shared
ownership of the ticket. Our analyses are based exclusively on the 90% of winners who did not
indicate they shared ownership of the winning ticket. Our empirical strategy makes use of the
fact that, conditional on the prize plan, the nominal prize amount is plausibly random. Thus, two
players are assigned to the same cell if they won in the same year and under the same prize plan,
providing a final sample of 3,416 winners.
PLS – PLS accounts are savings accounts whose owners participate in regular lotteries with
monetary prizes paid on top of (or sometimes in lieu of) interest payments. Such accounts have
existed in Sweden since 1949 and were originally subsidized by the government. When the sub-
sidies ceased in 1985, the government authorized banks to continue to offer prize-linked-savings
products. Two systems were put into place, one operated by savings banks and one by all other
banks. The two systems were approximately equally popular and participation was widespread
across broad strata of Swedish society; every other Swede owned an account.
    The PLS sample was obtained by combining data from two sources of information about the
PLS accounts maintained by the commercial banks and state bank. The first source is a set of
printed lists with information about prizes won in the draws between 1986-2003. For each prize
won in a draw, these sheets list the prize amount, type of prize won (described below), and the
winning account number. The second source is a large number of microfiche images with infor-
mation (account number, account owner’s PIN, and number of tickets received) about all eligible
accounts participating in the draws between December 1986 and December 1994 (the “fiche pe-
riod”). Because the prize lists contain the winning account number, but not its owner PIN, the
fiches are needed to identify winning players’ PIN.
    PLS account holders could win two types of prizes: odds prizes and fixed prizes. The prob-
ability of winning either type of prize was proportional to the number of tickets associated with
an account: account holders assigned one lottery ticket per 100 SEK in account balance. Fixed
prizes, which constitute the majority of prizes, were prizes whose magnitude did not depend on
the balance of the winning account. Odds prizes, on the other hand, were awarded as a multiple of
the balance of the prize-winning account.
    For fixed-prize winners, our identification strategy exploits the fact that in the population of
players who won exactly the same number of fixed prizes in a particular draw, the total sum of
fixed prizes won is independent of the account balance. Previous studies of lottery players have
used this identification strategy (Imbens, Rubin and Sacerdote (2001); Hankins, Hoestra and Skiba

                                                 6
                            Table 1: Overview of Identification Strategy.

               PLS           1990-2003       Fixed Prize      Draw × # Fixed Prizes

               Triss         1994-2007       Fixed Prize      Year × Prize Plan


(2011)). Because the strategy does not require information about the number of tickets owned,
it can be employed also during the post-fiche period, as long as the winning account was active
during the fiche period so the account owner’s PIN can be identified. We therefore assign two
individuals to the same cell if they won an identical number of fixed prizes in that draw. Overall,
we were able to reliably match 99% of the fixed-prize-winning accounts from the fiche era to a
PIN.
    To construct odds-prize cells, we match individuals who won exactly one odds-prize in a draw
to individuals with a near-identical account balance who also won exactly one prize (odds or fixed)
in the same draw. This matching procedure ensures that within a cell, the prize amount is inde-
pendent of potential outcomes. After the fiche period, we do not observe account balances and
therefore odds prizes are only included if won during the fiche period (1986-1994). In total, the
sample includes 275,248 PLS prizes, of which 257 are larger than 1M SEK.

1.3    Identification Strategy
Table 1 summarizes the previous section’s discussion of how we construct the cell fixed effects
in each of the three lotteries. Normalizing the time of the lottery to s = 0, our main estimating
equation is given by,

(1)                      Yi,s = βs × Li,0 + Xi × Ms + Zi,−1 × γs + ηi,s ,

where i indexes households, Li,0 denotes the prize size (in million SEK), Xi is a vector of cell fixed
effects, and Zi,−1 is a vector of controls. Controls are included to improve the precision of our
estimates and are always measured in the year before the lottery. Standard errors are clustered at
the level of the player. The key identifying assumption needed for βs to have a causal interpretation
is that the prize amount won is independent of ηi,s conditional on the cell fixed effects.
     In many of our analyses, we estimate Equation 1 in our pooled sample. We also conduct
several analyses in the subsample of players who participated in draws conducted between 2000
and 2007. In what follows, we refer to these samples as the all-year and the post-1999 samples.
The post-1999 sample plays an important role in subsample analyses where we stratify players
by their pre-lottery participation status, which is first observed in 1999. In the all-year sample

regressions, we control for the following lagged baseline demographic characteristics: age, sex,
marital status, retirement status, college completion, household size, disposable income, and self-
employment. In the post-1999 sample regressions, we additionally control for the following lagged
baseline financial characteristics: net wealth, gross debt, and indicators for real estate ownership
and participation (directly held stocks or mutual funds).
Prize Variation – To get a better sense of the source of our identifying variation, Table 2 provides
information about the distribution of prizes. The total value of the after-tax prize money disbursed
to the winners in our samples is almost 3.5 billion SEK (about 500M USD), 67% of which is ac-
counted for by prizes whose value is greater than the median annual Swedish household disposable
income in 1999 (143K SEK (21K USD)). Thus, although small prizes account for a relatively large
fraction of prizes won, most identifying variation comes from the larger prizes in all three lotteries.
All lotteries contribute substantial identifying variation to the all-year sample, whereas Kombi and
Triss prizes jointly account for most identifying variation to the post-1999 sample.
Testing for Random Assignment – To test our key identifying assumption, we again normalize
the time of lottery to s = 0 and run the following regression:

(2)                              Li,0 = Xi × Γ0 + Zi,−1 × ρ−1 + i .

Under the null hypothesis of conditional random assignment, the characteristics determined before
the lottery (Zi,−1 ) should not predict the lottery outcome (Li ) conditional on the cell fixed (Xi )
effects. We run these quasi-randomization tests in the all-year sample, its lottery subsamples,
and the post-1999 sample. As expected, Table 3 shows that the lagged characteristics have no
statistically significant predictive power in the specifications that include cell fixed effects. If they
are omitted however (columns 2 and 7), the null hypotheses of random assignment is rejected.

1.4    Generalizability
In this section we address two important concerns about the external validity of our sample. A first
concern is that individuals who play the lottery may not be representative of the population at large.
A second is that inferences from Swedish lottery players about the causes of non-participation may
not generalize to other countries.
Generalizing within Sweden – To investigate the representativeness of our samples, we compare
the lottery samples, weighted by prize size, to randomly drawn population samples of adult Swedes
matched on sex and age.
    Columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show that the demographic characteristics of our lottery players
closely resemble those of the representative sample. Columns 3 and 4 compare the financial char-
acteristics of members of the post-1999 sample to the sex- and age- matched representative sample.
In the matched population sample, 63% of households are home owners and 56% participate in eq-
uity markets; in our pooled sample, the corresponding figures are 70% and 59%. Columns 5-7
provide the corresponding descriptive statistics for the post-1999 sample broken down by lottery.
    Another way to gauge representativeness is to compare the cross-sectional relationships be-
tween stock market participation and household characteristics in our lottery samples to the rela-
tionships estimated in a representative sample. We conduct such a comparison by estimating the

cross-sectional probit equation used by Calvet et al. (2007) in their study of a large sample of rep-
resentative Swedes. To avoid including wealth variation that was induced by the lottery, we restrict
the estimation sample to the post-1999 sample and estimate the probit specification using the 1999
cross-sectional wealth data in (i) our post-1999 lottery sample and (ii) a sex- and age-weighted
representative sample. The results, reported in Appendix Table C.2, show the overall pattern of
conditional correlations are similar in our lottery sample and the reweighted representative sam-
ple.
Generalizing beyond Sweden – The processes that cause participation in Sweden may differ in
important ways from the processes in other countries. An indirect way to evaluate generalizability
beyond Sweden is to compare the cross-sectional relationships of financial variables with demo-
graphic characteristics in Sweden to other countries. Previous work has noted that the predictors
of non-participation in Sweden and the United States are similar, as is the aggregate composition
of household wealth in the two countries. For example, the Swedish participation rate was 62% in
1999, compared to 59% in the United States (Campbell (2006), pp. 1572-1576).
    To provide further indirect evidence on generalizability we compare the distribution of partici-
pation costs implied by the 1999 cross-sectional wealth data in our post-1999 lottery sample with


                                                  10

the distribution calculated by Vissing-Jørgensen (2003) using the 1994 PSID. In Vissing-Jørgensen
(2003)’s framework, households decline to participate if at their level of wealth, the gains from par-
ticipation are too small to offset the costs. The benefits are the expected equity premium for the
share of the wealth that the household chooses to allocate to the risky financial portfolio. Assuming
time separable and homothetic preferences, the per-period benefit of participation of household i
at time t can be approximated by

                               Benef iti,t = Wi,t × αi,t × (ri,t − rtf )

where Wi,t is household i’s wealth at time t, αi,t is the fraction of wealth household i would
                                                          ce
invest in equities at time t if they participate, and ri,t   is the certain return that would make a
household indifferent between investing in risky equity and investing in an asset commanding a
                   ce
certain return of ri,t . An estimate of a households participation cost is then obtained from the
dollar amount required to offset this benefit. Figure 1 shows that applying Vissing-Jørgensen
(2003)’s methodology with (ri,t ce
                                   − rtf ) = .04 results in similar CDFs of participation costs in the
two samples.

2     Empirical Results
We now turn our attention to our reduced form analyses. Our primary outcome variable is year-
end participation, defined as an indicator equal to 1 for individuals who own stocks, either directly
or indirectly. Figure 2 presents the estimated coefficients for s = −1, ..., 10 from the pooled
lottery sample. We estimate that 1M SEK causes a near-immediate and permanent increase in
the participation probability of around 4 percentage points. As expected, lottery wealth does not


                                                  11
predict participation prior to the lottery. The results are similar if we define participation more
narrowly to only include directly owned stocks (Appendix Table C.3, Panel B).

intervals, are obtained by estimating Equation 1 in the all-year sample. See Appendix Table C.3 for the
underlying estimates.


    We next investigate if the effects estimated in the pooled sample mask any treatment-effect
heterogeneity. An obvious potential source of heterogeneity is the pre-lottery participation status.
Figure 3 shows the estimated treatment-effects on participation probability in s = −1, ..., 4 in
the post-1999 lottery sample stratified by pre-lottery participation status. The estimated effect of
wealth differs dramatically by pre-lottery participation status. In pre-lottery nonparticipants, we
estimate that 1M SEK increases the participation probability by 12.1 percentage points. In pre-
lottery participants, the estimated effect is small and usually not statistically distinguishable from
zero. Hence, the aggregate effect of 3.7 percentage points we observe in the pooled sample appears
to be driven nearly entirely by a positive effect on nonparticipants. This finding is consistent with
the predictions of a model in which large, one-time, fixed costs of entry are a major cause of
non-participation (where “cost” is interpreted broadly to include not just financial costs). The
estimated treatment-effect among nonparticipants is similar in the four years following the lottery,
though less precisely estimated as we extend the time horizon.3
    Given that the causal effects appear to be driven entirely by positive effects on pre-lottery
nonparticipants, we conducted a suite of additional heterogeneity analyses in this subsample, strat-
ifying the nonparticipants by pre-lottery debt, home ownership, net wealth, stock returns in the
calendar year of win, self-employment, sex, age, and educational attainment.4 Results from these
   3
      There are two reasons for the widening of the confidence intervals. First, because participation is only observed
during a nine year period and we condition on prior participation status, the sample size decreases as we expand the
time horizon. Second, the predictive power of the lagged financial and demographic characteristics fall with time,
increasing the standard errors.

heterogeneity analyses for s = 0 are presented in Table 5.5
    The heterogeneity analyses provide information about how participation costs are distributed
across households with different observable characteristics, but are subject to the important inter-
pretational caveat that only wealth is randomly assigned. To illustrate, consider the heterogeneity
analyses by pre-lottery debt which shows the estimated effect on participation probability is about
twice as large in debt-free households. One theoretical mechanism that could account for this find-
ing is that indebted households face interest rates that substantially increase the interest-free rate
(Davis et al. (2006); Becker and Shabani (2010)), making debt reduction a more attractive way to
spend the windfall gain than stock market entry. This is a plausible explanation of the observed het-
erogeneity, but our data do not allow us to rule out the possibility that the observed heterogeneity
arises because debt is correlated with other factors that shift participation incentives.
    Next, we examine whether the effects differ by pre-lottery ownership of real estate. Theoreti-
cally, the net effect of real estate ownership on participation incentives is ambiguous. For example,
homeowners may find participation less attractive because they have access to investment opportu-
nities in their home, or prefer to pay off mortgage debt with higher interest rates. On the other hand,
as several studies highlight (Grossman and Laroque (1990); Cocco (2005); Flavin and Yamashita
(2011); Vestman (2013)), non-real estate owners may use the windfall gain to invest in real estate
and this could crowd out stock purchases. In practice, we estimate effects of similar magnitude
in owners and non-owners of real estate. When we examine if the effects are heterogeneous by
of the subpopulations. The resulting coefficient estimates are identical to those obtained when Equation 1 is estimated
separately in each subsample.
    5
      Results for s = 3 are shown in Appendix Table C.5 and are broadly similar but less precisely estimated because
the estimation sample size shrinks with time horizon.

pre-lottery wealth, we find that households with below-median financial wealth are more affected.
    Fourth, we ask if the effect differs in years with positive equity returns, as indeed it may if
individuals overweight recent events when forming subjective beliefs about future returns. Survey
research has found investors and chief financial officers adjust their beliefs about the one-year eq-
uity premium downward (upward) following periods of negative (positive) market returns (Graham
and Harvey (2001); Vissing-Jørgensen (2003); Greenwood and Shleifer (2014)). We estimate that
in households who win the year after a year with negative equity return, 1M SEK increases the
participation probability by .056, compared to .139 for households who win the year after a year
with positive returns.
    Our last four dimensions of heterogeneity are self-employment, age, sex, and educational at-
tainment. If the self-employed face greater uninsurable idiosyncratic labor income risk than do
regular salaried employees, the standard life-cycle model predicts the self-employed benefit less
from participation (Heaton and Lucas (2000b); Viceira (2001)). Consistent with this hypothe-
sis, we find no evidence of a positive effect of wealth on the participation probabilities of the
self-employed. In our age analyses, our estimated effects are larger in younger players, but the

                                                     14
difference is not statistically significant. We similarly do not find a statistically significant dif-
ference in the effect on the participation probabilities of men and women, but do find significant
differences by education level. The treatment-effect for college-educated households is twice as
large as for households without a college degree. One plausible interpretation of this finding is
that households with college degrees face smaller information costs or less psychological discom-
fort (Grinblatt et al. (2011); Van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie (2012); Benjamin, Brown and Shapiro
(2013)). Alternatively, Calvet et al. (2007) show that educated households diversify their portfolios
more effectively and hence gain more from entry.
    Overall, the results from these heterogeneity analyses show that the effect of wealth on stock
market participation generally varies in intuitive ways that are easy to reconcile qualitatively with
many of the proposed theories of non-participation.

2.1    Are the Effects Nonlinear?
Under our identifying assumption, our linear estimator gives an unbiased estimate of a weighted
treatment-effect. Because large prizes account for most of our identifying variation, the estimator
will assign most weight to the marginal effect of wealth at modest to large levels of wealth. To
test for nonlinear effects, we modify our basic estimating equation, replacing the lottery-wealth
variable by indicator variables for prizes in five categories. We then run regressions in which the
smallest prize category omitted.
    Figure 4 presents the estimated coefficients for each of these categories, with coefficients
marked at the mean prize size in each category. Relative to small prize winners (<10K SEK,
1.5K USD), a prize in the range 10K-100K SEK (1.5 to 15K USD) increases the participation
probability of pre-lottery nonparticipants by .013. The corresponding estimates for winners of
prizes in the 100K-1M (15 to 150K), 1M-2M (150 to 300K), and 2M+ (300K+) are 0.080, 0.183
and 0.392. Thus, the marginal effect is everywhere positive, but strongest for winners of small
prizes. Among pre-lottery participants, none of the prize-category coefficients are statistically dis-
tinguishable from zero.

2.2    Robustness Checks
We conducted a number of sensitivity checks to explore the robustness of our s = 0 results to
lottery subsamples, household definition, and choice of estimator. The results from these analyses
are summarized in Appendix Table C.1. The estimated effect of wealth on participation is similar
across lotteries and results are robust to excluding spousal equity ownership from our participation
definition. We also find that marginal effects from a probit estimator are substantively identical
to the OLS estimates reported in the main text. Overall, our main findings are robust to these
alternative specifications and analyses.

Figure 4: Effect of Wealth on Participation Probability by Prize Size. Coefficients are obtained by
estimating Equation 1 in the post-1999 sample with the lottery wealth variable replaced by indicators for
five mutually exclusive prize categories: 0 to 10K SEK (0 to 1.5K USD), 10K to 100K (1.5 to 15K), 100K
to 1M (15 to 150K), 1M to 2M (150 to 300K), and 2M+ (300K+). Coefficient estimates and the 95%
confidence bands are plotted at the mean prize in each category. See Appendix Table C.6 for the underlying
estimates.


2.3    Calibrating Participation Costs to Match Causal Estimates
The causal effects we estimate can be used to test the quantitative predictions of models in which
the source of non-participation is modest per-period financial costs. Vissing-Jørgensen (2003)
noted modest per-period financial costs were not a plausible explanation for the wealthiest house-
holds but that they could explain the non-participation of low- and medium-wealth households.
Indeed, we find modest wealth shocks induce some households to enter equity markets, suggesting
modest per-period costs are a plausible explanation for some of the non-participation observed in
low-wealth households. Quantitatively, however, our estimates suggest this deterrent needs to be
supplemented with other disincentives for a substantial share of non-wealthy nonparticipants.
    To get some intuition for this result, consider the finding, depicted in Figure 4, that a windfall
gain greater than 2M SEK is estimated to increase participation probability by 39 percentage points
in nonparticipants. Evaluating Equation 3 at 2M SEK implies that a cost of at least 47K SEK (7K
USD) is needed to explain continued non-participation. This cost is likely an underestimate both
because it does not take into account pre-lottery wealth and because all prizes in this category were
in fact larger than 2M SEK (mean 3.1M SEK). Thus, the per-period costs necessary to explain non-
participation are an order of magnitude larger than the median of the distribution of participation
costs calculated in Section 1.4.
    The estimated causal effects suggest certain structures of disincentives. First, the precisely
estimated null-effects of wealth on continued participation suggest that disincentives to continued
participation are modest. If not, increased participation benefits caused by the large wealth shock

would induce some participants who would otherwise exit to remain participants, thus generating
a positive effect. Similarly, the finding that most pre-lottery nonparticipants do not enter following
a large windfall gain suggests these households face large participation disincentives. Otherwise,
a large wealth shock would induce more households to enter.

2.4                       Where Does the Money Go?
Evidence on how participants and nonparticipants allocate the lottery wealth may provide impor-
tant cues about how to interpret the costs calibrated in the previous section. Here, we use our main
estimating equation to examine how lottery wealth affects five financial variables measured in the
Swedish Wealth Register: bank account balances, stocks, bonds, debt and real assets. Figure 5
graphically depicts the main results from these analyses (see the accompanying caption for details
on variable definitions). All variables are measured at year-end market value and all analyses are
run in the post-1999 sample. The coefficients plotted for each variable are scaled so an estimate
of 0.10 means that the total market value of the outcome (e.g., risky assets owned) increases by
.1 for each 1 SEK won. Shown at the top of the figure are the numerical values of the coefficient
estimates from an analogous specification in which the dependent variable is net wealth.
    As expected, measured net wealth increases substantially following a windfall gain. In partici-
pants and nonparticipants alike, the register measure of net wealth increases in the year-of-win by
roughly 60% of lottery prize won. This effect weakens over time, but remains at 30% at s = 4.For

                                                                             17
a number of reasons, the s = 0 estimate of 60% does not imply that 40% of lottery wealth is
consumed in the year-of-win. Statistics Sweden’s net wealth measure will ordinarily not capture
increases in the resale value of housing if some players use lottery wealth for home improvements,
nor the resale value of cars and other durables purchased in the year of win. The net wealth variable
also excludes monetary transfer to family members, unless the transfer is to the player’s spouse.
In exploratory analyses not shown here, we find that the effect of net wealth is approximately 9
percentage points higher if the wealth of unmarried, cohabiting partners are included.
     The effects of lottery wealth on the net wealth trajectories of participants and nonparticipants
are similar, and with the possible exception of stocks, as are the trajectories of the disaggregated
variables. In both samples, players allocate 17-22% of wealth to bonds in the year-of-win, and
this fraction is stable over the four-year period. Unsurprisingly, year-end bank account balances
increase substantially in the year-of-win, but less than 12% of the lottery wealth remains in bank
accounts at year-end in s = 1. Finally, Figure 5 shows that in both samples, the fraction of wealth
allocated to purchase of new real estate or to pay off debts is modest.
     Several of the results in Figure 5 are potentially relevant for interpreting the high costs re-
ported in the calibration exercise of the previous section. First, the fact that less than 12% of the
lottery wealth remains in bank accounts at s = 1, coupled with the observation that bond and
equity investments take place shortly after the lottery, suggests a limited role for procrastination.
Second, the small effects on debt and real assets suggest that few households forgo equity market
participation to purchase new real estate or pay off high-interest debt. Third, nonparticipants and
participants allocate more lottery wealth to bonds than equities. Fourth, among nonparticipants
the effect of wealth on the market value of stocks owned is negligibly small from s = 2 onward.
This supports the extensive margin finding that wealth shocks have small effect on nonparticipants’
willingness to invest in equities. Overall, these findings suggest that many households evaluate the
relative merits of bonds and equities very differently than standard theories predict.
     In Figure 6, we show results from additional analyses of extensive-margin effects on bond
market participation and real estate ownership. Panel (a) shows the estimated effect of wealth at
s = −1, ..., 4 on binary indicators for three distinct states: (i) owns real estate but not equity,
(ii) owns equity but not real estate, (iii) owns real estate and equity. The estimation sample is
restricted to post-1999 households who owned neither real estate or stocks prior to the lottery. As
noted above, the effect of lottery wealth on the value of real assets will be understated if some
lottery wealth is invested in home improvements whose positive effect on the resale value of the
property are understated in the register data. Since the sample does not include home owners, such
concerns do not apply. Panel (a) shows that there is some evidence of delayed adjustment, but
the estimated effect of 1M SEK on home ownership never exceeds 11 percentage points. Hence,
though wealth causes some households to invest in housing, such behavior is not common. Figure

Markets. Panel (a) presents the effect of wealth on participation in real estate and equity markets for
households in the post-1999 sample that participated in neither pre-lottery. Panel (b) presents the effect of
wealth on participation in bond and equity markets for households in the post-1999 sample that participated

5 and Panel (a) of Figure 6 jointly suggest that real estate investments are unlikely to explain the
relatively high rates of continued non-participation.
    Panel (b) shows analogous estimates from an estimation sample restricted to households who
owned neither bonds nor equities prior to the lottery. This sample overlaps greatly with our sample
of pre-lottery nonparticipants because 90% of nonparticipants also did not own any bonds. The
effect on bond market participation probability is more than twice as large as the effect on equity
market participation probability at all horizons. Of the three possible states (bond only, equity
only, bond and equity), we estimate the largest effects of wealth on the probability of participation
in bond markets only. Figure 5 and Panel B Figure 6 thus suggest that among the households who
did not participate in bond or stock markets pre-lottery, wealth is much more likely to trigger bond
market entry than stock market entry.

3                                        A Structural Model
In this section we compare our causal estimates to the predictions of a plausibly calibrated life-
cycle model of equity market participation. The model we study is standard, with a basic structure
similar to leading studies such as Gomes and Michaelides (2005), Cocco (2005), Alan (2006),
Khorunzhina (2013), and Fagereng et al. (2015). It is purposefully kept simple to highlight the link
between our reduced-form findings and the model’s predictions, and we regate detailed treatment
of the household decision problem to Appendix A.
    Briefly, agents in our model are finitely lived, facing an exogenous mortality probability and

                                                                                                      19
have time separable, CRRA preferences with risk aversion of 4. Each period an agent optimally
chooses how much to consume, save, and invest in equity markets given the agent’s age, wealth,
and participation status. Agents who choose to participate in equity markets face two separate
types of costs. Participation costs, denoted κ, are paid in each period an agent allocates non-zero
wealth to equity holdings. Entry costs, denoted χ, are paid whenever a previously non-participating
agent decides to enter equity markets for the first time. Entry and participation costs are drawn
independently from the two distributions:

(4)                                           κi ∼ Fθκ (κ)
                                             χi ∼ Gθχ (χ),

where θκ and θχ are vectors that characterize the distribution of entry and participation costs.
Equity provides a risky return rs with E(rs ) > rf , where rf is the risk-free rate. In addition, each
period an agent is endowed with stochastic labor income yt drawn from an age-specific distribution.
Both income and equity returns are calibrated to match historical Swedish observations, yielding a
6.7% baseline equity premium and the income profile presented in Appendix Figure B.2.

3.1    Calibration
To compare the model’s predictions to our causal estimates, we solve the baseline model, simulate a
data set, and estimate the effect of lottery prizes on participation in the simulated data. Specifically,
we draw lottery prizes identical to those in the data and assign these windfall gains to households
with pre-lottery characteristics (including cells) identical to those in our post-1999 sample. We
then solve for the optimal participation status of each household and estimate Equation 1. This
permits a straightforward comparison of the model estimates to the causal estimates.
    In our calibration exercises, we set entry costs χi equal to zero and assume κi is distributed
according to the cumulative distribution function pictured in Figure 1. Table 6 compares the pre-
dicted effects of wealth (column 2) to the causal estimates (column 1) for the all-year sample
(row 1) and the post-1999 sample stratified by participation status (rows 2 and 3). In the all-year
sample, the model-generated coefficient is 0.140, roughly three times the magnitude of our causal
estimate. For pre-lottery nonparticipants, the model-predicted effect is .224, again exceeding the
causal estimate of .121. The number of nonparticipating households deterred from entering equity
markets under our cost calibration is thus too small to match our causal estimates. For pre-lottery
participants the model predicts, contrary to the causal estimates, a positive effect on continued
participation. Intuitively, the calibrated costs cause some households with poor income or equity
returns shocks to drop out of equity markets absent the windfall gain. In summary, the baseline
calibration’s predictions are generally qualitatively correct but overstate the effect of wealth on

participation.
    We also explored how well some standard extensions of the basic life-cycle framework improve
the model’s ability to replicate the causal estimates. The results of these analyses are summarized
in Table 6. For point of reference, Column 1 shows our causal estimates, and Column 2 shows
the effects predicted by the basic model. In Column 3 we consider the effects of multiplying
each drawn per-period participation cost by two. Next, following Viceira (2001), we allow for a
correlation of .25 between the random component of income and equity returns. Column 5 shows
the results from a model calibrated with a risk-aversion parameter set to 10. Column 6 shows the
predicted effects by a model which allows for the possibility that households may be unable to
fully realize welfare gains of participation because of poor diversification and asset management
fees (Calvet et al. (2007)). Following, Calvet et al. (2007), we impose a 1.5% management fee and
scale the expected equity premium by 1/2, thus reducing the equity premium to 2.7%. Column 7
shows results obtained if the lottery windfall gain is rescaled by a factor of 0.6, an adjustment that
may be appropriate if 40% of windfall gains are consumed immediately. Finally, Column 8 shows
that when all extensions are included simultaneously, the model matches our causal estimate from
the subsample of nonparticipants quite well, but continues to substantially overpredict the response
in the full sample and in pre-lottery participants.
    Although not exhaustive, these exercises suggest that standard models have difficulty matching
the small effects of wealth on equity market participation under common calibrations. In inter-
preting these results, an important factor to consider is that we purposefully erred on the side of
selecting parameter values that would increase the explanatory power of the extension. For ex-
ample, a coefficient of risk aversion of 10 is the upper bound of the range considered plausible in
Mehra and Prescott (1985) famous demonstration of the equity-premium puzzle, and for reasons
explained in Section 2.4, 40% is a substantial overestimate of the actual propensity to consume out
of the windfall gains.

3.2                       Estimation
To determine the size and structure of disincentives necessary for the model to match causal esti-
mates, we use the method of indirect inference to estimate cost distributions given in Equation 4.6
The resulting cost estimates can be interpreted as the financial equivalent of all disincentives nec-
essary to generate the causal estimates. For additional details regarding the estimation procedure,
including the resulting model fit, see Appendices A and B.
    Figure 7 shows the estimated cost distributions. Fixed per-period costs of participation are
estimated to be quite small, with a median estimated cost of 200 SEK (30 USD) and almost all
households having estimated participation costs less than 1000 SEK (160 USD). Intuitively, small
estimated per-period participation costs are required to match the reduced form finding that wealth
has no discernible effect on continued participation. The estimated entry costs suggests that entry
costs for nonparticipants are quite large, with 63% of entry costs estimated to be greater than 1M
SEK (150K USD), 61% greater than 2M SEK (300K USD), and a 27% greater than 3M SEK
(450K USD).7 These large costs reflect the need for large disincentives to match the small effect
of wealth on market entry, and thus confirm the qualitative patterns discussed in Section 2.3. The
entry cost distribution is quite polarized, with only 2% of the entry costs estimated to be between
1M SEK (150K USD) and 2M SEK (300K USD). The 37% of households estimated to have entry
costs below 1M SEK (150K USD) roughly correspond to those whose participation status responds
to the range of wealth shocks we consider, while the remainder reflect households whose behavior
              6
     Specifically, our estimation matches the causal coefficients from the all-year sample, the coefficients from the
post-1999 sample stratified by pre-lottery participation status, and the coefficients from the non-linear specification
considered in Figure 4. The exact coefficients matched are listed in Column 1 of Table A.1.

     The entry cost is modeled as a first-time cost of entry, and thus only affects decisions of pre-lottery nonparticipants.



                                                                   22
is not well captured by the mechanisms included in our model.
    Finally, we allow entry costs to vary by the pre-lottery characteristics considered in our hetero-
geneity analyses in Table 5. The estimated costs, shown in Appendix Table A.2, are intuitive given
the reduced-form estimates, with costs estimated to be higher in subpopulations with smaller esti-
mated causal effects. An important conclusion from this analysis is that the estimated entry costs
exceed 1M SEK (150K USD) for the majority of households in all sub-populations considered,
suggesting that the hypotheses advanced by Vissing-Jørgensen (2003) as possible explanations
for the non-participation of rich households may prove relevant for understanding the behavior of
nonparticipating households in a broader range of demographic groups.

4    Discussion
The widespread nonparticipation in the stock market observed across Western countries is a much
studied but imperfectly understood phenomenon (Vissing-Jørgensen (2003); Campbell (2006);
Guiso and Sodini (2013)). In part the imperfect understanding reflects the reality that putting
theoretical predictions to stringent tests, and quantifying the importance of the mechanisms inside
the theories that generate nonparticipation, often requires difficult-to-attain datasets.
    Our study contributes to the literature on participation by providing credible and statistically
precise estimates of how large, positive, windfall gains impact equity market participation, and ex-
ploring quantitatively how our estimates compare to the predictions of a standard lifecycle model.
We find that 1M SEK (150K USD) increases the probability of owning stocks by 12 percentage
points among pre-lottery nonparticipants, but has no effect on pre-lottery participants. The ef-
fect is near-immediate, seemingly permanent, and heterogeneous in intuitive ways. For example,
our finding of larger wealth effects in college-educated individuals is qualitatively consistent with
explanations of nonparticipation that emphasize human capital, financial literacy and cognitive
constraints (Calvet et al. (2007); Van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie (2011); Grinblatt et al. (2011);
Benjamin et al. (2013)).
    A standard lifecycle model makes qualitative predictions that align well with the reduced-form
evidence, but under a variety of calibrations and extensions predicts wealth effects larger than
those we estimate. This overprediction is pervasive across demographic groups: in all subsamples
considered in our heterogeneity analyses, the median entry cost needed to account for our causal
estimates exceeds 800K SEK (120K USD). Housing, a general aversion to financial markets or
procrastination are unlikely to play major roles in explaining why costs of this magnitude are
needed for the model-generated predictions to match our experimental estimates. Lottery wealth
only modestly impacts the value of real estate owned or the likelihood of owning a home. Nonpar-
ticipants who experience large windfall gains do enter financial markets, but more frequently bond
than equity markets. Finally because this entry is near-immediate – little lottery wealth remains in


                                                 23
the winners’ bank accounts a year after the lottery event – our results are not easily explained by
procrastination either.
    A parsimonious interpretation of our overall pattern of results is that a substantial fraction of
nonparticipants are simply reluctant to engage with stocks as an asset class. Consistent with this
interpretation is our finding that in nonparticipants lottery wealth has only a tiny effect on the total
value of equities owned over medium-term horizons: we estimate that from s = 2 and onward,
a 100-SEK increase in lottery wealth increases the value of the equity portfolio of a pre-lottery
nonparticipant by a mere 2 SEK.
    In summary, our study finds that exogenously “dumping” a large amount of wealth on house-
holds causes them to enter the stock market at rate that is puzzlingly low from the viewpoint of
many standard economic frameworks. The mechanisms highlighted in these standard frameworks
have considerable merit, but a complete theory of nonparticipation will likely require at least some
households to have nonstandard preferences or beliefs that induces reluctance toward stock own-
ership. Such reluctance may generated by a multitude of nonstandard assumptions about beliefs
or preferences, including loss aversion and narrow framing (Barberis et al. (2006)), disappoint-
ment aversion (Ang et al. (2005)), ambiguity aversion (Epstein and Schneider (2010); Campanale
(2011); Dimmock, Kouwenberg, Mitchell and Peijnenburg (2015)) pessimistic beliefs about re-
turns (Biais et al. (2010); Hurd, Van Rooij and Winter (2011)) fears that the “game is rigged”
(Guiso et al. (2008)), or perceptions that equity markets are too complex (Vissing-Jørgensen
(2003)). Our study’s findings thus point to these areas as potentially productive areas of future
study.

A       Model
Each period, an age t agent chooses how much to consume, save, and invest in equity markets. An
agent has a maximum lifespan of T = 113, but prior to reaching age T , faces mortality risk with
an exogenous probability of surviving from period t to t + 1 denoted by st . Upon death, an agent
receives a terminal payout of zero. Agents who invest in equity face two separate types of costs.
Participation costs, denoted κ, are paid in each period an agent allocates non-zero wealth to equity
holdings. Entry costs, denoted χ, are paid whenever a previously non-participating agent decides
to enter equity markets for the first time. Entry and participation costs are drawn independently
from the two distributions:

(5)                                                   κi ∼ Fθκ (κ)
                                                     χi ∼ Gθχ (χ),

where θκ and θχ are vectors that characterize the distribution of entry and participation costs.
Equity provides a risky return rs with E(rs ) > rf , where rf is the risk-free rate. In addition, each
period an agent is endowed with stochastic labor income yt drawn from an age-specific distribution.
    In each period, an age t agent chooses how much to consume, save, and invest in equity mar-
kets. For an agent who decides not to participate in equity markets in a given period, the decision
problem reduces to deciding how much to consume and how much to save in the risk-free asset:

(6)                 VtN P (Wt , κ, χ) = max u(ct ) + βst Eyt+1 [Vt+1 (Wt+1 , It , κ, χ)]
                                          ct ,Wt+1

                                          Wt+1 = rf (Wt − ct ) + yt+1
                                          It = 1,

where It is an indicator equal to 0 in year t if the agent has never participated in equity markets,
and 1 otherwise. An agent who participates in the equity market, decides how much to consume,
and what fraction of wealth to allocate to stocks. This decision problem can similarly be expressed
as:



          VtP (Wt , κ, χ) = max u(ct ) + βst Eyt+1 ,rs,t+1 [Vt+1 (Wt+1 , It , κ, χ)]
                           ct ,Wt+1 ,αt

(7)                        Wt+1 = rf (Wt − ct − κ) + αt (rs,t+1 − rf ) (Wt − ct − κ) + yt+1
                           It = 0.

      Subtracting the entry costs if the agent has not previously participated in equity markets yields

                                                          29
the following decision problem:



(8)            Vt (Wt , It−1 , κ, χ) = max{VtN P (Wt , κ, χ) , VtP (Wt − χIt−1 , κ, χ)}.

Each period, comparing the value function of non-participation against the value function of par-
ticipation net any entry costs determines the agent’s participation decision. We assume st , rs and
yt follow known stochastic processes. Although our data are collected at the household level, we
make the simplifying assumption st as the survival probability as a function of an individual at
age t. We assume the income process is age-dependent, with log income of an age-t individual
evolving according to the following process:

                                        ln yt = f (t) + σy,t ηt ,

where f (t) is a quadratic in age and σy,t is the age-specific standard deviation in earnings. Both
the earnings and mortality processes are estimated using a cross section of the Swedish 1999
population. To match historical equity returns in Sweden (see Waldenström (2014)), we assume
that equity returns are lognormally distributed, with location parameter set to 0.065 and scale
parameter set to 0.21. We calibrate rf = 2% to match historical yield on Swedish government
bonds.
Structural Estimation Results – Table A.1 presents the model fit for the baseline structural esti-
mation (see Figure 7 for the costs).
Estimation with Heterogeneous Costs – To understand how participation disincentives vary among
subpopulations, we repeat our structural estimation, now allowing cost distributions to vary with
characteristics included in Table 5. To identify these differences, we augment our baseline co-
efficient target β̂ to include coefficients presented in Table 5, and re-estimate Equation 9, thus
matching the heterogeneity in the effect of wealth on entry.
    In implementing this estimation, we make two additional assumptions. First, because contin-
ued participation effects are negligible and no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect on continued
participation exists, we do not allow for heterogeneity in per period costs of participation. Instead,
for all households, we calibrate κ to 200 SEK (30 USD), roughly the median per-period partic-
ipation cost in our baseline structural estimation. Second, to maintain computational feasibility,
we assume a parametric cost distribution. Specifically, we assume costs of entry χi are distributed
normally with truncation at zero to ensure non-negativity. We assume mean µχ xi , where xi is a
vector of indicator variables corresponding to the characteristics in Table 5 (plus a constant) and
µχ is a coefficient vector to be estimated.

    Table A.2 presents resulting model fit and estimates, while the estimated CDFs of entry costs
are presented in Figure A.1. These CDFs again highlight the extremely high costs for all subsam-
ples, because no group of nonparticipants is estimated to have a median entry cost of less than
1M SEK (150K USD). Although cost patterns vary intuitively along various characteristics, in all
groups we find that large disincentives to entry are necessary to replicate estimated effects. These
patterns directly track the reduced-form estimates.

B     Model Solution and Estimation
Model Solution and Details
The model solution algorithm utilizes a modified endogenous grid method algorithm. The en-
dogenous grid is defined over the savings problem, while a grid search (100 grid points) is used to
identify optimal portfolio choice (see Carroll (2006) and Barillas and Fernández-Villaverde (2007))
for more details. Model solution algorithm summary and model code are both available on request.
    The survival probability is calculated using the observed survival probabilities from years 1999-
2000. We select 100,000 individuals in year 1998 from the Swedish population, and define a
binary indicator equal to one if the individual is observed alive in 1999. We then regress a quartic
in age on this indicator. We do not permit time or cohort effects in our estimation, and do not
allow survival probabilities to vary with wealth, income, or sex. Note that there is no attrition or
selection concerns in this sample as it is drawn randomly from the entire population. Although
simple, we view it as unlikely that allowing for richer survival probabilities would substantially
affect our qualitative conclusions. The resulting estimates are presented in Figure B.1.

each age.


    Income is calculated using the observed incomes in 1999. We select 100,000 individuals in
year 1999 from the Swedish population, and combine with partners to get a measure of after tax
household income. We then regress a quartic in age on this variable. We do not permit time,
cohort, or sex effects in our estimation. Using our estimated income process, we then calculate
the residual for each household. We then regress a quartic in age on the squared residual to obtain
an age specific standard deviation of income realizations. In column 4 of Table 6 we consider the
effect of allowing for correlation between income risk and equity returns. The resulting income
estimates are presented in Figure B.2.

Estimation Technicals
We estimate the distribution of individual costs of cost of entry and participation that most closely
replicate the empirical estimates presented in column 1 of Table A.1. As shown in equation 4,
these cost distributions are parametrized by vectors θκ , and θχ . Defining Θ = (θκ , θχ ), we estimate

(9)                           Θ̂ = arg min(β̂ − β̃(Θ))0 W (β̂ − β̃(Θ))
                                                                 Θ


where β̂ represents the the vector of empirical estimates and β̃(Θ) represents the vector of coeffi-
cients implied by the model. W could be any positive semi-definite matrix, but in all estimations
we use the identity matrix.
    The cost distributions are estimated non-parametrically by defining θκ , and θχ as points on the
CDF. We first bound the set of feasible costs by assuming Fθκ (κ) = 1 and Gθχ (χ) = 1. Assuming
Fθκ (0) = 0 and Gθχ (0) = 0, we construct a linearly spaced grid consisting of 7 points denoted as
xnκ and xnχ , respectively. We assume the CDFs are piecewise linear between these points and define

                                                           θκ = {θκn |Fθκ (xnκ ) = θκn }
                                                           θχ = {θχn |Gθχ (xnχ ) = θχn }.

The cost distributions are thus characterized by the estimates θn corresponding to the evaluation of
the CDF at each point xn . κ and χ are not known prior to estimation, but are chosen such that the
next-to-last point on each respective grid is reasonably close but not equal to 1.
    To simulate the model and generate coefficients β̃(θ), we first solve the model over a grid of
participation and entry costs and then proceed in several steps:
  1. Take parameter set Θ as given.


                                                                               34
  2. From the time s = −1 data set sample for all lottery players all relevant variables, including
     observed wealth, participation decisions, and time invariant covariates included in Table 4.
     From the time s = 0 data set, sample the amount won.
  3. For each sampled observation, draw two uniform random variables. Using CDFs parametrized
     by Θ, map these random variable to a realized (κi , χi ).
  4. According to (κi , χi ), interpolate over grid of participation and entry costs to calculate for
     optimal decision rules.
  5. Taking the time s = −1 data set as given, assign lottery wealth and calculate the optimal
     s = 0 saving and participation decisions.
  6. Repeat reduced form estimation on the model simulated data set to obtain coefficients β̃(θ).
Following each of these calculations the objective function presented in Equation 9 is calculated. A
numerical optimization algorithm is utilized to find the global minimum of this objective function.

     Table C.6: Effect of Wealth on Participation Probability by Prize Size. Coefficients are obtained by estimating Equation 1 in the post-1999
     sample with the lottery wealth variable replaced by indicators for five mutually exclusive prize categories: 0 to 10K (omitted category), 10K to 100K,
     100K to 1M, 1M to 2M, and 2M+ SEK. Marginal effects are calculated by dividing the effect-size estimate by the mean prize in each category. In
     Triss, all prizes exceed 1.5K, so the omitted category is prizes below 15K USD.
