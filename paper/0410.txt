                    On Forecasting Interest Rates:
                   An Efficient Markets Perspective



                               ABTRACT



       This paper reviews, from an applied forecasting perspective, the

properties of short— and long—term interest rates in an efficient market.

The paper emphasizes that efficient markets do not preclude economic agents

from successfully forecasting movements in short—term interest rates. For

brief forecast intervals, however, ex ante changes in long—term rates are

sufficiently close to zero that economic agents are not likely to improve

upon the no—change prediction of the martingale model. Economic agents, in

effect, are not likely to succeed in forecasting short—term movements in

long—term interest rates. An analysis of three sets of Canadian interest

rate forecasts provides results which are consistent with the theoretical

discussior, Further, these results parallel those obtained in recent

studies of recorded forecasts in the United States, although the authors of

these latter studies apparently failed to appreciate the nature of their

findings.

1. INTRODUCTION


       In view of the substantial empirical evidence which supports the

proposition that capital markets are efficient in their use of publicly

available information, surprisingly little attention has been directed to

the question of whether economic agents can successfully forecast interest

rate movements. Impressed perhaps by the early evidence in favour of

the random walk hypothesis,1 most sophisticated agents tend to regard

published forecasts of the future level of aggregate stock prices with

a healthy degree of skepticism. As yet, however, such skepticism does not

appear to extend to published forecasts of movements in either short— or

long—term rates of interest, nor is it clear to many whether or not such

skepticism is warranted.


       At the theoretical level, the question of whether economic agents

can successfully anticipate interest rate movements in an efficient mar-

ket has received increased attention. Sargent (1976) and Pesando (1978)

have noted that long—term interest rates in an efficient market will

approximately follow a martingale sequence — and thus exhibit random walk

characteristics —   in   the absence of time—varying term premiums. As Mishkin

(1978) and Pesando (1979) caution, however, there is nothing in efficient

markets theory which requires that short—term rates follow a random walk.

Thus agents without access to inside information may well succeed

in forecasting movements in short—term rates, but are not likely to

succeed in forecasting short—run movements in long—term rates if the term

premium accorded long—term bonds is indeed time—invariant.


       The purpose of this paper is to extract from these theoretical

results an appropriate perspective on the practical problem of forecasting
                                      2




interest rate movements. The first section of the paper briefly reviews

the theoretical results, including the role of time—varying term premiums.

The second explores the closeness of the martingale approximation for long—

term rates in Canada, an exercise which bears directly on the usefulness

of the no—change prediction implied by the martingale model. The third

section examines the performance of a variety of recorded interest rate

forecasts in Canada in light of the preceding theoretical arguments. A

concluding section completes the paper.



2. THEORETICAL OVERVIEW


       Let           denote the interest rate on an n—period, non—coupon

bond in period t ,       the information available to the market in period t,

and           the forward rate at time t for the one—period bond rate in

period t+i. If pure expectations govern the term structure, and if the

standard arithmetic approximation to the geometric average that links the

long—term rate to current and future short—term rates is satisfactory,

then — as noted by Sargent (1976) and Pesando (1978) —     the   ex ante change

in the long—term rate can be written as follows:


      E(RIi) —        Rti    =    *                    —
                                                           Ri,_i]       (1)



The term on the right—hand side of equation (1), which represents the non—

overlapping one—period rates, clearly approaches zero as n gets large.

If n,t represents the term premium accorded an n—period bond in period t,

then (1) becomes:
                                        3




                 —          =     *                     —
     E(R,k_i)                                               Ri,t_i]


                                + E(lPn,tkt_i)
                                                 —
                                                                          (2)


If   this term premium is constant, then (2) reduces to (1) and hence the

martingale approximation emerges:




        E(R,kt_l) R,t_

Equation   (3) indicates that the ex ante change in the long—term rate is
approximately zero if   n       is large, and hence that the optimal forecast
of   the long—term rate is simply its current value. For a ten—year bond

whose (annual) yield is being forecast on a guarterly basis, n equals

40 and the tuartingale approximation is likely to be close so long as the

short—term   rate is not "too nonstationary". If the yield on this same
bond is being forecast on a monthly basis, n equals 120 and the ex ante
change in the long—term rate will be even closer to zero. In          general, the
shorter   the forecast interval, the closer the martingale approximation.

Equivalently, it is short—run movements in long—term rates which will not

be predictable under the joint hypothesis of market efficiency and a time—

invariant term premium.


        For coupon bonds, as noted by Pesando (1979), the expression analogous

to (1) is more complicated. Nonetheless, as illustrated later in this

study, the martingale approximation remains quite close for short—term

movements in long—term rates in the absence of time—varying term premiums.
                                 4




Intuitively, the martingale approximation stems from the fact that over

the unit intervals (e.g. one quarter) in which agents typically forecast

interest rate movements, the percentage change in bond prices necessary

to equate the ex ante returns on short— and long—term securities (up to

a time—invariant term premium) is very small. As a result, the implied

exante changes in long—term rates are very close to zero. From this

perspective, the inartingale approximation for long—term rates is but a

specific illustration of the more general proposition that short—run

movements in speculative prices are not likely to be predictable.

       Efficient market theory does not require, however, that the short—

term rate follow a martingale, nor does empirical evidence suggest that

this is the case. There is no arbitrage opportunity through which agents

could eliminate any serial dependence in the short—term rate and — as

emphasized by Modigliani and Shiller (1973) — an expectations solution"

to the term structure is consistent with any stochastic representation

of the short—term rate. Using end—of—the quarter data on 90—day Treasury

bills and 90—day finance company paper, so as to eliminate possible biases

due to time aggregation (Working (1960)), alternative time series models

can be fitted to the Canadian data. For the sample period 1957:1 — 1979:1,

an ARNA (1, 1) or an AR (2) representation is clearly superior to the mar—

tingale model for both short—term rates.2 The fact that the short—term

rate need not follow a inartingale sequence is "reconciled1' with the mar—

tingale property of the long—term rate when it is remembered that the

latter is only approximate. The long—term rate would exactly follow a
                                   5




martingale   if and only if the short—term rate followed a martingale. In

this case, the ex ante capital gain or loss on long—term bonds would always

equal zero, and the long—term rate would simply equal the short—term rate

plus the time—invariant term premium.


         The martingale approximation for the long—term rate is derived on

the assumption that the term premium accorded long—term bonds is time—

invariant. Is the existence of time—varying term premiums likely to

invalidate this approximation? The answer, of course, is moot, although

a convincing case can be made that the "forecastability" of movements

in long—term rates is not likely to be salvaged in this fashion. Those

who work in the capital asset pricing framework of modern finance theory

tend to treat the term premium — which is related to the covariance of

bond returns, and the return to the market portfolio — as constant over

time.3 Many —    if not most — of those who have conducted empirical studies
of   the determinants of term premiums have concluded that they may well
be time—invariant. McCulloch (1975) and Pesando (1975a) have presented
evidence that the term premium accorded long—term government bonds in
the United States and Canada, respectively, may be time—invariant. Mishkin
(1978) and Pesando (1978) have found empirical support for the joint hypo-
thesis that the bond market is efficient and term premiums are time—

invariant. Attempts to enrich the traditional term structure equation of

Modigliani—Sutch (1967) or Modigliani—Shiller (1973) with additional vari-

ables to capture the spirit of the "preferred habitat" model have, on the

whole, been unsuccessful. Indeed, empirical support for the existence of

time—varying term premiums is largely confined to structural models of the

long—term bond market, such as those estimated for the United States by
                                   6




                                                              In these models,
Friedman (1977, 1979) and for Canada by Masson (1978).
demand functions for long—term bonds are estimated for each major class

of investor, such as banks, life insurance companies and so forth. When

the aggregate of these demands is set equal to supply, the models yield

a (restricted) reduced—form equation for the long—term rate. Although

these reduced—form equations contain asset stocks, financial flows and

other variables associated with time—varying term premiums, the repeated

failure of researchers to find comparable effects in the traditional term

structure equations is rather disconcerting. Clearly, the careful and

successful inclusion of stock and flow variables into demand and supply

functions is not sufficient to guarantee that the implicit equation for

the long—term interest rate will better characterize its evolution than

will the traditional term structure alternatives. Transactors exogenous

to the model — such as investment dealers — may include Meiselman's risk—

neutral, well—financed speculators whose arbitrage activities at the margin

impose the expectations solution on the term structure. Indeed, the

ability" of short—run movements in long—term interest rates on these

grounds.

       Finally, the preceding discussion has implicitly assumed that agents

do not have access to inside information. Following Lucas (1976), there

also exists considerable doubt as to whether agents who might possess

inside information — such as central banks — can successfully forecast

movements in long—term interest rates. For central banks, the forecasting

exercise typically consists of the attempt to simulate the impact on long—

term rates of contemplated policy initiatives. There exists the fundamental

concern that standard simulation exercises may not provide the central

bank with reliable "forecasts" of movements in long—term rates conditional

upon hypothetical changes in policy instruments. If such policy initiatives

diverge from those which characterize the period over which the policy—

maker's macroeconometric models have been estimated, or alter the time

series properties of key variables (such as the short—term rate) which

drive expectations, then little faith can be attached to the implicit

assumption that the underlying structure of the economy will remain invari-

ant to the contemplated activity. In short, even agents with access to

inside information may have difficulty in forecasting short—term move—

ments in long—term interest rates, a result which provides a re—inforcing

perspective on the negative conclusion regarding the "forecastability"

of such movements contained in the prior discussion.

3. THE MARTINGALE APPROXIMATION: SOME EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE


            Let Hnt denote the holding—period return on long—term bonds

in period t, c1 the (known) coupon to be paid during the period t,

      the price of the bond at the end of period t and tl the informa-

tion available to the market at the end of period t—l. Then:



                I•'          —
                             —
                                 E(PI

                  n,t t—l'



If    the bond is trading at par, so that              is simply the long—term

interest rate R,t_i then (4) can be written



                             =
                                 E(PI
                                   t tl)—P t—1
               E(H
                 n,tIt—l)
                                                      + R
                                                          n,t—l
                                                                                    (5)
                                      Pt—1


Let    ip     be the constant term premium accorded the n—period bond. Assuming

that investors have a one—period horizon, and noting that Rl,t_l is the

ex ante return on holding one—period bonds, the relationship between the

ex ante returns on short— and long—term securities can            be   written as

follows:


                                                     E(PI 1)—P
               Rl,tl + tn =      E(HIi)          =                      1
                                                                            + Rn,t_i (6)



            Implicit in (6) is the ex ante change in the long—term interest

rate necessary to equilibrate the two returns, up to the presumed time—

invariant term premium. Let x         represent      the expected capital gain or

                                             —
loss implied by (6), or (R1,_i +                 Rntl)•     Since the price of a
                                        9




consol is just the coupon divided by the interest rate, the ax ante change

in the long—term rate if the bond were a consol (tRA) is simply:


           tRA     =
                        1 + x ,t—l                                            (7)

If the long—term bond is trading at par, and if its term to maturity of

n—periods is sufficiently large so that its change during the period can

be ignored, then the larger change in the long—term rate necessary to

produce the same capital gain or loss is approximately:4



                                              1
                        =   tR      *
                                                                              (8)
                  n,t        co,t       —
                                                   1

                                            (l+Rn,t_l)tl



       Note, in general, that the unit        of   observation is crucial to the

determination of            and hence ARA .            For quarterly data, for

example, the interest rates in (6) are expressed as quarterly rates,

and the implicit capital gain or loss is only one—fourth of that required

in the case of annual data. The smaller the unit of observation, cet.

     the   smaller is the required capital gain or loss and hence the smaller

the ax ante change (expressed at an annual rate) in the long—term interest

rate. Since economists traditionally forecast macroeconomic variables

on a quarterly basis, the unit of observation will be standardized at one

quarter in the subsequent analysis.


       Matching data on 90—day Treasury bills with long—term Government

of Canada bonds, and 90—day finance company paper with long—term corporate

bonds,5 the ax ante changes in the long—term rates can        be   calculated in two steps
                                         10




using (7) and (8).6 A representative term to maturity of 17 years was

deemed to be appropriate for both of the long—term bond indexes. The

time—invariant term premiums in (6) were set equal to the average spreads

between the corresponding long— and short—term rates during the sample

period 1957:1 —    1979:1.    These premiums equalled 136 basis points for

Canada   bonds, and   13,8 basis points for corporate bonds.


         The   results   of these calculations, summarized in Table 1, indicate

that the ex ante changes in the long—term rates are indeed quite small.

The mean absolute change is only 2.07 basis pints for Government of

Canada bonds, and 2.60 basis points for corporate bonds.7 The maximum

changes were 7.21 and 9.67 basis points, respectively. A full eighty—

eight percent of the cx ante changes for Canada bonds were smaller than

4 basis points in absolute value. The corresponding figure for corporate

bonds was 80%. By contrast, the actual changes in these long—term rates

were typically quite large. Of particular interest is the striking differ-

ence in   the size of the variances of the cx ante changes and the variances
of the actual changes. The ratio of the former to the latter equalled
0.62% for Canada bonds and 1.26% for corporate bonds. Since anticipated

and unanticipated changes in long—term rates must be uncorrelated if

the market is efficient, these figures imply that 99.38%and98.74% of the

variances of the observed changes in Canada and corporate bonds, respectively,

must be due — under the joint hypothesis of market efficiency and time—

invariant term premiums —       to   the receipt of new information. Equivalently,

under this joint hypothesis, regressions of the current change in the

long rate on any set of variables known at the beginning of the period
                                   11




are not likely to explain more than one percent or so of the variance of

the dependent variable. A higher R2 or explained variance would suggest

the presence of spurious correlation, and suggest that the observed relation-

ship is not likely to prove useful in an out—of—sample or forecasting con-

text.


        To sum up, the ex ante changes in the long—term rates are so close

to zero that the no—change prediction of the martingale model is a very

close approximation to the optimal forecast under the joint hypothesis.

This benchmark is employed in the subsequent analysis of the recorded

forecasts of long—term interest rates in Canada.8 Note also that the small

size of these cx ante changes suggests that the relatively large changes

in long—term interest rates implicit in many recorded forecasts imply sub-

stantial variation in the cx ante return on long— relative to short—term

securities. This point receives attention in the subsequent discussion

of the recorded forecasts.



4.   AN ANALYSIS OF RECORDED INTEREST RATE FORECASTS IN CANADA


        The Conference Board in Canada has made quarterly macroeconomic fore-

casts since late 1974, and histories of these forecasts for long—term cor-

porate bonds (McLeod, Young, Weir (MYW) 10 industrials) and 90—day finance

paper are available. Data Resources Incorporated (DRI) of Canada has pub-

lished macroeconomic forecasts since 1974, and historical data are avail-

able on five separate interest rate series: 90—day Treasury bills, 90—day

finance company paper, long—term Government of Canada bonds, long—term cor-

porate bonds (MYW 10 industrials) and long—term provincial bonds (MYW 10

provincials). For a large part of the sample period, DRI forecasts are

available monthly. To provide comparability with the other recorded forecasts,
                                    12




only four forecasts per year —   corresponding   to the calendar quarters —

were employed in the forecasting experiments. Since December of 1974,

McLeod, Young, Weir and Company Limited has conducted quarterly surveys

of interest rate forecasts, receiving responses from 35 to 40 individuals

from the financial community. The survey respondents are asked to pro-

vide one and two quarter ahead forecasts of nine Canadian and three U.S.

interest rates. Since (1) the concern in this paper is with Canadian data

and (2) several of the series (such as the prime lending rate of the char-

tered banks) are not determined in auction markets, only three series

proved appropriate for this study: 90—day finance company paper, long—

term corporate bonds (MYW 10 industrials) and long—term provincial bonds

(MYW 10 provincials).


       In comparing the recorded forecasts to the predictions of the mar—

tingale model, care must be made to ensure that the martingale forecasts

(i.e. the current value of the relevant interest rate) do not have access

to information not available at the time the recorded forecasts were made.

Since the published data on the several interest rates series are available

only on a monthly basis, the martingale forecasts were set equal to the

interest rate at the end of the latest month which unambiguously preceded

the month in which the recorded forecasts were made. In so doing, this

procedure confers an informational advantage to the recorded forecasts.

This advantage typically consisted of about two weeks, but in some cases

approached a full month.


       The results of the forecast comparisons,9 summarized in Table 2,

indicate that the recorded forecasts of long—term rates in general failed
                                   13




to outperform the no—change prediction of the martingale model, while this

was not the case for the recorded forecasts of short—term rates. In view

of the theoretical discussion, this result is not surprising. Only the

two—quarter ahead forecasts by DRI of the long—term Canada rate proved

superior to the martingale forecasts.      Even this modest success merits

qualification, however, in view of (1) the informational advantage accorded

the recorded forecasts and (2) the inferior performance of the one—quarter

ahead forecasts relative to those of the martingale model. This latter

result suggests that the improvement of the two—quarter ahead forecasts may

be somewhat of a statistical artifact and not likely to obtain over a

longer sample period.

        Both the DRI and MYW survey forecasts of the short—term rates did

prove significantly superior to the martingale model. Further, the forecasts

of the short—term rate by the Conference Board were about as accurate as

the martingale model, while their forecasts of the long—term rate were

distinctly inferior. These results, in general, enhance the credibility of

the null results with respect to the forecasts of the long—term rates.

In general, there always remains —   especially   with survey data —   the poss-

ibility that the reported figures do not accurately reflect the expecta-

tions that actually drive market behavior. In this regard, it is interesting to

note that Friedman (forthcoming) provides evidence that the Goldsmith—Nagan

interest   rate forecasts fail to pass a now standard battery of tests designed
to   measure their "rationalityt'. As   noted by Pesando (19751,), such failures
raise   the interpretive question of whether the recorded forecasts do indeed

reflect those of active economic agents, in which case the latter fail to
                                        14




form "rational" expectations, or whether such recorded forecasts must

not be those of the market on the maintained hypothesis that the market

efficiently     processes     information. Lynch (1979) performs this stan-

dard battery of tests —     the   unbiasedness of the forecasts, the orthogon—

ality of forecast errors to costlessly available information, and effi-

ciency and consistency in the use of autoregressive information — on the

MYW survey data and, on the whole, the results are favourable to the hypo-

thesis that the expectations are rationally formed.


          Finally, the magnitude of the changes in the long—term interest

rates implicit in many of the recorded forecasts merits comment. The

maximum (absolute) change forecast for the corporate bond rate, based on

the two—period compared to the one—period prediction (so as to eliminate

the   uncertainty regarding the date —       and hence the value of this rate —

when   the forecasts were made), equalled 22 basis points in the MYW survey
data, 30 basis points for the DRI forecasts and 70 basis points (!) for the
Conference Board forecasts. The mean absolute changes were 11.2, 12.7 and
13.8 basis points, respectively. In view of the magnitude of the ax ante
changes    summarized in Table 1, these      recorded forecasts clearly imply
substantial   variation in the ax ante return on long— relative to short—

term securities. For the extreme forecast of the Conference Board, for

example,   the implied ex ante return on long—term bonds is 32.60%. During
this same quarter, the Conference Board was predicting a 6.86%          return on

90—day finance company paper. On a:prima fade basis, this result appears

to be unreasonable and serves to highlight the conceptual importance of

translating predicted changes in long—term rates into comparable statements
                                  15




about their ex ante holding—period return. Although corresponding

calculations for the DRI and MYW survey forecasts are less dramatic,

they also imply a very sharp divergence between the ex ante returns

on short— and long—term securities.10 Both forecasters and those who

monitor forecasts would be well advised to focus on ex ante returns

in assessing the likely path of long—term interest rates during their

forecast horizons.



5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


       The failure of the recorded forecasts of long—term interest rates

to outperform the no—change prediction of the martingale, and the reversal

of this result for short—term rates, is not surprising on theoretical

grounds. In fact, however, this point does not appear to be well under-

stood by many financial market participants. These results, for example,

mirror those found in two studies of the accuracy of recorded forecasts

in the United States. The authors of these studies, however, apparently

failed to fully understand the nature of their findings. Prell (1973),

analyzing Goldsmith—Nagan survey data for the period 1969:3 —   1972:4,
found that the recorded forecasts of short—term rates (Federal funds,

90—day Eurodollars and 90—day Treasury bills) outperformed the no—change

prediction, while those of the long—term rates (Aaa utility bonds) did

not. A similar, although less precise, analysis by Fraser (1977) of pooled

forecasts of the National Association of Business Economists, Wharton

Econometric Forecasting Associates and Chase Econometrics, Inc. for the

period 1974—1976 suggests comparable results. In both studies, the authors
                                    16




refer with some surprise to the inability of forecasters to outperform

the   "naiv&' no—change extrapolation for long—term rates, and apparently
fail to   anticipate that their results are not surprising in light of the

evidence in support of market efficiency.


          To conclude, economic agents ought to regard published forecasts

of short—term movements in long—term interest rates with a healthy degree

of skepticism, although the same does not necessarily apply to future move-

ments in short—term rates. (The very small ex ante changes in long—term

rates isolated for the quarterly data examined in this paper do not, of

course, necessarily imply trivial future movements in the short—term rate.

In the absence of yield data on noncoupon bonds with sequential maturity

dates, however, such implied movements are not easily extracted.) Those

seeking to forecast movements in long—term rates over longer horizons

ought to explore further the use of the ex ante changes in the long—term

rate implicit in the term structure itself as a means of refining the

no—change prediction of the martingale model. In this regard, the large

forecast changes in long—term rates in the recorded data analyzed in this

paper — which imply substantial ex ante variation in the returns to long—

term relative to short—term bonds —      merit   note. These results highlight,

in the absence of convincing evidence regarding the existence of time—

varying term premiums, the fact that economic agents ought to observe

two rules: (1) predicted changes in long—term rates must be "small",

at least over short forecast intervals, if they are to be creditable; and

(2) predicted changes in long—term rates ought to be recast into statements

regarding ex ante returns on long—term bonds, in part to facilitate com-

parison with the ex ante returns (i.e. the interest rate) on short—term

securities.

    If stock prices follow a random walk (i.e. P —             =     where

is an independent and identically distributed disturbance term with mean

zero), then equilibrium returns are zero. If stock prices follow a random

walk with a particular form of drift (i.e. P —

equilibrium returns are constant (and equal to k). The statement in the

text is meant to draw attention to the fact that forecasts of the future

level of common stocks which translate into large (in absolute value)

ex ante returns on a diversified portfolio are appropriately discounted

by the market. The same skepticism does not seem to apply to forecasts of

changes in long—term interest rates, perhaps because the latter are not

so easily translated into statements about ex ante returns and/or the case

for market efficiency is viewed as less persuasive for bonds than for

common stocks.

    The standard errors of the regressions, in basis points, for the Trea-

sury bill and    finance   compànypaper rates were: ARMA   (1,1),    74.92 and

92.90; AR (2), 75.98 and 93.65; AR (1), 78.32 and 94.08. In the AR (1)

regression, the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the lagged rate

is equal to one could not be rejected. The standard errors for the martin—

gale or ARIMA (0,1,0) models, which constrain this coefficient to equal

unity, are clearly larger than those noted for the AR (1) specification.


    See, for example, Roll (1971) and McCallum (1975).

the ex ante changes in the long—term rate implied by (6) are so small, this

which are almost identical to the exact changes implied by (7). Consider

the standard valuation formula for an n—period coupon bond. Let c be

the coupon payment and F be the face value of the bond. After summation,

the standard valuation formula reduces to:

                               (F —

If the bond is selling at par, so that                  equals Rn           then this expression

reduces to:




                dP

                     =

Hence, for a given         (    = x)   ,   the   larger change in the interest rate on

an n—period bond is related to the change in the interest rate on a consol

by (8). Note, of course, that dRn + dR, as n +

    The corporate bond series is the McLeod, Young, Weir 10 Industrials, com-

piled by McLeod, Young, Weir and Company Limited. The other series are

compiled by the Bank of Canada. The corporate bond rates are those pre-

vailing on the last business day in the quarter. All of the other rates

are those prevailing on the last Wednesday in the quarter.

6
    Calculating the ex ante change in the long—term rate as if the long—term

rate were a consol provides a useful check on the results reported in the

text. If these changes are not trivial, then the larger (in absolute

value) changes for the finite maturity bonds clearly cannot be trivial either.

The mean absolute values of the ex ante changes so calculated are 1.42

and 1.92 basis points for the government and corporate bonds, respectively.


    For corporate bonds, the term to maturity figure of 17 years is clouded.

by the existence of call options and sinking funds. Fortunately, the

results of the simulation exercises are not sensitive to moderate changes

in the assumed term to maturity of the bond indexes. For an assumed term

to maturity, of 10 years, the mean absolute value of the ex ante changes

is 3.57 basis points rather than the 2.60 basis points reported in the

text. For an assumed term to maturity of 20 years, the corresponding figure

is 2.44 basis points.

         Similarly, variations in the assumed value of the time—invariant

term premium do not produce major changes in the mean absolute values of

these ex ante changes. If, contrary to most empirical studies, the term

premium is set equal to zero (i.e. the pure expectations hypothesis is

assumed), then these values rise to 3.50 and 4.02 basis points for Canada

and corporate bonds, respectively. These higher values reflect the tendency
                                               20




of long—term to exceed short—term rates, which thus requires — on average —

ox ante increases in long—term rates to produce the capital losses necessary

to equilibrate ex ante returns.

8
     An obvious question is whether the use of the ex ante change to refine
                                                                      A

              )             will
                     improve its forecasting accuracy and thus provide a

more useful benchmark. In fact, root—mean—squared errors of the refined

martingale as defined above were slightly smaller than that of the martin—

gale model for the period 1957:2 —                  1979:1.       These errors equalled 34.87

and 29.75 basis points for government and corporate bonds, respectively.

compared to those of 35.15 and 30.81 basis points for the unadjusted

martingale model. These results, in general, invited the estimation of

the following regression:


                              AR    = a + B(ARA ) +                                      (F4)
                                n,t           n,t             t


Under the joint hypothesis of market efficiency and a time—invariant
term premium, a = 0                and B = 1    while the residuals are devoid of serial

correlation. The appropriate test statistic for the null hypothesis

    (a =   0,   B =   1),   distributed F(2,86), equalled 0.83 and 2.97 for govern-

ment and corporate bonds, respectively. The 5 per cent significance level

for this test statistic is 3.12 and thus the null hypothesis could not

be rejected for either of the two data sets. The Durbin—Watson statistics,

as required by the joint hypothesis, provided no evidence of serial correla-

tion. Finally, as anticipated in the text, the explanatory power of these

equations is quite low. R2 equalled .022 in the corporate bond regression,

and only .005 in the government regression.
                                     21




  The forecasts differ in their release dates, and pertain to both quar-

terly    average (Data Resources and the Conference Board) and end—of—the—
quarter (MYW surveys) interest rates. As a result, the accuracy of the
forecasts cannot be compared across forecasting agents.
10
     The maximum change predicted by DRI implied an ex ante return on long—
term bonds of 17.71   per   cent at a time when DRI forecast a 9.49   per   cent
return   on finance company paper. For the MYW survey, the corresponding

figures are 17.23 per cent and 9.29 per cent.

    Notes:    Martingale forecasts equal the interest rate at the end of the month prior to the date at
              which the recorded forecasts were made. Forecast dates for the recorded figures vary within
              the quarter and are thus not strictly comparable across forecast sources.
