                                              ABSTRACT

Naturally-occurring yellow sand outbreaks, which are produced by winds flowing to Korea from
China and Mongolia, create air pollution. Although there is seasonal pattern of this phenomenon, there
exists substantial variation in its timing, strength and location from year to year. Thus, exposure to
the intensity of air pollution exhibits significant randomness and unpredictability. To warn residents
about air pollution in general, and about these dust storms in particular, Korean authorities issue different
types of public alerts. Using birth certificate data on more than 1.5 million babies born between 2003
and 2011, we investigate the impact of air pollution, and the avoidance behavior triggered by pollution
alerts on various birth outcomes. We find that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy has a significant
negative impact on birth weight, the gestation weeks of the baby, and the propensity of the baby being
low weight. Public alerts about air quality during pregnancy have a separate positive effect on fetal
health. We show that Korean women do not time their pregnancy according to expected yellow dust
exposure, and that educated women’s pregnancy timing is not different from those who are less-
educated.The results provide evidence for the effectiveness of pollution alert systems in promoting
public health.They also underline the importance of taking into account individuals’ avoidance
behavior when estimatingthe impact of air quality on birth outcomes. Specifically, we show that the
estimated impact of airpollution on infant health is reduced by half when the preventive effect of
public health warnings isnot accounted for.

                            Chinese Yellow Dust and Korean Infant Health



I. Introduction

        It has been documented that health at birth has long term effects on adult health, human

capital accumulation and economic well-being. One of the most commonly-used indicators of

health at birth is the weight of the infant when she was born. As summarized by Currie (2011)

and Almond and Currie (2011), infants who are heavier at birth end up being different in

adulthood from those who have lighter birth weights. For example, they are taller adults, have

greater IQ scores, attain higher levels of education and earn more when they are adults.

Consequently, a sizable literature has investigated the impact on birth weight of its various

determinants, ranging from smoking (Lien and Evans 2005, Grossman and Joyce 1990) to

prenatal care consumption (Mocan, Raschke and Unel (Forthcoming), Dehejia and Lleras-

Muney 2004), to nutritional assistance for low-income families (Almond, Hoynes and

Schanzenbach 2011).

        An important component of this investigation is the extent to which in utero exposure to

pollution impacts birth weight. 1 While the literature on the effect of air pollution on infant

mortality is extensive 2, there are relatively few studies examining the biological effect of

pollution on birth weight. Examples of this limited area of inquiry include Currie, Neidell and

Schimeider (2009), who show that mother’s exposure to carbon monoxide in her last trimester of

pregnancy in New Jersey increases the risk of low birth weight. Coneus and Spiess (2012) find a

similar effect of air pollution on birth weight using German data. Currie et al. (2015) report that

toxic plant openings increase the incidence of low birth weight through their detrimental effect

on air pollution within one mile radius. Currie and Walker (2012) demonstrate that the

introduction of electronic toll collection on the highways of New Jersey and Pennsylvania

reduced automobile emissions, resulting in fewer infants with low birth weight.

        In this paper we investigate the impact of air pollution on infant health, measured by birth

weight and gestational age of newborns. In contrast to the existing body of work that employed

data from the U.S. or some European countries, we focus on a new setting, the Republic of

Korea. We utilize the universe of birth certificates between 2003 and 2011, which allow us to

analyze more than 1.5 million live births. We exploit the exogenous variation in air pollution,

created by a natural phenomenon in South Korea: The Yellow Dust (Hwang-sa in Korean). This

is a weather event, originated in the arid lands of Northern China and in the desert regions of

Mongolia plateau “under the conditions of high temperature, low humidity, and high wind

velocity” (Chun et al. 2001). Winds with abnormally high speed, particularly the Westerlies, 3

pick up dust and sand particles and carry them to the Korean peninsula. Although there is a

seasonal pattern of this phenomenon, there exists substantial variation in its strength and location

from year to year. In other words, while the intensity of air pollution due to yellow dust exhibits

a seasonal cycle, the amplitude of the cycle varies significantly between the years, along with the

timing of the up-and-down swings. For example, Figure 1 displays the average concentration of

PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less) levels by month between 2003 and

 The Westerlies are winds blowing from West to East, and occur in temperate zones -- in the middle latitudes
between 30 and 60 degrees latitude.

2006. 4 The values reported in Figure 1 are average PM10 levels, aggregated over hourly

readings in about 130 weather stations across Korea. While pollution generally rises in the

Spring and declines during Summer, the pattern is not systematic, and it exhibits substantial

noise from year to year. The same irregularity is observed within a given city as well. We

demonstrate, in different ways, that women do not time their pregnancy according to expected

Yellow Dust exposure, and that educated women’s pregnancy timing is not different from those

who are less-educated. Therefore, exposure to the intensity of air pollution exhibits substantial

randomness and unpredictability.

        An important contribution of the paper is the ability to account for avoidance behavior,

and to obtain estimates of the impact of pollution avoidance on birth outcomes. Individuals may

take precautionary measures in reaction to temporary increases in pollution by such actions as

wearing masks or staying indoors. The biological impact of air pollution on health is

underestimated if reductions in the exposure to pollution due to avoidance are not accounted for.

The paucity of data prevented most of the existing research from controlling for the avoidance

behavior, although there are notable exceptions (e.g. Janke 2014, Moretti and Neidell 2011,

Neidell 2009). As summarized by Zivin, Neidell and Schlenker (2011), the provision of public

notifications and alerts on environmental hazards is being used increasingly as a tool to generate

behavioral responses to mitigate the detrimental effects of exposure.

        We utilize various pollution alerts at the local level, issued by Korean authorities, to

obtain unbiased estimates of the biological impact of pollution on infant health, as well as to

  Particulate matter intensity is directly linked to negative health consequences such as lung and heart disease and
reduced immune system function (http://www.epa.gov/pm/health.html). When inhaled by the pregnant mother, these
particles get into pregnant mother’s lungs and into the blood stream, and they may be transferred to the infant.

estimate the improvement of infant health generated by pollution avoidance. 5 Our paper is the

first one to investigate the effectiveness of public air quality alerts on birth outcomes. 6

         In a concurrent paper, using the incidence of yellow dust events in Korea, Jia and Ku

(2015) investigate the effect of pollution on mortality. The authors show that during the months

in which Chinese pollution is high, an increase in the number of yellow dust events triggers a rise

in deaths due to respiratory and cardiovascular causes, especially in the elderly population in

Korean districts. Our paper is different from Jia and Ku (2015) in a number of ways. First, we

focus on infant birth outcomes, rather than aggregate mortality. Second, we employ micro data,

as opposed to district-level data. Finally, Jia and Ku (2015) consider neither the avoidance

behavior of Koreans nor the public alerts against poor air quality.

         We find that, controlling for temperature and precipitation, exposure to air pollution

during pregnancy has a significant negative impact on birth weight, gestation weeks of the baby,

and the propensity of the baby being low weight (less than 2,500 gr). Public notifications about

air quality have a separate statistically significant and positive effect on fetal health. We show

that mothers do not time their pregnancy around expected yellow dust exposure, and that

educated women’s pregnancy timing is not different from those who are less-educated. We also

show that white collar families and more educated and older mothers are more likely to give

birth in high-pollution cities. These family attributes and the housing price index of the city in

which the birth took place are correlated with birth outcomes, but adjusting for these factors does

not impact the results appreciably.

  Neidell (2009), Moretti and Neidell (2011) implement a similar approach when analyzing the impact of ozone on
respiratory-related hospitalizations, and asthma.
6
  Janke (2014), Moretti and Neidell (2011), Neidell (2009) and Neidell (2004) also consider public warnings, but
these papers focus on the effects of smog and ozone alerts on respiratory illnesses such as the asthma in the general
population, rather than birth outcomes.

       Our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of pollution alert systems in promoting

public health. They also underline the importance of taking into account individuals’ avoidance

behavior when estimating the impact of air quality on birth outcomes. Specifically, we show that

the estimated impact of air pollution on infant health is reduced by half when the preventive

effect of public health warnings is not accounted for. Using the regression results, and following

the framework of Moretti and Neidell (2011), we obtain estimates of the willingness to pay to

reduce air pollution and the cost of the avoidance behavior.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II we provide a detailed

description of the public alert system that is designed to inform people about the yellow dust

activity. Section III presents the empirical specification. Section IV describes the conceptual

framework on cost of pollution avoidance and willingness to pay. Section V presents the data.

Section VI contains the results, robustness analyses and extensions. Section VII discusses the

estimates of the cost of avoidance and Section VIII concludes.




II. Yellow Dust, Air Pollution, and Pollution Alerts

       Yellow Dust is a weather phenomenon originated in Northern China and in the deserts of

the Mongolia plateau. High winds pick up particles of dust and sand and carry them towards the

Korean peninsula. These particles of dust and sand settle in Korea and they elevate the ambient

air pollution, measured by PM10 concentration. This phenomenon generally occurs from March

to May, but also irregularly during the winter months. These dust and sand particles are




                                                 5
detrimental to human health and they have adverse respiratory health effects, particularly in

children and the elderly (Ministry of Environment of Korea, 2002). 7

          To reduce the risk of the yellow dust exposure, the Korean government has developed a

warning system with behavioral guidelines. Since 2002, Korea Meteorological Administration

(KMA) has been releasing notifications to the public based on the measured PM10 levels.

Between mid-2002 and 2007, KMA issued an Advisory in a city when the PM10 level was

predicted to rise above 500 and 1000 𝜇𝜇𝑚𝑚/m3 for over 2 hours in a day. A Warning was issued

when the PM10 level was predicted to rise above 1000 𝜇𝜇𝑚𝑚/m3 for over 2 hours. In February

2007, these thresholds were reduced to 400 and 800 𝜇𝜇𝑚𝑚/m3, respectively. These public

notifications advise individuals, especially children, the elderly, and people with respiratory

illnesses to limit outdoor activities, and staying indoors is recommended. Pregnant women are

suggested to refrain from outdoor activities and to wear protective masks if necessary.

          In addition to Warnings and Advisories, officials may declare a Yellow Dust Event (YDE)

in the city if ambient yellow dust is noticeable in the air at least once at any time during a day.

This is produced daily by specially trained observers in monitoring stations who take into

account conditions such as visibility distance, atmospheric turbidity, dust stacks, and odor of the

air. Although YDEs are correlated with PM10 concentrations, they are monitored separately

from PM10 levels. Because of the health hazards associated with YDEs, YDEs are routinely

forecasted by the KMA. These forecasts, similar to weather forecasts, are announced to the

public.

 Epidemiological literature has identified negative health consequences of yellow sand (Park et al. 2005, Lee, Son
and Cho 2007).

           Anecdotal evidence suggests that individuals tend to consider seriously the information

provided by these alerts. For example, as documented by international media, during a Yellow

Dust Event, Koreans respond by wearing preventive masks and staying indoors. 8 For example,

in 2002, in response to a particularly high-density yellow dust event elementary schools were

closed and plants in some industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing, were temporarily

shut down. 9 Later in the paper we provide evidence that people avoid outdoor activities in

response to Advisories, Warnings and YDEs, by demonstrating that attendance to professional

soccer games is substantially impacted by these alerts.




III. Empirical Specification

           To investigate the impact of air pollution and the role of the public alerts on infant health

outcomes, we estimate the equation depicted below:

(1) 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃10𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜷𝜷𝟒𝟒 + 𝑾𝑾𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜷𝜷𝟓𝟓 + 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates a particular birth outcome of infant 𝑖𝑖 born to a mother residing in city

𝑐𝑐 on day t. We consider five outcome variables: birth weight in grams, a binary indicator of low

birth weight (equals to one if the infant’s birth weight is less than 2,500 grams), gestation weeks,

an indicator for premature birth (whether infant’s gestational age is fewer than 37 weeks), and

fetal growth (birth weight per gestation week). 10 The Korean birth certificate data released to us

do not include the exact birthday, but they have information on birth month. We assign the 15th

  The influence of Chinese Yellow Dust on Korea is frequently covered by the media. An example is a piece in New
York Times on April 12th, 2002, p.3. “China's Growing Deserts Are Suffocating Korea”

CNN also covered the issue on February 23rd, 2015 “Yellow dust blankets Seoul”

   Studies, such as Coneus and Spiess (2012), also used fetal growth as a birth outcome measure.

                                                                       7
day of the month as the birthday to each child. Because the birth certificate data include

information on gestation in weeks, the day of conception can be determined. Using this

information, and assuming that the mother spent her pregnancy in the same city as the one in

which she gave birth, her exposure to air pollution during each day of her pregnancy can be

determined. We measure air pollution by calculating the PM10 level in each city using hourly

readings of all monitoring stations in that city, and by creating a daily average PM10 level for

each city. In Equation (1), 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃10𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the average hourly exposure to air pollution of infant 𝑖𝑖’s

mother throughout the duration of her pregnancy that ended with the birth of the child on day t in

city c.

          The vector 𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 represents the two variables that measure the total number of days

in which a public notification is issued in mother’s city of residence during her pregnancy that

ended at time t. There are two types of public alerts: Advisories (issued when PM10 level is

anticipated to increase above 500 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 [400 since 2007]) and Warnings (issued when PM10

level is anticipated to increase above 1,000 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 [800 since 2007]). We also include in the

regressions the number of days a yellow dust event is observed in mother’s city during her

pregnancy. This is denoted by 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 in equation (1).

          To investigate potentially differential effects of pollution and that of avoidance behavior

on birth outcomes during different developmental stages of the fetus, in some specifications we

examine the effect of PM10 and pollution alerts by trimester of pregnancy.

          The vector 𝑿𝑿 stands for control variables that include parental characteristics such as the

age, education, marital status and employment status of both mother and the father. These

attributes are important to control for because they may impact health outcomes. For example,

more educated mothers are better producers of infant health (Chou et al. 2010, McCrary and

                                                      8
Royer 2011) and these attributes may also be correlated with exposure to pollution (e.g. more

educated mothers may be more effective in avoiding pollution, or in timing their pregnancy).

While we have no income information on birth certificates, parental education is expected to be

correlated with family income.

        Vector 𝑿𝑿 also contains other variables that impact infant’s birth weight (Currie 2011),

including infant’s gender, an indicator of whether the infant was part of a multiple birth, and

birth parity. 𝑾𝑾 is a vector of weather controls such as the average precipitation and temperature

during the mother’s pregnancy. All regressions include indicators for the city of residence, 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 to

account for unobserved (to us) time-invariant characteristics of cities such as the extent of

economic development, urbanization and access to health care. Equation (1) also contains a

vector of year-of-conception and month-of-conception dummies, represented by 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 . Standard

errors are clustered at the city level.

        Anecdotal evidence suggests that Koreans try and reduce/avoid outdoor activities during

a yellow dust event (YDE). In order to investigate this point more rigorously, we estimate the

effect of YDEs and public alerts on an outdoor activity: attendance to professional soccer games.

Soccer games are played in open air stadiums, and if Koreans attempt to avoid pollution when a

public alert is issued, then we expect the attendance to a soccer game to decline when a pollution

alert is released on the game day. To test this hypothesis, we estimate an equation similar to

Zivin and Neidell (2009)

(2)     𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 = 𝛼𝛼1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃10𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 𝜶𝜶𝟐𝟐 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈 𝜷𝜷𝟒𝟒 + 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔

where 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 is the number of fans (or the logarithm of fans) who attended a particular

soccer game 𝑔𝑔 that took place in city 𝑐𝑐 on day 𝑡𝑡. 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃10𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the average PM10 level in city 𝑐𝑐 that


                                                                   9
same day. 𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 is the same vector of indicators that take the value of one if an advisory or a

warning is issued on the day of the game, as explained above. Similarly, 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is a dummy

variable that is equal to one if a yellow dust event is observed. In vector 𝑿𝑿𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈 we include

variables that are likely related to soccer game attendance. For example, games in which high

quality teams are playing may attract greater attendance. To control for the quality of the teams,

we employ teams’ rankings in the league as of the game day. In addition, we control for the

round of the game in the tournament. 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 and 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 are city fixed effects and time dummies (month-

year).




IV. Cost of Avoidance and Willingness to Pay

         Exposure to air pollution, measured by PM10, has a direct biological impact on birth

weight. Public alerts, triggered by air pollution, are expected to generate avoidance; and

avoidance impacts birth weight positively. Therefore, an increase in PM10 affects birth weight

both directly and indirectly. Thus, holding constant other determinants of birth weight (BW),

the total derivative of 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 with respect to 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃10 is given by equation (3):

          𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑         𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕        𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
(3)      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑10
                    = 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕10 + 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕10


The first term on the right hand side of Equation (3) represents the biological health effect of

PM10. The second term is the effect on birth weight of PM10 through alerts and avoidance

behavior. Following Moretti and Neidell (2011) and the literature they cite, the willingness to

pay (WTP) for a reduction in pollution can be expressed as

                        𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
(4)      𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕10 × 𝐵𝐵



                                                                          10
where 𝐵𝐵 is the economic benefit associated with a one-gram increase in birth weight. Following

Currie, Neidell and Schimeider (2009), we use the estimate provided by Black, Devereux and

Salvanes (2007) in approximating B. Specifically, we consider the increase in lifetime earnings

                                                                                                   𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
due to the increase in birth weight as an estimate of B. The term (𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕10) in equation (4) is the

direct biological effect of pollution on birth weight. The coefficient β1 in Equation (1) is an

                  𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
estimate of 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕10 because the regression in Equation (1) controls for the impact of avoidance

(Advisories, Warnings and Yellow Dust Events). Thus, the estimate of the WTP in Equation (4)

provides the loss associated with the decline in infant health due to an increase in PM10.

        Re-writing equation (3) and multiplying both sides with 𝐵𝐵 yields Equation (5):

        Equation (5) decomposes the willingness to pay (WTP) into two components. The first

                                         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
component includes the term 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑10 which is the total derivate of birth weight with respect to

PM10. This term can be estimated by the coefficient of PM10 using the regression Equation (1),

if the regression does not control for variables that are related to avoidance behavior. That is, to

the extent that pollution alerts and notifications in Equation (1) capture the factors that influence

the demand for avoidance, omitting these variables from equation (1) allows the coefficient of

                                                                                         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

discussed by Neidell (2009), providing estimates on the cost of pollution avoidance is critical in

the assessment of full cost environmental pollution and the design of policy.




V. Data

         Our data set is compiled from multiple sources. We have information on all births in

Korea between 2003 and 2011, obtained from Vital Statistics-Natality Files provided by

Statistics Korea Micro Data Service System. Birth certificates provide information about the

infant (such as gender, birth weight, gestational length, whether the infant was singleton, and the

birth order) and about the parents (such as their age, education level, employment status, and

marital status). In addition, the month, year and the city of the birth are reported. Following

Knittel, Miller and Sanders (2011), we restrict our sample to infants whose gestational age is

between 27 and 42 weeks in order to accurately determine the three trimesters of the pregnancy.

In our regressions, we only consider the singleton births, since birth weight differences in twins

are largely attributable to biological factors attributable to the mother (Almond, Chay and Lee

2005).

         We augment the birth certificate data with data on city air quality, yellow dust events,

public notifications and weather conditions. To proxy for air quality, we use PM10 concentration

which is measured hourly by the monitoring stations in cities. 11 These PM10 data are obtained

from National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) in Korea. The variable PM10 is the

average hourly PM10 concentration in the city of residence of the mother during her




11
 PM10 stands for particulate matter 10. These are tiny objects in the air that are less than or equal to 10
micrometers in size.

pregnancy. 12 Figure 2 shows the average daily PM10 concentrations in each region across Korea

between years 2003 and 2011 in our sample. 13 PM10 concentration is relatively higher in the

North, in cities close to Northern China and the Mongolia plateau. For example, average PM10

was 58.6 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 in Seoul between 2003 and 2011, whereas Geoje-si, the most-Southeastern

region used in our sample, had 36.3 Geoje-si 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3. We show later in the paper that the results

do not change when we estimate models by geographical location. An important issue is the

timing of the pregnancy around the yellow dust season. We show that mothers do not time their

pregnancy around yellow dust, arguably because there is substantial uncertainty in the intensity

of yellow dust phenomenon from year to year. We obtain weather conditions data (precipitation

and temperature) from the annual climatological report provided by the Korea Meteorological

Administration(KMA).

        Although there are about 4 million births between 2003 and 2011, our estimation sample

contains over 1.5 million of these births because births in most locations cannot be matched

reliably with air pollution measures because air quality and weather measures are not measured

or not measured consistently in these locations. In addition, some regions such as Jeong-eup in

North-Jeolla Province are excluded at the advice of the Korea Meteorological Administration

because of the inaccuracy of the yellow dust outbreak indicators in those areas.

        The descriptions and the summary statistics of the variables are presented in Table 1. 14

The average Korean infant was born just above 3,200 grams with gestational age of 39 weeks. 15


12
   The birth certificates data set only includes month and year of birth, but not day of birth. In our analysis, we
assumed that infants are born on the 15th day of the month reported in the certificate.
13
   Although PM10 concentrations are available at the weather station level in a region, for eight regions (Seoul,
Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, Ulsan, and Gyeonggi-do) we report the average PM10 levels in a region
in this map due to the lack of space.
14
   Our sample period starts in 2003 since dust alert systems were established around the middle of the year 2002. In
the data set we obtained from the Statistics Korea, there are about 4 million birth certificates between 2003 and
2011. However, we lose observations since the PM10 data are not available for some Korean cities. The birth

Approximately, three and a half percent of Korean infants are classified as low birth weight

(<2,500 grams at birth), and four percent of the infants were born premature (gestational age<37

weeks). Thirty percent of Korean mothers and 95 percent of fathers are employed. Sixty-six

percent of mothers and 70 percent of fathers have a college education or higher.

         Average hourly PM10 exposure of a mother during pregnancy is about 54 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 . Due

to yellow dust breaks, mothers experienced about 1.7 Advisories and 0.5 Warnings during

pregnancy. The average Korean mother experienced 7 Yellow Dust Events.

         To investigate whether Koreans respond to public notifications of yellow dust events and

poor air quality by avoiding outdoors activities, we estimate these notifications’ effect on

attendance to soccer games played in Korean premier soccer league: K League. These data are

obtained from the English version of the official website of the K League. 16 From this website,

we scraped information about the number of people who attended a particular game, the final

score, and the teams’ performance in the league (standings table). The attendance data span the

period between 2004 and 2011. The average attendance to a game during this time period is

about 12,500.




VI. Results

The Effect of Air Quality, Pollution Alerts and Yellow Dust Events on Birth Outcomes

         The results obtained from estimating Equation (1) are presented in Table 2. In addition to

the variables listed, all regressions include city fixed effects and year-of-conception and month-


outcomes and parent characteristics of infants that are out of sample are similar to those that enter into our
regressions (Appendix Table 1).
15
   In comparison, the average birth weight of U.S. born babies is 3320 grams (Mocan et al. 2013).

of-conception fixed effects. Outcome variables are the birth weight in grams (column 1), an

indicator for whether the birth weight is less than 2,500 grams (column 2), gestational age in

weeks (column 3), an indicator for whether infant’s gestational age is less than 37 weeks

(column 4), and ratio of birth weight to gestational age (column 5). Standard errors, reported in

parentheses, are clustered at the city level.

            Column 1 of Table 2 shows that infants born to mothers who were exposed to greater

daily PM10 levels (worse air quality) during their pregnancy are born with lower weights.

Specifically, a one 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 increase in average exposure to PM10 during pregnancy leads to

about 0.8 gram reduction in newborn’s birth weight. This indicates that a 10 percent increase in

the average hourly PM10 exposure reduces birth weight by about 0.13% (from the baseline of

3,257 grams), which implies an elasticity of birth weight with respect to PM10 of about 0.013. 17

            The results of column (1) in Table 2 also indicate that each additional pollution Advisory

and Warning that a mother experiences during her pregnancy improves infant’s birth weight by

4.4 and 13.6 grams, respectively. A warning’s effect is larger than an advisory’s effect (p-value <

0.01). This could be because a Warning provides a stronger signal about the dust level than an

Advisory, and therefore a warning is associated with stronger health risk and may prompt a

stronger avoidance response. The coefficient of Yellow Dust Events in column 1 indicates that

each additional day a yellow dust event is issued during pregnancy increases birth weight of the

infant by about 8.6 grams. These positive estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that

Korean mothers avoid/reduce outside activities when an air quality alert is issued or when there

is a yellow dust event in the city of residence of the expecting mother.

       Similar to those in column (1), the results presented in columns (2)-(5) in Table 2 provide

evidence for the detrimental effect of PM10 exposure and the beneficial effect of pollution alerts

and yellow dust events on birth outcomes. Each Advisory, Warning and Yellow Dust Event

reduces the probability of low birth weight by 0.2, 0.5 and 0.3 percentage points (from the

sample mean of 3.4 percentage points), respectively. Similarly, advisories, warnings and yellow

dust events increase the gestational age of the infant, probability of premature birth and its

average fetal growth, while a rise in PM10 exposure reduces them.

       The signs of the control variables in Table 2 are consistent with expectations. Girls and

babies born to mothers who have not previously given birth weigh less at birth compared to boys

and babies born to mothers who have given birth to at least one baby, respectively. Infants whose

parents are employed and have attained higher education levels are born healthier.

       Previous papers provide evidence for differential effect on birth outcomes of external

factors in different developmental stages of the fetus (Currie 2011). To investigate this

possibility, we include in the regressions the exposure to PM10 and the number of alerts against

poor air quality during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy (instead of the overall

exposure during the whole pregnancy). For example, instead of the variable Advisories, we

include Advisories – trimester 1, Advisories – trimester 2 and Advisories – trimester 3 that

decompose the number of advisories a pregnant woman has experienced during her pregnancy

into its first, second and third trimester components. The results, presented in Table 3, are similar

to those in Table 2. The number of Advisories, Warnings and Yellow Dust Events experienced in

any trimester has a positive and significant impact on birth weight. These effects are not

statistically different from each other. An increase in PM10 exposure in the third trimester

worsens birth outcomes. Average PM10 exposure in late stages of pregnancy (third trimester)


                                                 16
has a larger negative impact on the birth outcomes compared to its effect in the first- or second-

trimesters. This finding is consistent with that of Currie, Neidell and Schmieder (2009) who

report that exposure to pollution during the third trimester has a more significant impact than

exposure during the two earlier trimesters.




The Estimates of Pollution on Birth Outcomes When Avoidance is Omitted

       The results in Tables 2 and 3 indicate that mothers’ exposure to PM10 is detrimental to

the infants’ health, while air quality alerts and yellow dust events are beneficial as they allow the

pregnant women to avoid pollution. That is, advisories and warnings help pregnant women avoid

harmful effects of pollution. Pollution advisories and warnings are issued based on anticipated

PM10 concentrations, and elevated PM10 level triggers these notifications. Similarly, Yellow

Dust Events cause an increase in ambient PM10 levels. In other words, PM10 levels are

positively correlated with the intensity of pollution alerts issued by the government. Given that

people take precautions when these warnings are issued, the failure to control for pollution

warnings and advisories would bias downwards the estimated biological impact of air pollution.

       In Table 4 we report the results of the models that exclude pollution alert indicators.

These are the same models as shown in Equation (1), but the variables Advisories, Warnings and

Yellow Dust Events are omitted. Put differently, Table 4 is similar to Table 2, except for the

pollution alert variables. The coefficients of PM10 in columns (1)-(5) of Table 4 indicate that

PM10 is harmful for infants’ birth outcomes as shown earlier. However, the magnitude of the

impact is much smaller in absolute value when compared to those in Table 2. For example,

according to the results in column 1 of Table 4 (where public notifications and yellow dust

events are omitted), a one 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 increase in the average exposure to PM10 during pregnancy

                                                 17
leads to about 0.2 gram reduction in the newborn’s birth weight. This same effect is estimated to

be 0.8 grams when the full set of control variables is included in the regressions (Column 1 in

Table 2). Thus, a comparison of PM10 coefficients between Tables 2 and 4 reveals that the

inability to account for the beneficial effect of pollution warnings on health generates a

substantial underestimation of the negative impact of pollution on health.




The Impact of Air Quality, Pollution Notifications and Yellow Dust Events on Attendance to

Soccer Games

       Our results show that air pollution alerts in terms of Advisories, Warnings and Yellow

Dust Event notifications are beneficial to birth weight and gestational age. These findings are

consistent with the hypothesis that mothers avoid/reduce outdoors activities when a public air

quality alert is issued or when a yellow dust event is observed. Ideally, we would like to test this

hypothesis using data on the amount of time pregnant mothers spend outside. No such data,

however, are available. Instead, we use data on another outdoors activity: attendance to

professional soccer games. Soccer games are played in open air stadiums, and the attendees are

exposed to air pollution. If Koreans try to avoid pollution when an air pollution notification is

announced, then the number of fans who attend a soccer game should decrease when a pollution

alert is issued on the game day. To estimate the effect of YDEs and alerts on attendance to the

soccer games, we run the regression depicted by equation (2).

       Table 5 presents the results obtained from equation (2) where the unit of observation is a

soccer game played between two teams of the Korean premier league, K League. The outcome

variable is the number of individuals who attended the game. We control for various attributes

of the games, including the strength of both teams (approximated by their rank that week), the

                                                 18
number of goals scored that far during the season, the week of the season, and whether the game

is played during the day or at night and in weekdays or at the weekend. We also add stadium

fixed-effects, time dummies (month and year), and indicators for the team match-ups. Standard

errors are clustered at the stadium level.

           In Table 5, the coefficients of Yellow Dust Events and Warnings are negative and

significant, lending support to the hypothesis that individuals avoid spending time outside during

days of pollution warnings and yellow dust events. Specifically, if a yellow dust event occurs on

game day, about 3,400 fewer individuals attend that particular game. This corresponds to about

26 percent decline (from the baseline of 12,500 spectators). Similarly, a Warning on the game

day reduces the game attendance by about 7,000.




A Falsification Test

           Neither exposure to pollution, nor avoidance of pollution should impact birth outcomes if

pollution is measured after the birth of the infant. To operationalize this idea as a falsification

test, we estimated equation (1) using future values of PM10, air quality alerts, and yellow dust

events as explanatory variables. Specifically, we ran the regression below:

(6)        𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃10𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑘𝑘 + 𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊+𝑘𝑘 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑘𝑘 + 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜷𝜷𝟒𝟒 + 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where subscript 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑘𝑘 indicates 𝑘𝑘 days after the delivery of the baby at time 𝑡𝑡.

           The results obtained from estimating equation (6) are presented in Table 6 where the

outcome variable is infant’s birth weight. 18 Columns (1) to (4) pertain to k=30, 60, 90 and 120

days. For example, in column (1) of Table 6, the rows PM10, Advisories, Warnings, and Yellow

18
     Similar results are obtained when other outcome variables are used in the regressions.

                                                                       19
Dust Events stand for the corresponding variables measured during the 30 days subsequent to the

delivery of the baby. In column 2, these rows indicate the air quality and notification during 60

days following the baby’s birth. The full set of control variables, as in Table 2, is included in all

regressions. As expected, results show that mother’s exposure to poor air quality or her

avoidance behavior due to notifications after she delivered the baby does not have any influence

of the baby’s birth weight.




Other Robustness Checks

       As an extension, to investigate whether air quality and pollution notifications have

differential impacts on birth weight, we estimated equation (1) over a number of subsamples.

The results are presented in Table 7, where the outcome variable is infant’s weight at birth. First,

we split the sample into two groups by geographical location. Mothers who live in the North and

Northwest Korea could be more responsive to pollution and notifications. The Northern part of

Korea is closer to China and it is exposed to more frequent yellow dust events. As a result,

individuals could be more aware of adverse effects of yellow dust and poor air quality, and they

may respond more intensely. However, the results in columns 1 and 2 of Table 7 suggest the

effects of PM10, air quality notifications and yellow dust events on birth weight are similar in

both samples. Similarly, there is no difference between mothers who live in cities with poor

versus high air quality (PM10 greater or smaller than the median) regarding the effect of air

quality and notifications on birth weight (columns 3 and 4).

       A potential concern is selection due to unobservables related to mother’s health

knowledge. For example, pregnant mothers who are more knowledgeable about the detrimental

impact of poor air quality may take better preventive action against pollution. They may move

                                                  20
away from cities of low air quality, or they may time the birth to avoid exposure to high levels of

PM10. Alternatively, they may be better at following the advisories and warnings. In that case,

our baseline results in Table 2 may be overestimates of the true effect of pollution.

       To investigate this possibility, we first estimated equation (1) in subsamples that are

separated by mother attributes: mother’s education, work experience, and pregnancy experience.

Mothers with more education or more experience in the labor market are likely to command

more know-how about reducing/eliminating harmful effects of air pollution. Similarly, a mother

who has given birth before could be more knowledgeable compared to her counterparts who are

expecting their first babies. The results, presented in columns (5) to (10) of Table 7, suggest that

our baseline findings are not driven by certain types of mothers. For example, advisories,

warnings and yellow dust events improve birth weights of infants born to high-educated or

experienced mothers as much as they improve birth weights of low-educated or inexperienced

mothers’ babies. Similarly, exposure to PM10 is detrimental to infants of high-educated or

experienced mothers as much as it is damaging to the health of babies born to low-educated or

inexperienced mothers.

       As another robustness check, we investigated whether high-educated parents alter the

timing of their pregnancies in order to select themselves out of poor air quality seasons. First,

using each birth as the unit of observation, we regressed total exposure to pollution during the

pregnancy of the mother (measured by PM10) on monthly dummies for the month of conception

(n=1,549,376). This regression showed that PM10 exposure during pregnancy is lower if

conception is between the months of March and June. We then created a dummy variable for

each mother to indicate if her conception of pregnancy was during this more favorable period

(March to June). We ran this Conception Timing dummy on mother’s and father’s education


                                                 21
(dummy indicators of having high school education, and having college education as used in all

regressions). The results showed that neither mother’s nor father’s education had any impact on

the timing of pregnancy. 19 Thus, we could not find support for the hypothesis that educated

parents adjust the time of their pregnancies to avoid poor air quality.

           To investigate any overall seasonal pattern in conceptions, we calculated the total number

of conceptions by month in the country and regressed them on 11 monthly dummies to analyze

whether the number of conceptions rises or declines in certain months of the year (possibly to

avoid pollution). The estimated monthly coefficients and the corresponding confidence intervals

are reported in Figure 3. In no case the coefficients are different from zero, signifying that the

number of conceptions does not exhibit any seasonal pattern.




Residential Location Decision

           A possible bias in our estimates could emerge due to the geographical selection of

parents. For example, if families with more income and higher education reside in bigger cities

with worse ambient air quality, and if such families have high productive and/or allocative

efficiency in infant health production (Grossman 2008 and 1972, Rosenzweig and Schultz 1982,

Kenkel 1991, Altindag, Cannonier and Mocan 2011), then the negative impact of pollution on

birth outcomes is underestimated.

           To investigate the correlation between city-level air pollution and parent attributes, we

estimated a regression where the outcome variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if

the infant is born in a city where average PM10 level is above the national median. 20 The


19
     The point estimates ranged from -0.005 to 0.0007 with p-values ranging from 0.15 to 0.81.
20
     This is the variable that we use to divide the sample into two (columns 3 and 4) in Table 7.

                                                            22
explanatory variables included parent characteristics and month- and year-of conception

dummies. In addition, the variable White Collar Family took the value of one if both mother and

father have white collar jobs such as managers, engineers and office workers. Families for

which White Collar Family is zero include at least one parent with a blue collar job (such as

laborer, technician) or an agricultural job. The results presented in column (1) of Table 8

indicate that mothers who delivered their baby in high pollution cities are more likely to be

working, older, married and slightly more educated. Also, those mothers are delivering their first

infant. Father characteristics are unrelated to the probability of the child being born in a high

pollution city. In column (2) of Table 8, the coefficient of White Collar Family is positive

indicating that infants whose parents have white collar jobs are more likely to be born in more

polluted cities. Thus, the results of Table 8 support the hypothesis that parents with potentially

higher incomes select into more polluted cities. To the extent that such families are more

efficient in the production of infant health, the negative impact of pollution on infant health

could be underestimated. In this case, our baseline result presented in Tables 2-4 represent an

underestimate of the effect of PM10 on infant health.

        To investigate this issue, we augmented the regression depicted in equation (1) with two

variables that are shown to be related to air pollution in the city at the time of the birth (Table 8)

as well as potentially correlated with productive/allocative efficiency of the family. The first

variable is White Collar Family as described earlier. We also added the housing price index of

the city (Housing Price Index) in which the family resides. Higher housing prices may reflect

more favorable city characteristics including better health care services. 21 The results are




21
  We include 9 month lagged Housing Price Index (HPI) to capture city amenities at the time of conception. Using
contemporaneous HPI does not change the results.

                                                      23
reported in Panel A of Table 9. 22 As expected, Housing Price Index is positively correlated with

infant health. Similarly infants born to white collar families have better health at birth. The

coefficients of PM10, Advisories, Warnings and Yellow Dust Events do not change in any

significant way when White Collar Family and Housing Price Index are not controlled for in the

regressions (Panel B of Table 9).




VII. The Willingness to Pay and the Cost of Avoidance Behavior

                                                                                                                 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
           Conditional on avoidance, the impact of a 10% increase in PM10 on birth weight (𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕10 )

is 4.3 grams (using the coefficient of -0.8 in column 1 of Table 2). This represents a 0.13%

decrease from the baseline average of 3,257 gr. Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2007) report that

a one-percent increase in an infant’s birth weight generates an increase in future earnings by

about 0.13%. An average full time Korean worker’s annual earning was about $28,000 in

2010. 23 Assuming the average newborn will earn as much as the average worker, and

considering that a typical Korean starts working at age 25 and retires at age 60 (the official

retirement age in Korea), and using a discount rate of six percent, the present value of the

benefit generated by a 10% decline in PM10 is about $20. This is the estimated value of the

Willingness to Pay (WTP), which is depicted by equation (4). In 2010, 470,000 babies were

born in Korea. Thus, the full cost of a 10% increase in PM10 for one cohort of Koreans is $9.5

million.

     Sample size is smaller in these regressions since we lose observations due to lack of HPI data in some cities.

           The estimated coefficient of PM10 reported in column (1) of Table 4 corresponds to

  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑10). This is because the models reported in Table 4 do not control for pollution alerts which

shift the demand for avoidance. In this specification, a 10% increase in PM10 generates a

reduction in birth weight by 0.03%; and using the same B as above, this produces a cost of $2

million for one cohort of Korean babies. Using Equation (5), this implies that the cost of

avoidance is $7.5 million (in 2010 dollars). We should note that the benefit value used in this

exercise pertains to increased future earnings of the infant, and it does not include any other

elements such as health-related expenditures. For example, to the extent that poor health at birth

has an impact on chronic health conditions in adulthood, the benefits should be adjusted

upwards. Thus, the magnitudes we report should be considered as lower bounds.




VIII. Summary and Conclusion

           Previous research has shown that infant health, particularly weight at birth, is an

important predictor of future well-being of individuals, including earnings. An important

determinant of birth weight is prenatal exposure to pollution. A complicating issue in the

investigation of the impact of environmental pollution to infant health is the difficulty in finding

exogenous exposure to pollution. Individuals and families who are likely to live in less polluted

areas may have better health outcomes because of particular attributes of these families,

unrelated to pollution. Such endogenous geographical selection, or endogenous timing of a

pregnancy would confound the estimated impact of pollution on infant health. Second, as policy

makers increasingly emphasize the relevance of pollution warnings and air quality alerts as a

potential tool to modify exposure of individuals through avoidance behavior, it is essential to

determine the effectiveness of such alerts. This is important not only because the failure to

                                                    25
account for avoidance behavior would provide an underestimate of the biological impact of

pollution on health, but also because of the significance of the welfare loss associated with such

avoidance behavior.

       In this paper we investigate the impact of air pollution on infant health using information

on more than one and a half million live births in the Republic of Korea. The novelty of our

identification strategy is the ability to measure the exposure of pregnant women to pollution

generated by a natural phenomenon: the yellow dust. Winds carry particles of dust and sand

from the arid lands of Northern China and the deserts of Mongolia to the Korean peninsula.

These particles of dust and sand settle in Korea and they elevate the ambient air pollution,

measured by PM10 concentration. Although there is a seasonal pattern of this phenomenon,

there is significant variation in its timing, strength and location from year to year. Thus,

exposure to the intensity of air pollution exhibits substantial randomness and unpredictability.

We also show that Korean women do not time their pregnancy according to expected yellow dust

exposure, and that educated women’s pregnancy timing is not different than those who are less-

educated.

       We measure air pollution in each city by calculating the PM10 level, using hourly

readings of all monitoring stations in that city, and creating a city-level daily average PM10.

Using these daily air pollution data and making use of the gestation weeks reported on birth

certificates, we measure the extent of exposure to pollution of each pregnancy.

       An important contribution of the paper is the ability to account for avoidance behavior.

We utilize pollution advisories, pollution warnings as well as alerts on yellow dust events that

are issued by Korean authorities at the local level. We obtain estimates of the biological impact

of pollution on infant health, and the improvement in infant health generated by pollution

                                                 26
avoidance. Our paper is the first one to investigate the effectiveness of pollution alerts on birth

outcomes.

       The results show that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy has a significant

negative impact on birth weight, gestation weeks of the baby, and the propensity of the baby

being low weight. Public notifications about air quality have a separate statistically significant

and positive effect on infant health. In complementary analysis we show that the same public

notifications significantly reduce attendance to professional soccer games, supporting the

premise that individuals avoid being outdoors when pollution alerts are issued.

       We find white collar families and more educated and older mothers are more likely to

give birth in high-pollution cities. These family attributes and the housing price index of the city

in which the birth took place are correlated with birth outcomes. Adjusting for these factors,

however, does not impact the results.

       Our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of pollution alert systems in promoting

public health. They also underline the importance of taking into account individuals’ avoidance

behavior when estimating the impact of air quality on birth outcomes. We show that the

estimated impact of air pollution on infant health is reduced by half when the preventive effect of

public health warnings is not accounted for. Using future earnings as the only component of the

benefit of pollution reduction, our estimates imply that willingness to pay, associated with a 10%

decline in the level of PM10, is $9.5 million (in 2010 dollars) for one cohort of babies, and the

corresponding cost of avoidance is $7.5 million. To the extent that poor health at birth has an

impact on health conditions later in life, the magnitudes we report should be considered as lower

bounds.

The outcome variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if the baby is born in a city where the average PM10
level is greater than the median. Regressions also include month and year of conception dummies. High Family
Income is equal to one if both parents of the infant have white collar jobs such as managers, engineers and office
workers, and it is equal to zero if at least one parent has a blue collar job such as laborer or technician or an
agricultural job. Standard errors clustered at the city level are presented in parentheses. *, ** and *** indicate
significance at 10%, 5% and 1%, respectively.

    Notes: The Housing Price Index pertains to the city of infant’s birth, 9 months before the infant’s birth date. White
    Collar Family is equal to one if both parents of the infant have white collar jobs such as managers, engineers and
    office workers, and it is equal to zero if at least one parent has a blue collar job such as laborer or technician or an
    agricultural job. Regressions in Panel A include Housing Price Index, and White Collar Family in addition to the
    control variables as in Table 2. Regressions in Panel B include all control variables except for Housing price Index
    and White Collar Family. The coefficients of the full set of control variables are listed in Appendix Table 2.
