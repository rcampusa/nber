                                          ABSTRACT

Throughout the 21st century, population aging in the United States will lead to increases in the
number of elderly people requiring some form of living assistance which, as some argue, is to be
seen as a burden on society, straining old-age insurance systems and requiring younger agents to
devote an increasing fraction of their time toward caring for infirm elders. Given this concern, it
is natural to ask how aggregate GDP growth is affected by such a phenomenon. We develop an
overlapping generations model where young agents face idiosyncratic risk of contracting an old-
age disease, like for example Alzheimer's or dementia, which adversely affects their ability to
fully enjoy consumption. Young agents care about their infirm elders and can choose to
supplement elder welfare by spending time taking care of them. Through this channel, aggregate
GDP growth endogenously depends on young agents' degree of altruism. We calibrate the model
and show that projected population aging will lead to future reductions in output of 17% by 2056
and 39% by 2096 relative to an economy with a constant population distribution. Curing diseases
like Alzheimer's and dementia can lead to a compounded output increase of 5.4%while improving
welfare for all agents.

1     Introduction

For the United States and other developed countries, population aging will increase the
absolute number of individuals requiring some form of elder care.1 Microeconomic evi-
dence suggests that caring for infirm older adults requires substantial resources, both in
terms of market-traded services and the off-market time of family members. As an ex-
ample, the Alzheimer’s Association estimates that caring for individuals diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s and dementia is almost triple the cost of caring for non-diagnosed individ-
uals. While approximately 70% of these costs of care are covered by state and federal
social insurance programs, Hurd et al. (2013) estimates that the time-value of informal
care provided by family members in 2011 amounted to between $50 billion and $106
billion. Recent empirical evidence suggests that many working-age adults spend sub-
stantial shares of their available time providing informal care for sick and diseased elders
with the average adult who cares for another infirm adult spending 5.18 hours per week
doing so. Adults who provide informal care work 1.22 hours per week less and enjoy
3.96 hours less leisure time.2 The National Institutes of Health, the World Health Or-
ganization, and others have warned that the costs of providing assisted-living care for
older adults could balloon as the population ages, suggesting that aggregate economic
outcomes will be adversely affected by this phenomenon.3 We show that the ballooning
number of elderly people requiring living assistance will have a modest impact on ag-
gregate economic growth independent of the substantial impacts imposed by aging itself.
We find that reducing incidence of high cost-of-care old-age diseases can improve welfare
for both diseased and healthy agents in a general equilibrium environment.
    1 We use the terms “elder care,” “informal care,” and “assisted-living care” synonymously to refer to any

kind of assistance received by diseased elderly individuals to perform day-to-day life functions.

   Our findings also confirm previous studies that showed population aging in general
has a large, negative impact on aggregate output growth rates. In our baseline calculation,
holding constant the risk rate of acquiring a debilitating, welfare-reducing disease, we
project average annual U.S. GDP growth to be 2.2% over the period 2016-2056 and 2.1%
over the period 2016-2096. Eliminating the risk of needing long-term assisted-living care
marginally increases projected future average annual growth rates for the United States
economy over the period 2016-2056 by 10 basis points relative to the baseline. As in
Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995) and Prescott (2004) social insurance programs in a
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) structure crowd out investment, reducing long-run growth rates
relative to a tax-free environment. In the presence of intergenerational transfers of off-
market time from young to old, lifetime welfare increases when social insurance tax rates
fall as savings and investment increase. Young agents expect to enjoy being cared for
by their offspring when old and plan for this spillover effect when choosing savings.
This is because endogenous time transfers from young to old of informal care can help
offset the adverse welfare implications of incomplete markets for insurance against old-
age welfare shocks. Yet, while reducing social insurance taxes may increase expected
lifetime utility, a reduction is not necessarily Pareto improving if the working-age share
of adults is low. This is because old agents afflicted with a welfare-reducing disease are
made worse off as taxes fall and the number of workers is small enough. In various
counterfactual simulations we explore the implications of these trends under different
population growth rates and different adverse shock probabilities.
   The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the population trends and
cost estimates associated with the prevalence of high cost-of-care old-age diseases, while
also summarizing available data on the allocation of time to care for infirm elders. In
Section 3 we outline an OLG model that captures the features discussed in Section 2. In
Section 4, we calibrate this model to match observed data points. In Section 5 we simulate
counterfactuals to understand how population changes affect long-run economic trends.

2     Background & Discussion

The primary motivation for our undertaking is to understand how population aging af-
fects aggregate economic outcomes when members face ex-post idiosyncratic risk to old-
age welfare. While the effects of population aging have been discussed in many contexts,
few studies have analyzed general equilibrium outcomes when young people save to in-
sure against idiosyncratic risk that directly impacts old-age consumption utility.4 The
closest study that comes to mind is that of Hall and Jones (2007) who model health risk
as endogenously affecting survival rates, along with a health status component in util-
ity.5 To the best of our knowledge nobody has attempted to place idiosyncratic endoge-
nous health risk into a model where young agents provide informal hospice care to ail-
ing loved ones. Our undertaking thus contextualizes diseases like dementia, including
Alzheimer’s, and other idiosyncratic old-age welfare shocks within an economic frame-
work that features long-term informal, assisted-living care.
    There have been no studies, to our knowledge, that estimate the impacts of providing
informal care off-market on general equilibrium economic outcomes. This is important
because an aging population will likely lead to higher levels of informal care being pro-
vided by young people to old people.6 Several studies have examined how provisions of
informal care impact individual labor force participation and earnings (Muurinen 1986;
Carmichael, Charles, and Hulme; Leigh 2010; Van Houtven, Coe, and Skira 2013). In-
formal caregivers who also participate in the formal labor force work on average 3 to
10 hours less per week than their non-caregiving peers (Van Houtven, Coe, and Skira
    4 We are aware of French and Jones (2011), DeNardi, French, and Jones (2010), Edwards (2008), and
Palumbo (1999) who look at financial planning decisions within retirement in a partial equilibrium context.
   5 An unpublished study by Azomahou, Diene, and Soete (2009) models health risk as a shock to a health

capital stock, as opposed to a direct change in the utility function, which is our approach.
   6 For our purposes, “informal care” encompasses all aspects of care which take place off market. “Formal

care” will be used to refer to care paid for on the marketplace. These definitions are consistent with those


                                                     3
2013). Providing informal care can thus lead to considerable earnings losses (Muuri-
nen 1986; Van Houtven, Coe, and Skira 2013). Recent work suggests that substitution
rates between formal nursing home care and informal in-home care in the United States
depend on individual states’ complex Medicaid reimbursement structures (Mommaerts
2016, 2017). Indeed, paid long-term care and unpaid in-home care are imperfect substi-
tutes (Mommaerts 2017). We conjecture that this imperfection is due to trade-offs faced
by younger family members who willingly provide informal care to elders. Since provid-
ing off-market care requires a time investment, younger family members must weigh the
altruistic benefits they receive from caring for older loved ones against the loss in lifetime
permanent income due to working less.
    Until recently there have been few aggregate data available on the rate at which infor-
mal elder care is supplied. In 2011 the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) began asking
respondents about time spent engaging in informal care for infirm elders (Bureau of La-
bor Statistics 2017). These data are available for years 2011 thru 2016, but the number of
respondents who participated is small ( N = 1066). From 2003-2016 ATUS asked respon-
dents how much time they spent caring for or helping adults, not just the elderly, who
require assistance. Weighted averages of time use for adults age 25-65, where our pri-
mary target variable is “adult care”, are presented in Table 1.78 Conditional on providing
informal care, individuals work less and have less leisure time.
    At first glance, the time-use data suggest that the impact of increasing disease preva-
lence on the intensive margin of labor supply is significant in magnitude as the population
ages. For illustration, if providing adult care is perfectly substitutable with working, then
for every 1000 people over the age of 65, 3.55 jobs for individuals under the age of 65
would cease to exist. Consider now the effects of such a change: working less results in
in Hurd et al. (2013) and Lepore, Ferrell, and Wiener (2017).
   7 We take the denominator in our weekly time-share calculations to be 112 hours, thus allowing individ-

uals 8 hours of non-allocatable personal time per day.
   8 We choose to use the total “adult care” data point rather than the “elder care” data point due to the

small sample size of the latter. Empirical tests show that the differences in weighted averages of both data
points are not significantly different from zero. More details are available upon request.

a reduction in permanent income, resulting in a reduction in investment, resulting in a
reduction in aggregate output and social insurance tax receipts. However, our results in
Section 5 show that young individuals adjust their time use in response to market con-
ditions, including the population distribution, mitigating the aggregate impacts of this
disease risk. In fact, changes in the population distribution alone appear to affect the la-
bor supply greatest along the extensive margin. In steady state simulations, we show that
young workers increase work time as the relative population of working-age adults to re-
tirees falls, but this increase on the intensive margin does not offset the negative impacts
on total labor supply due to a falling extensive margin.
   To understand more broadly how long-run declines in aggregate output are related
to population aging, in Figure 1 we plot the working-age population ratio (wapr), i.e.
the ratio of adults age 25-65 to adults age 65 and over, along with the HP-filtered trend
  9 See   Hodrick and Prescott (1997) for more information on the HP filter.

of year-on-year aggregate and per-worker GDP growth (gY and gY / Ny , respectively) for
the United States economy since 1950.9 When business cycles are removed, the long-
run decline in annual GDP growth appears remarkably correlated with the decline in the
working-age population ratio. A regression of ln gY,t on ln waprt reveals that the elasticity
of the filtered trend in output growth with respect to the working-age population ratio is
1.487, so that a 1% relative increase in workers leads to an approximate 14 basis point
increase in the growth rate. Falling wapr accounts for almost 57% of the decline in gY
since the 1950s. The magnitude of this correlation affirms some of the alarm bells sounded

recently in Cooley and Henriksen (2018).
     As a motivating example, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia impose substantial for-
mal costs on the United States’ social insurance system and informal costs on family mem-
bers tasked with caring for diseased individuals. Total cost estimates for caring for de-
mented elderly individuals range from $157 to $215 billion (2010 dollars) depending on
the method used to impute time value of informal care (Hurd et al. 2013). Within this
range, roughly $11 billion is covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, while
the remainder includes both out-of-pocket costs paid by afflicted individuals and their
families as well as the time value of unpaid, informal care provided by loved-ones (Hurd
et al. 2013). Estimates of total time devoted to informal care for demented persons are
not small in magnitude. The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that in 2010, 17 billion
hours of unpaid care were provided by loved ones to diseased elders, with over 80%
of this time burden born by family members. Further, over 90% of those afflicted with
Alzheimer’s or dementia receive some form of informal care on top of care provided by
professional hospice services. The spillover effects on working-age adults of shouldering
this burden represents an additional societal cost, the impacts of which have not been di-
rectly quantified in past studies. As the population ages and Alzheimer’s and dementia
prevalences increase, it is reasonable to expect that the quantity of informal care provided
by working-age adults to elderly adults will increase.



3      Model

Agents live a maximum of two periods, though they may die accidentally after their first
period of life.10 Each period, there exists a population of Nyt young households and
Not old households.11 There is only one type of young household and two types of old
    10 Younghouseholds cannot choose to die, nor can individuals, rather the household is thought to “dis-
appear,” in that all of its members have perished before becoming old.
  11 Since agents live only two periods, we use y and o subscripts to denote their ages.




                                                    7
households. Old households can be either diseased, dt = 1, or non-diseased, dt = 0.
For now, assume the population of young households grows at constant rate g N so that
Nyt / Ny,t−1 = (1 + g N ), and the probability that a young household in period t lives to be
an old household in period t + 1 is so,t+1 .12      13


    We model the old agents’ consumption process in terms of home production, taking
cues from Becker (1965). Young agents can subsidize the home production of diseased
old agents’ final consumption by supplying them care time h yt outside of formal mar-
kets. Diseased individuals thus receive flow utility from final consumption cot (dt = 1),
which is produced in the home by using inputs of this off-market care time they receive
from their children hot and market resources purchased xot (dt = 1).14 Meanwhile, their
healthy peers only use market resources xot (dt = 0) for production of final consump-
tion because they do not require additional off-market care time from their children. The
home production functions we employ for both diseased and non-diseased old are


                     cot xot (dt = 1), hot , dt = 1 = xot (1)1−σ hσot σ ∈ (0, 1)
                                                   
                                                                                                       (1)

                     cot xot (dt = 0), dt = 0 = xot (0)                                                (2)


In Equation (1), σ is the elasticity of final consumption with respect to informal care time
received. Note that both diseased and non-diseased individuals may purchase hospice
care or other health services on the formal market. Such a purchase would fall under
market consumption, xot (dt ). Any additional services received by diseased old that are
not accounted for on the formal market would fall under informal care-time received, hot .
    Old households have preferences over consumption that depend on health status dt .
The form of an old individuals’ utility function is chosen to satisfy several conditions.
First, we assume that individuals infected with a disease require more resources, both
  12 We will relax the constant growth, g N , assumption in some of our simulations.
  13 The “survival” probability is the probability a young household that enters the economy survives to be
an old household next period.
  14 We also refer to h as “hospice” care.

market and off-market, to care for than those who are not. It would be unreasonable to
assume that these individuals, by consuming more, are necessarily better off than their
                                                                    
non-diseased peers (after all, they are sick). Let uot cot (dt ), dt denote the flow utility
from final consumption for an old individual with disease status dt . This brings us to an
assumption about an old individual’s utility function.


Assumption 1. Suppose cot (1) = cot (0) = c, where c is any feasible level of final con-
sumption. Then uot (c, 1) < uot (c, 0). In words, for each level of final consumption, the
non-diseased agent always receives higher consumption utility than the diseased agent.


Assumption 1 ensures that it is always better to be non-diseased than diseased. We choose
a Stone-Geary flow utility function for diseased old which satisfies this assumption under
certain parameter restrictions:

                                                               
                           uot cot (1), dt = 1 = ln cot (1) − ν                          (3)
                                              
                           uot cot (0), dt = 0 = ln cot (0)                              (4)


The flow utility parameterizations in (3) and (4) lead to two basic lemmas.

Lemma 1. For all ν > 0, Assumption 1 holds.

Proof. See Appendix A                                                                     


Lemma 2. If 0 < ν < cot (1) − cot (0) then the ratio of the marginal utility of non-diseased
consumption to diseased consumption is such that MUot (0)/ MUot (1) > 1.

Proof. See Appendix A                                                                     


Lemma 1 is trivial. Lemma 2 says that for certain combinations of the subsistence param-
eter ν and consumption policies, non-diseased agents benefit more from additional final
consumption than diseased agents. In our calibration we find that the premise of Lemma


                                             9
2 holds, which is one indicator that in this economy resources are inefficiently allocated
in a steady state competitive equilibrium.
   Young households use market resources x yt and leisure time l yt to produce a final
consumption good c yt according to the home production function:


                                                 c yt = xγyt · lµyt                            (5)


Young households additionally supply off-market time h yt to care for their elders, but
since this does not affect the final production of their home-produced consumption good,
h yt does not enter into Equation (5). Rather, young households exhibit imperfect altruism
toward their sick elders, discounting the diseased old household’s utility at rate η. The

In addition to consuming and spending time caring for their parents, young agents sup-
ply both labor 1 − l yt − h yt and invest i yt in the market.15 Young agents earn a before-tax
wage rate wt and pay social insurance taxes on their income at rate τt .
   Old agents do not work but earn a gross return on their assets a yt at rate Rt and also
receive Social Security and Medicare transfer benefits from the government Tt (dt ) which
depend on disease status dt . Normalize the price of market purchases to 1 each period.
For old agents, net outlay must satisfy the budget constraint:

Old agents die with certainty at the end of their life and will choose to consume the
entirety of their available cash-on-hand. At the end of each period, young agents who

cording to

Since returns on investment are compounded at the beginning of the period, young agents
earn gross return on these assets Rt · b yt . Having fully-described the right-hand side of
a young agent’s budget constraint, their choices of market purchases x yt , asset-holdings,

Let ρt = Tt (1)/ Tt (0) be the ratio of diseased to non-diseased benefits. The government
balances Social Security and Medicare transfers and tax receipts:

   Young agents do not know whether they will survive to become old and if they do
whether they will face a disease that adversely impacts their welfare, but young agents
know ψt and how it evolves, just as they know the survival rate. Thus, they make their



                                                   11
investment choice both with the aim of smoothing consumption and imperfectly insuring
themselves against the adverse welfare effects of contracting some kind of disease such
as Alzheimer’s or dementia, for example. In this model, given young agents in period
t know the distribution of diseased agents in t + 1, expectations are perfectly rational.
Let β be the time discount factor. In competitive equilibrium, utility maximizing young
agents seek to smooth expected market consumption over the lifecycle according to the
expected intertemporal Euler equation:

Since the model contains only idiosyncratic uncertainty, Rt+1 is pre-determined by the
population distribution which is assumed known. Thus young agents choose invest-
ment by equating the marginal utility of present market purchases with the discounted
expected marginal utility of future consumption given by weighting diseased and non-
diseased marginal utilities by the distribution ψt+1 . The period t choice of labor supply
by young depends on the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure
and the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and off-market care time:

Each period aggregate capital in the economy is only affected by young agents’ choice of
investment from last period since surviving old agents consume their entire portfolio.

Finally, total factor productivity zt grows at constant net rate g z .


3.1    Competitive Equilibrium with Transfers

and survival from young to old, {ψt , so,t+1 }t≥0 , an initial population level Ny0 = 1, an
initial total factor productivity level z0 = (1 + g N )α , and an initial young asset level a y0 ,
a competitive equilibrium with transfers consists of:

 ii. Sequences of prices { Rt , wt }t≥0 .

iii. Government policies { Tt (1), Tt (0), τt }t≥0 .

   such that

a. Young agents’ choices satisfy (9) and (12) thru (14).

b. Old agent consumption policies satisfy (7).


                                                       13
c. Asset return rates and wage rates are (15) and (16).

d. Formal and informal markets clear.

e. The government’s budget is balanced.

   The beauty of the two period assumption is that it allows us to consider only how
changes in the working age to retiree population ratio waprt affects equilibrium outcomes.
This is illustrated in Proposition 1. As a corollary to Proposition 1, we also demonstrate
that in this environment, aggregate output growth gYt depends only on waprt , not gener-
ational population levels.


Proposition 1. A competitive equilibrium depends only on waprt , not the population
levels.

Proof. Using (17) and the normalization z0 = (1 + g N )α , we can write the aggregate re-
source constraint

                                                                

                                1 + gN

Dividing both sides by Not , we can write


          waprt · x yt + ψt · xot (1) + (1 − ψt ) · xot (0) + waprt · a y,t+1
                                 waprt                                                              (20)

Note that consumption decisions depend on Rt and wt . Using (17) and (18), Rt and wt
do not depend on population levels except through household policies. In (8), under
constant g N , b y,t+1 can be written

                                                                       1

In (10) h yt can be written

                                          h yt =         hot                                (22)
                                                   waprt

The government budget constraint in (23) can be written

                                                  
               ψt · ρt · Tt (0) + (1 − ψt ) Tt (0) ≤ waprt · wt · τt · (1 − l yt − h yt )   (23)


Finally, young household policies must satisfy (12) thru (14). Population levels only enter
(14), which can be written

Corollary 1. Aggregate growth gY,t depends only on waprt , not population levels.

Proof. See Appendix A                                                                         


3.2   Steady State and Balanced Growth

To solve for a steady state, we assume a balanced growth path (BGP) and de-trend pro-
ductivity growth as in Krueger and Ludwig (2007). For now, suppose τt = τ is exoge-
nously fixed. Along a BGP the population of young agents and productivity grow at
constant exogenous rates, g N and g z . Proposition 2 demonstrates that if survival rates
and disease risk are constant, then wapr is constant across time.


Proposition 2. Assume the survival rate so,t+1 = so is constant and the diseased old
distribution ψt = ψ is stationary. Then along a BGP the working-age population ratio




                                                   15
wapr is constant and given by

                                                          1 + gN
                                                wapr =                                   (25)
                                                            so

Proof. See Appendix A                                                                      


     Clearly, the assumption that wapr is constant is unrealistic in practice, as we see that
wapr has been falling over time and is projected to continue falling. This fact begs the
question as to whether the U.S. economy in the 21st century is in fact on a balanced growth
trajectory or rather is exhibiting structural change due to forces such as population aging
and potentially associated idiosyncratic welfare risk affecting long-run growth rates. In
Section 5 we simulate the future path of aggregate output growth to understand the ex-
tent to which falling waprt , coupled with idiosyncratic welfare risk and young agents’
altruism, together impact aggregate growth.



4      Calibration

For our calibration we set the period length to 40 years and assume young agents enter
the economy at age 25 and turn old at age 65. Our calibration assumes the economy is
in steady state in 2016, thus taking the 2016 observed population distribution as the ini-
tial steady state distribution.16 We choose parameters to match a set of carefully selected
data moments from around 2016. Specifically, we calibrate to leisure, labor, and hospice
care average time shares from the 2003-2016 ATUS data, the personal savings rate from
the “PSAVERT” time series (BEA, 2016) which measures personal savings as a percentage
of disposable income, the ratio of diseased to non-diseased consumption computed from
estimates made by Hurd et al. (2013), the 2016 consumption and investment shares of

parts, while Table 3 presents the calibrated parameter values and their sources.
   The calibration requires a couple of assumptions for identification purposes. First, we
exogenously set the benefits ratio ρ using estimates by Hurd et al. (2013) and Mommaerts
(2016) to get ρ = 1.923.17 Thus, diseased agents receive almost double the benefits from
the government as non-diseased agents. To calibrate to a steady state assuming it has been
de-trended from a BGP, we only have to pick two of g N , so , and wapr, due to Equation
(25). We set g N to accommodate growth in the young population since 1976 and wapr
to equal the observed population ratio for workers to retirees in 2016. We exogenously
fix the parameters µ, γ, and η to reflect the observed ATUS time-use averages from 2003-
2016. The output elasticity α is chosen to match the average U.S. capital share since World
War II. The risk rate ψ is fixed based on estimates from Hurd et al. (2013). We calibrate
the subsistence parameter ν and intensity of hospice care parameter σ to match aggregate
data moments, including the ratio of diseased to non-diseased consumption xo (1)/ xo (0)
taken from estimates in Hurd et al. (2013).

5.0.1        Predicted U.S. Aggregate Output Growth

We want to understand how well the model predicts different aggregate growth rates
when the population is evolving in ways inconsistent with balanced growth. We com-
pute a transition path from starting steady states with wapr equivalent to those observed
in 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990, simulating toward a terminal steady state with wapr =
3.475 as observed in 2016. We assume period 0 of the model is in one of the old wapr, and
then the economy suddenly changes to wapr = 3.475, allowing 200 simulated periods
to facilitate convergence to the new steady state.18 For each simulation, we set the ini-
tial steady state’s τ to the actual employee and employer combined Social Security and
Medicare tax rate for the given year.19 Productivity growth is set to accommodate the
observed average annual private multi-factor (MFP) productivity growth rates for the

tions model see the endogenous grid point method of Carroll (2006) and Appendix B of Krueger and Lud-
wig (2007).
   19 The tax rates are as follows: 3% (1950), 6% (1960), 9.6% (1970), 12.26% (1980), 15.3% (1990 and there-

after).

periods 1950-2016, 1960-2016, 1970-2016, 1980-2016, and 1990-2016.20 We compare both
predicted productivity re-trended aggregate output growth and per-worker re-trended
output growth from the first period after the sudden change in working age population
ratio to that observed in the data. These values are presented in Table 4 under columns
labeled “Model gY ” and “Model gY / Ny ,” where the former describes aggregate growth
and the latter growth per working-age adult. Model predictions slightly undershoot ag-
gregate growth rates for all periods, though the aggregate rates are only off by 20 basis
points at most.
    We run two additional simulations adjusting g z to match observed gY and gY / Ny . Im-
plied productivity growth from these simulations is presented in columns labeled “Im-
plied g z ” and “Implied g z/ Ny ” in Table 4. In the data, g z/ Ny is negative since the 1960s
when the denominator we use to compute output per-worker is the entire working-age
adult population. To reconcile per-worker growth, our model requires growth in produc-

tivity per-worker to exceed growth in aggregate productivity as can be seen by comparing
the “Implied” column of the bottom half of Table 4 to the top half. The model thus ap-
pears to do a decent job of matching aggregate output growth but not output per-worker.
This is due to the fact that we assume a 40-year transition period regardless of the start-
ing wapr being associated with the year 1950 or 1990. Comparisons between aggregate
numbers are not biased by this fact because the aggregate growth rate does not depend
on a scaling with the growth rate of newborns entering the economy, g N , which must be
computed to accommodate the transition from the initial steady state wapr to the termi-
nal one. If we allow for the possibility that perhaps measurements of MFP in the NIPA
tables themselves are biased, failing to account for endogeneity due to g z ’s dependence
on the population distribution, then U.S. productivity growth over the second half of the
twentieth century has perhaps been overstated, or at the least misunderstood. At first
consideration, it is hard to ignore the positive correlation between measured productivity
per-worker and wapr. One can think of a number of possible ways in which wapr may
affect productivity: younger workers have more energy and work more in order to build
up a nest egg from scratch, for example. In the context of our formulation, a relatively
large population of retirees could negatively weigh on aggregate productivity by divert-
ing working-age adults’ attention from their jobs because they provide informal care. If
this explanation were true, zt would be an endogenous function of waprt , and g z,t would
vary in time, falling along with waprt . We do not take a stance on the mechanism by
which zt may partially depend endogenously on waprt . Rather, the decomposition in Ta-
ble 4 illustrates what the waprt -independent component of g z,t would need to be in order
to match observed output growth under our parameterization. In general, the results of
these simulations show that the given model can accurately predict aggregate growth,
suggesting researchers should take our future growth estimates presented in Section 5.1
seriously, affirming the general spirit of the results in Cooley and Henriksen (2018).

5.1    Future Growth Under Different Counterfactual Regimes

One goal of this project is to understand how the welfare risk of contracting a debilitat-
ing old-age disease may affect future aggregate output growth while the population is
aging. As a baseline, we follow techniques described in Krueger and Ludwig (2007) to
simulate a transition path between the calibrated 2016 steady state and a far-off future
steady state assuming the population converges after 200 periods to the United Nations
predicted, 2096 median-variant population distribution.21 We then examine projected
growth rates and lifetime welfare under the following policy reforms. First, we consider
how the economy evolves when the “dynamically ignorant” government suddenly sets
τ = 0 one period into the future and households are surprised by this change, failing
to anticipate it.22 Second, we consider a policy reform where the government decides
to fully reimburse working-age adults for their off-market time at the before-tax market
wage.23 Finally, we simulate a dynamic transition path under unexpected changes to the
disease risk rate. We consider growth under a cure by 2056 and a cure by 2096, as well as
growth under 10%, 20%, 50%, and 100% increases in cross-sectional risk by 2096.24 These
changes are all based on the value of ψ = 0.14 used in calibration, taken from estimates
of dementia risk for 70 year olds in Hurd et al. (2013). For computational reasons, we
assume changes are permanent after 2096 so the economy has some steady state outcome
to which to converge.
  21 SeeUnited Nations: Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2017.
  22 Here,we consider the 2016 wapr = 3.475 as “present.”
  23 Currently, some U.S. state Medicaid programs reimburse family members for care time they provide

to Medicaid recipients, though the rates of reimbursement and restrictions vary substantially across states.
Current data on state-level Medicaid policies does not appear to be readily available in a central source.
   Under this reform, the young agent’s budget constraint is:

                            x yt + a y,t+1 ≤ Rt · b yt + wt (1 − τt )(1 − l yt − h yt ) + wt · h yt             (26)

while the government faces budget constraint:

  24 For   a “cure” we consider a situation where ψ drops to 0.0001 to ensure Inada conditions hold.

   Table 5 presents simulated average annual aggregate output growth rates (gY ). For
the baseline simulations holding τ and ρ at their observed and calibrated 2016 values, we
compare the dynamic transition path of an economy aging according to U.N. projections.
Our regime-change counterfactuals operate as follows. First, we suppose that the econ-
omy is in the initial 2016 steady state, then the regime change occurs suddenly. For all of
these changes, in period t = 2 right after the 2016 steady state, the economy has changed
unexpectedly, but agents have not updated their dynamic plans. We thus simulate the
economy for 200 periods to allow for it to converge to the new steady state, which gener-
ally happens after only 7-10 model periods anyway. All of our counterfactual simulations
occur off a BGP, where the population distribution is evolving exogenously according to
U.N. estimates.
   From these simulations it is apparent that an aging population substantially reduces
growth relative to a BGP where wapr remains constant. In fact this reduction is on the
order of 50 basis points annually, leading to compounded aggregate output losses of 17%



                                            22
by 2056 and 39% by 2096 relative to an economy where wapr held constant at 2016 levels.
Though perhaps politically unrealistic, it is illustrative that in this economy setting τ = 0
can lead to both Pareto improvements along the dynamic transition path and increases
in compounded aggregate output relative to the baseline with population transition —
5% higher by 2056 and 17% higher by 2096. Figure 2 presents the fully compounded pre-
dicted population baseline growth relative to counterfactual growth projections, includ-
ing the BGP. Implementing a before-tax reimbursement policy while holding τ = 0.153
fixed yields Pareto improvements but adversely affects compounded growth relative to
the population transition baseline in the first period — output is 0.2% lower by 2056 —
though growth improves slightly by the end of the century — 1.7% higher by 2096. The
predicted baseline falls the most relative to BGP, then the tax-free environment, then fi-
nally the full cure. Neither stabilizing the population distribution to achieve a BGP nor
eliminating Social Security and Medicare are realistically feasible, yet scientists are work-
ing to find cures for dementia-like diseases. In the event a cure is found, the model pre-
dicts compounded U.S. total output will be 5.4% higher by 2096 and 6.6% higher by 2136
relative to the baseline where ψ = 0.14.
   One takeaway we wish to emphasize is that achieving a full cure — ψ = 0.0001 by
2056 — would have a small impact on growth, increasing gY by only about 10 basis points.
Long-run growth rates and welfare are decreasing in ψ. The most striking thing about our
simulations under different ψ is that changing the risk rate hardly matters for long-run
growth prospects. Rather, the population distribution, regardless of the risk rate, has
the largest effect on long-run growth, which can be seen by comparing any of the sim-
ulations that account for population transitions with the BGP. All counterfactuals result
in anywhere from 60 to 90 basis point relative declines in the average annual growth
rate by 2136, and 40 to 70 basis point relative declines by 2096. While this result should
mitigate concerns that the burdens of old-age care alone will tamp down growth, we con-
firm recent findings in Cooley and Henriksen (2018) suggesting a long-run “demographic

deficit” may be coming to the United States economy.
   Yet reducing disease risk, despite having minimal impact on growth, is still welfare
improving. Figure 3 compares welfare paths for different possible risk rates, relative to a
baseline economy where ψ = 0.14, as estimated by Hurd et al. (2013). Notice that wel-
fare improves for all agents as ψ → 0, though risk reduction has the most pronounced
effect on diseased agents’ welfare, leading to a greater than 6% lifetime gain relative to
the baseline. Next, young agents enjoy higher expected lifetime utility, but are also hit
hardest relative to the baseline when ψ increases. This is because children shoulder the
burden of increased numbers of diseased old through the altruism mechanism. Mean-
while, Figure 4 compares welfare paths over the 21st century relative to the population
transition baseline for the tax-free environment and an economy with a reimbursement

scheme. Lifetime welfare of all agents over the 21st century is improved from baseline
under the reimbursement scheme, though again the most notable improvement is for dis-
eased agents. This finding is particularly promising since growth is relatively unaffected
by such a scheme, yet all agents are better off. Further, reimbursement schemes are al-
ready implemented in certain states. Our results suggest that more adoption of these
policies will lead to welfare improvements across the board.

5.2        Steady State Comparative Statics

Using the calibrated parameters from Table 3 we simulate steady state outcomes under
different working-age population ratios and compare them to an economy without a so-
cial insurance system. We present selected policies and aggregate outcomes in Figure 5.
The model predicts that both labor supply and total time spent providing informal care
is higher when the social safety net is eliminated. Young people sacrifice leisure time for
work because wages are higher and pick up the slack caring for their elders at all levels
of wapr. All values are monotonic in wapr, though the signs of some of the relationships
may be surprising. Not surprisingly, labor and output are increasing in wapr, but work
hours are increasing because wages are decreasing: holding productivity fixed, wages
are bid down as the number of workers increases. Steady state savings rates increase in
wapr as a response to higher interest rates, driven up by increases in the labor supply
forcing firms to acquire more capital to efficiently utilize the skills of increasing numbers
of workers. U.S. personal savings rates have generally fallen since the 1950’s, from 11.3%
in January 1959 when wapr was at 5.176 to 6.3% in December 2016 with a wapr of 3.475,
confirming the validity of the sign of the relationship we observe here.
    For each of the τ = 0 and τ = 0.153 case, we simulate expected lifetime utility for
a young agent who has not yet realized his old-age disease status as well as realized
lifetime utility for both diseased d = 1 and non-diseased d = 0 old agents.25 Figure 6
presents these welfare values as functions of wapr. This exercise demonstrates that for
small enough wapr, higher social insurance taxes can lead to higher steady state lifetime
welfare for diseased agents, though not non-diseased agents. In steady state, reducing
  25 LetEu(d) be expected lifetime steady state utility, u(d = 1) be realized lifetime utility for a diseased
agent, and u(d = 0) be realized lifetime utility for a non-diseased agent. These values are as follows:
                                                                             
                              Eu(d) = u y + β · ψ · uo (1) + (1 − ψ) · uo (0)                             (28)
                               u(d = 1) = u y + uo (1)                                                    (29)
                               u(d = 0) = u y + uo (0)                                                    (30)

taxes from the 2016 value of τ = 0.153 is Pareto improving as long as wapr > 2.434.
Why is this? Consider informal care time supplied by young h yt . Figure 5 shows that
time supplied per-individual is decreasing in wapr though aggregate time supplied is
increasing in wapr. At a certain threshold, the extensive margin — the total number of
young people — dominates the intensive margin — the time supplied by each young
person, leading to adverse welfare effects on diseased old.




Figure 5: Here we plot steady state outcomes as a function of wapr and different tax rates. Solid
lines represent economic variables when the government chooses τ = 0, and dotted lines repre-
sent variables under τ = 0.153, the 2016 Social Security and Medicare tax rate.


   Notice also that diseased old utility falls faster than non-diseased utility as wapr de-
creases. This is because the decline in the extensive margin drives down total off-market
time supplied by young agents as wapr falls, even though every individual young agent
is supplying more informal care time on the intensive margin. Meanwhile, as wapr in-
creases, diseased lifetime utility increases faster than non-diseased lifetime utility as the
total supply of informal care time increases, allowing diseased agents to supplement their
market consumption with increasing amounts of care from their children. Since these are
steady state comparisons only, they should be interpreted with caution as such analyses
fail to account for productivity gains. We present them to illustrate the co-dependence of

                                               27
lifetime welfare on both wapr and τ.




Figure 6: For all wapr ≤ 2.434 — in the pink box to the left of the dashed vertical line — diseased
agents are worse off with τ = 0 than under the baseline 2016 tax rate.




6    Conclusion

Including both idiosyncratic health risk and a motive for young people to engage in infor-
mal care of their elders allows the standard, two-period overlapping generations model
with production and social insurance taxes to broadly describe the observed decline in
aggregate output growth since the 1950s. The model we present qualitatively describes
and matches the observed tradeoffs from the ATUS data that agents face when making
a decision to provide time on the informal market. These results are important because
they should encourage researchers to take seriously the model’s predictions about future
economic outcomes in an environment with a rapidly aging population. Due to incom-


                                                28
plete markets, the rate at which the population ages can adversely impact lifetime welfare
of diseased agents when not enough young agents are alive to supply informal care. In
counterfactual simulations, reimbursement of informal care time and cures for dementia-
like diseases improve both growth and welfare over the U.N.’s medium-variant projected
population distribution throughout the 21st century. These results should encourage pol-
icy makers to consider how the age-distribution and idiosyncratic risk affect economic
aggregates when proposing reforms to address stagnating growth. Aging appears to
have broad impacts on long-run GDP growth, regardless of old-age disease risk. Fur-
ther, finding cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia can lead to modest growth
improvements, but more importantly such cures are Pareto improving.

A     Proofs

Lemma 1. For all ν > 0, Assumption 1 holds.

Proof. This proof is trivial, but requires the assumption that c > ν so that Inada conditions
are satisfied and c is thus feasible. Under that assumption, clearly ln(c − ν ) < ln c.                


Lemma 2. If 0 < ν < cot (1) − cot (0) then the ratio of the marginal utility of non-diseased
consumption to diseased consumption is such that MUot (0)/ MUot (1) > 1.

Proof. Assume Inada conditions are satisfied such that cot (1) > ν and cot (0) > 0. Given
Lemma 1, ν > 0. Note that:

                                                     1
                                    MUot (1) =                                                      (A.1)
                                               cot (1) − ν
                                                  1
                                    MUot (0) =                                                      (A.2)
                                               cot (0)

Rearranging the inequality in the premise we get


                                 cot (0) − ν < cot (0) < cot (1) − ν                                (A.3)

In Proposition 1 we showed that household policies depend only on waprt . Thus gY,t

                                                    so

Proof. The population of young agents entering the economy in period t is


                                      Nyt = (1 + g N ) Ny,t−1                              (A.8)


The population of old agents evolves according to

Substituting for Ny,t−1 we can write:

                                              =                                           (A.10)

B       Calibration

B.0.1    Setting ρ — Ratio of Diseased to Non-Diseased Benefits

We calibrate ρ by using estimates from Hurd et al. (2013) and Mommaerts (2016). Mom-
maerts (2016) uses RAND Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to estimate median
permanent income ($14, 157 in 2010 dollars) of sample respondents over age 65 from
1998-2010. We then use the Social Security Administration’s rule of thumb permanent
income replacement rate (0.4) to compute the implied Social Security benefits for the me-
dian retiree:


                                       14, 157 · 0.4 = 5, 662.80                                 (B.1)


    Using HRS data, Hurd et al. (2013) estimates that average total annual Medicare spend-
ing for demented individuals is $5, 226. To compute a baseline for total benefits received
by diseased agents we add $5, 226 to Equation (B.1) to get $10, 888.80. The steady state
ratio of diseased to non-diseased benefits is:

                                            10, 888.80
                                       ρ=              = 1.923                                   (B.2)
                                            5, 662.80


B.0.2    Steady State Equations

The de-trended steady state conditions are below. In order they are as follows (B.3) thru
(B.6) comprise the young agent’s intertemporal consumption condition, intratemporal
consumption/leisure condition, intratemporal leisure/hospice care condition, and bud-
