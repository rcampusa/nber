                                               ABSTRACT

The behavioral economic model presented in this paper argues that the effect of advertising and price
differ by past consumption levels. The model predicts that advertising is more effective in reducing
consumption at high past consumption levels but less effective at low past consumption levels. Conversely,
the model predicts that higher prices are effective in reducing consumption at low past consumption
levels but less effective at high past consumption levels. Unlike the models used in most prior studies,
this model predicts that the effects of policy on average consumption and on the upper end of the distribution
are different.

Both FMM and Quantile models were estimated. The results from these regressions show that heavy
drinkers are more responsive to advertising and less responsive to price than are moderate drinkers.
The empirical evidence also supports the assumption that education is a proxy for self-regulation. The
key conclusions are that restrictions on advertising are targeted at heavy drinkers and are an underutilized
alcohol control policy. Higher excise taxes on alcohol reduce consumption by moderate drinkers and
are of less importance in reducing heavy consumption.

1. Introduction

       This paper presents a new empirical study of the effects of alcohol cues and price on

alcohol consumption. The specific alcohol cues which are examined are those provided by

alcohol advertising on TV and alcohol references included in TV programming. A novel feature

of this study is that the empirical work is guided by a blend of behavioral economic and

neoclassical economic theory. The resulting theoretical model benefits from the insights of

behavioral economics while maintaining the empirical tractability of a conventional neoclassical

demand model. Behavioral economic theory argues for a dual agent approach to examine the

effects of advertising and price and neuroeconomic laboratory research provides evidence of a

biological basis for this approach. The theoretical model employs the analytically convenient

fiction of two separate underlying decision mechanisms but emphasizes a single decision

outcome. The key conclusions of the theory is that heavy drinkers are more responsive to cues

such as alcohol advertising and alcohol references in programming on TV and less responsive

to price than are moderate drinkers. If this is the case, then restrictions on cues are targeted at

heavy drinkers and are an important alcohol control policy. The theory also implies that, while

price may limit the consumption of moderate drinkers, price is of limited importance in reducing

heavy consumption. These assertions are tested with a large scale secondary data set.



       In the U.S., alcohol advertising on TV is substantial. The advertising- to-sales ratio for

alcohol is about 5 percent, while the typical industry advertising-to-sales ratio is about 2 to 3

percent. Data from Kantar Media show that alcohol advertising just on TV was about $1.1

billion in 2009. There has not been much change in the overall level of expenditures on alcohol

advertising on TV between 2002 and 2009. However, annual hours of alcohol advertising on

national TV increased by about 50 percent and local TV hours declined by about 20 percent.

Spirits advertising on TV has been a major growth area. According to Ad Age, 2011, for all

media, spirits and blended liquors had an advertising-to-sales ratio of 14. This large ratio comes

1
mainly from the use of TV. Under the terms which ended prohibition, spirits producers

voluntarily agreed to not use broadcast media for advertising. In 1996, the spirits industry

abandoned this voluntary agreement and placed ads on cable TV stations. At that time, the four

largest broadcasters ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC refused to run ads for spirits. However,

gradually, local stations affiliated with NBC and CBS have been accepting spirits ads placed

after 10 pm. Elliot (2009) reported that one alcohol ad shown in 15 major markets on CBS

affiliates reached 31 percent of all American households.



       Alcohol cues on TV also come from alcohol use and references in TV programming and

are ubiquitous. Christensen, Henriksen and Roberts (2000) found that on prime-time TV, 71%

of all programming depicted alcohol use and 77% contained references to alcohol. Russell and

Russell (2009) studied a sample of 144 unique episodes from eighteen shows based on

Nielsen's top-rated prime-time television series on NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and WB including five

situation comedies, one cartoon, and twelve dramas. They found that all the shows contained

visual alcohol portrayals and verbal alcohol references.



       Alcohol prices vary across the country although there has been little change in prices

over time. Federal alcohol excise taxes have not changed since 1991. At the state level there

have been a number of small changes since 2002 amounting to only a few cents per gallon.

Data from the BLS shows that alcohol prices for at home consumption increased by about 33%

from 1999 to 2011. Since the overall CPI increased by about 30% during this time period there

has been little change in the real price of alcohol for at home consumption.



2. Prior Studies

       There are a growing number of studies in the economics literature and in the public

health literature on the effects of alcohol cues on alcohol consumption. However, few studies

2
provide any information on potentially differential effects by consumption level. A review of

economics studies by Gallet (2007) examined 132 studies of alcohol demand which included an

advertising measure. Gallet reports a mean value for the advertising elasticity of 0.03. He

compares this to a value for the price elasticity of -0.535 and concludes that advertising has only

a limited impact on alcohol consumption. However, the studies in the review do not distinguish

the effects of advertising on heavy drinkers from the effects of advertising on moderate drinkers.

Since most drinkers are in the moderate category, the failure to distinguish individuals by

consumption level may mask the effect of advertising on heavy drinkers.



       The public health literature provides a stronger consensus for a positive effect of alcohol

cues than the economics literature. Again, few of these public health studies look for

differences in the effect of advertising by consumption level. However, an experimental study

by Koordeman et al. (2011) found that alcohol commercials prior to a movie led to increased

consumption of alcohol, but only in heavy drinkers. Consistent with these results, McCusker

(2001) found that memories of positive drinking outcomes are more accessible for heavy

compared to moderate drinkers and Tapert et al. (2003) found that alcohol advertising leads to

distinct patterns of brain activation, causing craving responses and affecting consumption

decisions in heavy drinkers. Engels et al. (2009) tested experimentally whether portrayal of

alcohol images in movies and commercials on television promotes actual drinking. They had

young adult males watch a movie clip with two commercial breaks. The subjects were allowed

to drink non-alcohol and alcoholic beverages. These participants were randomly assigned to

one of four groups defined by increasing levels of exposure to alcohol portrayals. The

participants assigned to the conditions with most alcohol portrayals in either movies or

commercials consumed on average 1.5 glasses more than those in the condition with no alcohol

portrayals.



3
       There are a number of studies in the economics literature on the effect of alcohol price

on alcohol consumption. In contrast to studies on alcohol advertising, several studies of alcohol

price look for differential effects by drinking level. Prior studies which examined heavy drinking

find lower elasticities than those estimated for per capita drinking. A review by Wagenaar et al.

(2009) reports a mean alcohol price elasticity of -0.51 for all drinking and a mean price elasticity

of −0.28 for heavy drinking. Another review by Wagenaar, Tobler and Kromo (2010) of 50

studies examined the effects of alcohol price on various negative outcomes related to alcohol.

They report price elasticities for alcohol related mortality of -0.50, morbidity of -0.35 and lower

elasticities for alcohol related violence, traffic crashes, sexually transmitted diseases and crime.

These negative outcomes are probably more related to heavy drinking than to moderate

drinking. These results suggest that the effects of price on heavy drinking, while smaller than

the effects for moderate drinking, are not irrelevant.



       Two prior studies of alcohol price effects are of particular interest since they provide

guidance for the empirical strategy adopted in this paper. In estimating differential effects for

heavy drinkers and other drinkers a key empirical concern is endogenous selection. Ayyagari et

al. (2009) employ a finite mixture model (FMM) which bypasses selection on the dependent

variable and requires only specification of the number of distinct population subgroups.

Manning et al. (1995) employ a quantile approach which also bypasses selection on the

dependent variable and simply requires definition of the quantiles. Interestingly, the results in

both of these papers is consistent with the behavioral economic model presented in this paper.

Also, both papers argue that the failure to differentiate policy effects by consumption level

conceals important information.



       Ayyagari et al. (2009) investigates the price elasticity of demand for alcohol using Health

and Retirement Survey. They first estimate an overall price elasticity of -0.286 which is

4
somewhat lower than Wagenaar, Salois and Komro (2009) reported mean. Next, they estimate

a FMM with two components. The results for the first component show that a significant price

elasticity of -1.6. The first component included both drinkers and non-drinkers and comprises

75% of the sample. The average number of drinks per day in component one is 0.129. drinks

per day. In the second component price is not significant with an estimated elasticity of -0.035.

This component comprises 25% of the sample and the average number of drinks per day in

component two is 1.879 drinks per day. They conclude that there are two heterogeneous

groups in the population. Most individual are either non-drinkers or moderate drinkers with an

elastic demand for alcohol. However, a smaller group drinks more heavily and is unresponsive

to price.



        Manning et al. (1995) specifically examined the effect of the level of alcohol consumption

on the price elasticity. They use the National Health Interview Survey with a weighted average

of ACCRA beer, wine, and spirits prices and a two-part model which separates the dichotomous

drinking participation decision from the choice of quantity consumed given participation. The

price variable in the participation equation is significant while it is not in the consumption given

participation equation. They estimate an overall participation elasticity of -0.55. Next, they

estimate a quantile regression using deciles of the consumption distribution. The results show

that the moderate drinkers have the highest price elasticity which is -1.19. The price elasticity

declines as consumption increases from the median quantile. The price is insignificant in the

quantile which includes the heaviest drinkers while all other quantiles are significant.



2. Theory

        The theoretical model relies primarily on a theory of addiction and response to cues

based on neurological evidence presented in a paper by Bernheim and Rangel (2004). This

theory provides an advance in understanding how advertising affects alcohol consumption

5
decisions and provides guidance for the specific functional form of this relationship. There are

two key points in the theory. First, the theory argues that the role of advertising cues on alcohol

consumption is a consequence of the forecast of a hedonic effect from alcohol, rather than the

hedonic effect itself. Second, the theory argues that the forecast of a hedonic effect produced

by advertising cues is proportional to past consumption rather than the advertising cues

themselves.



       The theoretical model employed in this paper assumes an analytically convenient fiction

of two distinct neurological systems which act simultaneously to produce a single decision.

These neurological systems have been given different labels such as system 1 and system 2

(Frederick and Kahneman, 2002) but will be referred to in this paper as the Hedonic system and

the Rational system. The Hedonic system is a simple system for learning correlations between

current conditions, decisions, and short-term rewards. It does not involve higher reasoning and

is present in lower life forms as well as humans. The Hedonic system is efficient at learning

simple action-reward correlations, but it is inflexible and unsophisticated in the sense that it can

only learn about a limited range of near-term consequences. When decisions must be made

very quickly, the Hedonic system dominates behavior. The main advantage of the Hedonic

system is that it can produce rapid decisions with generally beneficial near-term outcomes

provided that the environment is stable. It cannot, however, anticipate sufficiently delayed

consequences, and when the environment changes, it cannot ignore irrelevant past experiences

nor adjust forecasts prior to acquiring further experience. The Rational system develops causal

models of the world and reasons out the implications of different choices. The Rational system

needs time and cognitive resources to reason and make a choice. The Rational system

addresses the shortcomings of the Hedonic system, but is comparatively slow. Self-regulation

is a process which refers to the Rational system’s ability to override the Hedonic system and is

related to the more familiar concept of time preference.

6
       There is an important distinction between non-addictive consumption goods and

addictive consumption goods in updating the Hedonic system. Individuals make consumption

choices based to some degree on past consumption experiences. When an individual

consumes a non-addictive good, there will be a post-consumption experience, which then

updates the Hedonic system. That is, there is learning from the post-consumption experience

and the predicted result of a future choice reflects this learning. However, an addictive

substance interferes with the normal operation of the Hedonic system with a direct chemical

effect on the process that leads the hedonic system to generate a choice. The consumption of

the addictive good affects the Hedonic system both through the post-consumption effect and the

direct chemical effect which distorts the learning process. The Hedonic system functions with

systematically skewed information which leads to mistakes in decision making. An individual

can try to compensate for this effect by exercising self-regulation, but cannot consciously correct

it. Individuals appear to achieve different balances between these mechanisms which may

result from differences in self-regulation and differences in the direct effect of alcohol on both

systems. This may be, in part, why some individuals become heavy drinkers while others drink

alcohol without excess.



       External cues associated with consumption can produce a forecast of the hedonic effect

which is separate from the actual hedonic effect. Alcohol advertising is one form of external

cue. Bernheim and Rangel (2004) report on a series of neuroscience experiments on cues and

the level of hedonic forecasts. Hedonic forecasting occurs as a result of activity in a certain part

of the brain and is distinct from the hedonic experience itself. In these experiments, when

subjects are presented with a cue followed by a reward, there is a corresponding level of neural

activity. However, as experience with the reward continues, this neural activity occurs in

response to the cue rather than the reward. When the reward is increased, but the cue remains

7
constant, the neural activity increases in proportion to the new level of reward. That is, the

hedonic forecast is proportional to past levels of consumption rather than proportional to the

level of the cue. Thus, in the case of alcohol consumption, the same cue will produce a greater

response in heavy drinkers than is produced in moderate drinkers.



       The theoretical model underlying the empirical work relies on the neurological processes

described above and on neoclassical economic theory. The model assumes that an individual

makes a choice regarding the consumption of alcohol and a non-addictive substance. The

consumption level chosen reflects a weighted average of consumption desired by the Hedonic

system and consumption desired by the Rational system. The weights are a function of cues,

past consumption and self-regulation. For clarity of exposition, consumption desired by the

Hedonic system is a function of only past consumption and consumption desired by the Rational

system is a function only of price. The theory can be represented by six relationships which are

assumed to be linear without intercepts.



       Equation (1) shows that actual consumption (C) is a weighted average of desired

consumption by both systems. W h is the weight given to consumption desired by the Hedonic

system (Ch) and (W r) is consumption desired by the Rational system (Cr).

(1) C = W hCh + W rCr

The second relationship shows that the weight given to consumption desired by the Hedonic

system is a function of Cues, past consumption (PC) and self-regulation (SR). Cues can be

provided by alcohol advertising and alcohol portrayals on TV.

(2) W h = γ1Cues + γ2PC + γ3SR.

Since the two weights sum to one.

(3) W r = (1 – W h) = 1 - γ1Cues - γ2PC - γ3SR.



8
Consumption desired by the Hedonic system is determined by past consumption where α1

represents a heuristic process.

(4) Ch= α1PC.

The Rational system reflects the optimization of a standard constrained utility function.

Consumption desired by the Rational system is determined by price (P).

(5) Cr = β1P.

Substituting equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) into equation (1) results in the following estimable

relationship:

(6) C = λ1*P + λ2 SR*P + λ3 Cues*P + λ4 PC*P + λ5Cues*PC + λ6SR*PC.

Equation (6) drops one squared term which would not be included in an empirical model due to

potential problems with colinearity. Since the theory assumes that β1 and γ3 are negative, λ1, λ2,

and λ6 are negative while λ3 , λ4 and λ5 are positive.



       The effect of price on consumption is shown by: ∂C/∂P = λ1 + λ2 SR + λ3 Cues + λ4 PC

λ1 is negative but since λ4 is positive, increases in past consumption offsets the negative effect

of price on consumption. Since λ3 is positive increases in Cues also offset the negative effect

of price. Self-regulation increases the negative effect of price since λ2 is negative. The effect

of Cues on consumption is shown by: ∂C/∂Cues = λ3P + λ5 PC + > 0. Since λ3 and λ5 are

positive, the effect of Cues on consumption is positive. An increase in past consumption will

increase the effect of Cues on consumption. The effect of self-regulation on consumption is

shown by: ∂C/∂SR = λ2 P + λ6PC < 0. Since λ2 and λ6 are negative, the effect of SR on

consumption is negative. However, counter intuitively, the model predicts that higher levels of

past consumption will increase the negative effect of self-regulation.




9
3. Data

          The working data set is based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

1997 (NLSY97) from 2002 to 2009. NLSY97 is an annual longitudinal, nationally representative

sample of 8984 individuals who were 12 to 16 years old as of December 31, 1996. The data

are representative of the entire population including those not in school. Price and advertising

data were merged to the NLSY97. The mean values and standard errors for all the variables

are presented in table 1.



          The alcohol consumption variable is based on two consumption measures provided in

the NLSY97. The first measure is the number of days in the past thirty days that alcohol was

consumed (drinking days per month). The second measure is the usual number of drinks

consumed per day in the past thirty days (drinks per day). The empirical consumption variable

is the product of these two variables and is drinks per month. A number of prior studies have

used the same measure.



          The independent variables from the NLSY97 measure economic, demographic, and

other factors that may impact alcohol consumption. These variables include continuous

measures of the respondent’s income, education and age and age squared. Also included are

dichotomous measures of the respondent’s gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status

school enrollment status and a variable for under age 21. The NLSY97 has TV watching in

years 2002 and 2007 which are reported as hours of TV watching per week. Data from Nielson

indicate that overall TV viewing time during the 2002-2009 period was relatively stable. Thus a

linear trend based on the 2002 and 2007 data for each individual was used to interpolate data

for 2003-2006 and to extrapolate data for 2008 and 2009. Weekly hours of TV watching were

multiplied by a value equal to the number of days in the month of interview divided by 7. This

converts TV watching to hours per month.

10
       Education is usually included in a demand for alcohol equation as a proxy for health

knowledge but could be a proxy for self-regulation. Education could be a proxy for self-

regulation since individuals who are better able to self-regulate have been shown to achieve

higher levels of educational success (Mischel, Shoda and Peake, 1988). This does not imply

that education has any casual effect on self-regulation. The ability to self-regulate is related to a

number of individual factors including genetics and experience. The estimation results for

education are compared to what would be expected if education proxied for self-regulation.



       Both the probability of exposure to alcohol ads on TV and the probability of exposure to

alcohol portrayals in programming increase with the hours of TV watching. To model this

interaction the empirical proxy for alcohol cues on TV is an interaction term defined as the

product of hours of TV watching and hours of alcohol advertising on TV per month. This

variable (called All TV Cues) is a measure of the probability of exposure to alcohol cues on TV.

Hours of TV watching is also tested as a measure of exposure to alcohol cues. The TV

advertising data was purchased from Kantar Media and includes hours of alcohol ads on all

local and national TV. Local TV includes data from the top 101 local markets and national TV

includes Network TV, Syndicated TV and Cable network TV. Spanish Language TV was

excluded since it has a limited audience. The top 101 local markets account for about 82

percent of the US population. National ads have no local variation but have monthly and yearly

variation. Advertising is not defined as a stock since advertising is viewed in the behavioral

economics framework as an external cue which can result in a shift toward the Hedonic system.

The alcohol cue variable was appended to the NLSY97 by market, month and year.



       The alcohol price data come from the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers

Association (ACCRA). The data are the price of a six pack of Heineken less any deposit and are

11
at the quarterly level for about 300 communities. These data were aggregated to the state level

to reduce measurement error associated with a small number of observations in each

community and adjusted for the 1983 CPI. These beer prices were appended to the NLSY97 by

state and quarter.



4. Estimation Issues and Results

        The goal of the empirical work is to estimate the effects of price, cues and self-regulation

at different levels of past consumption. The inclusion of past consumption in the empirical

equation would create bias since past consumption is correlated with current consumption and

thus correlated with the equation error term. Stratifying the sample into two or more groups

based on the individual’s past consumption would also create bias due to endogenous selection

which is again due to the correlation between current consumption and past consumption.

However, the correlation between past and current consumption can be used to advantage with

FMM and quantile regression. These methods allow for estimation of the effects of the

independent variables at different levels of current consumption without stratification of the

sample. Since higher levels of current consumption are associated with higher levels of past

consumption, FMM and Quantile regressions may provide estimates of the effects of the

independent variables at different levels of past consumption. The empirical models drop the

interaction terms with price from equation (6) since, in log form, they are too collinear with the

log of price.



        To verify that current and lagged consumption are correlated in the NLSY97 data a

regression of the natural log of lagged alcohol consumption on the natural log of current alcohol

consumption, its square and a constant was estimated. This regression resulted in an intercept

of 1.226, a coefficient of 0.474 on current alcohol consumption and a coefficient of 0.0228 for

the squared term. All coefficients were significant at the 1 percent level and the R-squared was

12
.35. This regression was used to predict values of past consumption using current consumption

for nine deciles of current consumption. Predicted past consumption increases with each decile

of actual past consumption and with each decile of current consumption. Thus, on average for

each decile, higher values of current consumption are associated with higher values of past

consumption making current consumption a good ordinal proxy for past consumption.



       The first set of results presented are for the FMM estimation of equation (6). The FMM

approach is useful as a test for two or more underlying distributions which represent

heterogeneous subsamples or components in the overall sample. This approach requires only

specification of the number of components and the probability distribution for each component.

The estimated mean value of the dependent variable in each component provides a natural

interpretation of what the component represents. The components may or may not represent

significantly different alcohol consumption levels. However, Ayyagari et al. (2009) employed the

FMM approach to estimate an alcohol demand function with two components and found that the

two components differed significantly by consumption level and the components can thus be

interpreted as moderate consumption and heavy consumption.



       The FMM results presented in table 2 assume two components each with a normal

distribution. Since natural log transformations of alcohol consumption, alcohol price and alcohol

advertising are employed, the resulting coefficients represent elasticities. These elasticities are

for consumption, conditional on positive consumption. Clustered standard errors at the

individual level were employed. The results show that the probability that an individual is in

component 1 is .69 and the mean value of alcohol consumption for component 1 is 8.08 drinks

per month (2.09 in logs). The predicted past consumption for component 1 is 10.45 drinks per

month. The results also show that the probability that an individual is in component 2 is .31 and

the average consumption in component 2 is 40 drinks per month (3.69 in logs). The predicted

13
past consumption for component 2 is 27.23 drinks per month. Thus component 1 can be

interpreted as consisting of individuals with moderate levels of current and past consumption

and component 2 can be interpreted as consisting of individuals with high levels of current and

past consumption. The coefficients estimated for component 1 can be interpreted as relevant to

individuals with moderate levels of past consumption and the coefficients estimated for

component 2 can be interpreted as relevant to individuals with high levels of past consumption.



       The results show that moderate drinkers have a price elasticity of -.49 and that the price

elasticity for heavy drinkers is insignificant. These results are consistent with the theoretical

model which predicts that an increase in past consumption decreases the negative effect of

price on current consumption. The results also show that in component 1 the alcohol cues

elasticity is significant and equal to .05. and in component 2 the alcohol cues elasticity is

significant and equal to .10. This is also consistent with the theoretical model which predicts

that an increase in past consumption increases the positive effect of advertising on

consumption. These results are also consistent with the review by Gallet (2007) who found an

average alcohol price elasticity of -0.535 and alcohol advertising elasticity of .03. The estimates

reported by Gallet do not distinguish between heavy and moderate consumption and therefore

primarily reflect moderate drinkers since moderate drinkers predominate in any random sample.



       It was argued above that education may be a proxy for self-regulation. The theoretical

model predicts that an increase in past consumption increases the negative effect of self-

regulation on consumption. The results show that for drinkers with a low level of past

consumption, both education and current enrollment in school are insignificant but both

variables are negative and significant for drinkers with a high level of past consumption. The

larger negative effect for drinkers with higher levels of past consumption is consistent with the

interpretation of education as a proxy for self-regulation.

14
       The theoretical model has no predictions with respect to the effect of past consumption

on the other included independent variables. The results show that age has a positive effect on

moderate drinkers maximizing at age 25.8. However, age has no effect on heavy drinking.

Being underage has a negative effect on moderate drinkers but no effect on heavy drinkers.

Similarly, being Hispanic has a negative effect for moderate drinkers but no effect on heavy

drinkers. Income has a positive effect for moderate drinkers but a negative effect for heavy

drinkers. Marriage and being Black has a negative effect for both moderate and heavy drinkers.

Finally, being male has a positive effect for both moderate and heavy drinkers.



       The FMM approach also allows for estimation of the influence of each independent

variable on the probability that an individual is in component 1. These results show that the

probability of being a moderate drinker is increased for those who are married, black or Hispanic

but decreased for males. These results parallel the results from the two components. The

remaining variables have no significant influence on the probability of being a moderate drinker

rather than a heavy drinker.



       Table 3 presents two alternative specifications of the alcohol demand function estimated

with FMM. The model in panel A of table 3 includes all of the independent variables in table 2

and also includes state dummies. The results in panel A are essentially the same as those of

table 2 with the exception that the price coefficients are no longer significant. The loss of

significance for price is probably due to the limited time variation in the state level price data.

Panel B of table 3 includes all of the independent variables in table 2 but employs the natural

log of TV watching as the measure of exposure to alcohol cues on TV. The results in panel B

are the same as those of table 2 with respect to sign and significance but differ in magnitude.



15
The coefficient of TV watching for component 1 is larger than the TV Cues variable in table 3

and the difference between component 1 and 2 is not significant.



       As noted in the introduction, Ayyagari et al. (2009) estimated price elasticities for a

sample which included non-drinkers. However, they also estimated priced elasticities for a

sample limited to drinkers. They used FMM with two components and their data are limited to

individuals over age 50. In the full sample they found that the probability of being in component

1 was .60 and the probability of being in component 2 was .40. Mean consumption levels for

the two components of the drinkers only sample were not provided although they state that

component 1 is the larger group and can be assumed that it is also the moderate drinkers. In

the sample limited to drinkers, the price elasticity in component 1 was -0.63 and the price

elasticity in component 2 was not significant. These elasticity results are very similar to the

results found with the younger NLSY97 sample used in this paper. Ayyagari et al. (2009) also

present results for the two components, for education, using several alternative specifications

and results for a variable defined as a longer financial planning horizon using one specification.

A longer financial planning horizon is related to time preference and could also be a proxy for

self-regulation. In all the results education and the longer financial planning horizon are positive

in component 1 and negative in component 2. Education and the financial planning horizon

increase the probability of drinking in component 1 which is due to the inclusion of non-drinkers.

The negative effect for component 2 is consistent with the prediction that past consumption

increases the negative effect of self-regulation. These results suggest that education and

financial planning horizon are proxies for self-regulation. Similar results for education were

found with the NLSY97.



       The second approach used to estimate equation (6) is quantile regression. The quantile

regression estimator uses all of the sample observations and thus does not require sample

16
stratification. The quantile regression estimates the marginal effects of the independent

variables at pre-specified quantiles of the dependent variable. These quantiles are simply

percentiles. The quantile regression results are presented in tables 4 and 5 and employ the

same specifications used in tables 2 and 3. Again, the natural log of alcohol consumption,

alcohol price and alcohol cues on TV are employed and the coefficients represent elasticities for

consumption given that consumption is positive. The quantile results for the 10th to the 90th

quantiles are presented. Robust bootstrap standard errors are included based on 400

repetitions.



        Table 4 includes alcohol price elasticities, alcohol cues elasticities and results for

education. The price elasticities are all negative and four of these price elasticities are

significant. The price elasticities show a general pattern of decline from the 10th quantile to the

90th quantile and are all insignificant after the 60th quantile. That is, the price elasticity declines

as current and past consumption increase which is predicted by the theoretical model. At the

30th quantile the price elasticity is -0.506 which is the very close to the price elasticity estimated

in component 1 with the FMM approach. The alcohol cues elasticities are all positive and

significant. The cues elasticities show a general pattern of increase from the 10th quantile to the

90th quantile. That is, the alcohol cues elasticity increases as past consumption increases

which is also predicted by the theoretical model. At the 30th quantile the cues elasticity is .058

and at the 80th quantile the cues elasticity is .105. These are close to the values reported for

component 1 and component 2 in the FMM results. The education coefficients are negative and

significant which shows that education reduces consumption. The coefficients increase in

absolute value from the 10th quantile to the 90th quantile which shows that the effect of

education increases as past consumption increases. At the 30th quantile an extra year of

education reduces consumption by about 2% but at the 80th quantile an extra year of education

reduces consumption by about 7%. Enrolled is insignificant from the 10th to the 70th quantile

17
and then is negative and significant. This is the pattern expected for self-regulation which

supports the hypothesis that education is a proxy for self-regulation and is similar to the FMM

results.



           The other variables in table 4 include age variables which are generally not significant

but the underage variable is negative and significant in five of the nine quantiles. Income is

positive and significant in the 10th through the 70th quantile and decreases as alcohol

consumption increases. The demographic variables, Black, Hispanic and Married are all

negative and significant in almost all quantiles. Male is positive and significant in all quantiles.



           The quantile coefficients can be tested for significant differences between quantiles.

These tests were done with the results from table 4 with a null hypothesis of no difference

between the coefficients. The null hypothesis is rejected when the p values are .10 or less.

This test was performed on the coefficients of price and TV Cues for all the permutations of

quantile combinations. The results of these tests show that for price only the 10th and 90th

quantiles are significantly different. However, for TV Cues, most quantiles which were two or

more deciles apart were significantly different.



           Table 5 presents two alternative specifications of the alcohol demand function estimated

with quantile regressions. The model in panel A of table 5 includes all of the independent

variables in table 4 and also includes state dummies. The results in panel A are essentially the

same as those of table 4 with the exception that the price coefficients are no longer significant

which parallel the results in panel A of table 3. Panel B of table 5 includes all of the independent

variables in table 4 but employs the natural log of TV watching as the measure of exposure to

alcohol cues on TV. The results in panel B are the same as those of table 4 with respect to

sign and significance but differ in magnitude. The coefficient of TV watching for the 10 quantile

18
is significantly different than the coefficient for the 80th and 90th quantile. These results support

the theoretical model.



        As noted in the introduction, Manning et al. (1995) estimated alcohol price elasticities

with quantile regressions. They found the highest price elasticity was at the 50th quantile which

declined moving to both extremes. They reported a conditional price elasticity at the 50th

quantile of -0.64 and approximately zero at the 90th quantile. The hypothesis of equality of

these two coefficients is rejected. Using the NLSY97 data the conditional price elasticity at the

50th quantile is -0.72, at the 60th quantile is -.53 and approximately zero at higher quantiles.

Manning et al. also report the effect of four or more years of college on alcohol consumption. It

is negative and significant at the 5th and 95th quantile and increases in absolute value as alcohol

consumption increases. These results are consistent with the assertion that education is a

proxy for self-regulation and similar to results for education which were found with the NLSY97.



5. Conclusions

        The distribution of alcohol consumption indicates that most individuals who drink are

moderate drinkers and only a minority of individuals are heavy drinkers. An efficient alcohol

control policy would target these heavy drinkers since this group is responsible for much of the

social costs of alcohol. Moderate alcohol consumption probably causes no harm and might be

beneficial to health. The reduction of alcohol cues in the form of TV advertising and TV

placements and the increase in alcohol price through higher excise taxes are important alcohol

control options and are the primary focus of this paper. All of the prior studies of alcohol

advertising focus on average consumption and most of the prior studies of taxes and price focus

on average consumption. The focus on average consumption is based on the implicit

assumption that lower average consumption implies lower consumption at the upper end of the

distribution.

19
       The behavioral economic model presented in this paper argues that the effect of

advertising and price differ by past consumption levels. The model predicts that advertising is

more effective in reducing consumption at high past consumption levels but less effective at low

past consumption levels. Conversely, the model predicts that higher prices are effective in

reducing consumption at low past consumption levels but less effective at high past

consumption levels. Past consumption levels and current consumption levels are highly

correlated and thus current consumption is a good ordinal proxy for past consumption. Unlike

the models used in most prior studies, this model predicts that the effects of policy on average

consumption and on the upper end of the distribution are different.



       Both FMM and Quantile models were estimated. The results from these regressions

show that heavy drinkers are more responsive to advertising and less responsive to price than

are moderate drinkers. The empirical evidence also supports the assumption that education is

a proxy for self-regulation. The key conclusions are that restrictions on advertising are targeted

at heavy drinkers and are an underutilized alcohol control policy. Higher excise taxes on

alcohol reduce consumption by moderate drinkers and are of less importance in reducing heavy

consumption.



       The empirical results are not proof of the behavioral model since the estimated

specifications could have been generated by alternative theoretical models. However, there is

also laboratory evidence supporting the behavioral model. If the behavioral model is an

accurate representation of behavior there is an additional implication about the effect of cues on

alcohol consumption. In the neoclassical approach, advertising is information which can change

perceptions of the product and act as a complement to consumption. In this view, the various

streams of information about alcohol are rationally weighed and according to revealed

20
preference the individual’s observed consumption is optimal. In the behavioral economic model,

advertising is a cue which increases the probability that alcohol consumption is heuristically

determined. In the behavioral model the effects of advertising are not easily dismissed by

heavy drinkers. The conclusion from the behavioral economic model is that advertising induced

consumption is not optimal for all individuals and may be a particular concern for those drinkers

most at risk from alcohol.
