                                           ABSTRACT

       In 1990 the Federal Government included a Most Favored Customer (MFC) clause in the

contract (OBRA 90) which would govern the prices paid to firms for pharmaceutical            products

supplied to Medicaid recipients. The firms had to give Medicaid their “best” (lowest) price in some

cases, a percentage below average price in others. Many theoretical models have shown that an MFC

rule commits a firm to compete less aggressively in prices. We might expect prices to rise following

the implementation   of the MFC rule, yet the work done to date on OBRA 90 has found this result

somewhat difficult to show empirically.    I also conclude that the effects of the law are small and

relatively weak; however, the results are strongest where the product’s characteristics    match the

incentives in the law. I find that after the MFC rule was implemented the average price of branded

products facing generic competition rose - the median presentation’s price rose about 4Y0. Brands

protected by patents did not significantly increase price. Generics in concentrated markets should

display a strategic response to the brand’s adoption of the MFC.     I find support for the strategic

effect; generic firms raise their prices more as their markets become more concentrated.   I find little

change in hospital prices. The results suggest that the MFC rule resulted in higher prices to some

non-Medicaid   consumers of pharmaceuticals.

 Introduction
           The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation              Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) included a rebate program

 that featured a Most-Favored-Customer               (MFC) clause for Medicaid reimbursement:            Medicaid

 would pay manufacturers          the lowest price offered to any buyer of the product.             The rules also

provided for Medicaid to purchase at a given percentage below average price if the best price

was not low enough.             This paper examines the (perhaps-unforeseen)            effects of the policy on

average pharmaceutical          prices.   In particular, I examine how the Medicaid Rebate rules changed
prices charged by firms in different competitive positions.
           Most    Favored      Customer       clauses    have been    studied   extensively     in the Industrial
Organization      theoretical    literature;   see, for example, papers by Cooper (1986 and 1991), Png
(1987 and 1991), and Salop (1986). The basic model of MFC clauses has the following features,
A firm announces and commits to offering the following scheme: the lowest price it offers to any
customer      within a specific time period will be the price charged to the group of customers
“covered” by the MFC. 1 This scheme has two main effects; the MFC will alter optimal price
dispersion for any one firm, and secondly, the firm will find that competing with other firms for
low-valuation      consumers on the basis of price becomes more costly.               Any price discount given

to a marginal customer to induce a sale must be applied to all customers covered by the MFC.

Theory tells us that firms that credibly                 adopt the MFC clause can commit           to “soft” price

competition.       Although     the literature contains many models explaining             the strategic effect of

MFC clauses, there has been relatively little empirical verification                of the effectiveness    of the

policy.z
           Although OBRA 90 is the sort of experiment that lends itself to analysis, there has been
little formal work on the effects of the rebate rules.                This is partially due to the difficulty of
finding appropriate      data and partially to the complexity            of the problem.       The law applied to
actual prices paid per unit, not the more commonly available invoice prices (that do not include

cash discounts),     The MFC rules varied by retail channel, which themselves had different ex ante
price distributions.      To perform a good experiment,            prices should be adjusted for long term


     lThe firm chooses the applicable time period; it could extend the guarantee to past, future, or both
sets of customers.

that the main use of the facilitating practice in that industry is to allow efficient adjustment of prices in
long term contracts.
 contracts, and available before and after the law change from multiple retail channels.       The rebate

 rule has subsections that differ in their expected effects on market outcomes.         Therefore, prices
 respond to multiple forces and will not necessarily move strongly in one direction, which makes
 the impact of the law difficult to detect.    In fact, the United States General Accounting        Office

 (GAO) has examined the effects of the OBRA legislation on drug prices twice: once on prices
 paid by the Veterans Administration     (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) and once for prices
 paid by hospitals   and HMOS.3       In both cases the report concluded       that the GAO could not

 determine “the extent to which price increases were attributable to OBRA. ” The GAO states that
 VA and DOD could not provide enough data to examine the question carefully.              More recently,
the CBO published a report examining discounts received by pharmaceutical              purchasers in the

wake of the rebate law.4 That report notes that the prevalence of large discounts fell in 1991

and 1992 and attributes the drop to the Medicaid rebate legislation.          However, the report does

not have data from before the law took effect, so before and after comparisons          are not possible.
The inability to pin down a causal link between the legislation           and pharmaceutical     prices is
frustrating in light of the economic importance of the regulations, the clear theoretical predictions
of the ~C     portion of the rebate rules, and the anecdotal evidence from market participants.5

      5 “Congress recently passed a law requiring drug companies to give Medicaid the same deep discounts
they give other big customers. But instead of reducing Medicaid drug prices, many companies are now
raising the prices that those other big customers must pay.”
 “Now drug companies are increasing prices to some of those other buyers, including the Department of
Veterans Affairs, prepaid health plans like the giant Kaiser Permanence group, hospitals, family planning
clinics and community health centers for migrant workers, homeless people and the indigent. Health care
experts say these added costs may soon trickle down to consumers in the form of higher medical costs,
and ultimately, insurance premiums.”
“Supporters of the 1990 legislation are furious about the drug companies’ move. The chief sponsor,
Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, said the price
increases appeared to be “an attempt to circumvent the new Medicaid law, ” shift costs and nullify the
savings envisioned by Congress.””
“...But a lobbyist for the drug industry, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said: “We
are surprised that Senator Pryor is surprised. I don’t know what else he would have expected. It’s logical

         would re-examine their prices if Congress passes a law saying                that Medicaid,
         which accounts for about 10 percent of our revenues, must get the          best price given
         to any pharmaceutical customer in the country. ”

         I do not have all the information required to determine the effects of the law, but I have

enough to make some progress in our understanding            of its impact.    My data surround the time

the new rules took effect, so I can examine prices before and after the policy change.            The theory

section explains     that the market share of Medicaid,        the size of a drug’s package,           and the
competitive     structure   of the market all affect the way a drug price should respond                to the
legislation.    I then demonstrate   that these variables predict price changes around the time the
legislation    took effect in a manner consistent     with the Medicaid rebate rules, Therefore,          it is

likely that the rules did affect the prices of some pharmaceuticals           in the US market.
         I find that after the Medicaid rebate rules took effect the average price of the median
presentation    of a brand facing generic competition increased by about 4%. The average price of

a patented drug did not respond to the legislation.     This suggests that the MFC clause encouraged

some branded producers to engage in softer price competition,         I also find evidence that the MFC
indirectly affected generic producers; generic prices rose more in concentrated           markets after the

legislation took effect. This suggests that generics competing against MFC-constrained              branded

competitors    reacted strategically to their rival’s constraint.

        The estimates contained in this paper may not be representative           of all industry outcomes
for several reasons.    The data I have do not include prices to HMOS (or pharmaceutical               benefit


that companies would re-examine their prices if Congress passes a law saying that Medicaid, which
accounts for about 10 percent of our revenues, must get the best price given to any pharmaceutical
customer in the country. “’’LeslieRose, chief lobbyist for the Group Health Association of America, which
represents the organizations, said: “The reports we hear from H.M.0,’s across the country are really
disturbing. They are being told by drug companies that the days of discounts are over, that drug prices
will be raised. Clearly, this is an unintended effect of the new law.”
“Jose E. Carnacho, executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers, said that
within weeks of passage of the Medicaid law 7 to 10 drug companies began trying to renegotiate the
discount-price contracts for his organization, which buys drugs for 31 clinics serving 250,000 patients a
year.”

 managers like Medco), the types of institutions               likely have the pre-OBRA binding low price; it
 is probable that the price charged these types of customers rose more than I estimate here. All

 the adjustment        did not occur in the time period I analyze due to the presence of long term
 contracts in the market.          The CBO finds that discounts are still declining in 1992. Also, the data
 have a great deal of measurement               error due to the prevalence       of cash rebates that are not
 included in recorded prices, so the results are not as precise as one might expect from a large

 dataset.
            Although     the Federal and state governments          saved 150 million dollars per quarter in
Medicaid expenditure          by the end of the first year of the program (and $1.8 billion in 1994), to

the extent that some market prices rose as a consequence                 of the reimbursement       policy, not as
much savings occurred as might have been expected.                 In addition, other government expenditure,

such as purchases made by the V. A,, increased due to these rising prices and partially offset the

initial gain. Finally, some non-Medicaid             consumers of pharmaceuticals       that had been receiving

substantial discounts paid higher prices.

            The structure of this paper is as follows.            The exact rules of the rebate scheme are
explained      in Section     I.      Section   II discusses     the theory   behind   the rebate    rules,   The
pharmaceutical         industry, its rules of entry, and the available data are discussed in Section III.
The estimation         of the effects of the MFC rule on prices is reported in Sections IV and V.

Section VI concludes.          Throughout       the paper I use the term “price” to mean prices observed
before the Medicaid rebate is taken into account; prices here are always pre-rebate prices unless
explicitly described otherwise.


I. The Medicaid Rebate Rules

            The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation          Act of October 1990 (OBRA 90) included legislation

intended to reduce government spending on pharmaceuticals                 for Medicaid recipients by limiting

drug reimbursement         prices.    The Medicaid program was not receiving the low prices given to
other big buyers because it reimbursed individual hospitals and pharmacies rather than purchasing
in bulk. Medicaid is a large buyer whose purchases account for roughly thirteen percent of the
prescription     pharmaceutical       market.    Pharmaceutical      firms engage in a great deal of price
discrimination;    the fact that Medicaid could not use its bwgaining             power to secure the normal



                                                          6
 advantages of a large buyer in a market with significant price dispersion was part of the impetus
 for the legislation.

           To secure better prices for Medicaid (and reduce the federal deficit) OBRA 90 provided

 for a voluntary program in which manufacturers            could enroll their drugs.b The incentive for a

 firm to enroll was that its drugs were then guaranteed access to all state Medicaid formularies

 and reimbursement        from the Federal program.7     A formulary is a list of drugs approved for use

 by an institution.     All states were required to have Medicaid “cover” all drugs participating     in this

 scheme.      In return the program required drug manufacturers          to pay rebates to state and federal
Medicaid programs.          A rebate would represent the total dollar amount by which Medicaid had
 “overpaid” a firm in that calendar quarter, compared             to the new low prices that were now
required.     Manufacturers    of branded pharmaceuticals      were required to sell to Medicaid at 87,5%
of Average Manufacturer          Price (AMP) or their “best price,” whichever         was lower.    AMP is

simply a quantity weighted average of a firm’s wholesale prices.              Thus if a firm sold one unit
of its product to a customer at 75% of AMP, it would effectively have to sell all its Medicaid
units at that price also (although the mechanism would be a rebate check).             The best price could

not fall below 75% of AMP in the first year of the scheme, but the floor was scheduled to drop

to 50% the following year and zero thereafter.           Additionally,   if an innovator increased AMP of

its drug by more than the increase in the Urban CPI from a baseline period (September                 1990),

the rebate amount owed to the government           would increase by the amount the CPI change was

exceeded.

         The important variations in the rule are twofold.          Generic products were not subject to
quite the same scheme as branded products; instead, a generic product’s price to Medicaid was
required to be 90% of its AMP.           Notice that whether a drug has patent protection          or not is
irrelevant;   if it is the innovator,   or brand, it follows the brand rule before and after patent

expiration.    Additionally,    only outpatient drugs were subject to the OBRA program.            Inpatient




    6 Nearly every firm selling pharmaceuticals in the US enrolled in the program when it started.

     7 A couple of loopholes were available in 1991 that allowed states to have a de facto formulary if
some effort was expended. Only 11 states had “restrictive formularies” in 1991 according to Soumerai
et al (1993).

                                                     7
 drugs, given to a patient while staying in the hospital,           did not fall under the new rules.a
 Inpatient drugs include, but are not limited to, injectable drugs.        A hospital can purchase oral

 drugs (hereafter, pills) to dispense to inpatients or to sell to outpatients.     The inpatient sales are
 exempt from the rebate rules, whereas the outpatient sales are subject to the rebate rules.            The
 results for pills sold to hospitals will therefore be weaker than those for pills sold to drugstores

 due to the mixture of inpatient and outpatient drugs in the hospital sample,

          The rules required that the price used to calculate “best prices” and rebates be the [)rice
per unit of the drug; common units are the pill or the milliliter.      Separate packaging alone     would

not constitute a different product with a different “best price, ” Rather, the firm would have to

calculate    the price per pill on all its packages      of a given drug to find the lowest price.9

Additionally,    OBRA 90 defined AMP to be the average wholesale price available to a member
of the “retail pharmaceutical    trade, ” Only prices of goods sold to drug stores, not hospitals or

HMOS, counted in the calculation        of AMP.     However, prices from all sectors, including non-

profit,     were used to calculate   “best price.” 10 Thus, a firm would lose revenue            on all its

Medicaid sales each time it sold its drug to anyone at a price lower than 87.5% of its AMP,
while AMP itself was constructed from pharmacy prices only. The exact amount owed by each

firm was calculated every quarter, using sales data from that quarter provided by each firm and




     g My dataset consists of prices and quantities of cardiovascular drugs onIy; these drags are
disproportionately consumed by older patients who are often eligible for Medicare. Medicare covers the
cost of hospital stays and associated inpatient drugs. I divide drugs into injectable and oral to proxy for
inpatient and outpatient; although this rough division is not ideal, the government studies referenced above
use it. If all the Medicaid consumers in my dataset were Medicare-eligible also, Medicaid would not pay
for any injectable sold to hospitals. Therefore, since injectable are not affected by the legislation, are
bought less often by Medicaid, and the dataset contains relatively few injectable observations, I eliminate
injectable drugs from the study entirely.

    9 See the Appendix for a numerical example.

     10The problem with including all sales in the calculation of best price is that other government
agencies such as VA and DOD, as well as non-profit organizations, had been receiving substantial
discounts. The law now required those discounts to be given to all Medicaid units, The story I heard
from industry participants wm that many manufacturers eliminated the discounts in the face of the MFN
law. The following year a law was passed to exempt VA and DOD prices from the calculation of best
price.

 each state, by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). 11 Notice that in the role of calculator
 of rebates, the OIG acted as enforcer of the MFC agreement and monitored                  all firms to detect

 cheating,   The OIG had the ability to fine firms that violated the rules of the contract.              Thus

 firms in the industry in 1991 could be confident their rivals were applying the MFC properly and

 no cheating was going on.


II The Effect of a Most Favored Customer Clause in a Market with Price Discrimination

         To illustrate the effects of the Medicaid legislation,      a very simple model follows where
a firm’s choice of optimal price is compared in regimes with and without best price or average
price provisions.    I initially allow Medicaid’s quantity demanded to respond to price changes and
in a second example assume Medicaid          demand is completely         inelastic.     The two cases will
produce somewhat different implications       for the change in prices.

Elastic Medicaid Demand
        The market has distinct submarkets       indexed by i.       A firm can charge different prices

across submarkets,     but must charge the same price to all customers                 within the submarket

(examples of submarkets are chain pharmacies, HMOS, hospitals).             I assume each submarket has
its own simple demand curve for the elastic portion of the market of the form: qj = ~ - bpj. Each

submarket sells some Medicaid units, a fraction y of quantity ~, although no one knows exactly
which units will be sold to Medicaid ahead of time. Therefore, the firm must choose one price

for the submarket.      (The underlying   intuition       does not depend on the assumptions        of linear
demand, same slope across submarkets,       or constant proportion sold to Medicaid.)           Without any
regulation the Medicaid and non-Medicaid        segments of the market are identical:




Where profit is n and the optimal price for the iti market is pi*. When best price legislation             is

Where N is the total number of markets and pj is the minimum price.                               The new optimal pj is
higher than (q+bc)/2b      because ~ is less than all other ai. When the firm maximizes                         the best

price profit function with respect to customer j‘s price and customer j has the minimum price,
the derivative has an additional positive term compared to the original case. The firm will earn

more profits if it can raise its minimum price.

         A rule that mandates a discount to some customers based on average price will also alter
the firm’s profit function.

Where p is the average price and u is the percentage discount below AMP that Medicaid gets.

This problem turns out to be very complex and a general solution is beyond the scope of the
paper.    The intuition,    however,        is fairly straightforward.                 Medicaid   consumers   across all

submarkets are paying a percentage below average price that is almost surely not optimal in any
of the submarkets.    The firm can change optimal prices slightly with only a second-order                          loss
from the non-Medicaid      consumers.        The altered prices will change average price and have a first-
order effect on the amount of profits earned from Medicaid consumers.                             Whether prices move


                                                                10
 up or down depends on whether optimal prices are below or above the Medicaid price and the

 relative size and elasticity of the different submarkets.       Since the OBRA legislation mandated a

 price for Medicaid that was well below a quanti~-weighted             average price, it is likely that a

 f~m’s optimal response would be to raise price:              the higher the firm sets its price to non-

Medicaid customers, the higher are its profits from Medicaid consumers.



Inelastic Medicaid Demand
        The second framework       assumes that Medicaid demand is perfectly inelastic,           Since the
Medicaid final consumer does not pay for the drug he or she consumes,                 we might think that
Medicaid consumers do not respond to price changes at all. Of course, states can change aspects
of their Medicaid programs, such as eligibility rules, in response to price.          However, states may
not have responded to the OBRA 90 legislation very quickly because of the speed of the bi 11’s
passage, uncertainty over how the program would work, and delays in collecting data. Therefore,
I briefly explore the results of assuming Medicaid demands a fixed quantity of pharmaceuticals

and is completely unaffected by price, while the rest of the market has a normal demand curve,

If Medicaid    demand is fixed (~,      for example)       and the firm is required    to sell to the non-

Medicaid    consumers    due to political     pressures,     the optimal   price    without   regulation   is

(ai+bc+mi)/2b.12    price increases with the size of the inelastic segment, and, in particular,            is
above the optimal price for non-Medicaid      consumers.       If an MFC is imposed in this framework,

higher prices will fall to (q+bc)/2b,   but again, the low prices will rise to (ai+bc+Z~)/2b.         13
        Once again the average price rule is very complex and I do not present a general solution.
After the rules take effect, Medicaid prices depend entirely on prices charged to other consumers.
A firm can reduce its 1991 price to the optimal price for non-Medicaid             consumers (no inelastic
demanders in the market) which increases profits from that group, but causes the firm to receive
a very low price on its Medicaid sales.     In order to get the Medicaid price higher, the firm can




    12I assume political pressure requires the firm to sell to both types of customers, Charging infinity
to Medicaid and not selling to any other buyer would not last very long.

     13 Higher prices fall because the firm no longer sells at that price to the inelastic consumers.
Therefore, the firm prefers to price more optimally for the non-Medicaid segment and increase quantity
sold there.
 contemplate increasing prices to non-Medicaid consumers.       The envelope theorem says it is worth
 increasing prices slightly at least. The extent to which the firm is willing to raise prices further
 will depend on the market share of Medicaid and the elasticity of demand of the other consumers,

 These two effects, the jump down in price due to the reduction in importance           of the inelastic

 customers, and the increase due to the externality, have opposite signs and it is not clear a priori
 which effect will dominate in any given situation.
         To summarize, this basic discussion predicts that OBRA will cause brands to alter their

prices in response to several incentives.        The best price legislation   always gives a firm an
incentive to raise its lowest prices.    The average price legislation has opposing effects.      Prices
rise because Medicaid      prices depend on other prices; however,        when Medicaid      demand     is

inelastic prices can fall, again because the inelastic consumers are not as important in the demand

curve, so the optimal price is lower.

         Note that either best price or average price was binding at any one time for any one
branded presentation.    If a concentration’s   lowest price was below 87.5% of AMP, its Medicaid

sales were subject to the best price rule; if its lowest price was above that level, they were
subject to the average price rule. A firm would have calculated the profits for each concentration
of each brand under both alternatives      and chosen a price distribution    that maximized     profits.
After the legislation was passed each rule generated a significant share of rebate revenue; no one

rule was prefemed by all firms,     Half of single-source   brands gave discounts of more than 30%
and half of brands facing generic competition      gave discounts of more than 50% in 1991. 1“
         Generics were exempt from the best price rule, but had to sell to Medicaid at 90% of their
average price.    Thus only the average price provision       affected generic firms directly, and it

should have had the effects described above. A zero-profit firm facing an average price provision
would be forced to raise its prices to keep profits non-negative,     To the extent that generic firms

were perfectly competitive and earning zero profits, this is another reason to expect prices to have

risen.



     14CBO page 36. Health and Human Services has published a report (Sullivan (1992)) concluding that
the “best price” rule is not the dominant source of rebate revenue compared to the “average price”
provision. Their analysis, however, looks at prices after the MFC legislation had passed, when firms had
altered their price distributions. Thus we don’t know how much dispersion existed ex ante, but only that
the legislation did not completely deter fms from discounting below 12% of average price in 1991.

                                                   12
           The OBRA incentives may also have created strategic effects.        Cooper shows in a model
with two firms but uniform prices, that even a firm that unilaterally institutes MFC pricing alters

its own best response function so that equilibrium        prices for both firms are higher.     Intuitive y,

the MFC causes price discounts to become more expensive, which discourages their use. Rivals

are aware of the altered incentives and that knowledge changes their own behavior.            Oligopolistic

fiis     that are competing for the same customers, as therapeutic substitutes do, will become less

aggressive in price competition under an MFC, giving market prices another opportunist y to rise.

The price responses of generic firms will also depend on the strategic aspect of the MFC and
how many generic firms are in the market with the competitive               brand.     When the brand is
constrained by an MFC, its best response function shifts and its rival(s) has an incentive to raise
its price. If the MFC firm has many generic rivals, all producing a fairly homogeneous             product,

each of the rivals has much less incentive to give a soft response; there are many firms in the
market whose best response functions haven ‘t moved.           Since on] y the brand has shifted its best
response function, there may be no (or very little) price rise by generic rivals. 1s On the other
hand, if there are few generic competitors,        their price will shift noticeably   in response to the

softer competition       caused by the MFC and generic prices will rise.
          The cap on price increases imposed by the OBRA rules eliminates the gain from raising

prices too fast. In particular, a firm would not want its average price to increase at faster than

the rate of inflation      or it would have to subtract more than the difference         off the price to
Medicaid.lb      Therefore, a firm has no incentive to raise average price in order to increase the
price Medicaid pays for a drug -- once the rate of inflation has been reached.            This part of the
rule is very important as it limits the responses to the incentives created by OBRA.
Types of players
          Manufacturers     of pharmaceuticals   fall into two main categories.        The first category
consists of “innovator” firms; they undertake research and development           to discover new drugs
and bring them to market.           Once approved by the FDA, such drugs are marketed             under a

proprietary, or brand, name by the innovator.       A second type of firm is a generic or im]tator firm.




       15See Cooper (1986) for a theoretical treatment.

       16See CBO   BOX   I, p,15,

                                                     13
 After patent expiration, any firm may submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application,                or ANDA,

 to the FDA.17 The generic firm must show its product is bioequivalent            to the original branded

 product.     Once its ANDA is approved and the original patent has expired, a generic firm may
 legally make and sell the product.     Thus, some drugs have two categories of manufacturers,              the

 brand and one or more generics.
            The variety of competitive conditions in the pharmaceutical    industry will prove useful in
 predicting which prices will be most affected by the rebate rules, I classify all brand (also called
 “pioneer” or “innovator”) drugs that have patent protection        as “patented brands. ”18 Note tha[

 a patented brand continually      faces competition   from therapeutic   substitutes,    despite its patent
protection.19      The level of competition     when    a brand has lost patent          protection     can be

characterized by the number of generic firms also manufacturing           the drug at any given time,         I

refer to a brand in a market with one or more generic firms as a “competitive brand. ” The final
class includes all the generic manufacturers.     This class can be further broken down into ANDA

holders and labelers; the definition of labelers will be given below.

        Table I lists the expected effects on pre-rebate average price by competitive                 class and
retail sector at the imposition of an MFC rules.       The pre-rebate mean price is exactly what my
data record; the prices in the data should respond to the imposition of the MFC and average price
clauses according to the strength and prevalence of the MFC, average price, and strategic effects.




    17I identify which fms are participating, or have permission to participate, in each market with the
~A’s Approved Drug Products and Therapeutic muivalents. This publication details which ANDAs have
been granted; it reports the exact concentration, form, date of approval, and firm receiving the ANDA.


   1s Sometimes two firms discover a drug independently and share the patent or are both licensed to
manufacture and market a drug by the inventor. Although the market structure is a duopoly rather than
monopoly, I classify these observations with “patented brands. ”

     19Some brands are still monopolies but have lost patent protection; no generic has entered that
particular market. I call these drugs “off-patent brands,” but end up excluding them from the analysis due
to lack of useable observations.

         Usually when industry prices and profits rise we expect to see entry by firms wanting a
share of the profits.     Patented drugs are obviously protected from entry by their patent,           Generic

manufacturers     are, in general, not protected from entry. However, a generic entrant must receive

approval from the FDA before it can begin selling a generic drug.             The approval process takes

eighteen months, on average, after the application is submitted.          The firm would normally spend

several months preparing the application.       Thus, the earliest an entrant (encouraged to enter by

the new profitability     of the market) would normally appear would be towards the end of 1992,

well outside my sample period.
        From a firm’s point of view, the most important question might be how much (and in
what direction)     post-rebate   revenues   change.20    To find the post-rebate           mean   price,   the
researcher must know where in the distribution       the Medicaid purchases fall.           If Medicaid sales
are already at the low end of the price distribution,    the direct payments required by the scheme

will not lower firm revenue by very much.         On the other hand, if Medicaid sales are often to




     20“Is this a good bill or a bad bill? ...It also depends on who you are. If you market major producls
that had previously been denied forrnulary access and do not discount deeply, this is probably a pretty
good bill. If, on the other hand, your products are multi-source, your growth products are very expensive,
and/or you discount heavily, you have your work cut out for you. ”

small pharmacies without bargaining power, the rebate amount might be large.                In general, the
direct effect of the rebate and the expected strategic effect of reduced competition            and higher

prices oppose one another and their relative strengths cannot be precisely              evaluated   without
individual invoice data from fm         and Medicaid purchase data that is collected by HCFA,


III. Data Description

        The observations      that make up the data for this study are fairly complex.        To make the
structure clear, Table II illustrates the fields that make up each observation,          The first elemen L
of an observation is the “drug,” or specific chemical entity, which may be called by i[S generic
or brand (proprietary)     name.   A drug can be manufactured        by the NDA holder and any ANDA

holders that exist. The drug comes in one or more forms; a form is solid (e.g. tablet), liquid, or

other (e.g. patch); most drugs come in only one form and some have two forms.               The drug-form

can be further divided into different concentrations,        for example, 250mg or 500mg.        The drug-

forms in this dataset have an average of 3.67 concentrations          each.   Several drugs have as many

as seven different concentrations,     one has twelve, which is the maximum           in the dataset.    The
final choice variables for the manufacturer        are the packaging and number of units.      Tablets can
come in bottles of many sizes, from 2 to 1,000, or in unit dose packages                  which have, by
definition, one unit.    Liquids can be packaged in bottles, bottles with droppers, or vials.           Each

presentation is a unique combination         of drug, labeler, form, concentration,   number of units and

packaging.    Adding information     on revenue, quantity, month, and year turns a presentation          into
an observation.       All the observations     in a presentation   have the same drug, labeler, form,
concentration,    number of units, and packaging data, The previous pharmaceutical           literature has
largely worked with the most common (highest revenue) dosage form to avoid these complex

dimensions.      I hope to be able to add more depth to the analysis with the additional information.

          Data

          The data were collected        by IMS America,               a firm that provides         detailed    data about

pharmaceutical       sales in the US. IMS provided the Cardiovascular                 subset of their Drugstore Audit

and Hospital Audit from 1989 through                 1991.        Cardiovascular     drugs is one of the largest (in
revenue     terms)    classes   of prescription       pharmaceuticals           and has experienced            considerable
innovation in the post-WWII         period.        Therefore there are many drugs and competitive                    classes
represented in the dataset as well as about six billion dollars in annual revenue.                          The Audits are

created by monthly sampling of warehouse, chain pharmacy, and independent pharmacy invoices
for observations on the wholesale price, No sales to HMOS are included in these samples.                              Then
the individual invoices are combined,              transformed       from a sample into national-level            data, and
reported as an estimate of national revenue and quantity.                     The individual invoice information           is
never reported.

          Hospital prices have more measurement                   error than drugstore prices because hospitals
receive more cash discounts than phmacies                    md, in addition, the number of observations                  is


                                                             17
 smaller.      Cash discounts are cash returned to the customer after buying a certain quantity of a
 drug, a particular mix of drugs, or a specific dollar amount with one wholesaler,                   that do not
 appear on invoices.      Discounts are nearly impossible to trace, quantify, and assign to a particular
 product, and yet are an important component of the market.             If invoice prices change and cash

 discounts compensate, the data will show a change when none has occurred.               However, the rebate
 rules explicitly instructed firms to include cash discounts in their calculation of best and average
 prices; thus the rule did not provide any incentive for firms to alter their rebate (v, invoice)

 policies.     However, some flexibility in assigning cash rebates will minimize observed change and
 the existence of rebates adds considerably      to measurement      error in the data.21
             IMS takes out a large fraction of all price dispersion before the data are seen by anyone,

 I do observe one source of dispersion in my data: a type of quantity discounting,              For example,

 tablets can come in bottles of 10 or 1,000. The latter size might not be very practical for a small

pharmacy although the cost per pill is usually lower.           Manufacturers       also use special types of
packaging to take advantage of heterogeneous          consumers.      Proprietary    convenience     packaging

like “accudose” packs that mark a patient’s          daily dose contain the same chemical entity as
simpler presentations       but cost much more.       IMS also reports        payment     sources,    including

Medicaid, for some drugs in the sample.
         The IMS data have two important features,         The first is that what MS refers to as the
“manufacturer” is not always the actual manufacturer;           instead it is the labeler,   A manufacturer

may label all or part of its own output,      It may also sell all or part of its output to one or more
labelers who put their own firm name on the package.               The labeler, not the manufacturer,         is
responsible to HCFA for the Medicaid Rebate on all its products.            Thus each labeler has its own

AMP and rebate amount which could differ from other firms selling the identical product.                  I can
identify the true set of manufacturers     allowed to make a given drug because each one must have

filed an NDA or an ANDA with the FDA.              However, some manufacturers           sell all their output
to labelers, in which case they will never show up as an IMS manufacturer.                The manufacturer

and the labeler are synonymous        for brand observations,    but many generic drugs have multiple


    21 Additionally, pharmaceutical companies sometimes sell products as a bundled package; they
combine a sale item with a full price item and charge one price for the two. The prices imputed by the
Office of Inspector General average away the deep discount, thus concealing a potential “best price. ”
Bundling therefore also contributes to fins’ ability to conceal change.

                                                    18
 labelers.   In this paper I focus on only one generic class, the distributors,    and do not analyze the

 ANDA holder category.        ANDA holders have data that are unexpectedly          difficult to work with,

 perhaps because they have a different set of customers          and different types of contracts than

 generic distributors.   ANDA data are significantly     more problematic    to analyze and are omitted
 from the analysis hereafter.

         I drop any drug in the IMS dataset which is not listed in the FDA Orange Book22, my
 main source of information        on the state of competition    in the market.       I also drop those
 observations    for which I cannot identify the competitive      class due to some anomaly in the
market, those whose labeler is “Manufacturer         Not Stated, ” and also those that have internally
inconsistent    reported units.   The remaining data are described in Table IV.


IV. The Problem of Identifying          Price Changes Due to OBRA

         The prices given by the data exhibit two main patterns. The first is a step-like pattern;
prices are flat for several months and then rise by a small amount,       The increases typically come
at irregular intervals and vary somewhat in size, The other pattern is really a lack of pattern, a

scatter of points perhaps sloping up or down.          A clear upward jump in January         1991 is not

visible to the casual observer.     A simple statistic that should be illuminating     is a comparison of

price growth before and after the law for drugs affected and unaffected by the legislation.           The
GAO tried this and finds that HMO outpatient           drug prices increased      faster in the year after

OBRA was implemented          than the year before, while hospital drug prices did the opposite, but
does not feel confident in attributing     that difference to 0BRA.23     I perform the same exercise
with drugstore and hospital outpatient      drugs and report the results in Table 111, Not only do

hospital growth rates increase more, which was not predicted, the standard deviations are very
large while the mean changes are quite small,       This methodology    makes it difficult to conclude

that one group had a significantly     larger price increase than another.




    22See Note 17. About 10 chemicals are listed in the IMS dataset and not in the Orange Book,

    23ibid 1993. p2. Their methodology compmes price growth between July 1989 and July 1990 to
growth between July 1990 and January 1992.

         Another approach that should be helpful is to look at whether price changes around the

time of OBRA’S implementation       are correlated with characteristics    that give the firm an incentive
to raise price.   The framework discussed above predicts that price changes in response to the
Medicaid    Rebate Rules will depend on several characteristics           of an invoice,     However,    my

dataset contains no invoice information;         the analysis will have to use averaged values for a
presentation.

         Medicaid’s market share (Medicaid Share) in 1990 of a particular drug will determine the

strength of the incentive to raise prices for any given price distribution.        The effects of both the
best price and the average price rules will depend on the importance            of sales to Medicaid.     In
the extreme case of no Medicaid sales, the firm will have no direct reason to change its prices
(although it may respond to the incentives and choices of other firms), Unfortunately          the variable

Medicaid Share is available for only about half the observations          in the dataset.   The values this
variable takes depend on the formulary rules in different states in 1990 and Federal Medicaid
reimbursement     rules. The Federal program limited reimbursement        of state Medicaid expenditures

for competitive   brands to the price of available generics.       A state therefore had an incentive to
restrict use of competitive brands since it would not be fully reimbursed for them.24 The mean

value of Medicaid share is lower in the competitive brand class than among generics or patented

drugs.
         The best price rule gives firms an incentive to increase their lowest prices.       Since the data

only report average prices, it seems as though we cannot make use of this incentive.               However,
large package sizes usually have a lower unit price than small packages, whether due to lower




    u See Soumerai et al for a description of state Medicaid policies and their effects,

                                                    20
per unit costs or price discrimination.    If the largest packages are sold at the lowest prices, large

packages will be more likely to find the “best price” provision binding.         In such a case, firms w il1
want to raise the price of larger package sizes more.           Smaller packages with higher unit prices
will not see as large a rise. We should see package size predicting price increases under the best

price legislation and for competitors of firms subject to the best price rule. The variable Relative

Size is defined to be a package’s own size (e.g. 100 tablets) over the largest size available for

that drug and firm (e.g. if 1000 is the largest size, Relative Size= lOO/lOOO=.1). Relative Size
varies from 0.0017 to a maximum of one. Note that package size is fixed, although the quantity

sold of different package sizes may change over time,
        More price dispersion     raises the probability       of a brand finding the MFC binding and

therefore increasing its lowest prices. In the case of competitive brands, the level of competition
may affect the level of price dispersion.         Borenstein   and Rose (1992) find that competition        is

positively associated with price dispersion.       A greater number of generic competitors       or a lower
Hetilndahl   Index would therefore imply a stronger price rise on the part of the brand to avoid
the negative impact of the legislation.      Similar reasoning       extends to patented brand duopoly

markets .25 The variables Drugstore        He~ and Hospital        He~ are Herfindahl      indices for the

Drugstore and Hospital markets respectively,         calculated over the number of labelers (including

brands) selling a drug in December        1990,     Number of ANDAs measures the number of firms

which have been approved by the FDA to manufacture               the product by the end of 1990, Notice

that this is a fundamentally   different measure of competition       than the number of labelers listed
by IMS, on which the Hetilndahl      variables are based.
       To illustrate the difficulty of picking up the effects of the OBRA legislation, I regress the

log difference in drugstore price (over fifteen months) on concentration        in the market, the market
share of Medicaid, and the relative size of the package.           The results are reported for the three
main classes in Table IV.      The results are extremely inconclusive;       very little is significant,   let

alone of the predicted sign. However, this regression does not control for characteristics            of the
drugs which may be affecting price movements.             A drug’s prices have trends due to exogenous
factors such as changing technology, changing demand, and seasonal effects, although we expect



     25A duopoly market is one where each fm has its own brand name, but the two firms are selling
the identical product. (Usually because a foreign firm has licensed the product to two US firms.)

 to see presentation variation within the drug. Hence, it is very difficult to identify small changes

 in prices with this method and the explained variation is very low. The problem with interpreting
 Tables III and IV is that we are trying to explain any change due to the legislation and overall
 trends in different drugs.     The effects of the legislation        will be small and are likely to be

 swamped by important trends in technology and demand when aggregate changes are examined.
 Exploiting    the time series available for each presentation        goes some way toward solving this
 problem.


 v.       Estimation   of Price Shifts at the Implementation          of OBRA

          In this section   I estimate     the magnitude      and sign of any change     in prices at the

implementation     of OBRA 90. The dependent variable is one of two variables: Drugstore Price

or Hospital Price, for three competitive        classes.    Although quantity data are available, they are

extremely difficult to fit well because of the many outliers and differing buying patterns across

presentations.    The results are very unstable, so I do not discuss them in the paper, but focus on
prices.

Brands
          I examine the behavior of price over the two years surrounding January 1, 1991, the first

effective date of the new policy.        The basic regression uses log price as the dependent variable,
The log form of the dependent variable allows shift and trend terms to be expressed in percent
changes and therefore be estimated as a constant across presentations            and drugs,     Since every
drug is experiencing different demand and supply conditions, it is important to allow for different

growth rates and seasonal patterns across drugs. Therefore, every presentation of every drug has
its own intercept and time trend.         Additional   variables accounting   for quarterly movements    in

price and quantity     are included.zb      These controls produce      adjusted R2’s of over 0.8 in all

regressions.

          Each of the explanato~    variables described in section IV is interacted           with the Rule

Dummy,      Rule Dummy is zero until the legislation takes effect and one thereafter.      Each equation

also includes Rule Dummy on its own which will capture class-specific shocks to price not related



   26For example, quantities sold are about 20% higher in Mar, June, Sept, and December than the other
months of the year. Prices are more likely to change in Jan, April, July, and Ott than other months.

                                                       22
 to any of the variables discussed above.          For a branded class the equation is:



                 log pi = PIMedicaidShurei *RD + ~2RelutiveSizei *~
                        + ~3DrugstoreHe#t *RD + ~4Number~ANDAsi                     *RD             (4)
                           + ~5RD + CONmOU             i + e,



 where the controls are presentation         time trends, quarterly shifts, and presentation      intercepts.    I
 analyze both hospital and drugstore markets separately; Pi is either drugstore price or hospital
 price.    The results for brands are reported in Table VH.
           The competitive brand class, as expected, has the results most consistent with the theory.
 The coefficients        on the first three explanatory         variables   have the predicted   sign and are

 significant    at conventional    levels.   A larger Medicaid         Share increases    average price, which
indicates the legislation      is creating an overall incentive to increase price.          The coefficient     on
Relative Size shows that larger packages experience a larger average price increase, evidence that

they may be disproportionately          represented    among ‘best’ prices,       The positive coefficient      on

Number ofANDAs           is consistent with the relationship found in Borenstein and Rose (1992); more

competitors increase price dispersion which in turn increases a firm’s incentive to raise its lowest

prices, increasing average price. The coefficients on Rule Dummy and Drugstore He~ are both
negative and insignificant.       The regression fits well, which we can see in the adjusted R2 of 0.96.

Although the first three coefficients are positive, not all presentations           are predicted to have the
same response when the law takes effect.              I construct the total effect of the variables reported
in Table VII (X6) for each presentation.           The median change is 4.3% while the mean change

across presentations is 4% with a standard error of .970. In total, the average price of competitive
brand pills rises after the law takes effect. This number can be contrasted to the average monthly
price increase in this class of 0.2% (although some presentation                prices grow much quicker or

slower).
           Competitive    brand hospital price is predicted to rise less than drugstore price because

some of the hospital drugs are used for inpatients and are not subject to the regulation.            The on] y

significant coefficient is that of Relative Size which is larger than the drugstore coefficient; the

others are insignificant,    either because the incentives are too weak to move all hospital prices or


                                                        23
because of the additional measurement error created by cash rebates, The mean presentation time
trend in the hospital regression is negative, which is consistent with hospitals negotiating           low
prices for brands because of competition from generics.        The combined effect of all the variables
is a just significant six percent increase on average.       In sum, in the competitive      brand class it

looks as if the MFC and the average price provision combined are working to increase drugstore
prices of those presentations      with the strongest match to the incentives in the bill.
         Patented brands face competition      from therapeutic substitutes,   and their competitors    are
subject to the same incentives as themselves,       To the extent brands compete against therapeutic

substitutes, the strategic effect of the MFC should apply to patented brand pricing,          However, if

the level of price dispersion is lower due to lack of generic alternatives, then the chance that the

MFC is binding in the drugstore         or hospital sector is lower,    Patented brands may be more

affected by the average price provision than competitive brands.         However, patented brands are

also likely to be bumping up against the inflation constraint already and therefore may have no
“room” to raise prices, regardless of the effectiveness      of the MFC or average price provisions,

The results     in Table VII show that the specific        predictors   of the increase   in prices    are
insignificant   for patented brands, although Rule Dummy is positive and significant            at the 670

level. Overall price levels may have moved up, but in the absence of correlation between prices
and the incentives in the legislation, it is unclear that OBRA had any effect on patented brands.
It is interesting to note that patented brand time trends are larger than competitive        brand trends,

which is consistent with stronger price growth in the class. Again, the hospital regression yields
no significant coefficients.



Generic fitimation

         Measures of market concentration      are included in the generic regressions although many
researchers view generic competitors as zero-profit price-takers playing a Bertrand game. There

is a substantial   literature   that suggests the generic industry is not playing a Bertrand        game.

Wiggins and Maness (1995), Frank and Salkever (1995), and Caves et al. (1991) all document
that generic price decreases steadily with the number of generic suppliers.        Generic prices could
respond to the incentives of the average price provision if they face a downward-sloping          demand
curve.   The hetilndahl     variables will have positive coefficients   if prices increase more when



                                                    24
 concentration       is high, for example.
           The specification      for generic producers contains an additional variable,           Brand Medicaid

 Share is the share of the Medicaid market sold by the competitive                   brand in 1990. Competitive
 brand and generic markets are matched so that the variable is the Medicaid share of the relevant

 competitive brand for each generic.            The purpose of including this variable is to track when the

 generic’s competitor is facing a large MFC or average price incentive due to a large amount of

Medicaid      sales.     Such a competitor       will respond      more strongly      to the legislation,      thereby

engendering       a stronger change in the generic’s optimal price.                 Due to the large number of

presentations     in the generic clmses, each drug-form gets its own time trend that is forced to be
equal across presentations         in the drug-fom.27       The equation to be estimated for the generic class

is:

                     log ‘i   = PI MedicaidSharei*RD + ~2RelativeSizei *RD
                              + P~(DrugstoreHe@t or Numkr~ANDAsJ        *RD                              (5)
                              + ~4BrandMedicaidSharei *RD + P~RuleDummy
                              + comoui           + ei




The variable Medicaid Share is not included in the specification                  for hospital price.    There is no
reason why a generic product’s hospital price should be influenced by its Medicaid share, since

the rebate amount does not depend on generic hospital prices at all, However, generic hospital

prices could be affected by the brand’s behavior in the hospital market.                    This depends on the
brand’s Medicaid share, the size of the package, and the concentration                 in the market, so all these
variables are included.
          The simple generic results are displayed in Table VIII.                 The two sides of the table use
different measures of concentration          in the market, either a herfindahl index or the number of

ANDAs       extant     in 1990.      A larger    relative    size significantly     increases   prices   across    all
specifications.        In column one, the herfindahl         index and the product’s       Medicaid      share have

positive coefficients, which is consistent with the theory, but they are only significant at the nine

and twelve percent levels, respectively.            Since the average price provision           has an ambiguous



      27Testing this restriction on brands reveals it cannot be rejected in about half the drugs.

effect on prices, the lack of significance of Medicaid Share could be expected.          In both drugstore

regressions the coefficient on Brand Medicaid Share is significant and negative.             This result is
unexpected, contrary to the incentives described above, and also very robust.            More research is
needed to ascertain        why a generic firm should lower prices for these presentations.             The

he~lndahl results on the lefthand side of the table are weak, with size the only variable behaving

as expected.

        The specifications      using Number of NDAs         as the measure of market concentrate ion are
somewhat     better.     In column three, drugstore prices fall with the imposition        of the law for

markets with a larger Number of ANDAs.             Again, the coefficient on Relative Size is positive and

significant and that of Medicaid Share is positive but insignificant.         The negative coefficient on

Brand Medicaid Share persists in both drugstore regressions.              However, in the hospital sector

products facing a brand with considerable           sales to Medicaid may raise prices more than others

(eleven percent significance).       The hospital results are consistent with the strategic effect of the

MFC.     Perhaps       this is because hospitals     are likely to be getting low prices from branded
manufacturers     and these low prices trigger the MFC. Generic time trends are small and negative,
in contrast to the positive brand trends.
        The presentations      which are most likely to display the strategic effect most strongly are
those where package size and Medicaid share are high, giving the brand an incentive to raise
price, and the number of generic players is few, giving the generic an incentive to respond to

softer brand pricing.      In principle one could include an interaction term of all three variables, but
the interpretation     of a triple interaction   term is awkward.    Instead, in Table VIII 1 restrict the
sample to larger values of one of the variables, and include an interaction term composed of the

other two.     The interaction terms should have positive coefficients.        I also report the results of
a regression restricting the sample to markets where there are fewer than ten outstanding ANDAs.

         A perfectly clean test of the strategic effect would use hospital data, because the law
provides no direct incentive to change hospital prices. However, the hospital data is confounded

with inpatient drugs, so I use drugstore data where the average price provision does affect generic
drugstore pricing.      However, the average price provision creates no incentive for a generic firm
to increase prices of large presentations        more than others, or to increase prices on presentations
where the brand’s Medicaid share is higher, so the use of drugstore data should not be biasing


                                                       26
my results.
         The results for generic drugstore prices (only) are displayed in Table IX. The coefficient

on Number of ANDAs increases in magnitude compared to the full sample result; the effect of

increased concentration        on price is stronger when the market is less competitive           to begin with.

Relative Size is again positive and significant,         and somewhat larger than the coefficient in the

unrestricted     sample.   Brand Medicaid Share is still negative, but declines in magnitude              and is
insignificant,     This variable seems to have a stronger effect in more competitive               markets with

more ~DAs.          Medicaid Share is insignificantly        different from zero in both regressions.      In the

concentrated      markets Rule Dummy becomes             significantly     positive,   but Rule Dummy    is also

controlling for the effects of the average price provision.              The total effect of all the variables is
approximately      zero on average, as in Table VIII.
        The interaction results display further evidence for the existence of a strategic effect in
the generic segment of the market.         All the interaction terms have positive coefficients,         but the
interacted variables on their own have negative signs; the interpretation               of the overal 1 change in

a variable is reported in the last lines of the table, The net effect of increasing any of the three
variables of interest is to increase generic price when the law changes, although some increases

are close to zero. The most important result is that when the sample is restricted to concentrated

markets, increasing either package size or brand Medicaid share raises the generic price upon

imposition of the law. When the sample is limited and the interaction included, increasing Brand

Medicaid Share from .05 to .15 in a concentrated             market raises the price change in response to

the law by six percent.        Similarly, if Relative Size moves from 0.4 to 1, generic prices increase

by three percent more when the law takes effect.             This suggests that generic producers in a less
competitive      environment    respond strategically    to the actions of the brand in the market.         The
more incentive the brand has to raise the price of a particular product, the more likely the generic
equivalent of that product shows a price increase also. Columns three and four of Table IX are
symmetric regressions      that display similar, though somewhat weaker, results.


Other Variations
        I tested the results reported above by running the same specifications              on data from 1989-

1990 rather than 1990-1991.        In these regressions the Rule Dummy turns to one in January, 1990.



                                                        27
If the results are due to a regularity of the pharmaceutical         market that I am not controlling for,

the 1990 results will be similar to the 1991 results.        None of the coefficients on the Rule Dummy
variables are at all similar.     Most coefficients     are not significant;   a few significant coefficients

appear in the regressions       on hospital price.     For the reasons discussed      above, I consider the
hospital     results in the paper to be less reliable.         To check robustness,      I investigate   other

functional forms of the price regressions.           One outlier drug affects the competitive      brand and
generic results quite strongly because its Medicaid share is more than twice that of the next
highest drug.     I do not have a good explanation         for why its Medicaid share is so high, I drop

those observations     from the sample and the results reported here.2a Otherwise,            the results are

quite robust.
           Merck & Co already had a MFC scheme in place for Medicaid                    sales in 1990.29 If

Merck is constrained      by its own MFC pre-OBRA,            its prices will not change in the expected
manner after OBRA.        I re-estimate the regressions above without including Merck observations.

The results are almost identical to those of the whole sample. A self-imposed             and self-monitored
MFC might not have been very credible to competitors,                 hence Merck might not have been
different.


VI. Conclusions
           The results presented here do not show textbook responses to the OBRA legislation               by
pharmaceutical     prices in either magnitude or significance.        As noted above, the rules are quite

complex,      In particular, they do not imply that we should see prices rise for all presentations        of
all drugs.    However, if we look for responses among groups of products most strongly affected




     2s The drug nifedipine has a value for Medicaid share of .43. This is extraordinary considering that
the drug faces generic competition and the range for the rest of the competitive brand sample is Oto .18.
Additionally, the drug has two branded suppliers and only one has a high share, which is suspicious. (The
other firm has a Medicaid share of about .2.)

    ‘g “In 1990 the Company initiated its Equal Access to Medicines Program (EAMP) on its single
source products under which it offered its “best price” discount to state Medicaid programs that grant open
access to the Company’s products. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 largely reflects the
Company’s approach, subject to implementing regulations. ”

by the legislation,      the expected responses are visible, though small.                  In particular, brands facing
generic competition        raised some average prices after OBRA was implemented,                           and, crucial] y.
prices increased        for those products          with characteristics        corresponding     to incentives        in the
legislation.     The average drugstore price of a branded drug facing generic competition                           increased

by about four percent.             In particular,    drugstore prices rose for large package sizes, for drugs
where Medicaid was a large purchaser, and in markets with many generic competitors.                                 Although

Federal and state governments             reduced pharmaceutical            expenditure,   and therefore had to collect

that much less in taxes, some non-Medicaid                consumers paid higher prices for some products, and
some pharmaceutical         firms may have become better off. These price changes illustrate the risk
with MFC clauses:          MFCS have distributional             consequences      that may be unanticipated.
                                                                                                                                ;.
           I find little evidence that brands protected by a patent responded to the MFC.                           None of
the characteristics      corresponding      to the incentives in the legislation are significant in predicting

price changes.         This may be due to the inflation cap suppressing                    a response to the best and
average price provisions            or less dispersion          in ex ante prices.         Hospital     prices are poorly

measured; this fact combined with weaker incentives for the hospital market results in almost no

significant coefficients in the hospital regressions for either brands or generics.

           Secondly,     generic     pharmaceutical       prices     responded      to the price        increases     of the

competitive brands.        The average presentation             did not experience a price increase, but those in

concentrated markets, with large package sizes and high sales to Medicaid, had significant price
increases.      The result that the number of generic manufacturers                    in the market affects generic
response     to brand pricing         provides      empirical     support     for the strategic       effect of the MFC

postulated by Cooper (1986) and others.                Generics in markets with few competitors               are the only
fm    that could possibly have strictly benefitted from the legislation.                     Although generics had to
rebate about one and one-half percent (ten percent of fifteen percent) of their sales to Medicaid,
price increases on some presentations               combined with likely quantity gain could have offset the
rebate payments for firms with the right product mix.
           A remarked upon above, the estimates reported here may not apply to all segments of the
indust~.       The data I have do not include prices to HMOS (or pharmaceutical                         benefit managers




                                                            29
 like Medco), the types of institutions     likely have the pre-OBRA binding low price.30 The price
 cap restricting   overall price growth to the rate of inflation            probably   restrained   some price
 increases we might have expected under the other incentives                in the law.    It is therefore not

 surprising    to find that these data show the expected          results    of the MFC for only a few
 competitive    classes and sales channels of drugs.         However,       it is impotiant   to note that, in
principle, an MFC’S indirect effect on competition could completely counteract the desired, direct

effect on expenditure.      Because the data report average prices it is impossible            to examine the
change in the distribution     of prices within and across channels.           Such an examination      wou Id

reveal more subtle and interesting effects of the legislation and should be area of future research.

     32@uation (4) is estimated, Standard errors are in parentheses. The sample for each column includes
all observations in the indicated competitive class. The dependent variable is the log of price in the
appropriate distribution channel. Intercepts for each presentation and presentation time trends are included
but not reported. Both brands’ drugstore prices have mostly small, positive time trend coefficients. After
-.132, the next lowest time trend is -.016 in the competitive brand drugstore regression. The competitive
brand hospital regression shows considerable variability across presentation time trends, unlike the patented
brand results.
