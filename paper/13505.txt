Is Unemployment More Costly Than Inflation?
David G. Blanchflower
NBER Working Paper No. 13505
October 2007
JEL No. E24,E31

                                                ABSTRACT

Previous literature has found that both unemployment and inflation lower happiness. This paper extends
the literature by looking at more countries over a longer time period. It also considers the impacts
on happiness of GDP per capita and interest rates. I find, conventionally, that both higher unemployment
and higher inflation lower happiness. Interest rates are also found to enter happiness equations negatively.
Changes in GDP per capita have little impact on more economically developed countries, but do have
a positive impact in the poorest countries -- consistent with the Easterlin hypothesis. I find that unemployment
depresses well-being more than inflation. The least educated and the old are more concerned about
unemployment than inflation. Conversely, the young and the most educated are more concerned about
inflation. An individual's experience of high inflation over their adult lifetime lowers their current
happiness over and above the effects from inflation and unemployment. Unemployment appears to
be more costly than inflation in terms of its impact on wellbeing.

         “…I should say, like some we have heard of, no, a dreary, desolate, and indeed, quite abject and
         distressing one, what we might call, by way of eminence, the dismal science” Thomas Carlyle,
         1849

         U.S. Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.

         "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
         their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
         happiness."

Despite what Thomas Carlyle said when he was arguing that slavery was morally superior to
allowing the market to work, economics is no longer the dismal science. A growing body of
literature in the economics of happiness has recently emerged. According to Krueger and Schkade
(2006), since 2000, 157 papers and books have been published using data on life satisfaction and
subjective well-being. There have also recently been two summary articles on the relevance of
happiness research for economists in the Journal of Economic Perspectives (Di Tella and
MacCulloch, 2006) and the Journal of Economic Literature (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). It is now
fashionable to try to understand the pursuit of happiness.

I investigate the determinants of happiness and its micro-economic and macro-economic correlates.
I make use of aggregate data from twenty-five OECD countries, and micro-data from twenty. I
also model individual’s reports on what they expect will happen to their life a year ahead. I find a
role for inflation rates, interest rates and unemployment rates, elevated levels of which all lower
happiness. Higher per capita GDP levels only have an impact on the happiness levels of poorer
countries.

Section 1 provides background to the micro-economic research conducted on happiness. Section 2
examines previous research on the macroeconomics of happiness. Section 3 reports econometric
evidence using macroeconomic data from an unbalanced country panel. Section 4 uses
microeconomic data on life satisfaction. Section 5 provides conclusions and estimates of the size
of the marginal rate of substitution between unemployment and inflation – the slope of the
indifference curve. Is unemployment more costly than inflation? My estimates imply that,
across EU countries, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate lowers well
being by at least one and a half times as much as a one percentage point increase in the
inflation rate.

1. Introduction
It is now in vogue to try to understand the pursuit of happiness. 1 The topic has attracted the
attention of medical statisticians, psychologists, economists, and other investigators including

1
  Happiness research continues to be controversial. For example, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard writing in the Daily
Telegraph on 25th April 2007, asserted that, without attribution, that this is "an area of research viewed as frivolous by
monetarists". This stands in direct contrast to the views of Bernard van Praag writing in a recent paper who suggested
that "It is our prediction that in the next decade the measuring of cardinal utility or satisfaction by means of satisfaction
questions will become a matter of routine....This implies that the methodology of what is now called 'happiness
economics' probably will become one of the major instruments of socio-economic policy. At the moment we stand just
at the beginning" (2007, p.65). See also the discussion in letters to the Financial Times in early June 2007 in response
to Martin Wolf's June 6th article in the FT entitled 'Why progressive taxation is not the route to happiness'.



                                                             1
Easterlin (2003), Frey and Stutzer (2002), Lucas et al (2004), Layard (2005), Smith et al (2005),
Ubel et al (2005), Gilbert (2006).

In general economists have focused on modelling two fairly simple questions, one on life
satisfaction and one on happiness. These are typically asked as follows.

Q1. Happiness – (e.g. from the US General Social Survey)

"Taken all together, how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very
happy, pretty happy or not too happy?"

Q2. Life satisfaction – from the Eurobarometer Surveys

"On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with
the life you lead?"

Economists have had longstanding reservations about the reliability of interpersonal comparisons
of well-being. However, Krueger and Schkade (2006) have examined the persistence of
individual's responses to well-being questions over a two week period and conclude that the test-
retest correlations were reasonably high and "are probably sufficiently high to support much of the
research that is currently being undertaken on subjective well-being, particularly where group
means are being compared."

One definition of happiness is the degree to which an individual judges the overall quality of his or
her life as favourable. Psychologists view it as natural that a concept such as happiness should be
studied in part by asking people how they feel. As a validation of the answers to recorded
happiness levels, it turns out that answers to happiness and life satisfaction questions are correlated
with:

1. Objective characteristics such as unemployment.

2. Assessments of the person’s happiness by friends and family members.

3. Assessments of the person’s happiness by his or her spouse.

4. Heart rate and blood-pressure measures of response to stress.

5. The risk of coronary heart disease.

6. Duration of authentic or so-called Duchenne smiles. A Duchenne smile occurs when both the
zygomatic major and obicularus orus facial muscles fire, and human beings identify these as
‘genuine’ smiles (Ekman, Friesen and O’Sullivan (1988); Ekman, Davidson and Friesen (1990)).

7. Skin-resistance measures of response to stress.

8. Electroencephelogram measures of prefrontal brain activity (Davidson and Fox, 1982).



                                                   2
By now the standard econometric approach is to estimate an OLS or ordered logit using micro-data,
with the coding such that the higher the number the more satisfied an individual is. Generally, it
makes little or no difference if you use an OLS or an ordered logit, although the size of the
coefficients will be different. The datasets used in such studies range from an individual cross-
section in one country (Luttmer, 2005) sometimes with a number of years pooled (Blanchflower
and Oswald, 2004) and sometimes even for multiple years across many countries (Di Tella and
MacCullough, 2006).

It is apparent that there is a great deal of stability in happiness and life satisfaction equations, no
matter what country is looked at, what dataset or time period used, whether the question relates to
life satisfaction or happiness, or how the responses are coded (whether in three, four, five or even
as many as ten categories). The main findings from happiness and life satisfaction equations
estimated on individual level micro data are as follows (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004).

Happiness across countries is higher among:
Women
Married people
The highly educated
The healthy
Those with high income
The young and the old – U-shaped in age (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2006b)
The self-employed (Blanchflower, 2004),

Happiness is low among:
Newly divorced and separated people
Adults in their mid to late 40s
The unemployed and the disabled
Immigrants and minorities
Those in poor health
Commuters (Kahneman et al, 2004)

Wellbeing is correlated with life events such as being unemployed or being married. There is also
evidence that well-being is U-shaped over the life cycle in the USA and Europe, minimizing in the
late forties for both men and women, even after controlling for cohort effects (for males the
minimum is 49.5 and 45.1 for women in the USA, and 44.1 and 42.6 for Europe respectively).
Why is happiness U-shaped over the life cycle? The answer is probably a combination of a number
of factors.

a) Individuals learning to adapt to their weaknesses and in mid-life quelling their infeasible
aspirations.

b) Inherently cheerful people living longer, maybe?

c) A comparison process may be at work – I have seen my school friends die and I count my
blessings (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2006b)



                                                  3
There is also evidence that current levels of happiness are impacted by what happened to you as a
child. That is true even for older people. There is also evidence that parental divorce, death and
parental quarrelling lower happiness many years later (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2006c).
Blanchflower and Oswald (2006c) also find some evidence that parents who divorce but didn’t
quarrel have the biggest negative impact on their children’s happiness, presumably because divorce
in such circumstances comes as a surprise to the children.

What about money? The data shows that richer people are happier and healthier. Gardner and
Oswald (2007) have found that Britons who receive lottery wins of between £1,000 and £120,000
go on to exhibit better psychological health. But individuals in the USA were found to be less
happy if their incomes are far above those of the poorest people (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004).
People, however, do appear to compare themselves more with well-off families, so that perhaps
they get happier the closer their income comes to that of rich people around them. Relative income
certainly appears to matter. Luttmer (2005), for the USA, finds that higher earnings of neighbours
are associated with lower levels of self-reported happiness, controlling for an individual's own
income. Alesina et al (2004), find, using a sample of individuals across the USA (1981-1996) and
Europe (1975-1992) that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves as happy when
inequality is high, even controlling for individual income. The effect is stronger in Europe than in
the USA.

Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) tried to evaluate the value in money terms of various non-
economic outcomes such as marriage and found that it would take a lot of money to compensate for
a lasting marriage. The money value of events like unemployment and divorce are large. But the
relation between measures of well-being and income is actually quite weak. Kahneman et al
(2006) have argued that subjective well-being is connected to how people spend their time. People
with higher income tend to devote relatively more of their time to work. "On balance the activities
that high income individuals spend relatively more of their time engaged in are associated with no
greater happiness, on average, but with slightly higher tension and stress".

2. Macroeconomics and happiness
In the USA in 2006, only 13% of people in the General Social Survey said they were not very
happy, 56% were pretty happy and 31% very happy (see below for further details). In the
Eurobarometers for the EU in 2006, 2% said they were not at all satisfied, while 10% were not
very satisfied, 53% fairly satisfied and 34% very satisfied (also see below). Mean happiness and
life satisfaction scores for European countries are presented in Table 1. The data are taken from the
European Quality of Life Survey, 2003, where the results are based on scores from 1-10. Denmark
is highest and Bulgaria is lowest on both measures. The rankings are similar no matter if happiness
or life satisfaction are used.

There is a consistent structure to happiness and life satisfaction scores across countries and across
various datasets broadly replicating the results reported in Table 1. The northern European
countries – especially the Danes, but not the Scots – have generally higher happiness and life
satisfaction scores than residents of Southern Europe, especially Portugal, Italy, Greece and Turkey
(Blanchflower and Bell, 2007). Residents of former Eastern bloc countries have low happiness




                                                 4
scores (Blanchflower, 2001), but are they less happy? This begs the question, whether such
comparisons are meaningful given language and cultural differences?

One way to overcome this in a simple way is to compare countries where the same language is
spoken - Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, USA (as done in Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005,
2006a). In those papers it was argued that Australia's high ranking on the HDI measure was a
paradox given its much lower ranking on happiness and job satisfaction scores. Wolfers and Leigh
(2006) disagreed.

Another way is to look for some other objective criteria. A recent paper by Banks, Marmot,
Oldfield and Smith (2006) argued that Americans are less healthy than Europeans; differences in
blood pressure form part of the author's evidence. Blanchflower and Oswald (2006d) found that
happier nations report systematically lower levels of hypertension. Happiness and blood pressure
are negatively correlated across countries (r=-.6). This seems to represent a first step toward the
validation of cross-country estimates. Denmark has the lowest reported levels of high blood
pressure in our data. Denmark also has the highest happiness levels. Portugal has the highest
reported blood pressure levels and the lowest levels of life satisfaction and happiness. It appears
there is a case to take more seriously the subjective 'happiness' measurements made across
countries and seems meaningful to do cross-country comparisons.

There is evidence that for poorer countries both happiness and life satisfaction have trended up
over time.      An examination of data from the World Database of Happiness
(http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_nat/nat_fp.htm) suggests that this is especially true in
South America between 1997 and 2004 2 and in Eastern Europe since 2001. 3 Hungary is the main
exception.

For the major countries, however, there seems to be little evidence that happiness or life
satisfaction have trended up over time. That is true in the raw happiness data for the USA, as
shown in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004). The most recent data, released in the 2006 General
Social Survey presented in Table 2, confirms that; part A of Table 2 presents the responses to
question Q1 above (%) for the USA. The life satisfaction distributions (%), which are answers to
Q2 above for the UK are presented in part B of Table 2. The data for 1973-2002 are from the
Eurobarometer Trend file (ICPSR #4357) and for 2003-2006 from six subsequent
Eurobarometers. 4 Two facts stand out from these two time series distributions of life satisfaction
and happiness in the UK and the USA. First how little has changed over time – the distributions in
the early 1970s are virtually identical to those observed in 2006. Second, only a very small
proportion of respondents report that they were 'not at all satisfied' with their lives, or in the case of
the USA, that they were 'not at all happy'. Most people report that they are happy.

As can be seen from Figure 1, average happiness levels for the USA are flat, while real GDP per
capita has risen. Wellbeing is flat through time in the other rich countries too, as can be seen from
Figure 2a for France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK and in Figure 2b for Italy, Belgium,
Ireland and Denmark. Note that happiness levels are high in Denmark and low in Italy and France.
There is some sign of an upward trend in Italy and to a lesser extent in Denmark and for a number
of countries including France, Belgium and the UK since 2000. Concerns have been expressed that
this is in part due to the fact that the happiness data are bounded from above (Johns and Ormerod,
2007).

There is some consistent evidence though that the wellbeing of the young (<30) has risen over time
in both the USA and Europe (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2000). The rise is mostly among the
unmarried. Blanchflower and Oswald (2000) also found that this upward trend is not explained by
changing education or work, falling discrimination or rise of youth-oriented consumer goods.

So why doesn’t happiness increase when a wealthy country gets richer? I am not certain, but
possible explanations include:

a) Social comparisons (you compare your 3 BMWs to people with 3 BMWs)

b) Habituation: people adapt to money

c) Mistaken choices (long commutes and working hours).

3. Econometric analysis - Aggregate Data
In the raw data, happiness (and life satisfaction) is negatively correlated with unemployment
(Figure 3) and inflation (Figure 4). DiTella, McCullough and Oswald (2001) show that people are
happier when both inflation and unemployment are low. They find that unemployment depresses
well-being more than does inflation. Wolfers (2003) has shown that greater macro volatility
undermines wellbeing. Wolfers has found that eliminating unemployment volatility would raise
wellbeing by an amount roughly equal to that from lowering the average level of unemployment by
a quarter of a percent. Interestingly the effects of inflation volatility on well-being are smaller.

    Eurobarometers #65.2 (2006); 64.2 (2005); 63.4 (2005); 62.0 (2004); 61.0 (2004); 60.1 (2003).



                                                            6
It also appears that happiness is positively correlated with higher GDP per capita (Figure 5 – taken
from Wolfers and Leigh (2006)). When a nation is poor it appears that extra riches raise happiness.
However, income growth in richer countries is not correlated with growth in happiness. This is the
Easterlin hypothesis (Easterlin, 1974) and is illustrated in Figure 6, which uses data from the
1995/2000 World Values Survey; the slope of the function for western countries is approximately
horizontal. Recently, Deaton (2007) has questioned this view based on data collected by the
Gallup Organization from national samples of adults from 132 countries. He finds that average
happiness is strongly related to per capita national income, but unlike previous studies, finds that
the effect holds across the range of international incomes, and if anything, is slightly stronger in
rich countries. Interestingly, the question used in that survey is different from those used by most
other happiness researchers. Respondents are asked to imagine an eleven rung scale where the
bottom (0) represents “the worst possible life for you” and the top (10) represents “the best possible
life for you.” Respondents are then asked to report “on which step of the ladder do you feel you
personally stand at the present time?” It is unclear whether such a question is eliciting an
evaluation of the respondent’s complete life or how he feels today. Only one year of data are
available and the main analysis is based on only 111 macro observations. I examine this issue in
more detail below and find that GDP per capita impacts the life satisfaction levels of the poorer
European countries (Czech Republic; Greece; Hungary; Poland; Portugal: Spain and Slovakia) but
not the richer countries. Although, of course, data are unavailable from very poor developing
countries.

In this section I examine the impact of macro-economic variables on life satisfaction levels with the
unit of observation the country*year cell, extending the work of Di Tella, McCullough and Oswald
(2001, 2003) and Wolfers (2003) to a larger set of countries and a longer time series. I also
examine the impact of the interest rate itself on happiness. Di Tella, McCullough and Oswald
(2001), for example, restricted their analysis to twelve European countries (Belgium; France;
Denmark; Greece; Germany; Great Britain; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Portugal and
Spain) from 1975-1991, while Wolfers (2003) examined sixteen European countries from 1973-
1998, including the same twelve countries, but adding Austria; Finland; Norway and Sweden.

I extend the data series from 1973 to 2006 and the sample to twenty-five OECD countries i.e.
Austria; Belgium; Canada; Czech Republic; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Greece;
Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Luxembourg; Mexico; the Netherlands; Norway; Poland; Portugal;
Slovakia; Spain; Sweden; Turkey; the UK and the USA. The excluded OECD countries are
Australia; Iceland: Korea; New Zealand and Switzerland. The data should be thought of as an
unbalanced panel of countries. The coverage is as follows - Austria (1995-2006); Belgium (1973-
2006); Canada (1989-2000); the Czech Republic (2001-2006); Denmark (1973-2006); Finland
(1995-2006); France (1973-2006); Germany (1973-2006); Greece (1981-2006); Hungary (2001-
2006); Ireland (1977-2006); Italy (1973-2006); Japan (1974-2004); Luxembourg (1974-2005); the
Netherlands (1974-2005); Poland (2001-2005); Portugal (1985-2005); Slovakia (2001-2005); Spain
(1985-2005); Sweden (1995-2005); UK (1973-2006); USA (1991-2; 1998; 2001-2005). I also have
data on life satisfaction for 1995 for Norway and from 2001-2005 for Turkey.

Data on life satisfaction are taken from the World Database of Happiness based on the averages of
a four point scale. Answers to the question Q2 above are coded 1 if not at all satisfied, two if not



                                                  7
very satisfied, three if fairly satisfied and four if very satisfied, as used in Figures 2a and 2b.
Unemployment rates and inflation (consumer prices – all items) are OECD data.

Table 3 reports five different regressions. Column 1 regresses the mean life satisfaction score in
the country on a set of country dummies with the UK the excluded category, and year dummies.
The pattern of the country dummies is consistent with the findings from the micro-data, that
happiness is highest in Denmark and lowest in Hungary and Slovakia. The UK ranks eighth,
below, in order: Denmark, the Netherlands; the USA; Sweden; Luxembourg; Ireland and Finland.
Column two adds a lagged dependent variable. Although the country dummies reduce in size, the
cross-country pattern remains largely unchanged.

Column 3 of Table 3 includes the country and year dummies and also includes the inflation rate,
GDP per capita in $US at constant exchange rate and constant prices, and the unemployment rate.5
Higher inflation and higher unemployment lower happiness while GDP has no effect. Experiments
were also undertaken with the GDP growth rate, which was always insignificant – results not
reported. Interestingly, adding a significant lagged dependent variable in column 4 lowers the size
of the coefficients on inflation and unemployment, although they both remain significant at
conventional levels. Column 5 reports results excluding both the lagged dependent variable and
GDP per capita.

Table 4 experiments with a variety of further specifications. Column 1 drops the insignificant GDP
variable which has little impact. Column 2 adds a nominal interest rate variable, comprised from
an assortment of Treasury Bill Rates 6 taken from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics
database, which is significant and negative, although it drives the inflation rate to insignificance.
Column three replaces the nominal rate with the real rate, which is just the nominal rate minus the
inflation rate, and now both the inflation rate and the real rate of interest are statistically significant
and negative. GDP is insignificant when added back in column four, while the unemployment rate,
inflation rate and real rate of interest are all significant and negative. Column 5 shows that the
significance of the inflation rate, the unemployment rate and the real rate of interest remains when
the lagged dependent variable is removed.

In general, the literature has found that a percentage point increase in unemployment has a greater
impact on happiness than does a percentage point increase in inflation. Wolfers (2003) found that a
percentage point increase in the unemployment rate causes 4.7 times more unhappiness than a
percentage point increase in inflation. Di Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald (2001) estimated that an
additional percentage point of unemployment caused twice as much of a reduction in happiness as
an additional percentage point of inflation, once country time trends were introduced. These results
were found using disaggregated data, to which I now turn my attention.

An alternative way of modelling well-being is to use data at a disaggregated level. In this section I
make use of data at the individual level from the Eurobarometer surveys for a number of EU
member countries along with data from Norway, Croatia and Turkey for the period 1973-2006
(where available). These are the data that were used to generate the average life satisfaction levels
used for these countries in the earlier section, that were downloaded from the World Database of
Happiness. The life satisfaction question Q2 above has been asked in some, but not all,
Eurobarometer Surveys conducted for the EU every year since 1973 for member countries. As
new countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal join they are added to the surveys so there are
fewer years of data on them. The biggest change in the number of countries in the survey series
occurred in 2004 with the Accession of ten new countries (Czech Republic; Cyprus; Estonia;
Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Malta; Poland; Slovakia and Slovenia known as the A10). Bulgaria
and Romania who became EU members in 2007 were also added to the surveys in 2004 as were the
two EU Candidate Countries of Croatia and Turkey. I only have suitable macro-economic data
from the OECD on four of these countries (Czech Republic; Hungary; Poland and Slovakia) so the
other twelve countries are excluded from my analysis. Data are available on Norway for 1994-
1998 when it was an EU Candidate Country and a member of the OECD. Overall, I make use of
micro-data on over 680,000 individuals from twenty countries - Austria; Belgium; Czech Republic;
Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; the
Netherlands; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Slovakia; Spain; Sweden and the UK. I then map in
annual data on unemployment, inflation and the interest rate for each country. Comparable
schooling data are not available in the Eurobarometer surveys for 1995 so that year is excluded.

Table 5 reports the results of estimating a series of life satisfaction equations columns, using micro
data from these Eurobarometer surveys for the period 1973-2006. 7 The estimation procedure is
ordered logit in the first three columns with the dependent variable set to one if 'not at all satisfied'
and through to four if the respondent reported they were 'very satisfied with the life you lead'.
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used for simplicity in the final two columns with the dependent
variable coded one through four. The equations have the usual set of personal controls for age,
gender, schooling, marital status and labour force status. In all cases the standard errors are
clustered at the level of the country*year to overcome the problem of the common component in
the residuals, known widely as the Moulton (1986, 1991) problem. This adjustment is necessary
when a regression at the level of the individual includes a RHS variable at the level of the country
and year.

It is apparent across this group of 20 countries that life satisfaction is U-shaped in age, minimising
at age 46, is lower for men and for those with less schooling and is especially low for the
unemployed. Life satisfaction is lowest in Hungary followed by Slovakia and highest in Denmark.

Luxembourg and Ireland. The ranking of countries is consistent with those found in Table 3 using
aggregated country level data. Interestingly, the rank ordering of these countries, derived from
column 1 of Table 5 is highly correlated (r=+.84) with the 2006 Human Development Index

Column 2 of Table 5 now adds the annual inflation rate, unemployment rate and GDP per capita.
Adding these various macro variables has little impact on the other coefficients, including those on
the country dummies. As previously found in the aggregate equations above both inflation and
unemployment enter significantly negative – higher unemployment and higher inflation lower
happiness. Higher output, in contrast to the aggregate equation, is found to enter significantly and
raises satisfaction. The real interest rate is added in column three which drives the GDP variable to
insignificance. Column 4 uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for ease of interpretation. The size
of the coefficients fall, but the broad pattern of the results found in column 2 remains unchanged.
The equation in column 4 includes a full set of country time trends, which although significant as a
set of controls, passing the relevant F-test, in order to pick up differential time trends in satisfaction
across countries. However, these have little impact on either the inflation rate or unemployment
rate coefficients, which is confirmed in column 5 that excludes the country*time interaction terms.
When the GDP and real interest rate terms were included separately or collectively with the
country time trends they were always significant and hence were omitted in column 5.

The Easterlin (1974) hypothesis suggests that income growth in richer countries is not correlated
with growth in happiness, whereas there is such a correlation in poorer countries. Table 6 explores
this issue further by re-estimating the equation in column 5 of Table 5 for groups of countries.
Countries are grouped together based on GDP per capita in US$ at constant prices and constant
exchange rates. Column 1 of the Table is restricted to the thirteen richest countries - Austria;
Belgium; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; the Netherlands;
Norway; Sweden and the UK. The unweighted average GDP per capita for this group is $28,777.
Inflation and unemployment both enter negatively, while GDP per capita is insignificant. In
column 2 the equivalent equation is estimated for the remaining seven countries - the Czech
Republic; Greece; Hungary; Poland; Portugal; Slovakia and Spain. This group has an unweighted
average GDP per capita of $9,947. 9 For this sample, once again both the inflation and
unemployment terms are negative, but now GDP per capita enters significantly and positive. The
impact of the GDP variable is especially marked in column 3 for the former East European
countries of the Czech Republic, Hungary; Poland and Slovakia. These are the poorest countries in
the sample. In column 4 for the Southern European countries, which have somewhat higher GDP
levels than those from Eastern Europe, the GDP variable was also significant, although with a
considerably lower coefficient than was the case in column 3. The final column reports an
equivalent equation for the six richest, mostly northern European countries of Denmark; Finland;
France; Luxembourg; Norway and Sweden. GDP was insignificant for this richest group of
countries. For all countries, inflation and unemployment enter negatively in a life satisfaction
equation. These results are consistent with the Easterlin (1974) hypothesis.

Table 7 explores the impact of inflation and unemployment for a variety of sub-groups. Each row
of the table reports the results of estimating an OLS equation with the same controls as in column 5
of Table 5. Indeed, the first row of Table 7 reports the results from that overall equation. OLS is
used here because it is simpler to interpret the coefficients. What stands out from the table is the
stability of the findings, across virtually all groups, that higher unemployment and higher inflation
lower happiness.

In all of the life satisfaction equations estimated to this point I have included controls for the
current inflation rate in the country*year cell. It is perfectly feasible, though, that an individual
who experienced high inflation, and especially hyper-inflation, during their adult lifetime would be
more concerned about the consequences of higher inflation than somebody who had, say, only
experienced low and stable inflation. To isolate any such effects I mapped onto the data file a
variable representing the highest annual inflation rate an individual had experienced in their adult
lifetime. I map in such a variable separately by single year of age for each country and year cell.
For example, for the survey taken in Austria in 1990 for someone aged 45 years, the highest
annual inflation rate between 1964 and 1990 would be used i.e. 96.2%. Similarly, a 45 year old
sampled in Austria in 2005 would have the highest inflation rate of 9.5% between 1979 and 2005.
And so on in each age*country*year cell. The distribution of this variable is as follows.

The inflation rates by country are plotted in a series of figures in the appendix. I also mapped in a
variable for the average inflation experience during an individual’s adult lifetime for each
age*country*year cell.

Table 8 presents the evidence on whether individuals’ personal experiences of inflation over their
lifetime have any incremental value in explaining their level of life satisfaction. Column 1 of Table
8 replicates the results of Table 5, Column 5, for a smaller subset of countries for which I have long
time series of inflation data back to the 1950s (Austria; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany;
Greece; Ireland; Italy; Netherlands; Norway; Portugal; Spain; Sweden; UK) – the coefficients on
both inflation and unemployment are comparable to the results in Table 5. I cluster the standard
errors as previously by country and year. Column 2 adds the variable reflecting the average annual
inflation experience of each individual in our sample given their age, country, and year the life
satisfaction survey was conducted; this term is insignificant. Column 3 substitutes the average
annual experience term for the highest annual inflation rate experienced by each individual over
their lifetime. This term is negatively signed and significant, and its inclusion has essentially no
effect on either the coefficients on inflation or unemployment. The coefficient on individual
unemployment is little different from the full sample case. An individual who has experienced
high inflation in the past has lower happiness today, even holding constant today’s inflation and
unemployment rates. 10

6. Conclusions
Previous literature has found that both unemployment and inflation lower happiness (Di Tella, et al.
(2001) and Wolfers (2003)). This paper extends the literature by looking at more countries over a
longer time period. It provides aggregated data from a panel of 25 countries, including EU


10
   It is also apparent that the effect of this term could be greater for individuals in those countries that have experienced
much higher rates of inflation in the past than others. For example, the term may play more significance for Austrians
or Italians given the historic magnitude of inflation in these countries. This is a possible area for future research.


                                                             12
countries, four East European countries plus Mexico, Canada, the USA and Japan alongside micro-
data from a subset of twenty European countries on nearly seven hundred thousand respondents.

What do our estimates suggest about the relative size of the effects from the unemployment rate
and the inflation rate? The effects of unemployment and inflation, which in row 1 of Table 7 have
coefficients of -.0110 and –.0090 respectively, taken from the equation reported in column 5 of
Table 5, represent the effect upon wellbeing of a one percentage point change in each of the two
independent variables, for simplicity with the interest rate, GDP per capita and lagged dependent
variable omitted. As an example, consider the impact of an increase in the rate of unemployment
from the sample mean of seven and a half percent by one percentage point to eight and a half
percent. According to our estimate, this single-point rise in unemployment diminishes life
satisfaction by 0.0110 units. Consider instead an increase in the inflation rate from the mean of
4.9% by one percentage point to 5.9%. This single-point rise in inflation leads to a 0.0090
reduction in units of life satisfaction. These effects of unemployment and inflation are not small.
Consider the consequences of a rise in the unemployment rate of four percentage points, which is
equal to the standard deviation of unemployment in the sample. This produces a decline in well-
being of 4 times -.0110, which is -.044, and is slightly higher in absolute terms than the standard
deviation of life satisfaction in our panel of countries (mean = 3.14, standard deviation = .04).
Moreover, equality of the two coefficients can be rejected statistically. Life satisfaction is therefore
not captured exactly by a simple linear misery function defined on the sum of inflation and
unemployment rates, because unemployment has a larger weight.

Following Di Tella et al (2001) – henceforth DMO – the implicit utility-constant trade-off between
inflation and unemployment can now be calculated. As in conventional economic theory, their
methodology leads to a measure of the marginal rate of substitution between inflation and
unemployment – the slope of the indifference curve.

      “It is useful to explain what such correlations are likely to mean within a
      conventional natural rate of unemployment analytical framework. The estimation
      describes preferences themselves. Standard economic models suggest, of course,
      that there is no downward-sloping Phillips Curve in the long run. Knowledge of
      iso-utility contours is then of use to policy-makers primarily because it informs
      the choice of an optimal disinflationary path. Our estimates, and more broadly
      this kind of methodology, can be viewed as aiding central bankers concerned with
      the choice of policy trajectories” (2000, p. 338)

There are, however, two consequences of unemployment – society as a whole becomes more
fearful of unemployment (Blanchflower (1991) and some people actually loose their jobs; there are
aggregate and personal effects of unemployment. DMO argue that a way has to be found to
measure the two unpleasant consequences of a rise in unemployment. DMO develop a way to take
account of the extra cost of joblessness, namely, to work out the sum of the aggregate and personal
effects of unemployment. They do so first by calculating the direct effect of an increase in the
unemployment rate on society, as I have done above – I obtained -.0110. The fear of losing a job
appears to be quite prevalent. In a recent survey of working conditions across thirty two European
countries 14.1% and 13.3% across the EU25, of workers agreed or strongly agreed that they might




                                                  13
lose their job in the next six months. 11 12 The proportions were especially high in Eastern Europe
and low in Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and the UK. In the US General Social Survey workers
are asked how likely it is that they will lose their job or be laid-off in the next 12 months and, on
average across the 2002, 2004 and 2006 surveys 11.2% answered 'very likely' or 'quite likely'
(variable joblose). The fear of unemployment appears widespread.

DMO argue that it is apparent from the microeconomic life satisfaction and happiness data that the
person who actually becomes unemployed experiences a much larger cost. I concur. The loss to
the individual from being unemployed can be calculated from the coefficient on being
‘unemployed’ in a life-satisfaction micro regression, like the one reported in column 5 of Table 5,
estimated with OLS to keep the units consistent – I get -.3636. The entire well-being cost of a 1
percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is therefore given by the sum of two
components. Combining the two, I have .0110 + .0036= .0146 as society’s overall wellbeing cost
of a one percentage point rise in the unemployment rate. The implication is that the wellbeing cost
of a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate equals the loss brought about by an extra
1.62 percentage points of inflation. 13 How do I get this?

The reason is that (0.0146/0.0090) = 1.62, where 0.0146 is the marginal unemployment effect on
well-being, and 0.0090 is the marginal inflation effect on well-being from row 1 of Table 7. Hence
1.62 is the marginal rate of substitution between inflation and unemployment. This is almost
identical to the 1.66 obtained by DMO and I replicate exactly their estimate with their set of
countries for many more years, although I get a slightly higher estimate for their countries and their
time period of 1973-1991. 14 Interestingly though, the result is driven by the preferences of those


11
   In the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey workers were asked (Q37a) 'How much do you agree or disagree
with the following statements describing some aspects of your job? - I might lose my job in the next 6 months –
Strongly agree; Agree; Neither agree nor disagree; Disagree; Strongly disagree?'. The proportion answering that they
agreed or strongly agreed by country was as follows - Austria 9%; Belgium 9%; Cyprus 14%; Czech Republic 33%;
Germany 13%; Denmark 7%; Estonia 19%; Spain 15%; Finland 13%; France 8%; Greece 21%; Hungary 22%; Ireland
10%; Italy 9%; Lithuania 23%; Luxembourg 6%; Latvia 19%; Netherlands 18%; Malta 15%; Poland 27%; Portugal
19%; Sweden 20%; Slovenia 27%; Slovakia 15%; United Kingdom 7%; Norway 7%; Switzerland 12%; Bulgaria 23%;
Croatia 19%; Romania 18% and Turkey 19%.

12
   The same question was also asked in the 2003 European Quality of Life Survey; Austria 4.7%; Belgium 6.6%;
Bulgaria 5.1%; Cyprus 12.5%; Czech Republic 15.9%; Denmark 8.5%; Estonia 20.5%; Finland 7.8%; France 9.5%;
Germany 6.5%; Greece 12.4%; Hungary 9.1%; Ireland 6.3%; Italy 6.7%; Latvia 30.1%; Lithuania 32.0%; Luxembourg
8.3%; Malta 8.1%; Netherlands 2.6%; Poland 17.5%; Portugal 12.0%; Romania 17.7%; Slovakia 19.3%; Slovenia
9.4%; Spain 9.6%; Sweden 8.6%; Turkey 27.6%; UK 6.7%; weighted total 11.3%.

13
   The estimated trade-off is 2.81 if the macro estimates are used, for example, from column 3 of Table 5, along with
the estimate of the individual unemployment effect of -0.3636 in row 1 of Table 7. The estimate is 1.61 if the estimates
are used in column 4 of Table 5 which include the country*year interactions.
14
   Note that Di Tella et al (2001) use rolling three year averages and adjust for these omitted variable bias by running
first stage micro life satisfaction equations in each country and year cell and then using the averaged residuals at the
second stage of the regression. Using the micro data and adjusting the standard errors by clustering, the rhs variables
by country and year accomplishes essentially the same adjustment. DMO do not make clear why they use three year
rolling averages and we can see no compelling reasons to do so here; in any case this is unlikely to matter.

living in Greece, Portugal and Spain. This is apparent from Table 6: excluding them the preference
is lowered, but including them generates the bigger role for unemployment.

One alternative way to calculate the marginal rate of substitution between inflation and
unemployment is to control for the real rate of interest, rather than allowing it to vary as I have
done so far. If I recalculate with this specification the unemployment/inflation trade-off becomes
1.38 ((-.0110+.0036)/.0106).

What would I estimate the impact on well to be of these changes? In the case of the UK I
experimented by adding to the micro life satisfaction equations interaction terms between the UK
dummy and the inflation rate, the unemployment rate and the unemployed dummy. The results on
the relevant coefficients, using the same controls as in Table 5, are presented below with t-statistics
in parentheses (n=743,397, Pseudo R2=.1583).

UK*unemployment rate                       .0049 (1.69)
UK*unemployed                             -.0549 (1.95)

This implies coefficients of -.0059 on the inflation rate for the UK, of -.0072 on the unemployment
rate and -.4115 on the unemployed dummy, and consequently a slightly higher
unemployment/inflation trade-off of 1.92. 15

It is also feasible to obtain estimates for sub-groups. I find that females have a similar trade-off to
males (1.61 and 1.58 respectively). The least educated and the old are more concerned about
unemployment – they put the highest weight on unemployment. Conversely, the young and the
most educated and those still studying put the greatest weight on inflation. This runs counter to the
idea that older people care more about inflation as they are more likely to have experienced it
during their adult lives.16 The results are also consistent with this finding when the analysis is done
by cohorts defined by year of birth. Older cohorts care more about unemployment than younger
cohorts.

Johns and Ormerod (2007) have criticised estimates of the trade-off between inflation and
unemployment because the estimates, they argue, ‘vary between different studies’. This lack of

15
   If instead the sample excluded Spain, Greece and Portugal, as in Table 8, which in addition now adds a set of UK
interactions as done here, only the UK*inflation interaction term is significant. When that interaction alone is included
along with the other controls, the estimated unemployment/inflation trade-off for the UK is 1.29.

16
     In contrast Lombardelli and Saleheen (2003) show that older people in the UK have higher expectations for
inflation because they have experienced periods of higher inflation over their adult lives. They found that people in the
age group 45–54 had experienced the highest level of inflation, an average inflation rate of 7.3% over their adult lives.
They found that lifetime inflation experience has a significant effect on people’s inflation expectations.

consensus, they argue is “entirely typical of results in applied macro-economics….Moreover, as
any economic forecaster knows, macro-economic relationships break down more frequently and
more spectacularly than statistical, econometric theory suggests”. What is striking is how wrong
Johns and Ormerod are in relation to the micro-economic happiness data used here. Unlike
macroeconomic data which Johns and Ormerod argue, “contains very little genuine information”
(2007, p.50), micro data contains information in abundance. Micro-econometric analysis concerns
itself with aggregation and omitted variable biases; stability not instability is the order of the day,
as is apparent from the estimates presented here (see Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994).

The main results of the paper can then be summarised as follows:

1. The northern European countries, especially the Danes, have generally higher happiness and life
satisfaction scores than residents of Southern Europe, especially Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain.
Residents of former Eastern bloc countries have particularly low happiness scores.

2. The happiness ranking of countries remains broadly the same when macro controls are included.

3. Consistent with the Easterlin hypothesis, rising GDP per capita does not raise happiness for
developed countries. There is evidence, however, that higher GDP per capita has a positive effect
for poorer countries. This impact was especially marked for the former Communist countries of
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.

4. I estimate the unemployment/inflation trade-off as closer to one and a half than one as implied
by the ‘misery index’. I find that the least educated and, somewhat surprisingly, the old put the
highest weight on unemployment. Conversely, the young and the most educated put the greatest
weight on inflation.

5. Past experience of high inflation during an individual’s adult lifetime lowers their happiness,
over and above the impacts from higher contemporaneous inflation and/or unemployment rates.

6. Unemployment is more costly than inflation in terms of its impact on wellbeing. Our estimates
imply that, across EU countries, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate lowers
well being by approximately 1.6 times as much as a one percentage point increase in the inflation
rate.
