This paper considers a dynamic, non-steady state environment in which wage dispersion exists and
evolves in response to shocks. Workers do not observe firm productivity and firms do not commit
to future wages, but there is on-the-job search for higher paying jobs. The model allows for firm turnover
(new start-up firms are created, some existing firms die) and firm specific productivity shocks. In a
separating equilibrium, more productive firms signal their type by paying strictly higher wages in every
state of the market. Consequently, workers always quit to firms paying a higher wage and so move
efficiently from less to more productive firms. As a further implication of the cost structure assumed,
endogenous firm size growth is consistent with Gibrat's law. The paper provides a complete characterization
and establishes existence and uniqueness of the separating (non-steady state) equilibrium in the limiting
case of equally productive firms. The existence of equilibrium with any finite number of firm types
is also established. Finally, the model provides a coherent explanation of Danish manufacturing data
on firm wage and labor productivity dispersion as well as the cross firm relationship between them.

1    Introduction
The model studied in this paper is one in which employers set the wage paid
in the tradition of Diamond (1971), Burdett and Judd (1983), Burdett and
Mortensen (1998), Coles (2001) and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010). It
diﬀers from these papers by introducing (i) recruiting behavior at a cost of
the form estimated by Merz and Yashiv (2007), (ii) firm entry and exit, and
(iii) firm specific productivity shocks. Its purpose is to identify a rich but
tractable dynamic variant of the Burdett-Mortensen (BM) model that can
be used for both macro policy applications and micro empirical analysis.
     The framework developed contains several key contributions. First, we
show that introducing a hiring margin into the BM model results in a surpris-
ingly tractable structure. In the existing BM framework, wages are chosen
both to attract and to retain employees and equilibrium wage dispersion
arises in which the wage paid by a firm depends on its size. In contrast
equilibrium wage and hiring strategies here depend only on firm productiv-
ity and the state of the aggregate economy. The resulting structure gener-
ates equilibrium dispersion in individual firm growth rates which, consistent
with Gibrat’s law, are size independent as documented in Haltiwanger et al.
(2011). In particular more productive firms pay higher wages, enjoy positive
expected growth, and so generally become larger. Low productivity firms in-
stead decline because their low hire rate is not suﬃcient to replace employees
quitting to better paying jobs.
     In Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010), the existence of a (recursive rank-
preserving) equilibrium in the BM framework requires a restriction on initial
conditions. Specifically, because the wage strategy is size dependent in their
model, higher paying firms must be larger initially to guarantee equilibrium.
Unfortunately this condition is violated in real data because firms die and
new start-up companies are typically small. The framework established here
explicitly incorporates innovative start-up companies who are born small but
(depending on realized productivity) can grow quickly over time. Conversely
large existing firms may experience adverse productivity shocks and so enter
periods of decline.
     As a second key contribution, we suppose no future wage precommit-
ment. Wages are determined in a model of asymmetric information where
each firm’s productivity  ∈ [ ], which is subject to shocks, is private in-
formation to the firm. As workers are long-lived, they care about the future
expected income stream at any given employer. In this framework firm pro-

                                      3
ductivity is a persistent process: a high productivity firm is more likely than
a low productivity firm to be highly productive tomorrow. As employees
are more valuable to high productivity firms, a signalling equilibrium arises
where more productive firms pay higher wages and, consequently, enjoy a
lower quit rate. The lower quit rate occurs as employees believe the firm is
not only highly productive today but is more likely to remain highly produc-
tive into the future and so will continue to pay high wages.
    The equilibrium structure is thus not unlike an eﬃciency wage model
of quit turnover (e.g. Weiss (1980)). Unlike a competitive economy where
all firms pay the same wage (given equally productive workers), here high
productivity firms pay higher wages to reduce the quit rate of its employees
to better paying firms. Should a firm cut its wage, its employees believe
the firm has experienced an adverse productivity shock. Given the fall in
expected future earnings at this firm, this wage cut triggers a corresponding
increase in employee quit rates.
    Perhaps the central contribution of the paper, however, is the character-
ization of equilibrium labor market adjustment outside of steady state. In
the standard matching framework (e.g. Pissarides (2000)), wasge are deter-
mined wages by a Nash bargaining condition. Wages depend only on the
current state of the market and adjust along a Markov equilibrium path.
In contrast equilibrium wages here are determined in a signalling condition
but this rule is also Markov, depending only on the current state  which
is the distribution of current firm values. The resulting structure not only
generates equilibrium wage dispersion across employed workers, its infimum
is pinned down by the value of home productivity  which ensures that wages
are not fully flexible over the cycle. Furthermore being a model of aggregate
job creation (firm recruitment strategies) and of job-to-job transitions (via
on-the-job search), it identifies a coherent, non-steady state framework of
equilibrium wage formation and labor force adjustment. By focussing on
Markov perfect (Bayesian) equilibria, the framework can be readily extended
to a business cycle structure where the economy is itself subject to aggregate
shocks.
    Given the restrictions on primitives needed to guarantee the existence of
a well defined distribution of firm sizes, we show that a unique separating
equilibrium exists in the limiting case of equally productive firms. Formally,
any equilibrium solution is isomorphic to the stable saddle path of an or-
dinary diﬀerential equation system that describes the adjustment dynamics
of the value of a job-worker match and aggregate unemployment to their

                                      4
unique steady state values. In the case of firm heterogeneity with respect to
productivity, we establish the existence of at least one separating equilibrium
when the distribution of firm productivity limits to a finite number of firm
types.
    Menzio and Shi (2010) develop and study a recursive model of directed
search that also allows for search on-the-job. In their paper, they suggest
that directed search is a more useful approach for understanding labor mar-
ket dynamics. They claim that models of random search in the Burdett-
Mortensen tradition are intractable because the decision relevant state space
is the evolving distribution of wages, which is of infinite dimension. Al-
though the directed search model is arguably simpler in some respects, their
principal objection to a random search model is not valid in the variant con-
sidered in the paper. Indeed, in the limiting case of equally productive firms,
the relevant state variable is simply the aggregate level of unemployment, a
scalar.
    A troublesome implication of the original Burdett-Mortensen model for
empirical implementation is that the equilibrium firm wage distribution is
convex in the case of homogenous firms while in the data it has an interior
mode and decreasing in the right tail. Although a unimodal distribution
is possible when firms diﬀer in labor productivity, Mortensen (2003) shows
that model is not consistent with both the observed firm wage distribution
and the distribution of firm productivity in Danish data. In the case of our
model, the implied distribution of firm wages generally has an interior mode
given the form of the roughly linear but decreasing wage-productivity profile
observed in (Danish) data. Furthermore, the model is fully consistent with
this shape under the plausible restriction that the productivity density over
new entrants is decreasing and converges to zero.


2    The Model
Time is continuous. The labor market is populated by a unit measure of
equally productive, risk neutral and immortal workers and a measure of risk
neutral heterogenous firm who all discount the future at instantaneous rate
. Every worker is either unemployed or employed, earns a wage if employed,
and the flow value of home production,  ≥ 0, if not. Market output is
produced by a matched worker and firm with a linear technology.
   New firms enter at rate   0 continuing firms die at rate   0 so that

                                      5
the measure of firms is stationary and equal to  At entry, the productivity
of a new firm  is determined as a random draw from the c.d.f. Γ0 () Con-
tinuing firms with productivity  are subject to a technology shock process
characterized by a given arrival rate  ≥ 0 and a distribution of new values
from c.d.f. Γ1 (|) For ease of exposition, Γ0  Γ1 are continuous functions
As in Klette and Kortum (2004) and Lentz and Mortensen (2008), one can
think of the entry flow as firms with new products and the exit flow as firms
that are destroyed because their product is no longer in demand.
    Given the above productivity and turnover processes, it is a straight-
forward algebraic exercise to compute the stationary distribution of firm
productivity Φ() It is convenient, however, to instead rank firms by their
productivity; i.e. a firm with productivity  is equivalently described as hav-
ing rank  ∈ [0 1] solving  = Φ() The inverse function () = Φ−1 ()
then identifies the productivity of a firm with (transitory) rank . For the
main part, we assume () is a strictly increasing function with (0)   and
denote (1) = . Define Γ   b0 () = Γ0 (()) and Γ b1 (|) = Γ1 (|()) which
thus describe the above productivity processes but in rank space  ∈ [0 1]
Throughout we require first order stochastic dominance in Γ      b1 (|) so that
higher productivity firms  are more likely to remain more productive into
the future. Let [0 ()] denote the support of Γ   b1 (|) which we assume is
connected and that lim→0+ () = 0 so that productivity rank  = 0 is an
absorbing state [till firm death].
    Each firm is characterized by (  ) where  summarizes its productivity
rank (with corresponding productivity  = ())  is the (integer) number of
employees and  represents the aggregate market state. Throughout we only
consider Markov Perfect (Bayesian) equilibria where the market state process
 is Markov and known to all agents. As all agents are small, each takes
this process as given. Below we shall establish that the payoﬀ relevant state
 at date  is the distribution function  () describing the total number of
workers employed at firms with rank no greater than  In equilibrium  ()
evolves according to a simple first order diﬀerential equation.
    There is asymmetric information at the firm level: each firm knows its
productivity type  but its employees do not. Given the history of observed
wages at this firm, each employee generates beliefs on the firm’s current type
 and so computes  () denoting the expected value of employment at this
firm.
    New firms enter with a single worker, the innovator. Once a new firm


                                        6
enters, the innovator sells the firm to risk neutral investors for its value and
reverts to his/her role as a worker. Each firm faces costs of expanding its
labour force. If a firm with  employees decides to recruit an additional
worker at rate  then the cost of recruitment is () where  is
the recruitment eﬀort required per employee in vetting job applicants and
training new hires. Assume () is increasing and strictly convex with 0 (0) =
(0) = 0
    Any hire is a random draw from the set of workers with expected lifetime
value less than  where  represents the lifetime payoﬀ of employment to
a worker. Let  ( ) represent the fraction of job oﬀers that yield  or
less. A worker quits a firm if an outside oﬀer is received with (perceived)
value strictly greater than current  . We let () denote the arrival rate of
(outside) job oﬀers in aggregate state . Then, ()(1 −  ( )) is the rate
at which workers quit to a higher paying job from one that oﬀers  . Finally
at rate  each worker, whether employed or unemployed, conceives a new
business idea and so has the opportunity to start-up a new firm. We assume
the worker always chooses to accept the opportunity and so  describes the
entry rate of new firms.1

2.1     Firm Size Invariance.
Firms in this paper signal their productivity  through their choice of wage
. In BM, more productive firms pay higher wages to attract and to retain
more employees than do less productive firms. The same insight applies here:
higher productivity firms have a greater willingness to pay a higher wage to
reduce its quit flow. In the following we identify a separating equilibrium in
which each firm (  ) uses an optimal wage strategy  = (  ) which
is strictly increasing in  Assuming workers observe the number of employees
at the firm  and the market state , then the current wage paid fully reveals
the firm’s type . In what follows, however, we shall focus entirely on optimal
strategies that are also firm size invariant. Such an equilibrium has the
following critical properties: (i) the firm’s optimal wage strategy does not
depend on firm size, and so (ii) optimal worker quit strategies do not depend
on firm size.
   1
    This restriction is made for simplicity. Were it not so, then the entry decision is
endogenous to the process under study. Adding this complication is both realistic and
worth pursuing but goes beyond the scope of this paper.



                                          7
    The restriction to firm size invariance is most useful. Of course it may be
that a firm size invariant equilibrium does not exist (e.g. BM, Coles (2001),
Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010)). The critical diﬀerence here is that firms
have an additional policy choice - to recruit new employees with eﬀort  As
developed in Coles and Mortensen (2011) - though in a world of symmetric
information and reputation eﬀects - equilibrium finds the wage strategies are
indeed firm size independent, depending only on the firm’s productivity 
For ease of exposition we simply anticipate this result.


3       A Separating Equilibrium.
The following identifies a separating equilibrium in which ( ) describes
the optimal wage strategy of firm (  ) which is independent of firm size 
and is strictly increasing in  In any such equilibrium, let   b( ) denote the
worker’s belief on the firm’s type  given wage announcement  in aggregate
state  Of course a separating equilibrium requires   b solves  = (b   ). Let
 ( ) denote the worker’s expected value of employment at firm (  )
given belief b = 
    We start with some standard observations. First note that if a firm pays
wage  =  it is not optimal for its employees to quit into unemployment -
by remaining employed each worker retains the option of remaining employed
at his/her current employer which has positive value (the firm may possibly
increase its wage tomorrow while the worker can always quit tomorrow if
needs be). Assuming workers do not quit into unemployment if indiﬀerent
to doing so yields two key simplifications:
    (S1) any firm with  ≥ 1 must make strictly positive profit (as ()  
and the firm can always post wage  = );
    (S2) any equilibrium wage announcement ( ) by firm (  ) must
yield employment value  (b   ( ) ) at least as large as the value of unem-
ployment, denoted as  ().2 Thus all unemployed workers will accept the
first job oﬀer received.
    As previously described, outside job oﬀers arrive at rate  = () where
 ( ) is the fraction of job oﬀers in state  which oﬀer employment value
no greater than  With no recall, the employee’s optimal quit rate at a firm
(believed to be)  b is then (b
                                ) = ()[1 −  ( (b   ) )] which does not
    2
       generates zero profit as all employees quit into unemployment, and this
strategy is then dominated by posting  = .

depend on firm size Given this quit structure, consider now optimal firm
behavior.

3.1     Firm Optimality.
Because individual workers are hired and quit sequentially, the number of
employees in a continuing firm is a stochastic process. Indeed, the size of
a firm, denoted by , is a birth-death process with an absorbing state that
occurs when the firm dies. That is over any suﬃciently short time period of
length   0, the firm’s labor force size is an integer that can only transit
from the value  to  + 1 if a worker is hired, from  to  − 1 if a worker
quits, or to zero if the firm loses its market The transition rates for these
three events are respectively the hire frequency (  ), the quit frequency
(b ) and the destruction frequency 
    Suppose firm (  ) posts wage  recruits new employees at rate  =
 and employees infer the firm is type  =      b( ) Firm (  ) thus
chooses   to solve the Bellman equation:

                           *               [() − ] − ()                     +

In words the flow value of the firm equals its flow profit less hiring costs plus
the capital gains associated with (i) a successful hire ( →  + 1) (ii) the
loss of an employee through a quit ( →  − 1) and (iii) a firm specific
productivity shock with new draw  ∼ Γ     c1 (|) The last term captures the
eﬀect on Π() through the non-steady state evolution of  =  . As the quit
rate () is firm size invariant, it is immediate the solution to this Bellman
equation is Π(  ) = ( ) where ( ) the value of each employee in
firm  solves:

The following tranversality condition is also necessary for a solution to this
dynamic programming problem:

                               lim − (  ) = 0                          (2)

3.2    Worker Optimality.
Consider firm (  ) which adopts the equilibrium wage strategy  =
( ). As an employee correctly infers firm type  =  b( ) then, in a
separating equilibrium, the worker’s expected lifetime payoﬀ given employ-
ment at firm  is:

       ( ) = ( ) + [ () −  ( )]                               (3)

                                                                     
                  +      [( ) +  ( ) −  ( )] cΓ0 () +     

In other words, the flow value of employment is equal to the wage income
plus the expected capital gains associated with the possibility of firm destruc-
tion, a firm specific productivity shock, being oﬀered a better job elsewhere,
creating a business start-up and capital gains as the state variable  evolves
outside of steady state. Note this payoﬀ does not depend on the quit strate-
gies of colleagues as the wage paid does not depend on firm size.
      Given that Γ b1 (|) is stochastically increasing in  and that a separating
equilibrium requires ( ) is strictly increasing in  it follows that the
expected value of employment at firm   ( ) is strictly increasing in 
Proposition 1 now establishes a standard result.
      Proposition 1. In a separating equilibrium,  (0  ) =  ( ) for almost
all 
      Proof: Strictly positive profit for firm  = 0 implies  (0 ) ≥  () for
all  To establish the equality holds, we use a contradiction argument: Sup-
pose instead  ( )   (0  ) over some non-empty time period  ∈ [0  1 )
Thus throughout this time interval, being employed at the least productive
firm is strictly preferred to being unemployed. Suppose at any date  ∈
[0  1 ) firm  = 0 deviates and pays wage  = (0  ) −  where   0

                                        10
Given this deviation, workers update their beliefs on the firm’s type     b and
choose a correspondingly optimal quit strategy. The worst case scenario,
however, is that they believe the firm is type    b = 0 and so anticipate em-
ployment value  (0  )   ( ) for all  ∈ ( 1 ) in the subgame As this
deviating wage is expected to be paid only for an instant it has an arbitrarily
small impact on worker payoﬀs and so employees at this firm do not quit
into unemployment, though each will quit to any outside oﬀer (as      b = 0 and
  (0  )). This quit strategy, however, is the same turnover strategy
were firm  = 0 to pay  = (0  ) This contradicts equilibrium as firm
 = 0 can thus profitably deviate by announcing  = (0  )) −  while
 ∈ [0  1 ) This completes the proof of Proposition 1.
    An immediate corollary to Proposition 1 is that a separating equilibrium
implies
                                    (0 ) =                               (4)
This follows as, given all job oﬀers are acceptable, the value of being unem-
ployed in a separating equilibrium is:

                                 Z    1
             () =  +                                               c0 ()
                                          [( ) +  ( ) −  ()] Γ            (5)
                                  0
                                  Z      1
                                                                              
                          +()              [ ( ) −  ()]b( ) +       
                                     0                                         

Putting  = 0 in (3), using (5) and noting that productivity state  = 0 is
absorbing (Γc1 (0|0) = 1) then yields (4). As a separating equilibrium requires
() is strictly increasing in  (0 ) =  thus describes the lowest wage
paid in the market.

3.3     The Value of an Employee.
Assumption 1 below imposes conditions on fundamental that limit the growth
rate of the most productive firmsl. Specifically, the market distribution of
firm sizes has a well-defined steady state density if and only if its corollary,
Proposition 2, holds.3
    Assumption 1: A positive solution for , which solves
   3
    The steady state wage desity is given by equation (34). Its denominator is finite and
positive for all  if and only if   ∗ ((1))


                                                 11
                             =  −  + max{ − ()}                           (6)
                                           
exists.
    For any  ≥ 0 define the hire function
                            ∗ () = arg max[ − ()]                          (7)
                                         ≥0

The assumed properties of () ensure ∗ () is unique, non-negative, strictly
increasing, diﬀerentiable and Lipschitz continuous for all  ≥  ≥ 0. As-
sumption 1 implies that every firm’s expected growth rate is negative.
    Proposition 2. ∗ ()  
    Proof. By the Envelope Theorem, the right hand side of equation (6)
is an increasing, convex function of  with slope ∗ () As the right hand
side is also strictly positive at  = 0 then, given a positive solution exists for
 it satisfies ∗ () ≤ 
    Using Assumption 1, we now obtain the following crucial result.
    Proposition 3. The value of an employee ( ) is increasing in  and
bounded above by  in every state .
    Proof. The forward solution to (1) that satisfies the transversality con-
dition (2) along any arbitrary future time path for the state { }∞          0 is the
fixed point of the following transformation

for any ( ) ≤ . Because () is continuous and increasing in  and Γc1 (|)
is stochastically increasing in , ( )(  ) is bounded, continuous, and in-
creasing in  if ( ) is bounded, continuous and increasing in . Thus, the

transformation  maps the set of continuous and increasing functions that
are bounded in the sup norm into itself. Further, the transformation  is
increasing and satisfies discounting:

because (b(   )  )) ≥ 0 and ∗ () ≥ ∗ (( )) for any ( ) ≤ . In
short, the map satisfies Blackwell’s suﬃcient conditions for a contraction map
which thus guarantees that a unique fixed point exists in the set of bounded
functions that are increasing in . This completes the proof of Proposition
3.
    Armed with this result we can now fully characterise the strategies of
firms and workers in a separating equilibrium.

3.4    Equilibrium Wage and Quit Strategies.
The Bellman equation (1) implies the optimal wage strategy minimizes the
sum of the wage bill and turnover costs. Formally,

                     ( ) = arg min [ + (b
                                               )( )]                     (8)
                                      

where  b=  b( ) Characterizing the solution to (8) requires first charac-
terising the equilibrium quit rate function ().
    Define b( ) as the fraction of job oﬀers made by firms with type no
greater than  in aggregate state  As a separating equilibrium implies  =
 ( ) is strictly increasing in  it follows that b( ) =  ( ( ) ) By
now determining () and b( ) the equilibrium quit rate function is given
by ( ) = ()[1− b( )] where  =    b describes the worker’s (degenerate)
belief on the firm’s type
    In state  =  at date  let  ( ) denote the total number of workers in
the economy with value no greater than  As job oﬀers are random then, to

                                          13
hire at rate  =  while oﬀering a wage which yields expected employment
value  the firm must make job oﬀers at rate  ( ) (as an oﬀer is
only accepted with probability  ). But  () strictly increasing in  implies
 ( ( )) =  +  () ≡       b (), where recall  () is the measure of
workers employed at firms of productivity rank  or less and  = 1 −  (1)
is the measure of workers who are unemployed. Thus a firm (   ) which
recruits at optimal rate (  ) makes job oﬀers at rate (  )         b ()
Given there is a unit mass of workers and letting  () =          b () denote
the employment density over productivity rank at date , aggregating job
oﬀer rates across all firms implies the arrival rate of a job oﬀer to any given
worker is
            Z 1                      Z 1            b () Z 1 (  ) ()
                 ()(  )           (  )
   ( ) =                      =                      =                      (9)

Furthermore the arrival rate of oﬀers from firms with type greater than  is
                              Z 1                      Z 1
                b                  ()(  )          (  ) ()
     ( )[1 −  (  )] =                      =                      (10)
                                     b ()                +  ()

Hence a worker who believes he/she is employed at a firm with productivity
b has quit rate

                                  Z 1
                                      (  ) ()
                      (b
                          ) =                                    (11)

                                        +  ()
    We are now in a position to describe the equilibrium wage strategy of
firm (  ) Using (11) in equation (8), the optimal wage strategy solves:
                                ∙            Z 1                  ¸
                                                     ( )()
              ( ) = arg min  + ( )                               (12)
                                             ()  + ()

where () ≡  () in state  =   Consider  ∈ (0 1) and, for ease of
                   b is diﬀerentiable. The necessary first order condition for
exposition, assume 
optimality is:
                                     ) 0 (b
                                  (b         ) b

                                    + (b ) 
By marginally increasing the wage , the firm marginally increases its em-
                 b about its type, which marginally reduces their quit rates.
ployees’ beliefs 

                                          14
As ( ) describes the retention value of each employee, optimality ensures
the marginal return to the lower quit rate equals the cost to paying each
employee a marginally higher wage. We now identify the equilibrium wage
function.
    Proposition 4. For given , a separating equilibrium implies the wage
strategy () is the solution to the diﬀerential equation:

                     ( )( ) 0 ()
                     =                       for all  ∈ [0 1]                (14)
                           + ()

with initial value (0 ) = 
    Proof: A separating equilibrium requires that the optimal wage  solving
the first order condition (13) must yield a wage function  = ( ) whose
inverse function corresponds to   b( ) =  Using these restrictions in (13)
establishes (14).
    To show the solution to the necessary condition for optimal () describes
a maximum for each firm ( ), we have to verify the second order condition
holds. Thus consider firm  which instead announces wage 0 = (0  )
where 0 ∈ ( 1] As 0 satisfies (14) and (0  )  ( ) by Proposition 3,
the marginal cost to announcing wage 0   for firm  is

                                         (0  )

Hence for any 0 ∈ ( 1] announcing wage 0  ( ) increases the total
cost of labor to firm  The same argument establishes that for any 0 ∈
[0 ) the marginal cost to announcing wage 0 = (0  )   for firm  is
always negative Thus announcing wage  = ( ) is more profitable than
announcing any other wage 0 = (0  ) for 0 ∈ [0 1]
    Suppose instead the firm announces wage   (0 ) =  To ensure this
                                                            b = 0 when   
is not a profitable deviation, assume its employees believe 
As they anticipate wage  =  at this firm in the entire future [ = 0 is an
absorbing state] they quit into unemployment. As this outcome yields zero
profit, no firm announces wage   
    Finally suppose the firm announces   (1 ) In that case assume its
employees believe  b = 1 and, given those beliefs and resulting quit turnover,

                                       15
announcing wage (1 ) then strictly dominates paying the higher deviat-
ing wage. Hence the optimal wage announcement of any firm  ∈ [0 1] is
identified as the solution to the diﬀerential equation (14) with initial value
(0 ) = . This completes the proof of Proposition 4.
    The economic intuition underlying the result is simply that higher pro-
ductivity firms enjoy higher employee values () and so are willing to pay
marginally more for a reduced quit rate. Equilibrium has an auction struc-
ture where for each type  a too low wage bid yields a costly higher quit
rate, while a higher wage bid is not economic as the reduction in quit rate is
too small.

4     Homogenous Firms.
Although it is true that the market state  () is of infinite dimension in the
general case, it need not be so in practice. In this section we fully characterize
the unique separating equilibrium in the limiting case of homogenous firms.
    In the homogenous firm case, we suppose () is (arbitrarily close to)
 for all  With (limiting) equal productivity, incentive compatibility im-
plies (; ) cannot depend on . Let  = (;  ) denote the value of
an employee in each firm in the limiting case. Optimal recruitment eﬀort
 = ∗ ( ) is thus also independent of 
    Putting  = 0 in (16) implies:
                                    ·
                                        D                            E

                                                   

As the definition of equilibrium further implies job oﬀer arrival rate:
                       Z 1
                           (  ())()

which depends only on  and the unemployment rate   The equilibrium
unemployment dynamics are
                     ·
                     = (1 −  ) − [ − ∗ ( ) ln  ]              (19)

where the first term describes the inflow [job loss through firm destruction]
and the second is outflow through either firm creation or job creation. Note
then that employee value  and unemployment  evolve according to the
pair of autonomous diﬀerential equations (18) and (19).
   Thus for the limiting case of homogenous firms, we can restrict the ag-
gregate state vector to  =  which is a scalar. The solution of interest,
 = () solves the diﬀerential equation

      ̇  ( +  +  − ∗ () ln  )  − ( −  + max≥0 { − ()})
      = · =                                                             
                           − [ +  − () ln  ] 

It is well known that a unique continuous solution exists to this equation for
all  ∈ [0 1] if and only if the ODE system composed of (18) and (19) has a
unique steady state solution and the steady state is a saddle point. Indeed,
the branch of the saddle path that converges to the steady state for every
initial value of aggregate unemployment describes the equilibrium value of
(). Below we prove that these necessary and suﬃcient conditions hold.
    Any steady state solution is the ( ) pair defined by the pair of equations

                          − ( + ) = −∗ () ln                        (20)

            ( +  +  − ∗ () ln  )  =  −  + max { − ()}          (21)
                                                      ≥0

We first show there exists a single solution pair ( ) to these equations.
                                   ·
   Equation (20) describes the  = 0 locus drawn in Figure 1 below. The
                             
LHS of (20) is zero at  = +    1 and decreases at the constant rate  + 
For any   0 the RHS is positive and strictly concave in  for  ∈ (0 1)
Hence a unique, positive value of  strictly less than ( + ) exists for
every positive value of . As ∗ () is an increasing function, it follows that 

                                        18
decreases as  increases along the locus with limiting properties  → (+)
as  → 0 and  → 0 as  → ∞
                                  ·
    Equation (21) describes the  = 0 locus in Figure 1. The RHS does not
depend on  is strictly positive at  = 0 and, for  ∈ [0 ] the Envelope
Theorem implies it is a strictly increasing function of  with slope ∗ ()  
[Proposition 2]. The LHS is instead zero at  = 0 and is a strictly increasing
function of  with slope strictly greater than  +  +  Thus if a solution
exists to equation (21) it must be unique. Note further that at  = 1 the
unique solution for  satisfies  = 1   As the LHS is decreasing in  it
follows that a solution for  ∈ [0 ] exists for all  ∈ [0 1] where  increases
as  increases with limiting properties  → 0 as  → 0 and  = 1   at
 = 1 Continuity now implies a unique steady state solution for the pair
(  ) exists and steady state  ∈ [0 ( + )]
    The dynamics implied by the ODE system composed of (18) and (19) are
illustrated by its phase diagram portrayed in Figure 1. The intersection of
the two singular curves is a saddle point that attracts a unique converging
saddle path from any initial value of . Finally, because the growth rate in 
on the unstable path above the saddle path must eventually exceed the rate
of interest, while the unstable path below the steady state ultimately yields
zero  (which contradicts optimal firm behavior) the stable path represents
the only separating equilibrium. This argument thus establishes Theorem 1.

Theorem 1 A unique separating equilibrium exists in the limiting case of
equally productive firms. Further the equilibrium value of an employee ()
increases with unemployment.

    Equilibrium behaviors depend on the interaction between the value of
an employee (which stimulates greater recruitment eﬀort by firms) and the
arrival rate of outside oﬀers   Note at the steady state the value of an
employee is given by

                             −  + max { − ()}
                       =                                                (22)
                                  +++

which depends on the arrival rate of outside oﬀers  (the only endogenous
object). (22) determines steady state  =  ∗ () where the higher the arrival
rate of outside oﬀers, the lower the value of an employee  ∗ () This quit
propensity in turn depends on the recruitment eﬀort of competing firms as

                             = −∗ (( )) ln                         (23)


                                     20
At steady state  given by equation (20), it is possible to show  implied by
(23) is an increasing function of : the higher the value of an employee, the
greater the recruitment rate of competing firms and thus the higher arrival
rate of outside oﬀers. This interaction between the value of an employee and
competing firm recruitment strategies ensure a unique steady state.
    The non-steady state dynamics are interesting. Suppose there is a one-oﬀ
employment shake-out which increases unemployment above its steady state
level. Theorem 1 implies the value of an employee  = () increases which,
in turn, increases firm recruitment rates  = ∗ (()) At first sight this
seems empirically unlikely - that hiring rates are counter-cyclical (increasing
with unemployment). It should be noted, however, that this response is
necessary for the stability of the economy: if recruitment rates were to fall
as unemployment increases, then unemployment would continue to increase.
It is particularly interesting, then, that Yashiv (2011) finds empirically that
the hiring rate (H/N) in the U.S. is indeed countercyclical in this sense. The
model’s corresponding implication for the cyclicality of gross hiring flows
 = ∗ (( ))[1 − ] is, however, ambiguous
    Note that any common and unanticipated positive shock to the produc-
tivity of a match  shifts up the ̇ = 0 curve in Figure 1. The result is
an increase in the steady state value of an employee () and a decrease in
unemployment ( ) as in the canonical search and matching model. Along
the adjustment path, the equilibrium value of  jumps up initially and ad-
justs slowly downward along the path converging to the new steady state
value. This implies quit turnover also jumps up to a favorable aggregate pro-
ductivity shock: firms increase their recruitment eﬀort and workers in low
rank firms are more likely to receive a preferred outside oﬀer. The initially
large increase in job-to-job turnover gradually falls, however, as the economy
converges to the new steady state.
    It is straightforward to back out equilibrium micro-behavior. The diﬀer-
ential equation (14) for equilibrium wages simplifies to

                      (  ())                0 ()
                                    = ∗ ( )            
                                                +  ()
which, given initial value (0  ()) =  yields
                                                 µ             ¶

                                                         
where  = ( ) This expression describes equilibrium wage dispersion in

                                       21
the limiting case of homogenous firms. Specifically, () is increasing in ,
where (0; ) =  is the lowest wage paid. Wage dispersion arises as hiring is
costly and firms oﬀer diﬀerent wages to reduce their employee quit rates. As
in BM, the wages oﬀered are ranked by productivity  where higher ranked
firms pay higher wages and enjoy lower quit rates. Unlike BM, however,
there is no simple correlation between wages and firm size.
    The equilibrium quit rate from firm (  ()) is

                      (  ()) = −∗ ( ) ln[ +  ()]               (24)

which is decreasing in  being −∗ (( )) ln  at  = 0 (the bottom rank
firm) and zero at  = 1. Note a firm’s equilibrium quit rate depends directly
on the level of unemployment. This occurs as firms are more likely to recruit
from the pool of unemployed workers the larger is that pool.
    The expected growth rate of employment depends only on whether or not
unemployment  exceeds its steady state value. There is, however, dispersion
in individual firm growth rates: a rank  firm enjoys expected growth rate
∗ ( ) [1 + ln[ +  ()]]  Consistent with Gibrat’s law, a firm’s growth rate
is independent of its size  but depends critically on its productivity rank 
(which is subject to shocks) and the level of unemployment. High productiv-
ity (rank) firms pay high wages and attract workers both from the unemploy-
ment pool and from low wage firms. Such firms grow over time, while low
rank firms contract. Firm size ( ) thus evolves according to a geometric
Markov process where firms with  satisfying  + ()  1 ' 037 have
positive expected growth rates. Thus if unemployment exceeds 37% this con-
dition implies all existing firms have positive expected growth rates. Finally
note that currently large firms must typically have existed for a longer time,
have enjoyed higher than average growth rates, and, consequently, have been
more productive.

 = 1 2 , denote the value of an employee in type  firms in aggregate

values. Let  = ( ) denote the number of workers employed in firms
of type  or less and N =(1  2    ) denotes the corresponding vector.
Note unemployment  = 1 −  . Let  = ( ; ()) denote the wage paid
by firm  =  . Conditional on firm type  receiving a productivity shock, let
 denote the probability its type becomes  Assume the  are consistent

     As lim∆→0 [(v) (N)∆ −  (N)] ∆ = − and lim∆→0 [0 −  ] ∆ =
̇ , the lim∆→0 v(N)∆ = v(N) is an equilibrium vector of value functions.
Our strategy is to show that v(N)∆ exists for every small ∆  0. As we
demonstrate that it lies in a compact metric space, every sequence {v(N)∆ }∆→0 ,
has a convergent subsequence in the supnorm.
     First, we establish that the transform  maps bounded functions into
bounded function under Assumption 1 and   . Namely, for any v(N) ≤(  )
where  is the scalar defined by equation (6),

from equation (6). Further, as   −1 one can easily show that  (N0 ) 
−1 (N0 ) implies (v) (N)  (v)−1 (N) as in the proof to Proposition 2.
Finally, since 1  , 1 (N)  0 if 1 (N0 ) ≥ 0. Thus, (N)  0 for any
(N) ≥ 0.
    As ∗ () is a diﬀerentiable function with bounded derivatives on (0 ],
                                          1−0 +0
equation (7) and the derivatives of ln 1− 0 +  0   are bounded for all  ≤
                                                −1
  1, the continuous transformation  maps the set of bounded, positive,
diﬀerentiable, and Lipschitz continuous functions v(N)∆ into itself. As this
set is a compact metric space under the supnorm, at least one fixed point
with these properties exists by Schauder’s Fixed Point Theorem for every
∆  0.
    Finally, consider any infinite sequence {v(N)∆ } with ∆ → 0. As every
element is a bounded real vector function a subsequence that converges in
the supnorm exists and this limit, say v(N), satisfies all the equilibrium
conditions by construction. This comment completes the proof.


6    Wage and Productivity Dispersion
The aim of this section is to derive conditions under which the model gen-
erates wage and productivity dispersion which is consistent with matched
employer-employee data such as that available for Danish manufacturing.

       Figure 1: Danish Manufacturing Wage and Productivity Distributions

    The empirical employment weighted distributions of the average hourly
firm wages paid (annual wage bill divided by employment measured in annual
standard hours worked) and hourly labor productivity (annual value added
per standard hour worked) for four diﬀerent Danish manufacturing industries
are illustrated by the two solid lines in Figure 2.4 Note that the general
shapes of the distributions are quite similar across industries. In all four
cases, average firm wage dispersion is characterized by a distribution with
single interior mode and some upper tail skew but less than the distributions
of labor productivity.5 Figure 3 presents the cross firm wage-productivity
relationship in each of the four industries where the solid line represents
the nonparametric regression point estimate and the shaded area is the 90%
confidence interval. Obviously, there is a strong positive relationship between

     Bagger et al. (2011) show that the same shapes characterize firm wage distributions
in non-manufacturing as well.

the two, as our theory predicts. Further, the profile is roughly linear over
most of the mass of the productivity distribution but with diminishing slope
that tends to zero in the extreme right tail.6 In this section we demonstrate
that the formal model can provide a coherent explanation for these general
features of the data.




              Wage vs Labor Productivity in Danish Manufacturing



    We focus on steady state so that unemployment and the distribution of
employment across firms are consistent with firm and worker turnover. We
also abstract from the idiosyncratic shock to productivity by setting  = 0
We motivate this restriction by noting that firm productivity is quite per-
sistent and that there is a strong positive correlation between the average

    Although the point estimates suggest a negative slope near the upper support, there
is not enough data in the region to make that inference.

wage paid and firm size in firm data. Our model need not generate either
correlation if  is very large. Specifically as all start-up firms are initially
small, any currently large firm must have enjoyed high growth rates in the
past. If  were large so that firm productivity is not very persistent, then
the predicted correlation between current wages paid and firm size is cor-
respondingly small. Conversely, if  is suﬃciently small, then large firms
remain highly productive for long period, thus yielding the observed positive
correlation between firm size and wage paid. In steady state with  = 0 (15)

∗ (()) are both increasing functions of . The second term describes the

whether the density of wages paid is increasing or decreasing. If         e
decreases with  [as implied by the data] then the bracketed term is strictly
decreasing in  and so any interior mode, if it exists, must be unique. We
thus obtain the following proposition.
    Proposition 7. In any steady state with  = 0 the steady state distri-
bution of wages paid, z() has at least one interior local mode if (i) Γ00 () is

                                         29
suﬃciently large and (ii) Γ00 () → 0 as  →  Furthermore there is a unique
                                                            e
interior mode if (iii) () is a power function and (iv)     is decreasing in
.
Proof. Using (32) to substitute out 0 ()0 () in (33) it follows that z00  0
if and only if

                                                          + [1 −  Γ 0 ()]
        Γ00 ()              h                                     i
                       ()  +  +  − ∗ (()) + [1 − b()]
where  = Φ() Thus Γ00 () suﬃciently large ensures z00  0 for  small
enough. Furthermore Γ00 () → 0 as  →  ensures z00  0 for  large enough
and so the mode must be interior. Restriction (iii) ensures  does not depend
on . If (iii)-(iv) also hold, then the term in the square brackets on the RHS
of (33) is strictly decreasing and so implies a unique mode.
    Propositions 6 and 7 suggest the key to explaining the shapes of the em-
pirical wage distributions z() and the wage/productivity profiles ()         e     is
a distribution of productivity Γ0 () across new start-ups which has a de-
creasing density over most of its support. Thus most new start-ups suﬀer
low productivity draws and struggle to grow. Conversely a relatively small
number of start-ups enjoy high productivity draws and grow quickly over
time. Note this restriction is also consistent with the unimodal employment
weighted distribution of productivity, (),e        as illustrated in Figure 2. As

() = (Φ()) the above implies
                      Ã                                                    !

employed by a firm of productivity , is increasing in  = Φ() the distrib-

 =  and Γ00 () → 0 as  → .


7     Conclusion.
We have shown the introduction of a hiring margin into the matching frame-
work with on-the-job search yields a surprisingly rich and tractable equi-
librium setting in a model with firm heterogeneity in productivity. We have

                                          30
fully characterized and established the existence of Markov perfect (Bayesian)
equilibria in non-steady state economies where firms have private informa-
tion on their own productivity. The environment considered is particularly
rich. There is turnover of firms with new start-up companies replacing exist-
ing firms that suﬀer firm destruction shocks. There is labor turnover where,
in equilibrium, workers quit less productive firms to take employment in
more productive firms. Equilibrium wage dispersion arises as more produc-
tive firms are willing to pay a higher wage to reduce their employee’s quit
rates. Furthermore, firm growth rates are size independent where higher
productivity firms pay higher wages, enjoy low quit rates and recruit more
new employees. Hence, suﬃciently high productivity firm have a positive
expected growth rate. The structure also allows for firm specific productiv-
ity shocks, so that previously successful firms may ultimately decline should
they receive a suﬃciently unfavorable sequence of productivity draws. Fi-
nally, the model provides a coherent explanation for the properties of firm
wage and productivity distributions as well as the cross section relationship
between them.
    The characterization of equilibrium is particularly simple in the limiting
case of equally productive firms. Even though the distribution of firm sizes
is infinitely dimensional, equilibrium aggregate behavior depends only on the
level of unemployment. A particularly useful insight is that the value of a firm
is increasing in the level of unemployment. This occurs as, with higher un-
employment, firms are less likely to poach each others’ employees. As greater
employee value generates greater recruitment eﬀort by firms, the non-steady
state dynamics of the economy are intrinsically stable. This result appears
consistent with the U.S. business cycle where Yashiv (2011) finds the aggre-
gate hiring rate (H/N) does indeed covary positively with unemployment.
    This new, rich, and tractable framework opens up several important di-
rections for future research. The equally productive firms case is important as
equilibrium dichotomizes into (i) macroeconomic behavior where, depending
only on the level of unemployment , equilibrium determines gross job cre-
ation rates and (ii) microeconomic behavior where wages and quit turnover
at the firm level depends on a (possibly transitory) firm fixed eﬀect  the
collective recruitment eﬀort of firms (determined in the macroequilibrium)
and the distribution of firm sizes which itself evolves endogenously over time.
     Given the Markov structure of the model, it is clear it will generalize
to a framework where aggregate productivity and job destruction parameter
evolve according to a stochastic Markov process. The extension is interesting

                                      31
not only because firms use optimal wage setting strategies, rather than Nash
bargaining, but also because the insights of Coles and Moghaddasi (2011)
suggest this framework will fit the business cycle volatility and persistence
data as described in Shimer (2005). Indeed the model will automatically
generate procyclical quit turnover: high aggregate productivity will increase
firm hiring rates, thus increasing worker quits from the lower end of the
productivity distribution. Furthermore periods of high unemployment will
have lower quit rates as newly available jobs are more likely to be filled by
the unemployed.
    An important distinction between this paper and the BM approach is
that in the latter framework the wage has two functions: a higher wage both
attracts new employees and retains existing ones. Here instead, the hiring
margin is fully targeted by the firm’s recruitment strategy, leaving wages to
target only the quit margin. The properties of the resulting equilibrium wage
structure is correspondingly diﬀerent. Specifically, the (steady state) density
of wages paid is unimodal given the shape of the firm wage-productivity
profile observed in Danish data and that shape is consistent with the model
under plausible restrictions on the form of the distribution of productivity
of entering firms. Furthermore, the model’s equilibrium dynamics addresses
wage distribution evolution over the cycle, an important topic for future
empirical research.
