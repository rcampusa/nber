              An Analysis of the Stabilizing and
              Welfare Effects of Intervention in
                   Spot and Futures Markets

          This paper analyzes the effects of three alternative rules

on the long—run distributions of both the spot and futures prices in

a single commodity market, in which the key behavioral relationships

are derived from the optimizing behavior of producers and speculators.

The rules considered include: (i) leaning against the wind in the

spot market; (ii) utility maximizing speculative behavior by the

stabilization authority in the futures market; (iii) leaning against

the wind in the futures market. Since the underlying model is

sufficiently complex to preclude analytical solutions, the analysis

makes extensive use of simulation methods. As a general proposition

we find that intervention in the futures market is not as effective

in stabilizing either the spot price of the futures price as is inter-

vention in the spot market. Indeed, Rule (iii), while stabilizing the

futures price may actually destabilize the spot price. Furthermore, the

analogous type of rule undertaken in the spot market will always stabilize

the futures price to a greater degree than it does the spot price. The

welfare implications of these rules are also discussed. Our analysis

shows how these can generate rather different distributions of welfare

gains, including the overall benefits.

1.   INTRODUCTION

           The theory of commodity price stabilization has grown into a voluminous

literature. Many of the early studies analyze the question in terms of a buffer

stock stabilization scheme. The typical approach is to determine the allocation

of the welfare benefits to different groups in the economy following the introduc-

tion of such a scheme, with the stabilization authorities continually intervening

so as to ensure the exact stabilization of the market price at some appropriate

level (usually taken to be the arithmetic mean).

          Of course the maintenance of a buffer stock scheme which stabilizes

prices perfectly is extremely expensive and accordingly is not very practicable.

In reality some sort of partial price stabilization scheme is more likely to be

adopted. In the literature, two alternative aspects have been considered. The

first is the intervention in the commodity market by means of some specified inter-

vention rule. The second is the consideration of alternative institutional arrange-

ments, such as futures markets, and the role they may play in stabilizing the spot

price. Until recently, these latter models have suffered from an important

deficiency. Specifically, they ignored the fact that any change in the environment——

such as the introduction of a futures market——alters the structure of the model and

this needs to be taken into account in assessing the effects of the institutional

change on the equilibrium behavior of the market. To do this requires the analysis

to be developed from the underlying microeconomic optimizing behavior.

          In this paper, we analyze the effects of intervention by a stabilization

authority in both the spot and futures market. The effects on the properties of

both the spot and futures markets are considered. We also investigate the effects

of such action on the welfare of the various agents in the economy. The model

we employ is an extension of one developed by Turnovsky (1983) and refined by

Turnovsky and Campbell (l985). In this model, the key behavioral relationships

are derived from the optimizing behavior of producers and speculators. As a
                                      —2—


result of this behavior the coefficients of the relevant demand and supply func—

tions become endogenous and change with the degree of intervention by the authority.

         Three kinds of intervention rules are considered. The first of these

postulates the stabilization authority to intervene in the spot market in accordance

with a rule of leaning against the wind; i.e., it buys the commodity when the price

is low, relative to its equilibrium, and sells otherwise. The second rule assumes

that the authority enters the futures market as a private speculator, taking a

long or short position, depending upon whether the futures price exceeds or is

less than the expected spot price. The final rule is one of leaning against the

wind in the futures market; i.e., buying futures contracts when their price is

low and selling when they are high. Such a rule was suggested some years ago by

Houthakker (1967).

          The model underlying the analysis is sufficiently complex to render

analytical solution to be infeasible. We therefore analyze the questions using

simulation methods. While these techniques can yield only specific conclusions,

relevant to the specific chosen parameter values, when conducted over comprehensive

sets of parameter values, as we do here, they do provide an overall picture of what

the likely effects of the various stabilization rules will be. They also have

the advantage of indicating the likely orders of magnitudes of these effects and

providing some insight as to the crucial parameters upon which these depend.

Given the complexity of the model, this type of sensitivity analysis proves to

be intractable, without resorting to numerical solutions.

          The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the model,

with its solution being given in Section 3. The welfare measures are reported in

Section 4. Section 5 discusses the simulation procedures. The effects of the

three rules upon the distribution of the spot and futures prices together with

their welfare effects are considered in Sections 6—8. The final section contains

the general conclusions to emerge from our analysis.

2.      REVIEW OF FRAMEWORK

              This section summarizes the basic framework, developed in greater detail

by Turnovsky (1983) and Turnovsky and Campbell (1985). There are four groups of

participants in the market:            (a) firms; (b) private speculators; (c) consumers;

(d) the public stabilization authority. The behavior of each group is considered

in turn and the corresponding aggregate market relationships are then derived.

A. Producers

             We assume that there are n identical producers. The representative firm

is assumed to be perfectly competitive and to produce its output subject to a

quadratic cost function. In addition, at time t—l, when the production decision

must be made, the firm can enter a contract to deliver a fixed specified quantity

of output at an agreed contract price at time t.— The remainder is sold on the

spot market at whatever the random price may turn out to be. Its profit in

period t, Trk, is therefore given by


                                =        — z_1] + P_1 z_1 — cY                    (1)



where

                   = planned output, chosen by the representative firm, and

                       upon which costs are incurred,

                   =   actual    output of the firm,

             z_1 = firm's           net position in futures contracts entered into

                          at time t—l,

                   = spot price of output at time t, taken as parameterically

                    given to the firm,

                    = one period futures price prevailing at time t—l, for

                       delivery at time t.


If z.        > 0    the firm is selling futures contracts, while z.         <   0 denotes a
     i,t—1                                                         i,t—1

             The firm is assumed to make its production decisions for time t at t—l,

before the actual spot price P is known. Because of random fluctuations in produc-

tion decisions, assumed to be beyond the control of the firm, actual and planned

outputs are related by1!

                         =   conditional         expectation of profit for time t,

Under certain conditions, the parameter a describes the coefficient of absolute

risk aversion. For a risk averse producer a > 0, while a = 0 corresponds to risk

B.   Speculators

             There are n identical speculators. The representative, denoted by j,

holds a certain quantity of the inventories of the commodity in anticipation of

price changes. We shall let i1 denote the net position in the commodity by

the speculator entered at time t—l. If i1 > 0, the speculator holds positive

stocks of the commodity for speculative purposes, while 1j,t—1 < 0 denotes that he

is holding the commodity short. In addition, we assume he can speculate in the

purchase and sales of futures contracts. We shall let x_1 denote the net posi-

tion of the representative speculator in the futures market entered at time t—l,

with x              0 denoting sales and x
      •j,t —l
                >
                                             j,t —l      <   0 denoting purchases of futures con-

tracts,    respectively. The profit of the representative speculator over the period

(t—l, t)   is   postulated to be

                                    -            +                   -     -       di_i (6)
where the quadratic term denotes the costs associated with trading in inventories.L

While the assumption of quadratic costs is a gross simplification, introduced to

preserve linearity, the requirement d > 0 is necessary for a well defined inventory

demand function, in the presence of a futures market, to exist.

            Analogous to firms, the objective function of the representative specu-

lator is to maximize

These equations        are parallel to (5a) and (5b) derived above for the firm and have

been   discussed previously.
            The assumption of a single period decision horizon is adopted to preserve
simplicity. However, given the specifications of the profit functions in (1) and (6),
(which involve only the current values of the decision variables), identical demand
functions are obtained with a multiperiod objective                       function.'
C. Aggregate Market Relationships
             The agents collectively trade in the final goods market and in the
futures market. These shall therefore be considered in turn.
             The third group of market participants, consumers, are assumed to pur-
chase    only final goods. It is not necessary to derive their demand functions from

underlying utility maximization. Instead, it suffices simply to postulate some

aggregate demand function, Dt, which most conveniently can be taken to be linear


                                       Dt = A —              aP   +
                                                                      u                                  (9)


             Summing the optimal production plans (5), over the identical firms leads

to    the aggregate supply function

                                     S = n(y. + v.)
                                           =                  + n                                        (10)
                                                         —7—

Since the n firms are assumed to be identical they also are assumed to contribute

equally to the aggregate supply disturbance, Vt, so that

Furthermore, for notational convenience letting c/n be denoted by c, leads to the

aggregate supply function

                  The aggregate demand and aggregate supply disturbances are assumed to

be additive, normally independently distributed over time, to have zero means

and finite covariances, and to be uncorrelated


                                               E(ut)      E(vt) = 0                    (13a)

                  Likewise, summing over the demand functions for the individual speculators

leads to the aggregate inventory demand function 1tl'

where Gt denotes the position taken by the stabilization authority in the market.

If G > 0, the authority is a net purchaser of the commodity, adding to its inventory;

if      <    0,    it   is a net seller, running down its inventory.

                  Aggregating over the representative firm's position in the futures market,

(5b), leads to the following aggregate net supply function for futures contracts

where Z1 represents the aggregate. In the rational expectations equilibrium we
consider, the current spot price deviates from what was previously anticipated by

an amount which is linearly proportional to the aggregate demand and supply disturbances.

Thus we may write
                                          =               + P1u + P2v                                (17)

fact that u, v are normal and uncorrelated, we find that

Also, it is evident from (26a) below that the probability distribution of                                     is

          Likewise, summing (Sb) over the futures positions for individual speculators,

leads to the aggregate position

The solutions for P and P depend upon the specific forms for the intervention rules

for spot and futures market intervention and to these rules we now turn.


D. Specification of Intervention Rules
                                                                                                13/
          The following three intervention rules are considered:

          Rule 1:                     Ct =                        — F)
                                                 _A(P                                                 (22a)


This rule asserts that the stabilization authority buys the commodity when the

current spot price is below its long—run equilibrium and sells when this situation

is reversed. It describes a type of "leaning against the wind" policy commonly

encountered in the stabilization literature in general)' The case of a buffer

stock stabilization scheme, when the intervention of the authority maintains

at F, is obtained by letting X -*


          Rule    2:
                        Htl
                                                 -                          '
                                                                                 >0                   (22b)


Rule 2 is analogous to the demand function for futures contracts by a pure private

speculator. This form of intervention therefore assumes that the stabilization

authority is behaving as if it were a pure private utility maximizing speculator.

          Rule 3:           H1 =                          - f)                                        (22c)


The form of intervention suggested by Rule 3 is the analogue to Rule 1 applied to

the futures market. It asserts that the stabilization authority sells futures con-

tracts when their price is above the long run mean and buys them when they are

below the mean. This is a formalization of the type of rule suggested by

Houthakker (1967)

3.   SOLUTION FOR SPOT AND FUTURES PRICES

             Since the objective is to assess the impacts of the various intervention

schemes on the market and its participants, as a benchmark, we begin with the

case where there is no intervention by the authority in either the spot or futures

                                    = 0 in (21a) and (2lb), we obtain
markets. Setting G =       Htl

Observe from (23b) that in the absence of supply disturbances, the long—run average

futures price is in general below the long—run average spot price. This is necessary

in order to induce producers to hedge permanently part of their output. In the

presence of supply disturbances, however, the negative correlation between them

and the spot price reduces the incentive for firms to nedge by selling futures

contracts, thereby reducing their supply and raising the futures price. Indeed,

it is now possible for the equilibrium futures price to exceed the spot price.

The long—run bias will disappear if either ÷ 0,                             -'-

Equation (25) describes the behavior of the current market clearing price in terms of

its conditional expectations. Using standard solution procedures, the stable solution

for Pt (i.e., the rational expectations equilibrium) is given by the stochastic

difference equation--1
                                                                  e

quadratic equation

Taking conditional expectations of (26a), and subtracting, we can immediately show

that p1. p2 appearing in (17) are defined by

The one period and asymptotic variances of the spot price are therefore given by

where r is the smaller root of (26b) and a1, b, w and                                                  are given by (24a)—(24d).

            From the expressions (24a)—(24d) it is seen that the parameters a1, b, ,

w   are endogenous functions of the one period spot price variance 02(1), and

therefore of o and r. As a consequence, equations (26b) and (27b) define a pair

of highly nonlinear relationships between o and r. As pointed out in a related

context by McCafferty and Driskill (1980), this nonlinearity is the cause of

possible nonuniqueness and nonexistence problems pertaining to rational expecta-

tions equilibria. That is, when we take the definitions of a1, b,                                                   and w, given

by (24a)—(24d) into account, it is possible that there is in fact no value of r

lying in the range 0 <     r   <   1; or alternatively, there may be a multiplicity of
such roots. This question is considered further below.

            Using the steady state relationship (23b) to write (2lb') in deviation

form, and taking expectations of (25), the current futures price can be expressed



                                                                v2 +1

Thus given (25), the evolution of                               is determined. From this it follows

the   asymptotic variance of the futures price, o, is

                                                        2                     22

and a similar relationship holds between the corresponding one period variances.

Consequently, in the case of demand disturbances fl2 < 1 and the futures price has 1es

variance than the spot price, both ii the short run and in the long run. In the case

of supply disturbances, however, it is possible for                                                >   1, in which case the futures
price may actually exhibit more variability.

           The solution for the spot and futures prices, derived in the absence of inter-

vention, may thus be summarized as followa'

These 11 equations determine between them the solutions for the 11 quantities P.

,   cY, 02(1), o, r, p, a1, b, w, and .               It   is possible, by substitution, to

reduce the number of variables, although for expositional purposes it is convenient

to lay out the structure of the solution in full.

          We turn now to the solutions obtained for the three alternative forms of

intervention rules. It turns out that the forms of the solution in each case can

be expressed in terms of relatively minor adjustments to the basic solution.


Rule 1

          Substituting (22a) into the spot market clearing condition, the solution

consists of the following equations:       (28b), (28c), (28d), (28e), (28f), (28g),

(28i), (28j), (28k), together with

                                                                                   (28a')
                                 a1-X+b
                                                         1/cd
                           a1 =a+A+                  k                             (28h')
                                                 2          c   d
                                               a (1)


which again determine the 11 endogenous variables. In deriving this solution, the

critical thing to observe is that this form of intervention leads to a transitional

dynamic equation in the spot price, identical to that obtained in the absence of

intervention ((26) above), with the difference being that the coefficient a (the

slope of the demand function) is increased to (a +              X); see (28h'). Combining
(28a') with (28h1) and likewise (28a) with (28g), we see that in either case, the

steady—state solution for P can be written as



                                a+         k
                                       0   (1)
In particular, P does not depend upon the intervention parameter A through the

effect of the latter on a, as during the transitional path. The mean spot and

futures prices do, however, depend indirectly on A via the effect which operates

through the one period variance of the spot price 02(1).

Rule 2

             Substituting (22b) into the futures market clearing condition (21b) we

find that this form of futures market intervention is equivalent to replacing the

coefficient k/a2(l), which describes the degree of private speculation, by
   k
         +          is therefore equivalent to a reduction in the degree of risk
 a (1)
aversion of the private sector. The entire solution is of the same form as (28a)—(28i),

the only difference being that kIa(1) is now replaced by k/a2(l) + .                  In    this case,

the mean spot and future prices are now directly influenced by the intervention

parameter v, as well as indirectly through the variance a(l), as in Rule 1.


Rule 3

             Substituting the third rule (22c) into the futures market equilibrium

condition (2lb), it turns out that the modifications introduced by this rule to

the basic solution (28a)—(28i) are somewhat more substantial than in the other

cases. We now obtain

In contrast to the analogous rule for spot market intervention, Rule 1, this form

of intervention in the futures market has direct effects on all three parameters

(a1,b,). While an increase in p raises a1, which can be shown to be a stabilizing

effect on the spot price, it also reduces b and u, and these changes can be shown

to be destabilizing influences. Also, the increase in p can be shown to be
                                      —17—


equivalent to an increase in a and therefore to be stabilizing. In addition, there

are the indirect effects of these changes operating through 02(1).


4. WELFARE MEASURES

          In order to assess the distribution of welfare gains or losses arising

from government intervention, it is necessary to introduce welfare criteria for

the respective agents in the market. These include the three private agents (firms,

speculators, and consumers) as well as the profits accruing to the stabilization

authority. The traditional approach in the stabilization literature has been to

evaluate welfare gains and losses in terms of changes in producer's and consumer's

surplus. The limitations of these measures are well known, and while it can be

shown that the qualitative implications they yield are generally acceptable, it

is preferable to carry Out the welfare analysis in terms of the underlying functions.

          The underlying welfare maximizing approach of the present study allows us

to move away from surplus measures, at least in the cases of firms and speculators,

to welfare measures based on means and variances of the profits accruing to the

respective groups. As we have simply assumed an aggregate demand function, with-

out resorting to underlying utility maximization, we have retained the traditional

consumer's surplus measure as an indicator of welfare gains or losses to consumers.

As we shall see below, it is impossible to make any kind of general qualitative

assessment of the welfare gains, without resorting to numerical methods. The

analytical complexities, present in the price variance comparisons, are simply

compounded.

          We turn now to the expressions for the welfare gains for the three groups

in the economy. These are evaluated at long—run equilibria, by taking asymptotic

expectations of the welfare expressions. In the case of producers and speculators,
                                                                               21/
the derivations of the resulting expressions are tedious and are not reported.—

A. Producers
            The welfare function for the representative firm is given by (4). The

analogous expression for total firms is therefore

                                                          -     a var l(ll)
                                      =
                                          E1(fl)                                                 (29)


where Ei(fl) vari(iI), denote one period means and variance of aggregate

producer profits. One issue associated with the use of (29) for the purposes of

making welfare comparisons with other agents in the economy is the fact that

embodied in the expression vari(11) are terms involving fourth moments (and

squares of the second moments) of the distribution of the spot price.                             These are

not present in the consumer surplus measure, which is analogous to expected profits.

The measure (29) thus attributes greater weight to stability thereby perhaps giv-

ing a distorted comparison with consumer welfare, as measured by consumer surplus.

To obtain the most complete picture of overall welfare effects, it is useful to

consider the effects of the futures market on

             (i) the asymptotic expected profit of the firm, E(fl);

           (ii) the asymptotic one—period variance of profit of firms,

                   var

           (iii) the asymptotic welfare of firms as defined by the asymptotic

                   expectation of the utility function, E(V).

k/a2(l) + .    In   the case of Rule 3, the numerators in (31) are unchanged; the

denominators are now replaced by (k/a2(l) + 1/c + l/d + p).

          The gains or losses to firms are obtained by comparing (30) in the case

where there is no intervention with the corresponding expressions obtained under

the three forms of intervention rules. The long run impacts of intervention on

these welfare measures are therefore

                     =   Z(I)   —   Z(0)        Z =         E(fl)        ,    Var T[(l) ,     E(V)

B. Speculators

          The procedure for deriving the welfare gains or losses to speculators is

directly analogous to that for firms. The welfare function of the representative

speculator is given by (7) with an analogous expression applying in the aggregate.

Again it is useful to focus on (1) asymptotic expected speculative profits; (ii)

asymptotic one—period variance of speculative profits; (iii) asymptotic welfare

as specified by the utility function. These expressions are:

                                                                                     p

                                                                                              (32b)

The long—run expected profits of the futures markets on these quantities are

therefore


                              Z(F)   —
                                         Z(N); Z = E[115],        var[IIS(l)], V              (33)


C.   Consumers

              As noted above, when considering the gains or losses received by con-

sumers through the introduction of a futures market, we resort to the traditional

surplus measure. The gain in consumer surplus (CS) from intervention in the futures

market is given by

                                                      D(P ')dP'



With a linear demand function, and taking expected values, the expected gains to

consumers from the introduction of a futures market are


                  E(CS)   =
                                E{[P(0)
                                             -   P(I)] [D(P(O))       + D(P(I))]} .           (34)

Using   the   solution (25) for the spot price in deviation form, (34) can be expressed as


                     AE(CS) =        [P(0)   —
                                                 P(I)}[2A    —
                                                                 a(P(O) +   P(I))]

              + a[(I) - 02(0)1 +                           w(l-r)]
                                                                      -
                                                                          Cal
                                                                                +
                                                                                    w(l-r)J
where the subscripts I, 0 identify the intervention regime. One interesting feature

about (35), that is different from the usual surplus measures which now abound in

the literature, is that it consists of two components. The first, and less familiar,

is due to the shift in the long—run average price. The second is the contribution

to the welfare gains from the stabilization of the spot price, and this of course

is familiar from previous stabilization literature.

D. Stabilization Authority

          The gains to the stabilization authority from intervention denoted by

AG, are straightforward, namely

Rule 1: E[X(P —     P)P]     Xe2                                                            (36a)


Rule 2: E[v(P_1 —                               —       +                                   (36b)
                                                            [r(x1—1) + x2]2eJ

Rule 3: E[p(P1 -
                           1)(P1        -
                                                    = (rx1   + x2)(r(x1-l) + x2)a           (26c)


E. Total Welfare Gains

          In our welfare results below, two measures of both total private and over-

all welfare gains are presented. The first measure of total private gains is the

sum of the expected changes in the profits of producers and speculators, together
                                                                  23/
with the expected change in consumer surplus, namely—

                           AE(IT) =     E(II)     + AE(IIS) + AE(CS)                (37a)


The second is the corresponding sum of the changes in expected utility

                           AE(V) =     AE(V)      + AE(VS) + AE(CS)                 (37b)


The corresponding expressions for overall welfare gains are these expressions,

together with the return to the stabilization authority

                                      AE(TTT) =     AE(fl) + AG                     (38a)


                                      AE(VT) = AE(V) + AG                           (38b)



5. SIMULATION PROCEDURE

          Numerical solutions for the non—intervention case and the three inter-

vention rules were obtained by assigning numerical values to the basic parameters——
                24 /
a, c, d, c and 3,      and the intervention parameters. The resulting expressions

for P, 2 were then used to obtain the corresponding numerical values for the welfare

gains. The range of parameters considered is given in Table 1. As A and 2, act

only as scale parameters in the solutions for the price distribution, they were
                                            —2 2--




assigned constant values set arbitrarily at 10 and 1, respectively. The case where

the fluctuations in et are due to fluctuations in demand is specified by
                     2                               .    2    2           2
 2   =   2
             = 1,   o
                     v
                       = 0; while for supply fluctuations
                              .
                                                          o = aV
                                                          e
                                                                   =   1, au = 0.
 e       U

The results are more sensitive to the other parameters including the intervention

parameters, which were therefore allowed to vary over a wider range.
               As demand and supply characteristics of commodities tend to vary, not

only between different commodities, but also across countries for a given commodity,

we try to cover a wide range of slopes for the relevant demand and supply functions.

This of course will also provide some insight into the generality of any particular

result which may arise. Indeed, given the small number of parameters involved, it

is possible to approach generality in the results without resorting to a prohibitive

number of simulations.

               The values assigned to the parameters a, c and d are self—explanatory.

They allow the implied slopes of the demand and supply functions to span a wide

range. For example, the slope of the demand function ranges from 0.1 to 10,

which is an increase of 100—fold. The rate of increase in the marginal cost of hold-

ing inventories, d, ranges between 0.2 and 4, which is a factor of 20.

               The choice of values for ct.and ,     the coefficients or risk aversion, is

not so straightforward. While the degree of risk aversion is likely to vary between

producers and speculators and across industries, the literature is unclear as to

what reasonable values of a and         should be, although there is some agreement that

the values are probably small. The consensus among authors would seem to be that

these risk parameters should lie in the range 0.0001 to 0.1; see Freund (1956), Peck

(1975), King and Robison (1981), Buccola (1981), Rolfo (1980), Kramer and Pope (1981),

Yassour, Zilberman, and Rausser (1981). We consider values of the risk parameters

a and        between 0.001 and 0.1. We find that for values of a, < 0.001 the results

are difficult to distinguish from the case of risk neutrality which is one of the

special cases considered by Turnovsky (1983).          It would therefore seem reasonable to
                                      —23—


conclude that if a and   are extremely small, the special cases of a =   =0   are

good proxies. The upper bound of 0.1 is probably too high. Nevertheless it enables

us to conduct sensitivity analysis as the risk parameters change from the more reason-

able values of 0.01.

          The simulation procedure adopted was as follows:

          (i) solveffor the non—intervention solution (02, 02f r,
               and P ), for given parameters          p


         (ii) then solve for the intervention solutions for each
               of the three rules;

        (iii) use solutions from (i) and (ii) to compare variances
               of the spot price and futures price and to compute
               welfare gains and losses.


Taking into account different combinations of the parameters set out in Table 1

and a search for multiple feasible roots set out in the next section, the total

number of simulations carried out exceeded 4300.

          The large number of simulations carried out enables us to draw some fairly

general conclusions about the behavior of a futures market subject to intervention

by a stabilization authority. Obviously it is impossible to present the results

of all experiments. In order to get some idea of the dispersion of results, a

number of representative cases are presented. For purposes of exposition, 10 cases

are presented in detail (for each intervention rule). Parameter values for each

case are presented in Table 2. Table 3 contains solutions applicable to the parameters

in Table 2, assuming no intervention.-'1 The solutions provide a point of comparison

with the intervention solutions. For each rule we have considered 4 values of the inter-

vention parameter, 0.5, 1, 10, 100, thereby covering a wide dispension of degrees of

intervention. However, results for only 0.5, 10 are presented in the tables.'

Before turning to a discussion of each of the three rules, we briefly consider the

          The rational expectations procedure adopted in this paper is consistent
                                                                  27/
with the possibility that multiple solutions may exist:—                Of particular interest

is the possibility that intervention by a stabilization authority may result in

non—existence or the creation of multiple feasible solutions. The numerical frame-

work employed in this paper provides a convenient framework for analyzing the

existence or otherwise of multiple solutions.

          The algorithm used to solve for intervention solutions provides only one

solution for each unknown and does not provide an indication as to the uniqueness
of such solutions. Solutions are obtained by an iterative procedure which requires

the provision of a set of initial conditions. For feasibility we require

                                           0 < r1, r2 < 1


Initial conditions were therefore set in the range 0 to 1 with a grid search being

carried out with alternative initial conditions within the range. No examples of

multiple feasible solutions were found in the presence of intervention. Further-

more, numerous examples àf nonfeasible solutions, after intervention, were found

for particular initial conditions, but a unique feasible solution could always

be found by using alternative initial conditions. The absence of multiple feasible

solutions and the fact that intervention does not lead to existence problems is of

some importance in a practical policy context.

A. Effects on Long—Run Distributions of Prices

             As one would expect, intervention in the spot market by means of Rule 1

results in the stabilization of both the spot and futures prices. Interestingly,

very large reductions in the variances of both the spot and futures prices can be

achieved for a relatively low degree of intervention; see, e.g., A =    0.5,. Cases land
3.    Eut it is also possible for negligible stabilization to be achieved for A =   0.5.
Examples of this are given in Cases 2 and 8, which have in common a high value of

a, but very different degrees of risk aversion. For relatively intensive intervention,
the effect of a high a is swamped and it can be seen from Table 4 that for A = 10

a high degree of stabilization of both the spot and futures price can be achieved

for all parameter combinations.

             It is of interest to note that while significant reductions in both

variances can be achieved, the futures price is always stabilized to a greater

degree than the spot price——even though the intervention occurs directly in the

spot market. The reason for this can be seen from (28e). The intervention impinges

on the variance of the futures price in two ways. First, it reduces the variance

of the spot price. Secondly, by reducing the one—period variance of the spot price,

it increases both the numerator and the denominator of n,    the coefficient of
It can be shown that on balance the effect on the denominator dominates., so that n

falls, leading   to a relatively greater stabilization of the futures market.

             In terms of variance reduction it would appear that for particular parameter

combinations, little can be gained by increasing the degree of intervention beyond

A =   1.   This is so, for example, for Cases 1, 3, and 10, which are typified by very

low values of a. Furthermore, comparing the reductions in the variances in Tables

4A and 4B it is seen that intervention in accordance with Rule 1 is approximately

equally effective in stabilizing for demand disturbances as it is for supply disturbances

            The qualitative effect of intervention by means of Rule 1 on the long—run

mean prices depends critically upon the source of origin of the stochastic disturbances.
                                     —26—

In the case of demand shocks, the mean spot price is always lowered, while the mean

futures price is always raised. The reason for this is seen from (28). The inter-
vention reduces both the long-run and the one period variance of the spot price.

While this tends to reduce a1, there is a more than offsetting increase in b, so

that a1 ÷ b rises, thereby lowering the long—run mean spot price P. At the same

time, the coefficient of P in (28b) is increased, by a more than offsetting amount

and the long—run mean futures price tends to rise. In the case of supply disturbances,

the intervention may cause the long—run mean prices to either rise or fall. The
reason is that whereas a1 will still fall, b may now either rise or fall, render-

ing the net effect on the mean spot price P indeterminate. However, in all cases,

the spot and futures prices move in opposite ways (as they do for demand disturbances).

          In comparison with the reductions in the variances, which we showed could

be significant, the changes in the mean spot and futures prices are relatively

small. The greatest reduction in the spot price achieved for all parameter sets

was around 20 percent. The changes in the futures price are all much smaller,

the maximum being less than 6%.

          In concluding our comments on the price effects, the following observa-

tions may be made. Whereas, the intervention appears to stabilize both demand and

supply disturbances equally effectively, the intervention has a relatively greater
impact on mean prices when disturbances originate with demand than when they are

due to supply shocks. Secondly, reductions in the mean prices are fairly insensi-

tive to varying degrees of intervention. Thirdly, as intervention increases, the

mean spot and futures prices converge to a common value for a particular set of

parameter values. Indeed, for A = 100, (not reported) the spot and futures prices

are identical for each particular set of parameters. Finally, the reason why

intervention has such a large impact on both variances but a relatively small

impact on both mean prices can be explained by the fact that intervention by means

of Rule 1 has only an indirect effect on the means prices, whereas it impacts on

the variances directly.

 B. Welfare Effects

           Since the welfare criteria introduced in Section 4 involve the asymptotic

 means and variances the prices, the results we have just been considering are the

 key inputs in determining the welfare effects within the economy of the interven-

 tion rule. The welfare of the various agents shall be discussed in turn.

          Producers:

           (i) The welfare of producers as measured by expected profit, can either

increase or decrease with intervention. For most parameter sets, when disturbances

originate with demand, expected profit tends to fall with intervention, while for

supply disturbances, expected profit tends to rise. These findings reflect the

stabilizing effect of intervention on the price level and are consistent with the

usual results of the buffer stock stabilization literature. The exceptions to

this pattern are marginal, except Parameter Set 1, where expected profit fall

quite sharply with intervention in the presence of supply disturbances. This

particular result is a consequence of the fall in the spot price, together with

the only modest increase in the futures price.

          (ii) Intervention tends to stabilize the profit of firms (i.e., reduce

its one period variance) in the presence of demand disturbances and generally, but

not always, destabilize it in the presence of supply shocks. The reduction in the

variance of the spot and futures prices are obviously stabilizing. But the variance

of profit also depends upon (f —   p)2    This tends to be reduced by intervention in

the case of demand disturbances and to be increased in the case of supply shocks.

In the former case, the stabilizing effects of the reduced variance of price is

reinforced; in the latter case it is offset.

          (iii) The welfare of producers, as measured by E(V) generally falls in

the case of demand disturbances and rises in the case of supply disturbances. The

losses in the former case are less than those of expected profit. This is because

intervention tends to stabilize producer profit in that case. Likewise, the gains
                                          —28—

in the latter case are less than those of expected profit. This is due to the

destabilizing effect of intervention on profit associated with supply disturbances.


         Consumers:

         Consumers gain from intervention when the stochastic fluctuations originate

with demand. They may either gain or lose when the fluctuations are due to supply
disturbances. They usually lose when the fluctuations are due to supply disturbances,

aithouth, in the latter case they can also make significant gains. The magnitude

of the effects to consumers reflect the behavious of the mean and variance of the

spot price. The reduction in the mean price tends to benefit them, while the

reduction in the variance tends to harm them. The significant gains experienced

for Parameter Set 3 are due primarily to the large reduction in the mean spot price

(18% and 12% for demand and supply disturbances respectively) which occurs in that

case. Since the reductions in the means through intervention are smaller under

supply disturbances, the benefits to consumers are smaller in that case. It is

also possible that increased intervention turns consumer gains into losses; see,

e.g., Parameter Set 1 for A =    0,5,   A = 10.   This is because in the presence of

supply disturbances, intervention can actually raise the mean spot price, thereby

adversely affecting consumers.


          Speculators:

          (i) The expected profits of speculators always decline with intervention

when disturbances originate with demand. The same applies in the case of supply

disturbances for all but Parameter Set 1. The reduction in the variance of the

spot price, resulting from intervention, tends to reduce the expected profit of

speculators. But their expected profit also depends positively upon (f —

see (32a). As noted, this tends to decline with intervention in the case of demand

disturbances, so that the expected profit of speculators is reduced unambiguously

in that case. However, it tends to be increased in the case of supply shocks,
                                        —29—

 thereby offsetting the losses from more stable spot price. Indeed, in the case of

 Parameter Set 1, this effect can dominate leading to gains to speculators.

           (ii) The one period variance of speculative profits are almost always

 reduced through intervention, in the case of demand disturbances and usually increase

 in the case of supply disturbances. Exceptions in both cases do exist. The reason
 involves the effects of intervention on the variance of the spot price and the

divergence between the long—run mean spot and futures prices.

           (iii) The welfare of speculators as measured by their overall utility

function E(VS) is always reduced by intervention in the case of demand disturbances

and usually falls in the case of supply disturbances. Parameter Set 1 is the excep-.

tion for all degrees of intervention.

          Total Private Welfare:

          (i) Total private welfare effects, as measured by tE(IT) are almost always

positive for both disturbances. Exceptions are Parameter Set 5 for demand disturbances

and Parameter Set 8 for supply disturbances, when small losses are incurred when

intervention is weak. These losses, however, are converted to gains with more

intensive intervention (A >   1).   The overall private gains are larger in the case

of supply disturbances than for demand disturbances.

          (ii) Total private welfare effects as measured by AE(V) are always positive

in the case of demand disturbances, although there may be losses in the case of
supply disturbances, through the increases in the variances in producer and

speculator profits. More intensive intervention does not eliminate the losses

as measured in this way, and indeed may intensify them.

          Government:

          The government always ensures itself an expected profit from intervening

in accordance with Rule 1.    For a given degree of intervention, their gains are

marginally higher for supply disturbances, than they are for demand disturbances.
                                                     —30—

For very high degrees of intervention (A = 100) gains become small. This of course

is due to the fact that although A gets large, the subsequent decline in the

variance of the spot price more than offsets this. The relationship between the

intervention parameter A, and gains to the government is nonlinear. For example,

for Parameter Set 2 gains to the government are increased as A increases from 0.5

to 1 to 10, before subsequently declining. There is therefore an optimal degree

of intervention form the viewpoint of maximizing government revenue.'

          Total Welfare:

          (i) Total welfare as measured by expected profits is always positive.

Total welfare as measured by E(VT) is always positive in the case of demand

disturbances and with the exception of Parameter Set 1, in the case of supply

disturbances as well. In this case the losses to producers are not compensated

by the gains to the other agents in the economy.

                       =   )(pft—l   —   p*

                                                 )




          We consider now Rule 2, whereby the stabilization authority behaves as

a utility maximizing agent. In contrast to Rule 1, we find that in general,

stabilization is virtually ineffective for all degrees of intervention in terms

of variance reduction and changes in the mean price. Indeed, Rule 2 is so ineffec-

tive that only 2 of the 10 representative cases are worth reporting. Both of

these cases (Parameter Sets 1 and 3) are associated with high risk aversion and

inelastic demand. These are set Out in Tables 6 and 7. The                  effect   of Rule 2

on the distribution of prices and welfare for all other parameter sets is virtually

zero.


A. Effects on Long—Run Distributions of Prices

          Intervention via Rule 2             has    the effect of stabilizing the spot and futures

prices. In the case of demand disturbances, the mean spot price is reduced, while
                                        — 31—


  in the case of supply disturbances it can be either reduced or increased. Like-

  wise, the mean futures price is increased in the case of demand disturbances, while

  it can be either decreased or increased in the case of supply disturbances. In

 most cases, the mean futures price is less than the mean spot price, although this

  is not the case of supply disturbances with Parameter Set 1.

            An interesting comparison of Rule 2 with Rule 1 is that the former has

 a relatively greater impact on the mean than on the variance of the spot price.

 For example, with Parameter Set 3, setting V        10 we find that for supply disturbances
 a 9% reduction in the mean is associated with a .9% reduction in the variance.

 With A = 10 in Rule 1, we find that a 10.6% reduction in
                                                          the mean is associated
 with a 99% reduction in the variance. In all
                                                   cases, the change in both mean prices
 are always greater under Rule 1 than under Rule 2 (for equivalent values of the

 intervention parameters). Parameter Set 3, with V = 100
                                                         (not reported) repre-
 sents the greatest impact obtained for all Rule 2 simulations. While the effects

on the mean spot and futures prices are comparable in
                                                           magnitude than under Rule 1,
the effects on the corresponding variances
                                                are considerably less.

           In summary, we see that in terms of price and variance reduction, Rule 2

is substantially inferior to Rule 1.   Indeed, in most cases, intervention by means
of such a rule will have a negligible impact on the market.

B. Welfare Effects

          Since the welfare effects operate through the means and variances of the

prices, the welfare effects essentially mirror them. In particular, in all but
Parameter Sets 1 and 3, the effects are negligible. For the other two sets, the

effects can be summarized as follows

          (i) The expected profit of producers declines with intervention, if

disturbances originate with demand; it increases in the case of supply disturbances.

Intervention in accordance with Rule 2 stabilizes profit in the case of demand dis-

turbances, but destabilizes it for supply disturbances.      Welfare of firms, as
                                         —32—

measured by E(V), declines in the case of demand disturbances, but increases in

the case of supply disturbances.

            (ii) Consumers gain from intervention with demand disturbances; they may

either gain or lose in the case of supply disturbances.

        (iii) The expected profit of speculators declines with intervention,

although they are stabilized as well. However, overall, the welfare of speculators

declines.

            (iv) Private welfare, as measured by E(II) declines with intervention in

the case of demand disturbances; in the case of supply disturbances it may either

rise or fall. By contrast, private welfare, as measued by E(V) increases with

intervention in the case of demand disturbances; for supply disturbances it may

go either way.

             (v) The government gains from intervention.

            (vi) The overall gains from intervention are with one exception always

positive. The exception is in the case of supply disturbances, where the measure

E(IIT) is employed. In Parameter Set 1, the losses to consumers and speculators

may dominate the gains to other agents.

                           f   — P
8. RULE 3: Hi =                      )



             Representative solutions for intervention via Rule 3 are set out in Tables
8 and 9. Only for parameter sets 1, 3, 4, and 10 did this rule have uniformly

substantial effects on the asymptotic distributions of prices. For parameter sets

5 and 6 significant effects could be generated for high degrees of intervention.

For all other other parameter sets the effects are negligible. Note that as

               0. However, since for parameter sets 2, 7, 8, 9, the benchmark (no

intervention) values of        are so small, there is little opportunity for the

present rule to stabilize the futures prices in these cases.
                                         —33—

 A. Effects on Long—Run Distributions of Prices

           Being symmetric with Rule 1, one would expect that intervention with Rule

 3 to stabilize both the spot and futures prices (when effective). However, as can

 be seen from the solutions given in Table 8, even though such a rule always stabilizes

 the futures price (albeit by a negligible amount) it can destabilize the spot price;

e.g., parameter set 3 for ii   = 10.   The reason for this is that one effect of this

 form of intervention is to reduce the slope of the supply curve and inventory

demand function and both of these are destabilizing influences. In the case of

parameter set 3, when p = 10, these effects dominate all the other stabilizing

influences of the intervention. It is interesting to note that this case of

destabilization of the spot price is associated with inelastic consumer demand

and very high degrees of risk aversion for both producers and speculators. In

practice, since the empirical evidence suggests that farmers are not as risk

averse as the coefficients chosen for this parameter sets, the destabilization

of the spot price may in fact not be such a problem.

          Despite the fact that high degrees of intervention in the futures mar-

ket can destabilize the spot price, futures market intervention via Rule 3 always

reduces the mean spot price. As for the other two rules, the mean futures price

is increased after intervention. In general, changes in both mean prices are

less than the corresponding changes achieved under Rule 1 and in some cases even

less than for Rule 2; see, e.g., parameter sets 1 and 3. Similarly, reductions

in both variances are relatively small. We noted that for Rule 1 a considerable

degree of spot and futures market stabilization could be achieved for relatively

low degrees of intervention. In contrast, intervention in the futures market can

achieve substantial stabilization in the futures market, but relatively little

stabilization of the spot price. In fact, as futures market stabilization increases,

spot price stabilization declines, until in particular cases, we get a reveral as

noted above and the spot price becomes destabilized.    Furthermore, significant
                                        —34—

reductions in the variability of the futures price can be achieved only for high

degrees of intervention.


B. Welfare Effects

          The allocation of the welfare effects resulting from intervention in

accordance with Rule 3 can be summarized as follows:

          (i)   If disturbances originate with demand, the expected profit of

producers always decreases with a low degree of intervention and increases with a

high degree of intervention. The response in the case of supply disturbances is
slightly less clear cut, although this same pattern generally applies in that case

as well. A low degree of intervention always stabilizes producer profits, a high

degree destabilizes them. The welfare of producers, as measured by E(V), follows

that of expected profit.

         (ii) Consumers always gain from intervention with demand disturbances;

they may either gain or lose in the case of supply disturbances.

        (iii) The effect of intervention on the expected profit of speculators is

somewhat mixed. In the case of demand disturbances it usually declines if the

degree of intervention is low and to increase if the degree of intervention is

high. In the case of supply disturbances, expected profit is increased, especially

if the degree of intervention is high. For either demand or supply disturbances

a low degree of intervention stabilizes speculator profit, while a high degree of

intervention destabilizes them. The welfare of speculators, as measured by E(VS),

generally, but not always, follows that of E(115).

         (iv) Private welfare, as measured by E(ll), is increased when the degree

of intervention is high (p   = 10).   In the case of low degree of intervention, its

effects are much less sure and private welfare losses may be incurred. The same

comments apply when private welfare is measured by E(V).
                                      —35.-

          (v) The government tends to gain when the degree of intervention is low

and to lose when it is high.

         (vi) The total welfare gains from intervention are generally positive

or low degrees of intervention, but negative for high degrees of intervention.

          These general results merit some additional comments. First, the gains

to consumers and producers under Rule 3 are always less than the gains achieved

under Rule 1, with the corresponding losses being greater. Similarly, total private

and overall total welfare gains are always lessfor Rule 3 than Rule 1, and indeed,

as noted above, it is possible to get. negative gains under the former.

          Second, for Rules 1 and 2 it was found that speculators always lose from

intervention. A major difference for Rule 3 is that speculators can in fact gain.

Indeed, as the degree of intervention increases, so does the chance that speculators'

welfare will be positive; it will always be so for i   = 100.   Where speculators

lose under Rule 3, the losses are in fact less than the corresponding losses

achieved under Rule 1. Therefore speculators will always be better off under Rule 3

than under Rule 1. However, the same general conclusion cannot be drawn for compari-

Sons with Rule 2, as the latter was so ineffective in producing non—zero gains that

it is possible for Rule 3 to yield very small losses for speculators, compared with

the zero losses/gains under Rule 2.

         A major divergence from the first two rules is that under Rule 3, the

stabilization authority may in fact lose. We can see from the expression for the

gains to the stabilization authority that whether or not gains or losses are achieved

depends essentially upon the relative sizes of x1 and x2, defined in (31). In the

expression for these gains, (3bc), r(x1—l) will always be negative. If x2 is close

to unity, then the chances for gains will be increased. However, for large values

of i, x2 will tend to decline thus enhancing the possibility of losses. In fact,

from the simulation results we can conclude that the stabilization authority tends

to lose for p = 10 and always does so for p = 100.
                                     —36—

          Finally, we may note that whereas for Rules 1 and 2 total welfare was

greater than private welfare, this is not so for Rule   3.   On the contrary, as the

degree of intervention increases under Rule 3, society as a whole tends to lose,

this being always the case for p = 100.   This of course is due to the losses being

incurred by the stabilization authority in that case, which more than offset the

possible private gains.


9. FINAL COMMENTS

          In this paper we have analyzed the effects of three alternative intervention

rules on the long—run distributions of both the spot and futures prices, together with
the welfare implications which stem from these effects. The results for each rule

have been summarized at the appropriate part of the text, with some comparisons being

made. Space limitations preclude further detailed discussion here, and we conclude

with some general observations.

          As a general proposition we find that intervention in the futures market is

not as effective in stabilizing either the spot price or the futures price as is inter-

vention in the spot market. Indeed, the plausible rule of buying futures contracts

when their price is low and selling when they are high, while stabilizing the future

price, may actually destabilize the spot price. Furthermore, the analogous type

of rule undertaken in the spot market will always stabilize the futures price to

a greater degree than it does the spot price. The basic reason for these findings

is due to the impact that intervention has on the behavioral relationships of the

private sector. It underscores the need to develop the analysis in terms of a

utility maximizing framework.

          The various rules we have considered can generate rather different dis—

tributionsof welfare gains, including the overall benefits. The first rule, of inter-

vening in the spot market has the greatest effect. The allocation of benefits depends

in part upon the sources of the disturbances. With demand shocks, consumers and govern-

ment gain at the expense of speculators and producers. With supply disturbances pro-

ducers and the government gain at the expense of speculators and consumers. Much
                                      —37—

the same emerges (although to a smaller degree) with Rule 2.   In both these cases the

gains to society from intervention will generally (but not always) be positive.

          In the case of Rule 3, however, the benefits depend crucially upon the degree

of intervention. However, a high degree of intervention, which may be needed in order

to generate significant stabilizing effects on the spot price, may in fact generate

overall welfare losses. In particular, it is likely to lead to losses by the stabili-

zation authority and will therefore not be favored by them.

         As a final point, we may note that our analysis treats the numbers of

producers and speculators as being fixed exogenously. An important possibility is

that the introduction of price stabilization through intervention will influence

the number of participants in the market. An interesting extension of this analysis,

therefore, would be to allow the numbers of agents to be endogenously determined

through free entry or exit from the market.

 i/A survey of much of this literature is contained in Turnovsky (1978a). For a
      more recent discussion of more recent developments see Newbery and Stiglitz (1981).


 See, e.g., Turnovsky (1978b), Newbery and Stiglitz (1979).

 See, for example, Working (1985), Stein (1961), Peck (1976), Turnovsky (1979 and
   1983), and Kawai (1983).

 -'See also Kawai (1983) for a similar framework.

          futures contracts we consider are for single period which coincides with the
      production period.

   The assumption that costs -depene upon ptannea ratner than actual output can be justi-
 6/ -
 —
   fied if costs are incurred on non—stochastically determined inputs, chosen at the
    time the production decision is made. The random fluctuations in output appearing
   in revenue are due to stochastic disturbances in production conditions, which
   occur after the inputs have been purchased.


 The additive form of the disturbance term appearing in (2) corresponds to a produc-
   tion function f(mt) of the form y f(m) + v, where m is a fector of inputs.
   The result we shall obtain below, that production and futures trading decisions
   may be "separated," depends on this assumption and would not hold for a more
   general specification of the disturbance term y = f(mt,vp; see Danthine (1978).

 -'Since the function (3) can be derived from formal expected utility maximization
   under at best only highly restrictive conditions, we prefer to simply postulate
   (3) on the grounds of being a plausible and familiar ad hoc ojective, which is
   analytically tractable, rather than attempting to justify it in any very rigorous
   way. The function is consistent with expected utility maximization if (i) the
   utility function has constant absolute risk aversion and (ii) the spot price is
   normally distributed and output is non—stochastic, in which case    is normally
   distributed. It is not consistent with expected utility maximization if the firm's
   output is stochastic, since then uP will be non—normal. In this case the constant
   absolute risk averse utility function can be handled using the method of Bray
   (1981). The implied optimal decision rules for firms using this more general
   procedure turn out to differ from those derived below by terms which are of O(l/nf).
   Provided the number of firms is sufficiently large, as we are assuming, our
   approach provides an adequate approximation to this more general procedure.

 See Feder, Just and Schmitz (1980), although they assume         =   0.

10/
      For simplicity, the model assumes a zero interest rate. Since the introduction
      of such a rate would be exogenous to the market, its exclusion involves no essen—
      tial loss of generality.

The fact that • t—l may be negative is of no particular concern, since our
   specification he refers to only the speculative component of inventory hold—
      ings. To take care of the nonnegativity of total inventory holdings we simply
      assume that a sufficiently large fixed stock of inventories are held for non—
      speculative purposes to more than offset any short speculative position taken.

      More explicitly, one can introduce a based level of inventories i say and treat
      the speculative decision as_involving the choice of (' —        I).
                                                                     This leads to the
      addition of the base level i in the inventory demand function and provided i is
      taken to be sufficiently large, the problem of the nonnegativity of inventory
      demand disappears.

         the case of speculators, the demand functions (8a), (8b) would no longer
      obtain with a multiperiod objective function if costs were in terms of change
      in inventory holdings, say.

         1 and 3 assume that the stabilization authorities know the equilibrium
      level of spot and futures prices, respectively. An analysis of interven-
      tion when the authorities do not know the target price exactly has been carried
      out in a simple model (with only a spot market) by Turnovsky (l978b).

14/Rules
—                                        .
            such as (22a) are prevalent in the recent literature analyzing exchange
      market intervention.

           that Rule 1 requires the authorities to hold inventories of the commodity.
      No account is taken of the carrying costs of these inventories in assessing the
      costs and benefits of stabilization. Note further that the stocks of inventories
      held by the authorities at time t is given by
                                                         t

      where I is the initial level. Asymptotically, the expected value of this con-
      verges to the initial level, 10.

-'While these rules are arbitrarily specified, they are plausible. Both Rules 1
   and 3 have well established histories in both theoretical and applied work.
   One can of course specify an optimality criterion for the government and derive
   a corresponding optimal intervention policy. For example, if the stabilization
   authority chooses to maximize its utility of revenue from intervening in both
   the spot and futures market, then one can derive G and H functions of the form
   (8a), (8b), respectively. In this case, the effects of intervention can be
   analyzed through changes in the parameters, d, k.

-'Note further, that as the variance of prices tends to zero, the futures price con-
   verges to the equilibrium spot price.

--Note that we evaluate the welfare effects of the stabilization rules in terms of
   their asymptotic properties. While this seems reasonable, and is standard procedure,
   it may tell us little about the short run effects, especially when prices start from
   some initial point distant from their long run equilibrium.

      reason for looking at the asymptotic one—period variance E{ll — Ei(ll
  that this is the asymptotic expectation of the variance measure appearing n  the
  welfare function. This is not to be confused with asymptotic variance of profit,
  E[ll — E(rI)], which measures long—run variability.

      aggregation of the government's profit form intervention with the sum of pri-
  vate utilities is not entirely satisfactory. However, given that these utility
  measures are assumed to reflect dollar evaluations, the aggregate provides a
  measure for the potential for achieving Pareto optimality through redistribution.

-i'The equations were solved using a nonlinear solution subroutine contained in the
   Australian National University Program library and is based on a method dis-
   cussed in Brent (1973).

iThe following features of the benchmark solutions given in Table 3 merit atten-
   tion:  (i) the mean spot price P is lower under supply than under demand dis-
   turbances; (ii) the mean futures price P is higher under supply than under
   demand disturbances; (iii) f< P under demand disturbances; (iv) f > P under
   supply disturbances; (v) the variances of the spot, and futures prices
   respectively are both lower under demand disturbances than under supply dis-
   turbances; (vi) the variance of the futures price is less than the variance of
   the spot price.
