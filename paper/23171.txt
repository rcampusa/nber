                                          ABSTRACT

In an effort to address the opioid epidemic, a majority of states have recently passed some version
of a Naloxone Access Law (NAL) and/or a Good Samaritan Law (GSL). NALs allow lay
persons to administer naloxone, which temporarily counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose;
GSLs provide immunity from prosecution for drug possession to anyone who seeks medical
assistance in the event of a drug overdose. This study is the first to examine the effect of these
laws on opioid-related deaths. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System multiple
cause-of-death mortality files for the period 1999-2014, we find that the adoption of a NAL is
associated with a 9 to 11 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths. The estimated effect of
GLSs on opioid-related deaths is of comparable magnitude, but not statistically significant at
conventional levels. Finally, we find that neither NALs nor GSLs increase the recreational use of
prescription painkillers.

                                      1. INTRODUCTION

    Since the early 2000s, the rate of drug overdose deaths in the United States has more than

doubled (Rudd et al. 2016). Overdose deaths are currently at record levels, with more than 60

percent of these deaths due to opioid use, primarily prescription pain relievers and heroin (Rudd

et al. 2016). According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the United States is facing

“the worst drug overdose epidemic” in its history (Ahmed 2013).

     In an effort to reduce the death toll from the use of opioids, New Mexico passed the first

Naloxone Access Law (NAL) in 2001. Under this law, trained responders (e.g., police and

firefighters) were authorized to administer an “opioid antagonist” (i.e., naloxone) if they believed

that someone was experiencing a drug overdose. The law also stated that “a person who

administers an opioid antagonist…shall not be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution as

a result of the administration of the drug” (NM Stat § 24-23-1). Since 2001, 44 additional states

and the District of Columbia have adopted NALs, which allow lay persons to administer and

distribute naloxone without fear of legal repercussions.

     New Mexico was also the first state to pass a Good Samaritan Law (GSL). Under this law,

anybody “who, in good faith, seeks medical assistance for someone experiencing a drug-related

overdose shall not be charged or prosecuted for possession of a controlled substance…” (NM

Stat § 30-31-27). Since 2007, 33 additional states and the District of Columbia have followed

suit, although some GSLs are stronger than others. For instance, in 23 states the law provides

immunity from prosecution for possession of drug paraphernalia in addition to immunity from

prosecution for possession of a controlled substance.

     GSLs and NALs are viewed as important weapons in the fight against the opioid epidemic.

They have received strong bipartisan support (Ollove 2014), and prominent groups such as the



                                                 1
American Medical Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the American Public Health

Association also support the adoption of GSLs and NALs. However, these laws have their

critics. For instance, the governor of Maine, Paul LePage, recently vetoed naloxone access and

Good Samaritan bills, arguing that they would encourage drug use and hamper law enforcement

efforts (Cousins 2013; Sledge 2014; Tesfaye 2016).

      This study is the first to examine the effects of GSLs and NALs on opioid-related

mortality. Drawing upon data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) multiple cause-

of-death mortality files for the period 1999-2014, we estimate standard difference-in-difference

models, which exploit within-state variation and control flexibly for common shocks caused by,

for instance, the reformulation of OxyContin in 2010.1

      We find that the adoption of a NAL is associated with a 9 to 11 percent reduction in opioid-

related deaths. The relationship between NALs and opioid-related deaths that do not involve

heroin appears to be stronger than the relationship between NALs and heroin-related deaths.

Moreover, our results suggest that removing criminal liability for possession of naloxone is an

important feature of these laws. Removing criminal liability for possession of naloxone is

associated with a 13 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths, while Poisson estimates of the

effect of NALs without this provision are considerably smaller and statistically indistinguishable

from zero. The estimated effects of GSLs on opioid-related deaths are consistently negative, but

not statistically significant at conventional levels. We do, however, find stronger evidence that

GSLs reduce opioid-related deaths involving alcohol. Finally, contrary to the claims made by


1
 OxyContin was reformulated in 2010 with the goal of making it more difficult to abuse. There is
evidence that the reformulation in fact deterred abuse (Havens et al. 2014), but it may have also
encouraged the use of heroin and other OxyContin substitutes (Alpert et al. 2017). Figure 1 shows that
heroin-related mortality was roughly constant during the period 1999-2010. From 2010 to 2014, the
heroin-related mortality rate increased markedly, while mortality involving other opioids peaked in 2011.

some critics of NALs and GSLs, we find little evidence that these laws increase the recreational

use of prescription painkillers.



                                       2. BACKGROUND

        A number of state-level polices have been proposed to combat the opioid epidemic. For

instance, lawmakers have argued that prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) should be

strengthened (Ronayne 2015; Perrone 2016), and, as noted above, most states have passed some

version of a NAL or a GSL.

        Naloxone, which is administered by injection or nasal spray, temporarily counteracts the

effects of an opioid overdose. Its side effects (e.g., headache, nausea, sweating, and vomiting),

can be unpleasant, but are not life threatening (Boyer 2012). Laypersons with little or no training

can successfully administer naloxone (Doe-Simkins et al. 2014), giving overdose victims the

opportunity to seek assistance from trained medical professionals, although once revived the

majority of victims choose not to call 911 (Enteen et al. 2010; Bennett et al. 2011; Doe-Simkins

et al. 2014).

        NALs are designed to provide bystanders, family members, and first responders with an

effective intervention in the event of an overdose. However, NALs could, at least in theory, lead

to more drug use by lowering its expected cost, which includes the possibility of overdosing.

Critics also worry that increased access to naloxone could discourage overdose victims from

calling 911 by giving them an easy, low-cost alternative to utilizing traditional emergency

medical services (Seal et al. 2003; Castillo 2015). Indeed, a recent survey of organizations that




                                                 3
distribute naloxone kits conducted by the Harm Reduction Coalition (HRC) found that 83

percent of overdose reversals were performed by drug users (Wheeler et al. 2015).2

        GSLs provide immunity from prosecution for drug possession to anyone who seeks

emergency medical assistance in the event of a drug overdose. Some GSLs also provide

immunity from prosecution for possession of alcohol (for instance, if the caller is under the

minimum legal drinking age) and immunity from prosecution for possession of drug

paraphernalia. The intent of these laws is to encourage bystanders and victims to call 911.

However, just like NALs, they could lead to more drug use by lowering its expected cost.



2.1. Previous studies

      Although there is reasonably strong evidence that PDMPs reduce opioid prescribing and

drug treatment admissions (Haegerich et al. 2014; Bao et al. 2016), next to nothing is known

about the effects of GSLs and NALs (Haegerich et al. 2014, p. 40). What little we do know

about these laws comes from a handful of case studies (Mueller et al., 2015).

      The first of these case studies, by Albert et al. (2011), examined Project Lazarus, an

ambitious community-based overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina.

As part of Project Lazarus, doctors were trained to identify patients at risk of overdosing on

opioids, and naloxone kits were made available free of charge to these patients if they agreed to

2
  This same survey found that drug users represented 82 percent of naloxone kit recipients; twelve percent
of recipients were friends of drug users and family members, and 3 percent were service providers
(Wheeler et al. 2015). It should be noted that law enforcement organizations, fire departments, and
emergency responders were not surveyed by the HRC. Enteen et al. (2010) surveyed drug users who
were given naloxone kits and training by a community-based program in San Francisco. They found that
only 29 percent of participants who used naloxone to reverse an overdose also called emergency services.
Bennett et al. (2011) surveyed drug users before and after receiving naloxone kits and training from a
community-based overdose-prevention program operating in Allegheny County, PA. Before receipt of
the kits, those surveyed reported calling 911 in 34 percent of overdose situations. After receiving
naloxone and training, this figure decreased to 10 percent.


                                                    4
watch a 20-minute educational video. Overdose deaths fell sharply in 2010, the year in which

distribution of the naloxone kits began, but, because Project Lazarus involved multiple

interventions undertaken concurrently, it is impossible to isolate the effect of any single

intervention.

      Walley et al. (2013) examined the Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND)

program in Massachusetts, which began providing naloxone and overdose education to drug

users, the friends and families of drug users, and first responders in 2006.3 These authors found

that opioid overdose deaths declined substantially from 2006 to 2009 in communities that

participated in the OEND program relative to communities that did not participate. Doe-Simkins

et al. (2014), who also analyzed data from the OEND program, were primarily interested in the

effect of formal training by OEND staff on outcomes such as whether the overdose victim

survived and whether 911 was called. They found no evidence that trained rescuers acted

differently than rescuers who obtained naloxone through social networks, nor did they find

evidence that trained rescuers had a higher success rate than their untrained counterparts.4

      Finally, Banta-Green et al. (2013) surveyed police officers and paramedics in Seattle about

a Washington law that included both a Good Samaritan immunity provision and allowed

naloxone to be carried and administered by laypersons. Banta-Green et al. (2013a) found that,

more than a year after the passage of the law, few police officers and paramedics had heard of it.

However, awareness increased dramatically after a training video was circulated (Banta-Green

 Naloxone and educational materials were delivered through needle exchange and drug treatment
programs, at HIV prevention drop-in centers, emergency departments and primary healthcare settings,
homeless shelters, and community meetings.
4
 Other, essentially descriptive, studies focused on gauging the effects of local naloxone distribution
programs include Enteen et al. (2010), Coffin et al. (2016), and McAuley (2017).



                                                     5
2013b). The authors did not examine drug overdoses or whether drug users, their friends and

family members were aware of the change in the Washington law, but concluded that “the

impact of Good Samaritan laws on…health outcomes is worth evaluating” (Banta-Green et al.

2013a, p. 1109).



2.2. NALs

      Information on NALs was obtained from the Policy Surveillance Program, which is funded

by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.5 Table 1 shows the effective date of each NAL passed

during the period 2001-2014 and provides some basic information about the laws.6

      During the period under study, 27 states and the District of Columbia adopted NALs.

Twenty-three of these laws allowed “standing orders” (also called “non-patient-specific

prescriptions”), under which prescribers can authorize the distribution of naloxone to laypersons

deemed capable of administering it and to community-based overdose-prevention programs, fire

departments, and police departments (Wheeler et al. 2012; Davis et al. 2014; Green et al. 2015);

pharmacists can typically dispense naloxone to anyone who meets the standing-order criteria

(Davis and Carr 2015).

      Eleven NALs adopted during the period under study removed criminal liability for

possession of naloxone without a prescription. In theory, removing criminal liability for

possession of naloxone should increase access and encourage its use in emergency situations

5
 See http://lawatlas.org/. Additional information on NALs and GSLs was obtained from the Network for
Public Health Law (https://www.networkforphl.org/_asset/qz5pvn/network-naloxone-10-4.pdf).
6
 NALs were defined as laws that (i) grant criminal and civil immunity to non-medical professionals who
administer naloxone, (ii) grant criminal and civil immunity to medical professionals who prescribe
naloxone to patients, or (iii) allow medical professionals to issue third-party naloxone prescriptions.
Third-party prescriptions are dispensed to someone other than the patient (e.g., a family member of
someone at risk of experiencing an overdose).



                                                   6
(Corey et al. 2013). Naloxone is not considered to be a controlled substance and it cannot be

abused or taken recreationally (Jasinski et al. 1967; Seal et al. 2003; Straus et al. 2013).

Nevertheless, qualitative studies provide evidence that drug users fear that they may be subject to

arrest for possession of naloxone if they call 911 and the police arrive along with the paramedics

(Seal et al. 2003; Worthington et al. 2006; Kerr et al. 2008; Gaston et al. 2009).



2.3. GSLs

      Typically, death from opioid overdose is not sudden (Zador et al. 1996; Boyer 2012),

giving bystanders, companions and family members time to seek emergency medical assistance.

However, qualitative studies have found that fear of being arrested or harassed by police often

discourages drug users from calling 911 (Seal et al. 2003; Tracey et al. 2005; Tobin et al. 2005;

Bennett et al. 2011). For instance, Bennett et al. (2011) surveyed drug users who had received

naloxone kits and training from a community-based overdose-prevention program.7 A total of

249 overdoses were reported, but 911 was called only 10 percent of the time. Seventy-one

percent of participants cited “fear of police involvement” as the reason for not calling 911

(Bennett et al. 2011, p. 1025).

      Table 2 shows the effective date of every GSL passed during the period 1999-2014.8

During this period, 22 states and the District of Columbia adopted GSLs, which provide

immunity from criminal prosecution for possession and/or use of a controlled substance to

anyone who calls for emergency medical assistance in the event of an overdose. Fifteen of these

laws also provide immunity from prosecution for possession of drug paraphernalia; five of these

laws provide callers under the age of 21 with immunity from prosecution for possession of

alcohol.


                                          3. METHODS

3.1. The data

       Mortality data were obtained from the NVSS multiple cause-of-death mortality files.

These data are at the state-year level and cover the period 1999-2014. Our interest is in

estimating the effects of NALs and GSLs on opioid-related deaths, defined as those indicated by

the following International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) multiple cause-

of-death codes: T40.0 (opium), T40.1 (heroin), T40.2 (other opioids), T40.3 (methadone), T40.4

(other synthetic narcotics), and T40.6 (other/unspecified narcotics).

       It should be noted that the ICD-10 defines the term “narcotic” to include both cocaine

derivatives and opioids, so that some portion of the deaths identified by the multiple cause-of-

death code T40.6 could have been caused by cocaine. However, these deaths represent only a

small fraction of total opioid-related deaths. For instance, in 2014 (the last year included in our

analysis), there were a total of 29,650 opioid-related deaths in the United States. Of these, only

1,635 (or 5.5 percent) involved “other/unspecified narcotics” and no other type of opioid.

       Figure 1 shows opioid-related deaths in the United States per 100,000 population by

year. Figure 1 also shows heroin-related deaths (ICD-10 code T40.1) per 100,000 population

and non-heroin opioid-related deaths (ICD10 codes T40.0, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, and T40.6) per




                                                 8
100,000 population.9 Non-heroin opioid-related mortality increased steadily during the period

1999-2010, peaked in 2011, and then began to decline. This decline is commonly attributed to

the introduction of PDMPs and the crackdown on “pill mills” in Florida and elsewhere (Johnson

et al. 2014; Griggs et al. 2015), but the adoption of GSLs and NALs could have played a role.

Heroin-related mortality was relatively steady through most of the period under study,

but exhibited a sharp increase from 2010-2014 as many users of prescription opioids switched to

heroin.10


3.2. Empirical model

      Our empirical methodology exploits temporal and geographic variation in the passage of

NALs and GSLs to gain a better understanding of their effects. Specifically, we estimate the

following baseline Poisson regression:



     (1)    ln λst = α0 + α1NALst + α2GSLst + Xstβ + vs + wt,



where λst represents the expected number of opioid-related deaths in state s and year t.11 The

independent variables of interest are NALst and GSLst. NALst is an indicator, equal to 1 if a NAL


9
 Counts of opioid overdose deaths published by the CDC are restricted to those with ICD-10 underlying
cause-of-death codes X40–44 (unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10–Y14
(undetermined intent). See, for instance, Rudd et al. (2016). When we estimated equation (1) using
opioid-related deaths with these underlying cause-of-death codes as the dependent variable, the results
were very similar to those reported and discussed below.
10
   The evidence that users of prescription opioids switched to heroin as a response to the introduction of
PDMPs and the crackdown on pill mills is largely anecdotal. See, for instance, Park and Bloch (2016)
and Wilson (2016). There is stronger evidence that the reformulation of OxyContin in 2010, which made
it much more difficult to abuse, also fueled the increase in heroin-related deaths (Alpert et al. 2017).
11
 See Cameron and Trivedi (1986) and Grootendorst (2002) for descriptions of the Poisson regression
model. As noted by Card and Dahl (2011), an advantage of the Poisson regression model is that


                                                     9
was in effect in state s and year t (and equal to 0 otherwise). The indicator GSLst is defined

analogously.12 The inclusion of state fixed effects, represented by the term νs, ensures that our

estimates of α1 and α2 are identified using within-state variation. The year fixed effects,

represented by wt, account for common shocks to the opioid-related deaths caused by, for

instance, the reformulation of OxyContin in 2010 or changes in drug enforcement priorities at

the federal level.

        Only one control, the natural log of population, is used in the baseline regression. In

subsequent regressions, we add a PDMP indicator to the vector of controls, Xst, equal to 1 if there

was a PDMP operating in state s and year t. There is reasonably strong evidence that the

implementation of a PDMP reduces opioid prescriptions and drug treatment admissions

(Haegerich et al. 2014; Bao et al. 2016), although the evidence with regard to PDMPs and

opioid-related deaths is decidedly mixed (Paulozzi et al. 2011; Reiﬂer et al. 2012).

        In the fully specified model, the vector of controls, Xst, also includes the natural log of

police officers per capita in state s and year t, an indicator for whether medical marijuana was

legal, the natural log of the beer tax, the natural log of the cigarette tax, and the natural log of the

unemployment rate.13 Previous studies provide some evidence, albeit largely descriptive, of a


including fixed effects does not lead to an incidental parameters problem. Appendix Table 1 provides
descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis.
12
  When a naloxone access law was in effect for less than a full year, the indicator NALst is a fraction.
Likewise, when a Good Samaritan law was in effect for less than a full year, the indicator GSLst is a
fraction. Tables 1 and 2 provide the exact date in which these laws came into effect.
13
  The fully specified model includes these controls as well as the natural log of beer taxes in state s and
year t, the natural log of cigarette taxes, the natural log of the number of college graduates, the natural log
of per capita income, and the natural log of the minimum wage. Information on PDMPs came from the
National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws (http://www.namsdl.org/prescription-monitoring-
programs.cfm) and Bao et al. (2016). Information on police per capita come from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics; MML data come from Sabia et al. (2017) and the Marijuana Policy Project (2016). Beer tax
data are obtained from the Beer Institute and cigarette tax data from Tax Burden on Tobacco. State-level

2005; Corsaro et al. 2013). There is also evidence that opioid users are at risk of using other

substances, including alcohol and tobacco (Catalano et al. 2011; Fiellin et al. 2013; Bachhuber et

al. 2014). Carpenter et al. (forthcoming) documented a substantial increase in substance use

disorders involving opioids as a result of the Great Recession.



                                             4. RESULTS

4.1. Baseline estimates

         Table 3 presents Poisson estimates of equation (1) weighted by the population of state s

in year t. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are corrected for clustering at the state level.

The baseline specification suggests that the adoption of a NAL is associated with an almost 11

percent decrease (e-.113 – 1 = -.107) in opioid-related deaths. The estimated effect of adopting a

GSL on opioid-related deaths is of comparable magnitude, but is not statistically significant.

         When we include the PDMP indicator as a control, the estimates of α1 and α2 become

smaller, but the estimate of α1 remains significant: the adoption of a NAL is associated with a 9

percent decrease in opioid-related deaths. We show the results of including the full set of

controls in the third column of Table 1. The estimates of α1 and α2 are not particularly sensitive

to controlling for factors such as police officers per capita, the unemployment rate, and beer

taxes.




data on educational attainment are obtained from the Current Population Survey; per capita income data is
obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
and minimum wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Tax Policy Center.



                                                   11
4.2. Robustness checks

        In an effort to explore the sensitivity of our results, OLS estimates of equation (1) are

reported in Table 4. In these regressions, the natural log of population is no longer included as a

control, and the natural log of the opioid-related mortality rate in state s and year t replaces the

natural log of λst.

        The OLS estimates reported in Table 4 are, in general, larger than the Poisson estimates

reported in Table 3, but they are less precise. For instance, according to the baseline

specification, the adoption of a NAL is associated with a 13 percent decrease (e-.142 – 1 = -.132)

in the opioid-related mortality rate. However, this estimate is not significant at the 10 percent

level (p-value = 0.12). When all of the controls are included on the right-hand side, the adoption

of a NAL is associated with a 17 percent decrease in the opioid-related mortality rate. Again, the

GSL estimates are of comparable magnitude to the estimates of α1, but imprecise: in fact, the

estimate of α2 exceeds its standard error only in the fully specified model in column (3).14

        In Table 5, we present estimates of equation (1) augmented with mutually exclusive leads

and lags of the NAL indicator. Consistent with the parallel trends assumption, there is little

evidence that opioid-related mortality increased in the years leading up to NAL adoption. Before

Year 0 (the year of NAL adoption), estimates of the relationship between the NAL indicator and

opioid-related mortality are small and statistically insignificant. The estimated effect in the year

of adoption is larger in absolute magnitude but still insignificant. Significance is not reached

until two or more years after adoption. The Poisson estimate suggests that, after two years, NAL

adoption is associated with a 21 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths. The corresponding

14
  In Appendix Table 2, we report unweighted OLS and Poisson estimates of equation (1). The results are
generally consistent with those discussed thus far: NALs are associated with a 10 percent decrease in
opioid-related deaths and a 20 percent decrease in the opioid-related mortality rate. Negative binomial
regressions produce quantitatively similar results when models converge.


                                                  12
OLS estimate suggests that, after two years, NAL adoption is associated with a 29 percent

reduction in opioid-related deaths.

        As a final robustness check, we present the results of a standard event-study analysis in

Figure 2. Specifically, we present Poisson estimates obtained by regressing opioid-related deaths

on an indicator for NAL adoption, its leads and lags, the natural log of population, 50 state

indicators and 15 year indicators. Leading up to the year of adoption (Year 0), the Poisson

estimates are insignificant relatively small. After one year, the adoption of a NAL is associated

with a 6 percent decrease in opioid-related deaths, but this estimate is not significant (p-value =

0.37). After two or more years, adoption of a NAL is associated with a 22 percent decrease in

opioid-related deaths.



                                           5. EXTENSIONS

5.1. Heroin vs other opioids

        Heroin overdoses and overdoes involving prescription opioids can both be successfully

treated with naloxone (Boyer 2012). Nevertheless, there is evidence that naloxone is used to

reverse heroin-related overdoses more often than it is used to reverse overdoses involving

prescription opioids such as methadone and oxycodone. For instance, a survey of organizations

that distribute naloxone kits conducted in 2014 found that fully 82 percent of overdose reversals

involved heroin (Wheeler et al. 2015), perhaps because these organizations have, at least until

recently, focused on serving heroin users, or because heroin users are more likely to receive and

carry naloxone on their person than the users of prescription opioids.15


15
  According to Wheeler et al. (2015, p. 634), “early adopters of naloxone kit provision were mainly
syringe exchanges”, but these authors went on to note that “organizations providing naloxone kits are
increasing rapidly” and that organizations that began operation recently were less likely to have been


                                                    13
        In Table 6 we examine the effects of NALs and GSLs on heroin-related deaths and deaths

involving opioids other than heroin. Although negative, the Poisson estimate of the effect of

NALs on heroin-related deaths is relatively small and statistically insignificant. By contrast, the

adoption of a NAL is associated with a 9 percent decrease in opioid-related deaths not involving

heroin.16 The OLS estimates are closer in magnitude, but the estimated effect of adopting a NAL

on the heroin-related morality rate is not significant. The adoption of a GSL is associated with a

13 percent decrease in opioid-related deaths not involving heroin, and a 19 percent decrease in

the non-heroin opioid-related morality rate. Taken together, the results reported in Table 6

suggest that NALs and GSLs may be more effective weapons in the fight against prescription

opioid mortality than previously thought.



5.2. Alcohol and opioids

        The combination of alcohol and opioids is especially dangerous (Gudin et al. 2013), but

naloxone is not harmful to administer to someone suffering from alcohol poisoning, and it may

in fact work as an antidote to alcohol poisoning (Badawy and Evans 1981; Wu et al. 2012).




surveyed. Bennett et al. (2011), who surveyed drug users who had received naloxone kits and training
from an overdose prevention program “targeted primarily to heroin users” (p. 1028), found that 92 percent
of reversals involved heroin. Gaston et al. (2009) surveyed opioid users in Birmingham and London who
had received naloxone kits and training. They found that most participants did not carry naloxone on
their persons out of “fear of police engagement, and the awkwardness of carrying something bulky and
unwieldy.”
16
  However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimated effect of adopting a NAL on heroin-related
deaths is equal to the estimated effect of adopting a NAL on opioid-related deaths not involving heroin at
conventional levels (p-value = 0.50).



                                                   14
Several GSLs provide immunity from prosecution for drug possession to those seeking medical

assistance in the event of alcohol poisoning.17

        In Table 7 we explore the effects of NALs and GSLs on deaths involving alcohol, deaths

involving alcohol but not opioids, and deaths involving a combination of alcohol and opioids.18

Although consistently negative, the estimated effects of NALs and GSLs on alcohol-related

mortality are relatively small and not statistically significant. However, the Poisson regressions

provide evidence that these laws lead to fewer deaths involving both alcohol and opioids. The

adoption of a NAL is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 8 percent decrease in deaths

involving both alcohol and opioids; the adoption of a GSL is associated with a 16 percent

decrease in deaths involving both alcohol and opioids. This latter estimate is statistically

significant at the 10 percent level. OLS estimates confirm this general pattern of results.



5.3. Exploring the effects of specific NAL provisions

        As noted in the background section, 23 NALs adopted during the period 1999-2014

allowed standing orders, under which prescribers can authorize the distribution of naloxone to

any laypersons deemed capable of administering it and to drug prevention programs (Wheeler et

al. 2012; Davis et al. 2014; Green et al. 2015). Eleven NALs adopted during this same period

17
  For instance, the GSL recently adopted by Arkansas defines a “drug overdose” as “an acute condition
resulting from, or that a reasonable person would believe to be resulting from, the consumption or use of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or dangerous drug, or a combination of alcohol, controlled substance, or
dangerous drug …” GSLs adopted by Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,
and Wisconsin during the period under study pertain specifically to drug/opioid overdoses.
18
  Deaths involving alcohol were defined as those with the following ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death
codes: F10 (mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol), G31.2 (degeneration of nervous
system due to alcohol), G62.1 (alcoholic polyneuropathy), I42.6 (alcoholic cardiomyopathy), K29.2
(alcoholic gastritis), K70 (alcoholic liver disease), R78.0 (finding of alcohol in blood), X45 (accidental
poisoning by and exposure to alcohol), X65 (intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to alcohol), and
Y15 (poisoning by and exposure to alcohol, undetermined intent).


                                                    15
removed criminal liability for possession of naloxone without a prescription. In Table 8 we

explore the effects of these two provisions by estimating the following Poisson regression:



(2)     ln λst = π0 + π1NALst + π2NALst x Standing Orderst + π3NALst x Possessionst + π4GSLst +

Xstβ + vs + wt,



where λst represents the expected number of opioid-related deaths in state s and year t. In

addition to reporting estimates of equation (1), we report OLS estimates the effects of these

provisions on the opioid-related mortality rate.

        The Poisson estimates of π1 and π2 are, without exception, statistically insignificant. By

contrast, removing criminal liability for possession of naloxone is associated with a 13 percent

decrease in the number of opioid-related deaths. It is also associated with a 13 percent decrease

in the number of deaths involving opioids other than heroin.

        The OLS estimates of π1 are large and negative across the board, and two out of three are

statistically significant: NALs that neither provide for standing orders nor remove criminal

liability for possession of naloxone are associated with a 17 percent decrease in the opioid-

related mortality rate and a 14 percent decrease in the non-heroin opioid-related mortality rate.

While the OLS estimates of π2 and π3 are generally imprecise, removing criminal liability for

possession of naloxone is associated with an additional 16 percent decrease in the non-heroin

opioid-related morality rate.19


19
  In Appendix Table 3 we provide Poisson and OLS estimates of an equation in which we interact the
GSL indicator with three separate indicators: the first for whether the GSL includes immunity from
prosecution for possession of alcohol, the second for whether it includes immunity for possession of drug
paraphernalia, and the third for whether it includes immunity for parole violations. The results are, in
general, messy, perhaps due to sufficient independent variation. Several estimated coefficients are large


                                                   16
5.4. Non-prescription use of prescription painkillers

        Finally, we explore whether there is evidence of moral hazard associated with the

adoption of NALs and GSLs. For this task, we turn to state-level data on recreational (i.e., non-

prescription) prescription pain reliever use from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health

(NSDUH). These data are publicly available and cover the period 2003-2014.20

        In Table 9, we report OLS estimates of the effects of NALs and GSLs on the recreational

use of prescription pain relievers.21 These estimates provide little evidence that either NALs or

GSLs lead to changes in the recreational use of prescription painkillers. NALs are associated

with small, statistically insignificant changes in the recreational use of prescription pain

relievers.22 For GSLs, the estimated effects are also insignificant and are negative in two out of

three specifications (columns 2 and 3). Together, the results in Table 9 provide little evidence

that NALs or GSLs generate moral hazard.




positive, while others are of equal magnitude, but negative. Given these results, we chose to focus on the
NAL provisions.
20
 For more information on the NSDUH data see the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration. The data are available at: https://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh
21
   Publicly available state-level data on the rate of non-prescription pain reliever use are available for 12-
17 year-olds, 18-25 year-olds, and those ages 26 and older for the years 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-
2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014. The dependent variable is the natural log of the state-
specific rate of non-prescription use of prescription painkillers by age group. Controls include those
listed in column (3) of Table 4.
22
  Estimates are precise enough to rule out, with 90 percent confidence, NAL-induced increases in the rate
of prescription pain reliever use of greater than 8.2 percent for 12-17 year-olds, 1.0 percent for 18-25
year-olds, and 12.3 percent for those ages 26 and older.

                                        6. CONCLUSION

        To date, 34 states and the District of Columbia have adopted Good Samaritan Laws

(GSLs), which provide immunity from prosecution for possession of a controlled substance to

anyone who calls for emergency medical assistance. Forty-five states and the District of

Columbia have adopted Naloxone Access Laws (NALs), which allow lay persons to administer

and distribute naloxone without fear of legal repercussions. Although they clearly enjoy broad

support these laws have received little scrutiny from academic researchers. In fact, next to

nothing is known about their impact on outcomes of interest to policymakers, the public, and

social scientists.

        The current study draws on data from the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-

of-death mortality files for the period 1999-2014 to explore the effects of GSLs and NALs on

opioid-related deaths. The estimated effects of GSLs on opioid-related deaths are often large and

are consistently negative, but not statistically significant at conventional levels. By contrast, we

find evidence that the adoption of a NAL leads to a reduction in opioid-related deaths of 9 to 11

percent. Two or more years after the adoption of a NAL, this effect appears to be stronger: on

average, NAL adoption is associated with a 21 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths.

Although opponents argue that NALs could encourage recreational opioid use (Sledge 2014;

Tesfaye 2016), this effect (if it exists) is clearly outweighed by their intended use as an antidote

to opioid overdoses in emergency situations.

        We also find evidence that the relationship between NALs and opioid-related deaths that

do not involve heroin is stronger than the relationship between NALs and heroin-related deaths.

Specifically, we find that, although negative, the Poisson estimate of the effect of NALs on

heroin-related deaths is small and statistically insignificant, while the adoption of a NAL is



                                                 18
associated with a 9 percent decrease in opioid-related deaths not involving heroin. Finally, our

results suggest that removing criminal liability for possession of naloxone is an important feature

of these laws. Removing criminal liability for possession of naloxone is associated with a 13

percent reduction in opioid-related deaths, while Poisson estimates of the effect of NALs without

this provision are considerably smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero.

       Although only a handful of states have failed to adopt some version of a NAL, there are

other barriers to making naloxone available to those who need it. For instance, according to data

collected by Truven Health Analytics, the cost of naloxone has risen dramatically in the past

decade, from $0.92 per dose to more than $15 per dose (Jacobs 2016). Apparently, the auto-

injector version of naloxone now costs more than $2,000 per dose! If these trends continue, it is

not clear whether NALs will continue to be as effective at reducing opioid-related deaths as they

have been in the past.
