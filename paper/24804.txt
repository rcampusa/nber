                                          ABSTRACT

We study the effects of available student loan repayment plans on borrowers’ career choices. By
removing the risk of loan default, income driven repayment (IDR) plans make higher-paying but
riskier jobs more attractive to those with moderate skill levels. We present experimental evidence
that student loan recipients consider the repayment plans offered to them as well as the plans
available to other borrowers as a reference in their evaluations of loans and careers. Emotions
such as regret over a choice that turns out to be suboptimal ex post and relief at being unburdened
from having to make a choice that could turn out badly play significant roles in borrowers’ career
choices. Compared to giving borrowers a choice between a standard loan repayment plan that
requires a fixed amount to be repaid over a shorter period and an IDR plan that protects
borrowers from default by linking payments to income, offering only the IDR plan generates
notable benefits. Removing the standard plan from borrowers’ choice sets makes remunerative
but risky careers more appealing to borrowers and raises their expected net income. Moreover,
these effects are strongest when borrowers holding different plans coexist in the population, as in
this environment relief from the possibility of being exposed to a regret-triggering situation is
most salient.

    1. Introduction
         Over the past decade, college students in the United States have taken on increasing amounts
of debt to finance their postsecondary educations. 1 The growth in student borrowing has been
accompanied by increases in delinquency and default rates. 2 In recent cohorts of borrowers, almost
30% defaulted on their loans within 5 years of entering repayment (Looney and Yannelis, 2015).
Student loans remain a necessity for many students to finance their education, and for the average
borrower, the lifetime earnings gain from college attendance will significantly exceed the cost of
borrowing (Avery and Turner, 2012). Even borrowers who will eventually receive a positive return
on their postsecondary investment, however, may struggle to repay their loans. An important
contributing factor is that the standard repayment plan – which requires borrowers to make fixed
monthly payments over a 10-year period – is not well aligned with borrowers’ post-college earnings
profiles (Dynarski and Kreisman, 2013; Barr et al., 2017). To address this concern, the U.S.
Department of Education (hereafter, ED) has implemented and expanded income-driven repayment
(IDR) plans that aim to protect borrowers from default by allowing payments to vary with earnings.
         IDR addresses the risk of loan default due to low earnings by setting payments to $0 when
earnings fall below a set level. 3 Under IDR, however, a borrower could make larger payments than
would be required under the standard loan repayment plan. Thus, the availability of IDR may
generate unintended spillovers to decisions in other aspects of borrowers’ lives. Theoretically, access
to IDR will have ambiguous effects on career choice. On one hand, by linking payments to income,
IDR reduces the expected relative return to choosing a high paying career (Lochner and Monge-
Naranjo, 2016). On the other hand, by reducing downside risk, IDR could increase the likelihood that
borrowers pursue higher-paying careers that involve more uncertainty and/or require a longer
period of job search (Ji, 2017). While there is evidence that IDR can significantly reduce defaults
(Hebst, 2018), little is known about the extent to which IDR affects borrowers’ labor market decisions
and whether these effects vary with borrower ability. 4


1 Among public and nonprofit four-year college graduates in 2015-16, 60% had student debt averaging $28,400 per
borrower (Baum et al., 2017). Cumulative outstanding student loan debt stood at $1.41 trillion as of March 2018,
representing a 10-year increase of 143% (Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2018).
2 Over the past 3 years, between 1.5% and 2.5% of borrowers in repayment defaulted on their federal student loans each

quarter (U.S. Department of Education, 2018a). As of the first quarter of 2018, 14% of outstanding federal debt held by
borrowers in repayment was classified as delinquent (U.S. Department of Education, 2018b).
3 Appendix A includes detailed descriptions of current U.S. student loan repayment options.
4 A handful of studies provide evidence that student loan debt affects borrowers’ choice of career. Field (2009) and

Rothstein and Rouse (2011) focus on law school students and undergraduates enrolled in highly selective institutions,
respectively. Weidner (2016) and Gervais and Ziebarth (2017) show that borrowers in older cohorts – who lacked access
to IDR – were more likely to accept a low paying job that was less related to their degree than non-borrowers. Krishnan and


                                                                                                                         1
         Our paper addresses this gap by investigating theoretically and experimentally how student
loan repayment options affect borrowers’ choices. 5 Specifically, we compare borrowers’ career
choices in three settings — one in which both IDR and the standard fixed repayment (FR) plan are
available to all borrowers, one in which some borrowers can choose between IDR and FR while
others must participate in IDR, and one in which all borrowers must participate in IDR and do not
have knowledge of other options. These three repayment regimes are policy relevant. Many countries
have transitioned to universal IDR systems in the past three decades and legislation that would place
all new borrowers into IDR has been proposed in the United States. 6
         In the absence of behavioral biases, eliminating the standard repayment plan and requiring
all borrowers to participate in IDR should not affect the career choices of borrowers who would have
selected IDR when both types of plans were available. Because a borrower’s job and loan repayment
choices are decisions made under uncertainty, however, what appears to be the best choice ex ante
may not turn out to have been the best choice ex post. A borrower who reevaluates her decision after
this uncertainty has been resolved may come to regret her career and/or repayment plan choice.
Giving a regret-averse borrower only the IDR repayment option eliminates a potential source of
regret (over plan choice), making higher-paying but riskier jobs more attractive. When protection
from regret over repayment plan choice is most salient – that is, when borrowers are told that the
standard plan is available to be chosen by others – regret-averse borrowers who are only allowed to
choose IDR should be even more likely to choose the higher-paying but riskier jobs.
         We first investigate theoretically a two-period environment in which risk-neutral borrowers
vary in their probability of success in a difficult (risky but high paying) career. A borrower decides
between FR and IDR, and between a difficult and easy (safe but low paying) career. Her earnings will
depend on job choice and ability; if the borrower is successful in her chosen career, she will be paid,
otherwise she will not receive any income. Borrowers who choose the FR plan must make a fixed
payment only in the first period (mirroring the shorter horizon of the standard repayment plan), but



Wang (forthcoming) show that the removal of student loans from bankruptcy protection reduced the likelihood of
successful entrepreneurship.
5 In theory, loan repayment options could influence prospective students’ educational investment decisions (Findeisen and

Sachs, 2016), but most borrowers are not well-informed about available options (U.S. Government Accountability Office,
2015). Boatman and Evans (2017) report that over 50% of community college students responding to a 2015 survey said
that they did not know about IDR and an even smaller share of high school seniors and adults without college degrees
reported knowledge of IDR. Furthermore, the establishment of universal IDR in Australia did not affect college enrollment
or degree receipt (Chapman and Nicholls, 2013).
6 Countries that have adopted universal IDR include Australia (1989), New Zealand (1992), South Africa (1994), the United

Kingdom (1998), Hungary (2003), South Korea (2012), and the Netherlands (2012) (Chapman 2006; Lochner and Monge-
Naranjo 2016). Students in these countries still may be able to finance college with private loans or family resources, but
they do not have access to government guaranteed loans outside of IDR. In the U.S. context, the 2013 ExCEL Act and the
2014 Dynamic Repayment Act would have limited new borrowers to IDR.


                                                                                                                         2
risk “default” if they do not have sufficient earnings. The easy job pays enough to fulfill the FR
repayment obligation, thus, only borrowers who choose the difficult career risk defaulting on their
loans. Borrowers who default are not allowed an opportunity to earn income in the second period.
In contrast, under IDR, the borrower must pay a percentage of her income in both periods but does
not risk default.
         While borrowers with sufficiently low ability always should choose the easy career and those
with sufficiently high ability always should choose the difficult career, the decisions of borrowers
with intermediate ability may be affected by the decision-making environment. For these borrowers,
there will be a cutoff in the probability of being successful at the difficult job such that borrowers
whose success probability exceeds this threshold should choose the difficult job and those whose
success probability is below the threshold should choose the easy job. The surplus-maximizing cutoff
for any period equates the expected returns to performing the difficult and the easy jobs. When FR is
the only available repayment plan, the risk of defaulting will lead some borrowers with a probability
of success above this threshold to choose the easy job. 7 In contrast, IDR eliminates the risk of default,
and thus encourages these marginal borrowers to choose the difficult job. In the absence of
behavioral biases, offering only IDR or offering both IDR and FR should lead to the same percentage
of students choosing the difficult job. In the presence of anticipated regret, however, fewer students
will pick the difficult job when both IDR and FR are offered than when only IDR is offered.
         There are two sources of regret in this environment: regret due to loan choice and regret due
to career choice. Consider a skilled student who is planning to choose a more remunerative but
riskier career path. If she chooses IDR and is successful enough that she would have ended up paying
less under the standard loan repayment plan, she will regret not having chosen FR. On the other hand,
if she chooses FR and is unsuccessful in the riskier career, she will regret not having chosen the safer
but lower-paying path along which she could have paid her debt in full and avoided the negative
consequences of a loan default. Anticipating the possibility of regret, a borrower may alter her
decisions to reduce the possibility of suffering from regret (Bell, 1982; Loomes and Sugden, 1982). 8
The role of regret has been studied in many economically relevant environments, such as auctions
(Filiz-Ozbay and Ozbay, 2007; Filiz-Ozbay and Ozbay, 2010; Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Katok, 2008),
rent seeking (Hyndman et al., 2012), consumer decision-making (Nasiry and Popescu, 2012) and




7We do not need to assume risk aversion for this result, as it is due purely to the risk of default.
8The importance of this phenomenon has been documented in the experimental literature (see, e.g., Zeelenberg, 1999 and
Zeelenberg and Pieters, 2004).


                                                                                                                    3
product innovation (Jiang, et al., 2016), but ours is the first paper to study the role of anticipated
regret in students’ choice of career and loan repayment decisions. 9
         In addition to examining the effects of regret on borrowers’ decisions, we also examine
whether making borrowers aware that a potential source of regret – their choice of loan repayment
plan – has been eliminated affects their decisions. Consider a setting in which students are aware that
some people have been offered the opportunity to choose between FR and IDR, but they are given
only the IDR option. 10 Borrowers who are offered only IDR may feel gratitude for not being forced to
choose between repayment options. Such borrowers may expect to benefit from IDR but also
anticipate that there is some probability they would regret their choice of repayment plan if they
were allowed to choose. In this environment, relief from the possibility of being exposed to a regret-
triggering situation generates gratitude. We show theoretically that the presence of gratitude should
increase the number of students attempting higher-paying but riskier jobs. To the best of our
knowledge, the existing literature contains neither a behavioral theory nor experimental evidence
on the effects of gratitude due to being protected from a negative emotion.
         In the light of our theoretical results, we carry out an experiment to examine career choice
among borrowers in the three settings we examine theoretically: (i) both IDR and FR are available to
all borrowers (as is the case currently in the United States), (ii) most borrowers must participate in
IDR but are aware that some borrowers have been allowed to choose between IDR and FR (as would
be the case during a transition to universal IDR), and (iii) IDR is the only loan repayment option (as
would be the case in the long run after a shift to universal IDR).. Our results are in line with the
prediction of the theoretical model that incorporates regret and gratitude: borrowers are most likely
to choose the difficult career in setting (ii) and least likely to choose the difficult career in setting (i).
         The remainder of the paper proceeds follows: Section 2 introduces a model of career and loan
repayment choice for regretful and grateful borrowers. Section 3 discusses the predictions of the
theoretical model for the parameter values used in the experiment we have carried out. The
experimental procedures are explained in Section 4. Section 5 presents experimental results and
Section 6 concludes.




9 A growing body of research examining students’ borrowing and repayment decisions suggests that such decisions are

influenced by factors such as debt aversion, framing, and self-control issues (e.g., Field, 2009; Cadena and Keys, 2013; Marx
and Turner, 2017; Abraham et al., 2018).
10 This environment corresponds to a transition from the current environment in which students may choose between IDR

and FR to an environment in which only IDR is offered. Students who had only the IDR option following the transition would
be aware that such a choice had been available in the recent past.


                                                                                                                           4
    2. Theory
         We begin our theoretical investigation of student borrowers’ career and loan repayment
choices with a simple model containing no behavioral features in which borrowers choose the
careers with the highest expected payout given their loan repayment plan. We then introduce into
the model the ideas of regret over making a choice that turns out to be suboptimal ex post and
gratitude for being spared the necessity to make a choice that might lead to regret. The roles that
envy and risk aversion might play in our setting are then briefly considered.


A Simple Model of Student Borrowers’ Career Choices
         Assume that there is a risk-neutral agent who has previously taken out a loan; this can be
thought of as an education loan. The agent must now choose a task to be performed in the current
and following period to earn income that will be used to repay the loan and for consumption. In this
environment, the choice of task can be thought of as the choice of a career and we use the two terms
interchangeably. 11 There are two types of tasks (careers) available to the agent – an Easy task
(denoted by E) and a Difficult task (denoted by D). There is no risk associated with choosing the Easy
task; the agent completes this task successfully every time she attempts it. Choosing the Difficult task
entails more risk, as the agent’s performance in that task is uncertain, with a success rate denoted by
𝑝𝑝 ∈ [0,1]. The probability of success is known to the agent. Successfully performing the Easy task
during a period pays 𝐿𝐿; successfully performing the Difficult task pays 𝐻𝐻, where 𝐻𝐻 > 𝐿𝐿 > 0. Assume
that performance of the tasks is costless to the agent. From the perspective of an omniscient social
planner who wishes to maximize total surplus and would like to see agents allocated to tasks
accordingly, in any period, an agent with a success rate of 𝑝𝑝 such that 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 > 𝐿𝐿 should choose the
Difficult task, and an agent with a success rate of 𝑝𝑝 such that 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 < 𝐿𝐿 should choose the Easy task. In
other words, there exists a unique cut-off:


                                                                  𝐿𝐿
                                                          𝑝𝑝∗ =
                                                                  𝐻𝐻


such that the surplus maximizing choice of any agent with 𝑝𝑝 > 𝑝𝑝∗ is the Difficult task. 12



11 We study a two-period model, as two periods represents the minimum horizon over which the fixed repayment plan can

have a shorter repayment period than income-driven repayment.
12 The total surplus depends only on the task return, as the loan repayment is just a transfer from the borrower to the lender.

For notational simplicity, we set the discount rate equal to 1. Having two periods does not change the surplus maximizing
                                    𝐿𝐿                                                                              𝐿𝐿
cutoff for the success rate: (𝑝𝑝∗ = 𝐻𝐻) since 𝑝𝑝2 (2𝐻𝐻) + 2𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)𝐻𝐻 ≥ 2𝐿𝐿 also implies the same threshold 𝑝𝑝∗ = 𝐻𝐻.



                                                                                                                             5
           The requirement that agents repay their loan and the menu of available repayment options
may shift agents’ career choices away from those that would be surplus maximizing. We consider two
repayment plans. 13 The first is the standard mortgage-style Fixed Repayment (FR) plan, which
requires the agent to make a fixed payment of 𝑘𝑘 > 0 in the first period. If she does not earn enough
to make this payment, she is considered to have defaulted on the loan and is denied the opportunity
to earn money in the second period. This feature of the model is an admittedly simplified means of
incorporating the idea that defaulting on a loan imposes large financial costs on borrowers. If the
agent successfully makes the required payment in the first period, she has fully paid off her loan and
keeps all of her second period earnings for consumption. For someone who is repaying a loan under
the FR plan, choosing the Easy task (career) is the safe option, since 𝐿𝐿 > 𝑘𝑘 and the borrower is certain
to earn enough to make the required loan payment. The two-period payoff for choosing the Easy task
under the FR plan is:


                                                 𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸,𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = (𝐿𝐿 − 𝑘𝑘) + 𝐿𝐿
                                                       = 2𝐿𝐿 − 𝑘𝑘


           On the other hand, the agent who repays her loan under the FR plan and attempts the Difficult
task (career) is taking a risk. If the agent fails to perform the Difficult task successfully in the first
period, she earns nothing in the first period, defaults on her loan, and loses the opportunity to earn
in the second period. The expected two-period payoff for choosing the Difficult task under the FR
plan is:


                                   𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷,𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝑝𝑝2 (2𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘) + 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)(𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘)
                                                  = 𝑝𝑝2 𝐻𝐻 + 𝑝𝑝(𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘)


where the first term is the payoff received in the event that the agent succeeds in both periods (which
has probability 𝑝𝑝2 ) and the second term is the payoff received in the event that the agent succeeds in
period one and fails in period two (which has probability 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)).
           A risk neutral agent without any behavioral biases will choose the Difficult task when its
expected payoff is higher than the payoff of the Easy task.


13Note that we are assuming throughout that the agent does not save for the future and cannot borrow against future
expected earnings. This is consistent with evidence that recent college graduates face liquidity constraints (Rothstein and
Rouse, 2011).



                                                                                                                         6
Proposition 1: In the absence of behavioral biases, for risk neutral agents repaying a loan under the
FR plan, there exists a unique 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 , such that every agent with a success rate of 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 attempts the
Difficult task and 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 > 𝑝𝑝∗ .


         Proposition 1 holds because, under FR, the risk of defaulting scares some agents away from
attempting the Difficult task, so that fewer than the surplus maximizing number of people choose it.
Intuitively, a borrower who defaults on her loan loses the opportunity to earn in the second period,
meaning that the risk of default lowers her expected two-period payoff relative to that from choosing
the Easy task. This is partially offset by the risk of default also reducing the amount she expects to
repay on her loan. On net, however, the risk of default reduces the payoff expected from choosing
the Difficult task relative to that from choosing the Easy task and leads borrowers to require 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 >
𝑝𝑝∗ in order to attempt the Difficult task. 14
         The second repayment plan we consider - Income Driven Repayment (IDR) - removes the risk
of default. IDR requires the agent to pay back a set percentage (denoted by 𝑖𝑖) of her earnings in each
of the two periods in the model. 15 If the agent fails at her chosen task in the first period (and thus has
no earnings), she is not required to make a loan payment and is allowed to work in the second period.
         Our description of IDR abstracts from many of the complexities in U.S. borrowers’ current
choices (e.g., time and information gathering costs associated with plan choice) to highlight the
particular features of students’ decisions that are most relevant for the question of how borrowers
would respond to having more versus less choice over repayment options. Appendix A includes
detailed descriptions of the repayment options currently available to U.S. student borrowers. The
IDR features of particular interest are that: (i) IDR commonly requires a longer repayment period
than FR, (ii) IDR removes the risk of loan default due to low earnings, and (iii) IDR may reduce the
return to higher-paying jobs by linking payments to earnings. 16 Both the model and the experiment
are structured to reflect these features.
         The expected two-period payoff for choosing the Difficult task under IDR is:



14 The proof of Proposition 1 as well as the proofs of the paper’s remaining propositions are provided in Appendix B.
15 Since the IDR plan is offered to remove the possibility of default and there is no risk of defaulting when an agent chooses
the Easy task, we set i such that a borrower choosing the Easy task will be indifferent between the FR and IDR plans. This
assumption is not required for our analysis, but making it allows us to focus on the task choice of moderate ability
borrowers in an environment that offers varied repayment options.
16 Some existing IDR options cap payment amounts in each period at the amount the borrower would have paid under FR.

We abstract from this feature to highlight the effects of a longer repayment period (and potentially higher payments) and
the elimination of default risk in borrowers’ labor supply decisions.


                                                                                                                            7

where the first term is the payoff received in the event that the agent succeeds in both periods (which
has probability 𝑝𝑝2 ) and the second term is the payoff received in the event that the agent succeeds
in either period one or period two but not both (which has probability 2𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)). Note that if she
fails in both periods, the agent earns zero and pays back zero. The payoff for the Easy task under IDR
is:


                                              𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖) + 𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖)
                                                       = 2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖)


Proposition 2: In the absence of behavioral biases, for risk neutral agents repaying a loan under IDR,
there exists a unique 𝑝𝑝𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 , such that every agent with a success rate of 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 𝑝𝑝𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 attempts the Difficult
task and 𝑝𝑝𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑝𝑝∗ .


          Proposition 2 holds because, under IDR, the expected two-period payoff to the Difficult task
will equal the payoff to the Easy task at the same probability that the omniscient social planner would
use as the surplus-maximizing threshold for assigning borrowers to the Difficult task (i.e. 𝑝𝑝𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑝𝑝∗ .)
In other words, under IDR, risk neutral borrowers will make the same decision about which task to
perform that a social planner would have chosen for them.
          Furthermore, Proposition 2 does not depend on the percentage of earnings 𝑖𝑖 that the
borrower must pay on her loan. In other words, for any value of i, IDR leads agents to make the
surplus maximizing choices. A lender seeking to maximize revenue would like to set a high value of i.
For lower-ability borrowers who choose the Easy task however, the insurance provided by IDR has
no value and it would penalize such borrowers to set i so high that they paid more under IDR than
they would have paid under FR. The highest that i can be set without making agents who choose the
Easy task worse off under IDR than under FR is to set it at the level that makes such agents indifferent
                                                         𝑘𝑘
between the IDR and the FR plans, i.e. to set 𝑖𝑖 =             . Thus, in the rest of what follows, we assume that
                                                         2𝐿𝐿

i takes this value, which allows us to focus on the behavior of those for whom the insurance provided
by IDR has value and could affect their choice of task.




                                                                                                                8
Adding Regret and Gratitude to the Model
         Thus far, this analysis has assumed that an agent evaluates a loan repayment plan and task
independent of the set of loan repayment plans available to her. In reality, an agent who commits to
a certain loan repayment and task choice may compare her outcome either with the outcomes that
her alternative options would have delivered or with the outcomes that other decision makers
receive in a given state of the world. In the event of a discrepancy between her ex-post payoff and the
best payoff associated with a forgone alternative in the realized state, an agent may suffer from the
negative emotion of regret. 17 If the agent is given more options from which to choose, there is more
opportunity for her to feel regret over her decisions.
         In the environment we have described, there are two potential sources of regret: regret over
choice of repayment plan and regret over choice of task. We hypothesize that, even holding the
characteristics of an agent’s chosen plan constant, having more plans in the market may reduce the
agent’s expected utility by increasing the likelihood she will regret her choice of plan. Simplifying the
agent’s decision problem by eliminating some choices could actually raise utility by shutting down
potential sources of regret. Hence, in the presence of behavioral biases, the context within which IDR
is offered may affect agents’ decisions about performing the Difficult task.
         There are three ways that IDR could be made available to borrowers:


Choice (C): Both the FR and the IDR plan are available and borrowers are free to choose between the
two options.


No Choice (NC): Borrowers are offered only the IDR plan.


No Choice with a Reference Group (NCR): Both the FR and the IDR plans are present but the agents
of interest are assigned to the IDR plan. The remaining agents are offered a choice between the FR
and IDR plans. Members of both groups are aware of the choices given to members of the other group.


         Following the theory of regret, an agent may experience regret if she learns that the outcome
associated with a foregone alternative is better than the outcome associated with the chosen
alternative. Moreover, the bigger the foregone payoff, the more regret an agent may feel. Formally,


17 A related possibility is that borrowers rejoice when they realize ex post that they made the right choice. Theoretically, the

effects of anticipated rejoicing due to having made the right choice will be the opposite of the effects of anticipated regret
due to having made the wrong choice (see, e.g., Loomes and Sugden, 1982). Our analysis thus can be viewed as capturing
the net effect of the negative emotion of regret and the positive emotion of rejoicing.


                                                                                                                              9
the regret function, 𝑅𝑅(. ): ℝ → ℝ+ , which depends on the payoff difference between the best foregone
alternative and the chosen alternative, is assumed to be non-decreasing with 𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥) = 0 for any 𝑥𝑥 ≤
0.
            When an agent attempts the Easy task, she does not know for sure what would have happened
had she chosen the Difficult task unless her probability of success in the Difficult task is 1. 18 Hence,
she should not feel regret about not having chosen the Difficult task. If she attempts the Difficult task,
however, she is able to compare the realized outcome with all of her possible foregone options.
            Under NC, when she is forced into IDR, the agent who chooses the Difficult task may regret
her choice of task, but she cannot regret her choice of repayment plan, as she is aware of only one
plan. Regarding her choice of task, if the agent fails in the Difficult task, she may regret not having
chosen the Easy task and getting a payoff of 2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖). If she fails in the Difficult task in both periods,
she receives no payoff and the intensity of her regret for not having chosen the Easy task will be
proportional to 2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖). If she fails in the Difficult task in one of the periods, she receives a payoff
of 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖) and will experience regret if 𝐻𝐻 < 2𝐿𝐿. In this case, the intensity of her regret will be
proportional to 2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖) − 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖). In order to minimize the number of potential sources of
regret, we assume 𝐻𝐻 > 2𝐿𝐿. Thus, under NC, which offers only IDR, the utility of attempting the
Difficult task becomes:


                                      𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑝𝑝)
                                    𝑈𝑈𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 (𝑝𝑝) − (1 − 𝑝𝑝)2 𝑅𝑅�2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖)�


            Under C, there are two potential sources of regret: regret about task choice and regret about
plan choice. An agent who chooses the Difficult task and ends up with high earnings will make larger
loan payments (and take home less income) under IDR than under FR. Therefore, when the agent
chooses IDR, in addition to the potential regret associated with the choice of task anticipated in NC,
there is also the potential for regret due to not having chosen the FR plan. If the agent performs the
Difficult task successfully in both periods, she receives a payoff of 2𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖) under IDR but the same
task performance would have yielded a payoff of 2𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 under FR. In this case, the intensity of her
regret will be proportional to 2𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 2𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖). If she performs the Difficult task successfully only
in the first period, she receives a payoff of 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖) under IDR, but she would have received a payoff
of 𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 under FR. Further, had she chosen the Easy task, she would have received a payoff of
2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖). The intensity of her regret in this case (performing the Difficult task under IDR and



18   In our subject pool, only 1 out of 274 subjects was 100% successful in the Difficult task.



                                                                                                          10
succeeding only in the first period) will be proportional to max{𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘, 2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖)} − 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖) . Given
our assumptions that H > 2L and that k = 2Li so that the payoff to the easy task is the same under FR
and IDR, 𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 > 2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖), and the regret term for this case reduces to 𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖). Thus,
under C, the utility of attempting the Difficult task under IDR becomes:


             𝐶𝐶        (𝑝𝑝) = 𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 (𝑝𝑝) − (1 − 𝑝𝑝)2 𝑅𝑅�2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖)� − 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)𝑅𝑅�H − k − 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖)�
           𝑈𝑈𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
                              − 𝑝𝑝2 𝑅𝑅�2𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 2𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖)�


        Giving the agent the option to choose her loan repayment plan may decrease her utility. If the
agent selects IDR, the presence of the FR plan will invoke regret in states where the payoff under FR
would have been larger than the realized payoff under IDR. An agent who anticipates this regret may
prefer not having to choose a loan repayment plan and be grateful if she realizes that someone else
has made this choice for her. The extent of her gratitude for not having to choose a loan repayment
plan will depend on the intensity of any anticipated regret that would have been associated with
having to make that choice. Formally, the gratitude function, 𝐺𝐺(. ): ℝ+ → ℝ+ is assumed to be non-
decreasing with 𝐺𝐺(0) = 0.
        Under NCR, the agent’s regret is based only on choice of task, and thus is identical to that
under NC. In this environment, however, an agent who chooses the Difficult task and performs it
successfully may be grateful that she did not have the FR option. Under C, had she chosen IDR when
the FR plan was available and then succeeded in the Difficult task, she might have regretted her choice
of plan. Any regret anticipated in C from choosing IDR increases the agent’s utility under NCR. As
already mentioned, under C, if the agent chooses IDR and performs the Difficult task successfully in
both periods, her anticipated regret is 𝑅𝑅 (2𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 2𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖)). The intensity of her gratitude under
NCR will be proportional to this anticipated regret. If she succeeds only in the first period, she also
may experience regret under C due to not choosing the FR plan. Under the assumptions we are
making, the intensity of her gratitude under NCR for succeeding only in the first period will be
proportional to 𝑅𝑅�𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖)�. Hence, under NCR, the utility of attempting the Difficult task
under IDR becomes:


          𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑝𝑝)
        𝑈𝑈𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼   = 𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 (𝑝𝑝) − (1 − 𝑝𝑝)2 𝑅𝑅�2𝐿𝐿(1 − 𝑖𝑖)� + 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)G �R�𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖)��

                                         +𝑝𝑝2 G(R(2𝐻𝐻 − 𝑘𝑘 − 2𝐻𝐻(1 − 𝑖𝑖))




                                                                                                                11
.
        Based on these utilities, we can compare the proportions of agents who choose the Difficult
task under C, NC, and NCR.


Proposition 3: The threshold probability of success in the Difficult task that makes a risk neutral agent
indifferent between the Difficult task and the Easy task for C, NC, and NCR can be characterized as
follows: For any 𝑥𝑥 > 0,
                       𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑝𝑝∗   if 𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥) = 0
                       𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 > 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 > 𝑝𝑝∗   if 𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥) > 0 but 𝐺𝐺�𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥)� = 0
                       𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 > 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 > 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁         if 𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥) > 0 and 𝐺𝐺�𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥)� > 0


        Proposition 3 states that if agents do not anticipate regret, then under all three conditions (C,
NC and NCR), they will make surplus maximizing task choices. If the agents anticipate regret but do
not anticipate gratitude, all three conditions will lead fewer than the surplus maximizing number of
people to choose the Difficult task. Since the FR plan is an option only in C, there is more potential for
regret and hence fewer people will attempt the Difficult task under C than under NC or NCR. Finally,
if agents are grateful when they know that they have been precluded from choosing an option that
could have produced regret, the largest number of people will attempt the Difficult task under NCR.


Alternative Models
        Note that our model offers regret and gratitude as two potential behavioral motives in
evaluating risk. Our experiment is designed to test the implications of those potential motives for
borrowers’ behavior.
        Envy is another negative emotion that could affect agents’ choices. An agent may be envious
if she receives a lower payoff than the payoff to her reference group (see e.g. Fehr and Schmidt, 1999
and Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000). Such an envious agent may be willing to pay in order to reduce the
payoff to others (see Zizzo and Oswald, 2001). Furthermore, anticipation of envy may lead to
suboptimal behavior (see Mui, 1995). In our setup, under NCR, agents are forced into IDR but know
that other agents were given the FR option. In this environment, an agent who chooses the Difficult
task and performs it successfully will realize that an agent who completed the same task under FR
would have received a higher payoff. This could lead the agent to envy those who were given the FR




                                                                                                       12
option. 19 In contrast, under NC, agents know that anyone who succeeds in the Difficult task receives the
same payoff and hence there is no scope for envy. Likewise, under C, all agents are given the same choices,
meaning that no one should be envious of anyone else. Thus, an agent who is prone to envying the
opportunities made available to others will be less likely to choose the Difficult task under NCR than under
either NC or C. Furthermore, since there should be no envy under either NC or C, a model with envy will
predict no difference in the choices under those two scenarios. Hence, the behavioral motive of envy would
lead to the prediction that 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 > 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑝𝑝∗ .
     Risk aversion is an additional factor that could affect agents’ decisions, specifically the choice
between the Easy and the Difficult task. Because performance in the Difficult task is uncertain, the
Difficult task will be less desirable for agents who are more risk-averse. In the absence of behavioral
biases, however, risk aversion on its own does not lead to a prediction that the way in which the IDR
plan is introduced will affect the choices made by agents under IDR. Hence, for risk-averse agents,
absent behavioral biases, we would predict 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 > 𝑝𝑝∗ .


     3. Experimental Setup and Predictions
          The model presented in the previous section motivates the experiment we designed to assess
its predictions. In the experiment, we set the payment L (for performing the Easy task) to $4 and the
payment H (for successfully performing the Difficult task) to $10. The fixed loan repayment amount
𝑘𝑘 under the FR plan is set at $3.20 and the pay back percentage 𝑖𝑖 under IDR is set at 40% of earnings,
which implies a payment of $1.60 per period for an agent performing the Easy task and $4.00 per
period for an agent successfully performing the Difficult task. An important aspect of these
parameters is that the agent who chooses the Easy task is indifferent between FR and IDR. We
simplify the loan choice problem for borrowers who should always choose the Easy task because our
interest lies with how the availability of loan repayment plan options affects borrowers on the margin
of choosing between the Difficult and Easy tasks. Note that while the total loan payment under the
IDR plan for agents performing the Easy task is $3.20, the total loan payment under the Difficult task
can be $0, $4, or $8 depending on the outcome realizations in each period.
          Up to four different combinations of task and loan repayment plan choices are relevant to an
agent. Plugging the parameter values specified for the experiment into the model from Section 2, the
two-period payoff for task X and loan plan Y generates the following expected return 𝜋𝜋𝑋𝑋,𝑌𝑌 , for 𝑋𝑋 ∈
{𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷}, 𝑌𝑌 ∈ {𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹, 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 }, and a success rate of 𝑝𝑝 in the Difficult task:


19 Note that, because we picked the parameters to make the expected return to the Easy task the same under IDR and FR,

an agent who chooses the Easy task will have no reason to be envious.


                                                                                                                   13
𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸,𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = (4 − 3.2) + 4 = 4.8


𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷,𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝑝𝑝2 (20 − 3.2) + 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)(10 − 3.2) = 𝑝𝑝2 (16.8) + 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)(6.8)


𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 4(1 − 0.4) + 4(1 − 0.4) = 4.8


𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝑝𝑝2 [20(1 − 0.4)] + 2𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)[10(1 − 0.4)] = 12𝑝𝑝


        Figure 1 displays the expected payoffs under FR and IDR as a function of the probability of
success in the Difficult task. By design, the expected payoff for an agent who chooses the Easy task is
the same under FR and IDR. There are two critical levels for 𝑝𝑝 in Figure 1: 𝑝𝑝∗ = 0.40 and 𝑝𝑝∗∗ = 0.52.
Any agent whose probability of success in the Difficult task is lower than 0.40 earns a higher expected
payoff by choosing the Easy task, which pays less but can be performed successfully with certainty.
Any agent whose probability of success in the Difficult task is between 0.40 and 0.52 earns the highest
expected payoff by choosing the Difficult task and IDR. For these agents, the insurance provided by
IDR is more valuable than the possibility of making smaller loan payments under FR. Finally, agents
whose probability of success in the Difficult task is greater than 0.52 will earn the highest expected
payoff by choosing the Difficult task and FR. For these agents, the insurance provided by IDR is not
as valuable as making lower loan repayments under FR.

Figure 1. Expected payoff of each task under each loan repayment plan


         As noted in Section 2, the above analysis assumes that an agent evaluates a loan repayment
plan and task independent of the set of loan repayment plans available to her. Allowing for the
possibility of ex post regret about her choices and gratitude for not having to make a choice that could
turn out badly will alter an agent’s evaluation of the Difficult task under IDR. To illustrate the
predictions of Proposition 3, we assume linear regret and gratitude functions, 𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥) = 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 with 𝛼𝛼 ≥ 0
and 𝐺𝐺(𝑥𝑥) = 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾 with 𝛾𝛾 ≥ 0 , respectively, and write the expected utility of such a behaviorally
motivated agent for the values used in the experiment:


𝑈𝑈𝐷𝐷,𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 (𝑝𝑝) = [12𝑝𝑝] − 𝛼𝛼 [(1 − 𝑝𝑝)2 (4.8 − 0)] − 𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶 𝛼𝛼[𝑝𝑝2 (16.8 − 12) + 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)(6.8 − 6)]
            +𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾[𝑝𝑝2 (16.8 − 12) + 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑝𝑝)(6.8 − 6)]


In the above formula we introduce the indicator functions 𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶 , which takes the value 1 for those
assigned to Treatment C and zero otherwise, and 𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 , which takes the value 1 for those assigned to
Treatment NCR and zero otherwise.




                                                                                                                15
          Figure 2 shows the expected utility associated with the Easy task and the Difficult task as a
function of p under the IDR plan for each treatment when agents can regret their choices. 20 The
availability of both repayment plans in Treatment C shifts the utility of the Difficult task under IDR
downwards relative to the utility that could be gained if only IDR was available, as in Treatment NC.
In contrast, restricting some subjects to IDR while making them aware that there are subjects who
were required to choose between FR and IDR (as in Treatment NCR) shifts the utility of choosing the
Difficult task under IDR upwards with respect to Treatment NC.
          These shifts lead to changes in the threshold probabilities of success in the Difficult task such
that 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 > 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 > 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 as stated by Proposition 3. A higher threshold probability results in a smaller
share of agents choosing the Difficult task. This theoretical prediction allows us to state the following
hypothesis that can be tested by our experimental design.


Hypothesis: Treatment NCR will generate the largest share of subjects and Treatment C the smallest
share of subjects choosing the Difficult task.

     4. Experimental Procedures
         Nineteen sessions were conducted in the Experimental Economics Laboratory at the
University of Maryland. One of the three treatments was administered during each of these sessions
– Treatment C (Choice) (7 sessions), Treatment NC (No Choice) (6 sessions), and Treatment NCR (No
Choice with a Reference Group) (6 sessions). There were a total of 91, 90 and 91 subjects who
participated in Treatments C, NC, and NCR, respectively. 21 No subject participated in more than one
treatment. Instructions were provided in the form of printed handouts and also were read aloud to
subjects to ensure that everyone received the same information                        22   The experiments were
programmed and conducted with the software z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007). Each session lasted
approximately one hour and subjects earned $14.50 on average.
         The characteristics of our experimental subject pool align closely with those of the University
of Maryland undergraduate student body in terms of gender, age, SAT results, debt holding, and
financial literacy (see Appendix D for the details of the comparisons). Our experimental sessions were
divided into three parts. Subjects received the instructions for each part of the session at its
beginning, so that those engaged in the earlier parts of the experiment did not know what would
come later. In Part 1, which was the same for all three treatments, each subject performed 30 Easy
tasks and 30 Difficult tasks. 23 Each Easy task involved typing a five-letter word that was shown on
the subject’s screen. Subjects had 20 seconds to type each word and they were paid $0.10 per
correctly typed word. Each Difficult task required subjects to answer a cognitive question from a
sample SAT test. Subjects had one minute to answer each question and they were paid $0.10 for each
question they answered correctly. At this point, subjects did not know exactly how their performance
on these tasks would affect their later earnings, but they were told that performing better would have
a positive and significant impact on their earnings in the next part of the experiment. At the end of
Part 1, subjects’ computer screens showed them how many of the 30 questions of each type they had
answered correctly. Figure 3 displays the distribution of the share of Difficult task questions subjects
answered correctly. Recall that, in any given period, when p≥ 0.40, choosing the Difficult task
generates the highest expected earnings. Figure 3 shows that more than 80% of participants were
able to answer at least 40% of the Difficult task questions correctly.



21 A total of 92 subjects were recruited for Treatment C, but one subject left in the middle of a session. We drop this
participant from the data.
22 The instructions for the experiment are provided in Appendix C.
23 The instructions given to subjects referred to these as Type A tasks and Type B tasks rather than as Easy tasks and

Difficult tasks.


                                                                                                                    17
       The subjects next received the instructions for Part 2 of the experiment. These instructions
varied according to the treatment for the subject’s session. Subjects learned that they had to take out
a $2 loan to participate in Part 2 of the experiment, that they would have the opportunity to earn
income over two periods, and that this income would be used to repay their loan. They were told how
their earnings would be determined in each period depending on whether they chose to perform the
Easy task or the Difficult task and also how their loan repayment amount would be determined
depending on their loan repayment plan (either chosen by the subject or assigned to them, depending
on the treatment). The subjects then were asked to choose the type of task that would determine
their earnings and, in the case of Treatment C (and for one subject in each of the Treatment NCR
sessions), to choose their loan repayment plan.




Figure 3: Distribution of success rate in Difficult task in experimental sample


       The subjects did not perform their chosen type of task again in Part 2. Instead, they were
told that, for each earnings period, the computer would randomly choose one of the questions that
they had already answered in Part 1 according to their choice of task, and that their performance
on the randomly selected question would determine their earnings in the period. For example,
suppose that a subject chose to base her earnings on her performance in the Difficult task. In the


                                                                                                    18
first earnings period, the computer would select one Difficult question out of the 30 the subject
had answered in Part 1 as the basis for determining her earnings. If the subject had answered that
question correctly, she would earn $10 and make her loan payment from those earnings. Assuming
the borrower avoided default in the first period, the same procedure would be followed in the
second period to determine her earnings. At the point the subject was asked to choose the type of
task on which her earnings would be based, her screen displayed her Part 1 performance on the
two types of tasks, so that she knew the probability of success in each type of task before making
her choice. We did not ask subjects to perform their chosen type of task again in Part 2 because
we wanted them to be certain about their chances of success. This allowed us to rule out the
influence of over- and under-confidence biases regarding their own skill level on subjects’
decisions.
        Our treatments are distinguished by the loan repayment options available in the session. The
instructions for Part 2 provided the details of the repayment plans available in each subject’s session.
In Treatment C, both the FR and the IDR option were described. In Treatment NC, only the IDR option
was described. In Treatment NCR, both the FR and the IDR options were explained to all subjects.
Subjects also were told that some participants would be allowed to pick either the FR or the IDR plan,
while the remainder of the subjects would not be allowed to choose and would be assigned to the
IDR plan. At the time the instructions regarding the plans were given, a subject did not know if she
would be a choosing subject or a non-choosing subject. Since our interest in Treatment NCR lies with
the behavior of non-choosing subjects in the presence of choosing subjects, we assigned only one
choosing subject in each session; all other participants in each Treatment NCR session were non-
choosing subjects and our analysis makes use only of the data for the non-choosers. Once the
instructions for Part 2 had been provided, each Treatment NCR subject’s screen displayed whether
they were allowed to choose their repayment plan. Choosing subjects then decided on their loan
repayment plan and all subjects decided on their task type.
        A subject’s choice of task type applied to both periods. To ensure that subjects understood
the decision about task and plan, subjects were given a quiz that presented them with scenarios and
asked them to calculate the earnings, loan payments and net payoffs associated with those scenarios.
A subject could not proceed until they had answered the quiz questions correctly. After the subjects
made their task choices and (when allowed) plan choices, the computer reported the subjects’
performance on the randomly selected task for period 1, the randomly selected task for period 2,
their earnings in each period, and loan repayments according to their loan repayment plan. This
concluded Part 2 of the experiment.


                                                                                                     19
        In Part 3, we elicited subjects’ risk preference using a method devised by Holt and Laury
(2002). Appendix C includes a screen shot of the ten binary choice problems that we used for
implementing the Holt and Laury method. In each problem, subjects chose between an Option A and
an Option B, with the problems designed so that Option B gradually involves less risk than Option A
as one moves from the first to the tenth problem. More risk-averse decision makers should switch to
Option B at a later problem in the sequence. This was the last incentivized activity of the experiment.
After that, the subjects completed a short questionnaire that included questions about gender, age,
debt holding, the subject’s self-assessed willingness to take risk (measured on a scale from 0 for the
most unwilling to 10 for the most willing), and SAT and/or ACT scores, together with two questions
designed to assess subjects’ financial literacy. This questionnaire is available at the end of Appendix
C.


     5. Experimental Results
        We begin by reporting the performance of subjects assigned to different treatments on the
tasks carried out in Part 1 of the experiment. Table 1 reports the average success rate of subjects in
each treatment on the 30 Easy tasks and the 30 Difficult tasks they performed. The success rates in
the Difficult task were substantially lower than those in the Easy task and very similar across the
three treatments.
        As intended, the success rates on the Easy task were very high in all three Treatments. In
each treatment, however, a handful of participants did not succeed at the Easy task 100% of the time.
Specifically, 2 out of 91 subjects in Treatment C, 3 out of 90 subjects in Treatment NC, and 3 out of 91
subjects in Treatment NCR made at least one error when completing the Easy task. In our regret
model, the agent is required to know what would have happened had the alternative option been
selected, as this is what determines the disutility from regret. This means that, strictly speaking, the
model applies only for subjects who know for sure the outcome they would have realized had they
chosen the Easy task. Thus, we exclude these 8 subjects from all analyses. We also exclude
participants who were given a choice over repayment plans in Treatment NCR (N = 6) as we are
interested only in the behavior of the non-choosing subjects in this treatment. As shown at the bottom
of Table 1, these restrictions do not substantially alter the success rate on the difficult task across
treatment groups or for the sample as a whole.

      Standard deviations are in parentheses. The restricted sample excludes the 8 subjects with less than 100%
      success on the Easy task and the 6 choosing subjects in Treatment NCR.




        Figure 4 shows the cumulative distributions of the Difficult task success probability in each
of the three treatments. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests do not reject the hypothesis that the distributions
are the same (p-values from all pairwise comparisons are greater than 0.5). We likewise fail to reject
the hypothesis that the distribution of the probability of success in the Difficult task is equal in the
restricted sample for all pairwise comparisons across treatments. Hence, we deem our assumption
that the subject pools participating in the different treatments did not differ from each other in terms
of their ability to perform the Difficult task to be reasonable.

Switching from Easy to Difficult Task:
        We hypothesize that, in the presence of regret and gratitude, the share of subjects choosing
the Difficult task should be largest in Treatment NCR and smallest in Treatment C. The actual
percentages of subjects choosing the Difficult task were 81.6%, 68.2%, and 61.4% in Treatments NCR,
NC, and C, respectively (with p < 0.05 for all pairwise comparisons), a pattern consistent with our
hypothesis.
        Our prediction about the share of subjects choosing the Difficult task being different across
treatments is driven by our behavioral model, which predicts shifts in the expected utility of choosing
the Difficult task across the treatments. These shifts are caused by anticipation of regret about
foregone choices and, in the case of Treatment NCR, gratitude for not having to make choices that
could lead to regret. For each treatment, Proposition 3 states that there is a cutoff success rate for the
difficult task such that a subject should pick the Difficult task if and only if her 𝑝𝑝 is above that cutoff.
Our behavioral model predicts that the threshold probability of success at which a subject would
switch from the Easy task to the Difficult task will be lowest under Treatment NCR and highest under
Treatment C. While in all treatments, subjects with a very high probability of success should pick the
Difficult task and subjects with a very low probability of success should pick the Easy task, we expect
to see differences in behavior across treatments among participants of moderate ability. This is
because these agents face the potential for regret over both task and repayment plan choice and the
latter source of potential regret will affect the choice of task difficulty.
        Table 2 reports the percentage of subjects choosing the Difficult task among subjects with
low-range, mid-range and high-range skills in this type of task. We consider participants to have mid-



                                                                                                           22
range skills if their probability of success in the Difficult task falls between 0.25 and 0.75. 24 Subjects
with low and high skill levels chose their task rationally; in all of the treatments, all of the subjects
with a probability of success on the Difficult task below 25% chose the Easy task and all of the
subjects with a probability of success above 75% chose the Difficult task. As predicted, differences in
choosing the Difficult task across treatments arise from differences in the choices of the subjects with
mid-range skills. Among these students, we observe the highest percentage (81.7%) choosing the
Difficult task under Treatment NCR and the lowest percentage (50.7%) under Treatment C.

         Next, we estimate thresholds for choosing the Difficult task in each treatment. Note that
perfect step functions exist only for perfectly rational and homogeneous subjects; hence in reality,
there will not be a clear threshold dividing those who choose the Difficult versus the Easy task. We
therefore look instead for the threshold probability of performing the Difficult task successfully such
that more than half of agents with any probability above the threshold choose the Difficult task. We
first estimate these thresholds via logistic regressions in which we relate choice of the Difficult task
to the probability of performing the Difficult task correctly (see Table 3). Formally, the logistic
function is exp(a + bx) / (1 + exp(a + bx)), and thus, it takes the value of 1/2 when a + bx = 0. In our

in identifying the threshold value of x such that subjects have a 50% probability of taking either action
(see e.g. Cabral et al 2014). This threshold x* can be found by setting x* = -a/b, where a is the constant
term and b is the coefficient estimated for the variable x (the success rate on the Difficult task) in
Table 3. This methodology yields 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 = 0.54, 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 0.45, and 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 0.38. This ranking of the
estimated cutoff for being more likely than not to choose the Difficult task is consistent with
Proposition 3 for strictly positive regret and gratitude parameters and in line with Figure 2.

        As a robustness check, we also calculate threshold probabilities for choosing the Difficult task
using the methodology of Cabral et al. (2014). There are two ways to deviate from the step function:
choosing the Difficult task when the probability of success is below the cutoff or choosing the Easy
task when the probability of success is above the cutoff. We identify the minimum number of
observations that would need to be eliminated to generate a data set in which the task choice
becomes a step function. When we use this cutoff calculation strategy, we estimate 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 ∈ [0.57,0.60]
by eliminating 15 out of 89 observations; 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ∈ [0.41,0.43] by eliminating 20 out of 87 observations;
and 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ∈ [0.27,0.33] by eliminating 8 out of 82 observations. Hence, the same ranking of the
cutoffs is obtained as predicted by Proposition 3 with strictly positive regret and gratitude
parameters.
        These findings are not consistent with the “envy” model, which predicts 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 > 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 = 𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 . In
other words, contrary to the prediction of the envy model, the NCR treatment did not discourage
subjects from choosing the Difficult task.
        Our findings also are not consistent with a story grounded purely in risk aversion as an
explanation for agents’ behavior. On its own, risk aversion would increase the success probability




                                                                                                          24
cutoff for choosing the Difficult task, but equally in all of the Treatments. Thus, the pattern of
treatment differences we observe cannot be explained by risk aversion alone.
        We further investigate the effect of attitudes towards risk on task choice in the models
reported in Table 4. As in Table 3, the dependent variable in these logistic regressions is whether the
subject chose the Difficult task. The sample for Table 4 includes all subjects for whom we have the
information on risk attitudes and other individual characteristics needed to estimate the full set of
included specifications. The model in column (1) is estimated without any of these controls.
Consistent with the evidence already presented, the coefficient estimates imply that, holding
constant a subject’s probability of completing the Difficult task successfully, those in Treatment NCR
are most likely, and those in Treatment C (the omitted treatment group) least likely, to choose the
Difficult task. Our two measures of risk attitudes are introduced in the next three columns, the Holt-
Laury Switch measure in column (2), the subject’s self-assessment of their willingness to take risk in
column (3), and both together in column (4). Although both measures take on coefficients of the
expected sign (negative for the Holt-Laury measure which has larger values for people who are more
risk averse and positive for the self-assessment measure which has larger values for people who are
more willing to take risk), neither is statistically significant in any of these models and their
introduction has a negligible effect on the coefficients estimated for the treatment dummy variables.
Measures of various individual characteristics are introduced in the next two columns – whether
female, age in years, and raw SAT score on a 2400 point scale in column (4) and those same variables
plus number of financial literacy questions answered correctly (0, 1 or 2) and whether the subject
had any student loan debt in column (5). None of these coefficients is statistically significant and their
introduction has a negligible effect both on the treatment dummy coefficients and on the risk variable
coefficient estimates.

         Finally, we measure the share of subjects in each treatment who choose the surplus
maximizing task. Recall that, for the parameter values in this experiment, the surplus-maximizing
allocation of subjects to task occurs when subjects with a success rate in the Difficult task above 0.4
choose the Difficult task and those with lower success rates choose the Easy task. The share of
subjects choosing the surplus-maximizing task is highest in Treatment NCR (87.8%), lower in
Treatment NC (75.9%) and lowest in Treatment C (70.8%). The deviation from the surplus-
maximizing allocation is due mainly to subjects with success rates higher than 0.4 choosing the Easy
task. Among subjects with a success rate in the Difficult task greater than 0.4, some 32.4% of those in
Treatment C, 23.3% of those in Treatment NC, and just 8.6% of those in Treatment NCR chose the
Easy task.


    6. Conclusion
         In this paper, we have studied the effects of the available set of loan repayment plans on
student borrowers’ post-graduation career (task) choices . Our analysis rests on a behavioral model
of regret and gratitude that we have developed and that provides the basis for our empirical
predictions. In the experiments described in the body of the paper, we observe behavior that is
consistent with the predictions of the behavioral model and that cannot be explained by standard
economic theory.
         Currently available fixed student loan repayment plans put borrowers at the risk of default
during periods of low income. For moderately-skilled borrowers, the desire to avoid this risk may
lead them to avoid risky but high return career paths (Weidner, 2016; Gervais and Ziebarth, 2017;
Krishnan and Wang, forthcoming). Income-driven student loan repayment plans, which link
payments to income, provide insurance against unaffordable loan payments and potentially
encourage take-up of riskier career paths (Ji, 2017). Our paper argues that the loan and career choices
of a borrower are affected by the set of plans available to her and by the set of existing plans, even
when the borrower does not have access to all of them. We show, both theoretically and
experimentally, that the anticipation of regret will diminish the value of a repayment plan if there are
other available options that would produce better outcomes in some states of the world. Hence, the
value of an IDR plan is lower if borrowers are allowed to choose between an IDR and an FR plan.
Concerns about regretting a choice that turns out to be suboptimal ex post shrinks the number of
students who choose the paths with more volatile potential incomes below the surplus maximizing
level.




                                                                                                     27
        Note that in the transition period following the elimination of fixed repayment plans for new
borrowers, some previous borrowers still will participate in the FR plan. If new borrowers take the
repayment plans of others as a reference in evaluating their options, and realize that the repayment
plans not presented to them were a potential source of regret, they may feel gratitude for having a
smaller set of choices, increasing the probability that they will choose the risky, high-paying career
path. We find strong evidence supporting the behavioral predictions of a model that includes both
regret and gratitude. In our setting, this implies that if there was a transition to universal IDR, the
distortions to career choice associated with available loan repayment plans would be smallest during
the transition period.
        Our findings highlight the fact that the set of available loan repayment plans in the market
should be considered not only from an expected return perspective but also from a behavioral
perspective. Student borrowers who are relatively new to making financial decisions may be most
likely to anticipate regret over their labor market choices once uncertainty is resolved. While it is
difficult to measure the welfare consequences of alternative loan repayment plan designs, the clear
behavioral biases we have identified in the lab shed light on the expected welfare changes each design
choice brings to the picture.
