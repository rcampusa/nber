Vanishing Third World Emigrants?
Timothy J. Hatton and Jeffrey G. Williamson
NBER Working Paper No. 14785

JEL No. F22,J1,O15

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper documents a stylized fact not well appreciated in the literature. The Third World has been
undergoing an emigration life cycle since the 1960s, and, except for Africa, emigration rates have
been level or even declining since a peak in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The current economic
crisis will serve only to accelerate those trends. The paper estimates the economic and demographic
fundamentals driving these Third World emigration life cycles to the United States since 1970 – the
income gap between the US and the sending country, the education gap between the US and the sending
country, the poverty trap, the size of the cohort at risk, and migrant stock dynamics. It then projects
the life cycle up to 2024. The projections imply that pressure on Third World emigration over the next
two decades will not increase. It also suggests that future US immigrants will be more African and
less Hispanic than in the past.

                        Country-Specific Emigration Life-Cycles


       The academic literature and media reporting is written as if the rate of Third

World mass migration will increase indefinitely, at least after the current recession. It is

also written from the perspective of the host country demand side, ignoring the sending

country supply side, as if that supply is perfectly elastic and will remain so indefinitely.

Thus, Lant Pritchett tells us that “there are five irresistible forces in the global economy

creating growing pressures for greater movement of labor … from poorer to richer

countries” (2006: 138). Such statements like Pritchett’s imply that immigration rates into

high-wage host countries – unless checked by tougher immigration policy or by another

great depression – will rise to ever-increasing heights as the economic gap between them

and the sending countries remains large, as the industrialized world ages, as its share of

working native-born adults shrinks, and as the demand for additional foreign-born young

adults soars to fill the gap. History strongly suggests the contrary, and it also suggests

that analysts should pay much more attention to the supply side.



Immigration vs Emigration: Denominators Matter

       To begin with, we need to shed our conventional Euro-centric and American-

centric instincts and look at the problem from the point view of the Third World. That is,

in calculating migration rates let us begin by replacing the receiving country population

or labor force in the denominator with the sending country population or labor force.

After all, the growth rate of the former has been slowing down since the post-war baby

boom, and in some countries, like Italy and Japan, native-born population growth is fast




                                              3
approaching zero or even negative rates. Under these demographic conditions, even

constant emigration rates would yield rising immigration rates. In the denominator, when

host country populations – growing so slow at the end of their demographic transition –

are replaced by sending country populations – growing so fast in the middle of their

demographic transition, Third World emigration rates are capable of tracing out quite

different patterns than those of high-wage host country immigration rates. Indeed, as we

shall see below, they trace out what we have called elsewhere country-specific

emigration life cycles (1998: Chp. 3; 2005: Chps. 1 and 4), and they often offer leading

indicators for what to expect regarding immigration rates.



European Pre-1914 Emigration Life Cycles

       Country-specific emigration life cycles across the long 19th century make it clear

that real wage or income per capita gaps will not by themselves explain emigration:

during the course of modern economic growth in Europe, country emigration rates rose

steeply at first from very low levels, after which the rise began to slow down as the

emigration rates climbed to a peak, and subsequently they fell. This life cycle stylized

fact has emerged from study after study, both for aggregate time series of country

emigration rates and for regional emigration rates within countries (Gould 1979; Hatton

and Williamson 2005: Chp. 4).

       Several explanations have been offered for this pre-1914 stylized fact, but we

have previously found Figure 1 a useful way to think about it. Here, movements along

some downward-sloping home country emigration function (EM) are isolated from shifts

in that function (Hatton and Williamson 1994; 1998: Chapter 2; 2005: Chp. 4). In poor,




                                             4
pre-industrial, agrarian economies, we observe low emigration rates (e0) and low real

wages or living standards (w0).1 Industrialization, accumulation, and productivity

advance then serve to shift the emigration function outward to EM' and to raise real

wages to w1. The impact of economic growth on the home wage may be obvious, but the

outward shift in the EM function may not. Indeed, the outward shift in EM dominates in

this example since emigration rates have risen to e1; in the absence of the shift in EM,

emigration rates would have fallen to e1'. In later stages of development, EM is taken to

be stable so that further improvements in real wages at home, to w2, cut back emigration

rates to e2. Should EM shift backwards, the downside of the emigration life cycle will be

even steeper. Thus, Figure 1 can easily reproduce the emigration life-cycle.

         But what might account for the rightward shift in EM during the start of modern

economic growth and its stability, or even backward shift, thereafter? The first

explanation appeals to the costs of migration. Although there is certainly a strong

incentive to flee pre-industrial poverty and rural subsistence, the costs are likely to be

prohibitive for most poor laborers. After all, the potential migrant cannot get loans for the

move (a classic case of capital market failure), and his current income is too close to

subsistence to make it possible to accumulate the necessary savings to invest in some

future, long distance move. Thus, enormous wage gaps between an industrial, resource-

rich, high-wage country and an agrarian, resource-poor, low-wage country can be quite

consistent with low emigration rates. In short, poor agrarian countries are locked in a

poverty trap so that those who have the most to gain from the move are least able to

exploit the opportunity. But as modern development takes hold in the home country, real


1
 Ceteris paribus applies to Figure 1, so conditions abroad are taken as given, including real wages. Thus,
any rise in the home wage in the figure implies some catching up with high wage immigration countries.


                                                     5
wages rise and the supply constraint on emigration is gradually released: more and more

potential emigrants can now finance the move, and, in contrast with conventional theory,

the home wage and emigration are positively correlated. The supply constraint is also

released by greater remittances coming from an increasing stock of emigrants abroad. As

industrialization at home continues, the backlog of potential migrants is slowly exhausted

as more and more workers find it possible to finance the move. When the migration cost

constraint is no longer binding, further increases in the real wage cause the emigration

rate to decline from the peak, as conventional theory predicts.

       Thus, emigration histories should pass through two regimes, the first emigrant

supply constrained, and the second emigrant demand constrained, as in Figure 2. The

emigrant-supply-constrained regime is consistent with rising emigration and rising home

wages, and it can also be made consistent with the downward-sloping EM function in

Figure 1 by appealing to rightward shifts in that function induced by absolute wage

increases (as opposed to relative wages and catching up). At some point, home wages get

high enough so that financial constraints are no longer binding: further increases in the

home wage then reduce the emigration rate as the economy moves up and back along a

more stable EM function, and emigration experience enters the demand-constrained

regime. While this tale of regime switch certainly sounds plausible, we should remember

that it takes no account of changing conditions in the receiving countries. If the

emigration rate is ever to decline from its peak after the regime switch, the sending region

has to begin catching up with the receiving region, as described in Figure 1. If it does not

undergo catching up, the downside of the life cycle may never be reached.




                                              6
         Of course, there are more forces driving the emigration life cycle than simply

costs of the move and wage catch up. Here are three. First, even after controlling for

poverty-induced cost constraints, illiteracy can be a barrier to emigration. Thus, as late

19th century eastern and southern European countries underwent a revolution in

elementary schooling (Kirk 1946; Easterlin 1981; Williamson 2007), young adults were

empowered to exit, an effect sufficiently strong that they were able to leap over the

literacy requirement passed by the United States Congress in 1917 to keep them out

(Hatton and Williamson 2005: Chps. 8 and 9; Williamson 2007). This schooling effect

should shift the EM curve in Figure 1 outward until all potential migrants are literate,2

after which EM remains stable. Second, the number at risk will matter. When countries

start modern development, they also start a demographic transition: child mortality rates

fall, and about two decades later the young adult cohort swells. Thus, for the same costs

and benefits to a move, more will do so as the share of the population mobile rises. This

too will shift the EM curve in Figure 1 outward, but as the demographic transition

continues, the young adult cohort share will eventually start to shrink, and the EM curve

will shift back inwards to the left. Hence, the emigration life cycle is strengthened by the

demographic transition. Third, a rising stock of previous emigrants living abroad

generates the well-known friends and relatives affect: by helping finance the move and

lowering the cost of job search, previous emigrants serve to augment the current flow of

new emigrants. This effect is big at the start of the emigrant life cycle, as the emigrant

stock abroad rises steeply from low levels. But as the rate of growth in the immigrant




2
 Of course, what matters here is the schooling of the young prior to their reaching migration ages, not the
schooling (or its absence) of the older adults they leave behind.


                                                     7
stock in the host country slows down, so too does the friends and relatives effect,3 thus

causing the EM curve to stabilize. In short, outward shifts in the EM curve – more young

adults at risk, lower costs of the move, more resources to finance the move, and more

literate potential movers – contribute to an emigration boom, while a cessation in these

forces, and wage catching up, contribute to an emigration bust.



                 The Third World Emigration Life Cycle since the 1960s



        Pre-1914 mass migration without state intervention is one thing, but what about

post-1970 mass migration under quotas and other restrictions? Here we focus on

migrants from the three major developing regions: Latin America, including the

Caribbean; the Middle East, North Africa and Asia; and Sub-Saharan Africa. We exclude

from consideration the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as these

are affected by the political regime change in the middle of the period.4 Table 1 shows for

the five-year periods between 1970-4 and 2000-45 the immigration rates to the US

(migrants relative to US population) and emigration rates (migrants relative to source-

region population), with 1970-4 = 100. Three things stand out in the upper two panels.

First, immigration rates increase much more steeply than do emigration rates. The surge

of migrants looks a lot more modest when standardized by the more rapidly-growing

source populations.6 Second, emigration rates often tend to lead immigration rates: thus,

assimilation in the host country.

  We also exclude the poor counrties of Oceania where the numbers are miniscule.

  The migration rates are for fiscal years 1970/1-2004/5.

  It would look even more modest if the emigrants were included in the denominator, although the
differences are slight.


                                                   8
Asian emigration rates peaked a decade before immigration rates. Third, Asian

emigration rates reached a peak in the 1980-84 while Latin American emigration rates

reached a peak just a half decade later, in 1985-94. By contrast, the emigration rate from

Sub-Saharan Africa continued to grow throughout the period.

       The lower panel of Table 1 provides a more detailed breakdown for Latin

America and Asia. It shows that the trend in Latin American emigration is not just due to

Mexico (which accounted for about half of all US immigration from the Americas during

the 1991-2000 decade, including Canada: Hatton and Williamson 2005: p. 208). Neither

is it solely due to the legalization of undocumented migrants (principally from Mexico)

that affected the figures in 1989-91. Emigration rates from the Caribbean, Central

America and South America all have peak emigration rates in the decade 1985-94. The

pattern for Asia is similar but a bit more mixed: North African and Middle Eastern

(MENA) emigration rates underwent a pronounced decline after 1980-4; East Asian rates

underwent a more modest decline after 1990-94; and the South Asian decline after 1990-

94 was actually reversed in 2000-04.

       These trends raise four questions. First, are they driven by a few countries with

very large immigrant numbers that dominate the regional totals? Or, is there a distinct life

cycle pattern in the emigration rates even if we give equal weight to each country? We

investigate this possibility by regressing the log of emigration rates (to allow for

differences in scaling) on time and time squared for all the countries in each regional

sample over the seven five-year periods 1970-4 to 2000-4, using country fixed effects.

Table 2 shows that for the 26 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean there is a

significant inverted U with a maximum in the early 1990s. A similar (significant) life




                                              9
cycle pattern is found for 35 countries in the North Africa, the Middle East and Asia; the

squared term is negative and the peak occurs in the early 1990s. By contrast, only the

linear term is significant for Sub-Saharan Africa, the sending region containing the

poorest countries. These results confirm a fall in emigration rates for two of the major

sending regions, while the third has yet to reach its peak.

           Second, is the fall in Third World emigration rates just for those going to the

United States, or are the same effects observed for other immigrant host countries? Table

3 shows immigration and emigration rates to Canada and Germany from the three

sending regions.7 The Latin American and Asian immigration rates for Canada have been

falling since 1990-94, repeating the US pattern. This suggests that the slowdown and fall

in immigration rates from the early 1990s is not just the result of US-specific policy

changes. And, again repeating the US pattern, immigration rates from Africa and Asia

rose much more steeply over the long term than did the emigration rates. Also, the

emigration rates from Asia and Latin America into Canada have fallen more dramatically

since 1990-94 than have immigration rates, as has been true of the US. Finally, the rise in

the emigration rate to Canada from Africa, once again, was slower than for the

immigration rate.

           The lower panels of Table 3 document the immigration and emigration rates to

Germany. These comparisons are complicated by German reunification in 1990 and the

migration rates here are based on the combined population throughout. The German

immigration rates display a strong upward trend to 1990-94, and a fall (or a pronounced




7
    Other host countries do not offer the kind of evidence necessary for the empirical analysis which follows.


                                                       10
slowdown in the rise) thereafter. Once again, emigration rates show a more pronounced

life cycle than do immigration rates.8

        Third, are the recent downward trends or pronounced slowdowns in emigration

rates simply due to tougher immigration policies in host countries rather than to declining

emigration pressure in source regions? Imagine for a moment that the immigration rate

reflects only policy and that policy has been aimed at stabilizing immigration relative to

the home population. This implies that emigration rates from regions with rapidly

growing populations should fall. Under such conditions, policy gets tougher, and all the

more so if there are pressures pushing up source country emigration rates.

        Finally, if emigration policy got tougher over time, did emigration pressure from

sending countries create those policies? That is, can immigration policies in host

countries be viewed as an endogenous political response to rising emigration pressure

abroad? Perhaps, but it does not appear to have been the case that immigrants from Latin

America, Asia and Africa have crowded out potential immigrants from other regions, an

effect that would have eased any political pressure for tougher immigration restrictions.

That is, while emigration from eastern Europe, southern Europe and the former Soviet

Union fell as a proportion of US immigration from the 1960s to the 1980s, that share

stabilized between the 1980s and 1990s. In any case, the central point is this: when

analyzing trends in migration from any source region, overall host country policy

constraints must be taken in to account. The empirical work that follows does just that.

 Note that both the immigration and the emigration rates from Turkey fall steeply from the end of the
guestworker era after 1974.


                                                    11
                   Possible Causes of the Third World Emigration Life Cycle



           Here we focus on emigration rates to the United States from Latin America, Asia

and Africa. After all, the US is home to more than half of the stock of inter-continental

immigrants from these regions. US immigration offers the best opportunity to evaluate

the longer term trends since its immigrants come from a wider variety of countries over a

longer period than is true for most other host countries. Thus, we can include more source

countries in the empirical analysis without having to place too much weight on migration

streams that are small and volatile.

           Our goal is to identify the source country economic and demographic

fundamentals that drive emigration to the US. As in all migration models, the major

determinant is income of the home country relative to US. However, the incentive to

migrate does not depend just on income gaps, but also on the human capital of the

potential migrant needed to exploit the gap. Therefore, we also include relative education,

using average years of schooling in the home country relative to the US (Barro and Lee

2001). The positive effect of home country education that is often found in migration

equations reflects the fact that higher home education for a given income level implies a

lower rate of return to education at home. Alternatively, schooling in the home country

gives the potential emigrant the credentials to take advantage of the higher relative

income in the host country.9


9
    In any case, the result should not necessarily be interpreted as suggesting that the more educated have

higher mobility.




                                                       12
         Two demographic fundamentals feature in most migration models. The first is the

relative size of the migration intensive cohort, reflecting the fact that the net present value

of a given income gap is higher for young adults. To measure this first demographic

fundamental, we use the relative size of the cohort aged 0-14 fifteen years before the date

of observation.10 The second key demographic fundamental is the stock of immigrants

from the source country resident in the US. This measures the friends and relatives effect

that is thought to diminish the cost and uncertainty of migration. Most studies find this

effect to be powerful. Perhaps even more to the point, the friends and relatives effect

should be all the more powerful in the presence of immigration policies that favor family

reunification, as they do in the US.11 We measure the effect by dividing the US migrant

stock from each source country by the source country population at the beginning of each

five year period.

         It is widely recognized that poverty acts as a constraint on migration owing to

capital market imperfections. This constraint is especially important for long-distance

moves as it is hard to raise a loan for an investment in a move which takes the borrower

out of the lender’s jurisdiction. Here we proxy the share of the population in poverty by a

non-linear transformation of per capita income so that the poverty-reducing effects of an

increase in income are more powerful at lower income levels. While poverty implies

lower mobility, the poverty constraint is likely to be loosened by having friends and




10
   The size of the 0-14 age group lagged fifteen years is used rather than the current size of the 15-29 age
group since the latter is likely to be diminished by (the predicted) high exit rates.
11
   The friends and relatives effect should be much more powerful for the US where family reunification
policy has always been more generous. Family reunification could also weaken the role of young adult
cohort size in pushing emigrants out of sending countries. This prediction could be explored by a
comparison of emigration rates to the US with that of other host countries, an issue not explored here or, as
far as we know, elsewhere in the literature.


                                                     13
relatives at the destination: hence, the larger the migrant stock in the host country, the

less the poverty constraint facing potential emigrants.

       Finally, and as noted earlier, immigration policies must be considered in the

analysis. If immigration policies have become tougher since the early 1990s, then this

fact could account for the slow down or decline in emigration rates in recent years. One

way of taking host country policy into account is to include period fixed effects which

should capture any common trends in migration across different source countries, like

host country policy. An alternative approach is to include a measure of the overall

immigration quota in the analysis: here, policy ‘toughness’ is measured as the total US

immigration quota relative to the population of all three sending regions (see Appendix).

We much prefer the quota-based measure, but we will try both in the analysis.



         Explaining Third World Emigration to the United States 1970-2005



       Table 4 presents the results of regressions for emigration rates to the US from 62

countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa (see Appendix). We use a balanced panel, 24

of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 25 in Asia, the Middle East and

North Africa, and 13 in sub-Saharan Africa. The African sample is limited by the data

both for migration and for the explanatory variables. The dependent variable is the log of

five-year total emigration rates for fiscal years (e.g. 1970-4 includes the fiscal years

1970/1 to 1974/5), while all explanatory variables are for the beginning of the five year

period (e.g. 1970, 1975). Fixed country effects ensure that we focus on the trends over

time, absorbing in the fixed effects variables such as distance between the source country




                                              14
and the US, whether the source country is English speaking, and cultural affinities

between the two.

       The column (1) regression includes five-year period dummies which capture

changing immigration policies and any other trends, such as falling migration costs and

information diffusion that would be common to all source countries. The cohort effect is

the right sign but not significant in this regression. However, the income ratio and the

education ratio are strongly significant with the expected signs. Furthermore, the two

estimated coefficients are of a similar magnitude, supporting the view that relative

income and relative education should have equal and opposite effects. The log ratio of the

emigrant stock to source country population is strongly positive, reflecting the power of

the friends and relatives effect, enhanced by the immigration policy filter. While the

effect of poverty is negative as predicted, it is attenuated by an increase in the emigrant

stock, also as predicted.

       The column (2) regression replaces the period dummies with our preferred

immigration policy constraint variable. Controlling for the policy environment properly

serves to increase the size and significance of the cohort size coefficient and to reduce the

size of the still-significant relative income and relative education coefficients. The effect

of a one percentage point increase in the size of the migration-sensitive cohort in the

source country increases emigration to the US by about 2.4 percent. This effect is large—

at the sample averages it implies an increase in five-year emigration rates of about 3 per

thousand of the source population between the early 1970s and the early 1990s. The

effect of the migrant stock is also large: an increase of one percent in the US source

country migrant stock increases the emigration rate by about 0.32 percent. At the sample




                                              15
means (including the interaction with poverty), this implies a chain migration effect

where for every 1000 of the stock of previous migrants a further 90 would arrive in the

following five-year period, or 18 each year. That figure was much the same in the 19th

century (20 each year: Hatton and Williamson 2005, p. 65), and, as we shall see, this has

important implications for the dynamics of migration since it means that migration

streams persist long after the original shocks that created them.

       The effect of source country poverty is of special interest. Excluding the

interaction with the migrant stock, a doubling in per capita income from US$1,000 to

$2,000 (about equivalent to the East and Southeast Asian per capita income level in 1960

and its growth rate between 1960 and 1985, 3.4 percent: Maddison 2008) increases the

emigration rate by 12 percent. In contrast, an increase for today’s middle income country

from $10,000 to $11,000 has a negligible effect on the emigration rate (0.03 percent). To

see more clearly how the poverty-constraint-eradication effect contributes to the

emigration life cycle, note that a 50 percent increase in per capita income at $1000 raises

the emigration rate by 9 percent while the same percentage increase at $10,000 raises the

emigration rate by just 0.1 percent. That is, the poverty effect is non-linear, powerful at

low-income levels and weak at middle-income levels. Thus, the poverty effect by itself

can produce the emigration life cycle.

       But there are two forces that tend to offset the poverty constraint. The first offset

operates through the relative income gap. With no change income at the destination and

no change in relative education, a 50 percent increase in per capita income from $1,000

reduces emigration by 12 percent—exactly offsetting the poverty effect. However, if per

capita income growth at home is positive but does not exceed that of the US, then




                                             16
emigration pressure rises. The second effect can occur through the interaction with the

migrant stock. For example, when a country with a migrant stock abroad equivalent to 10

per thousand of the home population enjoys an increase in per capita income from $1000

to $2000, the emigration rate increases by just 1.3 percent, as compared with a 12 percent

increase for a country with zero migrant stock (i.e. no emigration history). Thus for poor

countries, a large migrant stock in the host country can largely eliminate the poverty

constraint, as it did for the Irish in the 19th century.

        The regressions in columns (3) and (4) explore the result when the interaction

between the poverty proxy and the migrant stock is omitted. It matters. In column (3), the

poverty effect is now negligible, which highlights the importance of the friends and

relatives effect in releasing the poverty constraint. Column (4) shows that in the absence

of the migrant stock the effect of the coefficients on relative income and relative

education increase dramatically. This is because the migrant stock reflects past

immigration, which in turn depends on past gaps in relative income and relative

education that persist to the present. In effect, without the migrant stock, economic

fundamentals matter much more since migrants tend to be driven by job opportunities

rather than family ties.



        Decomposing the Sources of Trends in Third World Emigration Rates



        This section explores emigration rate trends by source region to see how the

fundamentals that determine emigration (Table 4) influenced long term trends. Table 5

compares actual log emigration rates with predicted rates in our balanced panel for each




                                                17
of the seven five-year periods, both expressed as deviations from the overall 1970-2004

mean for the source region. The patterns observed for these mean deviations do not

exactly replicate Tables 1 and 2 since they are estimated with a smaller sample of source

countries. Nevertheless, the patterns are certainly consistent.

          The actual or observed mean deviation for Latin America and the Caribbean rises

from 36 log points below the average in 1970-4 to 31 log points above the average in

1985-9 before falling close to the mean in 2000-4. The predicted values rise from 44 log

points below the average in 1970-4 to a plateau of 22 log points above the average from

1985-9 onwards. For the Asia, Middle East and North Africa region, there is a steep

increase in observed mean deviations from -39 log points in 1970-4 to a peak of 26 log

points in 1990-4 followed by a decline to 16 log points in 2000-4. The predicted values

yield a similar profile, although the predicted peak occurs in 1985-9 rather than 1990-4.

As was found in Table 2, the trajectory for sub-Saharan Africa is a fairly linear upward

trend. This is evident in both the actual and predicted series although it is stronger in the

former.

          Two questions naturally follow. The first, which we pursue here, is this: How do

the underlying explanatory variables account for these emigration trends in the source

regions? We save the second for the next section: What happens to the Third World

emigration rate when the explanatory variables are projected into the future? In order to

examine the contributions of the different variables we multiply the change in the

explanatory variable by its coefficient in column 2 of Table 4. Table 6 reports the

decomposition for changes in the emigration rates in log points. For Latin America and

the Caribbean and for Asia, the Middle East and North Africa we distinguish between the




                                              18
upswing from 1970-4 to 1990-4 and the subsequent decade whereas for sub-Saharan

Africa we take the three decades as a whole.

       In all three sending regions, the migrant stock effect made the most important

contribution to the emigration rate boom, reflecting the importance of family

reunification in US immigration policy. Yet, there is another way of interpreting the

migration stock effect: it has embedded in it the impact of all these fundamentals which,

in the past, brought the primary family mover to the United States. Thus, consider the

share each fundamental contributed to the residual difference between all effects up to

peak and that of the migrant stock (e.g. 0.60-0.38 = 0.22 for Latin America and the

Caribbean). Using this accounting, here are the contributions of the key fundamentals in

percent for Latin America and Africa: Latin America, income gap 36, birth cohort 32,

education gap 22, and poverty 0; Africa, income gap 70, education gap 28, birth cohort

20, and poverty -20. Asia is especially interesting. Were it not for the migrant stock

effect, Asian emigration rates would have fallen between 1970-4 and 1990-4 (0.50-0.87 =

-0.37), and almost all of that was being driven by education gap catch up (education gap

89 percent) and income catch up (income gap 16 percent).



        What Will Third World Emigration Rates Look Like in the Future?



       What should we assume about host country policy when we project the future?

Clearly immigration policy has important effects on the numbers who are able to

emigrate to the United States. Recall that our measure of the overall immigration

constraint is the total US quota divided by the total population of the three sending




                                             19
regions for each five year period. While the overall quota trended upward, so did the

population of the three sending regions. As it turns out, there has been no change in the

US policy constraint since 1970, at least as we have defined it.12 Thus, the projections

will assume that there will be neither tightening nor loosening in the immigration

constraint in the near future.

        To examine the underlying trends in the explanatory variables by sending region,

in our balanced panel they are regressed on a quadratic in time, with country fixed

effects. We have observations for each of the explanatory variables on most of the

countries back to 1960. The demographic projection (which involves a lagged variable)

relies on the UN’s estimates up to 2020. The squared term is dropped where it is

insignificant. The results are provided in Table 7.

        The size of the relevant birth cohort follows a strong quadratic inverse U shape

trend for all three sending regions. The birth cohort variable trend peaks is in the late

1980s for Latin America and Asia, while that for sub-Saharan reaches a peak around

2000. In contrast, the relative income and relative education trends are uniformly linear.

Latin America exhibits some falling behind in income per capita relative to the US (the

positive coefficient 0.0603 implying a rise in the income gap), but some catching up in

relative education (the negative coefficient -0.048 implying a fall in the education gap) .

Sub-Saharan Africa fell further behind in relative income even more than Latin America

but exhibited even greater catching up in relative education. The trend in poverty has

been clearly downwards in Latin America, and even more so in Asia, although in both

12
  Our measure of policy exhibits an inverse U shaped trend that is almost entirely the result of the
legalization program under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 that resulted in a large
increase in recorded migration in 1989-91, most of which came from Mexico. If we exclude this
component of the policy index then there is no evidence of a trend. When this modified version of log
policy is regressed on a trend the coefficient is -0.011, with a ‘t’ value of 0.51.


                                                    20
cases it flattens out as would be expected given the functional form of the poverty

variable. Sub-Saharan Africa’s poor economic performance is reflected by a linear

upward trend.13

         The projected emigration rates are derived using the quadratic or linear trend in

the fundamentals as reported in Table 7. The trends in these variables will have a

cumulative effect on emigration rates since they affect the host country migrant stock in

successive periods, thus influencing future emigration rates. For each of the fundamentals

in Table 7, we calculate the effect of the change on emigration rates in each period but we

also take account of the effect on the migrant stock in subsequent periods. Thus, the

simulation updates the migrant stock in each period and adds the indirect effects on

emigration through the migrant stock (including its interaction with poverty) to the direct

effect in the subsequent period. Table 8 reports the overall difference in log points

between the simulated emigration rate in 2020-4 and in the base period 2000-4. These are

averages for the individual countries in each regional group.

         For Latin America and Asia, demographic pressures are predicted to reduce

emigration rates by 21-22 log points on average. These demographic forces will dominate

trends in emigration rates in the future since no other fundamental will do anywhere near

the work that this one will in these two regions. However, the combined effects of

relative income and relative education partially offset the effect of demographic trends:

the two combined increase emigration rates by 12 log points in Latin America and 8 log

points in Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa offers a sharp contrast: the demographic effects are

negative but small, while the relative income and relative education effects are both


13
   Note, however, that the level of significance (t = 1.78) is lower for sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting the
large variance in economic performance across the region.


                                                      21
positive, adding up to a powerful 30 log points. The effects of rising poverty (including

the interaction with the migrant stock) are neutral for Latin America -- where the poverty

constraint is less binding, and positive for Asia – where poverty more binding but is

being quickly eroded. Poverty is projected to increase in sub-Saharan Africa and its

impact tends to reduce emigration rates powerfully (larger than the birth cohort or income

gap effect): the effects are negative as the direct effect of deepening poverty outweighs

the interaction with the migrant stock.

       The penultimate row in Table 8 shows the independent effect of the migrant

stock. This arises because migrant stocks are projected to increase even in the absence of

any further ‘push’ from the other emigration fundamentals. The higher is current

emigrant flow relative to the previous migration stock, the greater is the rate of increase

of the stock, which in turn boosts emigration rates in the next period. These migrant stock

dynamics produce effects that persist into the future at different rates for different source

regions. For the Latin American countries, where the current migrant stock is relatively

high relative to the flow, the stock dynamics have no effect (0 log points). For the Asia

and MENA countries, where the current migrant stock is lower, dynamics increase the

emigration rate by 8 log points between 2000-4 and 2020-4. The most striking result,

however, is for sub-Saharan Africa, where the migrant stock is low relative to the current

flow: in this case, stock dynamics are projected to increase the emigration rate by an

enormous 21 log points.

       Adding these effects together, the overall projection implies a decline in the

emigration rate from Latin America and the Caribbean, and a stable emigration rate from

Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, is




                                              22
projected to undergo a steep increase of 19 log points in its emigration rate, driven by

rising income gaps, falling education gaps and migrant stock dynamics. When the three

regions are weighted by shares in total US immigration, the projected result is a modest

fall of 1.8 log points in the overall emigration rate. Alternatively, when they are weighted

by sending region populations, the result is a modest increase of 2.7 log points. When we

look beyond 2024, the migrant stock dynamics weaken and the continued fall in the other

fundamentals will almost certainly cause Third World emigration rates to fall.

       In contrast with media hysteria and academic assumption, these results strongly

support the view that there will be no mounting emigration pressure from the Third

World over the next two decades, and a likely fall thereafter. Of course, if Africa starts to

register double digit GDP per capita growth rates, the fall in emigration rates may be

postponed as unlocking the poverty trap will dominate before the effect of reduction in

the income gap takes over.



        Why Did Third World Emigration Wait Until After the 1960s?



       Why didn’t the Third World post-war emigration boom start in the late 1940s, the

1950s or the 1960s? After all, the income gap between industrial and Third World

countries was huge. Why did the boom wait until the 1970s? Now that we have analyzed

the Third World emigration life cycle over the half century 1970-2024, the answers

should be clearer. Four fundamental forces emerged simultaneously, and all four

underwent dramatic change between the 1950s and 1970s:




                                             23
Leveling the policy playing field: From the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 until the

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (which became effective in mid-1968), the US

applied strict country of origin quotas that were related to the stock of foreign-born in the

US population before the First World War. The 1965 Act replaced this regime with a

non-discriminatory policy under which migrants from all countries could compete

equally for immigration into the US,14 first under separate quotas for the Eastern and

Western Hemispheres and then under a combined worldwide quota after 1979.15 The new

policy regime also greatly favored immigrants arriving by family reunification, most of

whom did not even fall under the quota.

         The composition of US immigrants by source changed dramatically between the

1950s and the 1970s. The European, Canadian and Oceanic share fell by about 45

percentage points, and the Third World share rose by 55 percentage points, the rise for

Asia by itself 29 percentage points (Hatton and Williamson 2005: Table 10.2). Policy

reform certainly opened up opportunities for migrants from poor countries, but dramatic

changes on the supply side transformed the benign policy regime into a surge of

migration.

Third World schooling revolutions started reducing the education gap: A revolution

in primary schooling and literacy took place in the Third World prior to the emigration

boom (Easterlin 1981; Schultz 1987), and it started to erase the education gap between

the US and sending countries. Between 1960 and 1981 the ratio of expected years of

schooling in industrial countries relative to low-income countries fell from 1.92 to 1.60,


14
   Non-discriminatory immigration policies were enacted a little later by Canada, Australia and New
Zealand.
15
   Before 1979 the overall quota for the Eastern Hemisphere was 170,000 per annum; for the Western
Hemisphere it was 120,000 until 1976 and then 88,800 for 1977-78.


                                                   24
and the same ratio relative to middle income oil importers fell from 1.82 to 1.44

(Williamson 1993: Table 4.8). Between 1960 and 1987, the education stock (school years

per person ages 15-64: Nehru et al. 1995: Table 1) rose by only 0.3 percent per annum in

the industrial countries, but by 4 percent in the developing world. Based on our model

and the countries in our sample, the direct effects of those trends would have been to

increase emigration rates from Latin America and the Caribbean by 5 log points between

1950-4 and 1970-4, by 10 log points from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and by

8 log points for Sub-Saharan Africa.

Growth miracles started unlocking the poverty trap: Not many Third World regions

started catching up with the industrial world like the East Asian gang of four did, but per

capita incomes did rise enough to start unlocking Third World poverty traps. Between

1950 and 1970, per capita income rose by 52 percent in Africa, by 41 percent in East

Asia, by 59 percent in Latin America, and – pulled by oil – by 125 percent in the Middle

East (Maddison 2008). The direct effects of unlocking the poverty trap would have added

10 log points to the emigration rate from Asia between 1950-4 and 1970-4.

Demographic transitions began to yield fat young adult cohorts: The timing of the

demographic transition in the Third World mattered. The share of Asia’s population aged

0-14 started rising rapidly in the 1950s, with the result that the migration-sensitive age

group rose sharply in the 1970s and 1980s. The share of the working age population in

Asia rose dramatically after it bottomed out in the late 1960s, and other sending regions

followed. For example, the East Asian adult percent share rose from about 57 in 1965 to

67 in 1995 (ADB 1997: Figure 3.4). Based on our model, the direct effects of the

demographic transition would have added a huge 20 log points to emigration rates from




                                             25
Latin America and the Caribbean and from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa from

1950-4 to 1970-4. Demographic pressures increased a little later in sub-Saharan Africa

but they still would have added about 16 log points to the migration rate between 1950-4

and 1970-4.

       What would have happened if the US Congress had passed those Amendments to

the US Immigration Act in 1950 rather than 1965? Emigration pressures stemming from

the key fundamentals were much lower in 1950 but by the 1960s they were building up.

Most importantly, the stock of migrants from the Third World was relatively low in 1950

partly because emigration pressures were modest and partly because of discriminatory

policies, like the Asiatic Barred Zone which prohibited Asian immigration from 1917 to

1952. This suggests that emigration from Asia would have surged in the 1960s rather

than in the 1970s when its share in total US immigration increased from 12.9 percent in

1961-9 to 35.3 percent in 1971-9 (Hatton and Williamson 2005, p. 208). In Latin

America, emigration pressures were building up more slowly, policy was much less

restrictive, and there was already a substantial migrant stock. As a result, the emigration

rate rose only modestly between the 1960s and the 1970s. Finally, emigration from

Africa was very small in the 1950s as Africans were constrained both by colonialism and

poverty. Although migration from Africa rose continuously, the base was very small and

the increase was driven almost entirely by the migrant stock.



                               Host Country Implications


       This paper has argued that to understand the forces that drive international

migration we must take a source country perspective. Only then can we assess the



                                             26
fundamental forces that have underpinned the ebb and flow of migration over the last half

century that will drive migration in the future. Much of literature, however, takes a host

country perspective and its agenda is often determined by host country concerns about

rising migration pressure leading to soaring immigration rates. What do we find when we

look instead at the supply side, using the United States as our window on the process?

       Trends in migration rates are very different when viewed from a source country

perspective. Since the Second World War, population growth rates have been higher and

fell later in poor sending countries compared with rich host countries where they have

been lower and fell sooner. This has served to influence the timing and magnitude of the

migration rates: emigration rates have tended to lead immigration rates, but they have

been less dramatic.

       These trends in late 20th century Third World emigration rates trace out country

and region life cycles, and the underlying fundamentals can be identified. First, the US

migrant stock effect made the most important contribution to the boom up to the 1990s,

reflecting both the importance of family reunification in US immigration policy and that

the impact of previous changes in the economic and demographic fundamentals got

embedded in the current migrant stock. Indeed, were it not for the migrant stock effect,

Asian emigration rates would have fallen after 1970-74, rather than rising to 1980-4. The

change in the poverty trap mattered only for Africa, where a rise in poverty rates reduced

emigration rates over time. Education catch up played an important role everywhere in

the Third World, augmenting emigration rates. The birth cohort effect also played an

important role in Latin America and Africa, but not in Asia (where much of the

demographic transition had already run its course by the 1970s). While there was




                                            27
certainly per capita income growth in Asia and Latin America, it was not fast enough to

reduce the income gap with the US, and thus it contributed a little to the emigration

boom. For Africa, however, it contributed a lot, as poor growth performance caused

Africa to lose ground and the income gap to rise.

       Having estimated the causes of the Third World emigration rates over the past

half century, we turned to projections of the future. These projections speak to a changing

composition of US immigration by source and its total size. In 2000-4, the US

immigration shares (of the three region total) were 41 percent from Latin America and

the Caribbean, 53 percent from Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, and 6 percent

from Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2020-4, the share from Latin America and the Caribbean is

projected to fall to 38 percent while the share from Asia, the Middle East and North

Africa will decrease modestly to 52 percent. The most striking change is the rise in the

share from sub-Saharan Africa from 6 to 10 percent, a significant increase in the share of

Africans. In short, US immigrants will be more African and less Hispanic fifteen or

twenty years for now.

       A final observation is this. History demonstrates that migration stock dynamics

are important. During the transatlantic migrations of the late 19th century, for each

thousand of the migrant stock 20 more migrants were pulled across the Atlantic each year

(Hatton and Williamson 2005, p. 65). That 19th century figure is close to the late 20th

century 18 per thousand estimate obtained here. The ‘friends and relatives effect’ was

particularly strong in the upswing of every sending region emigration cycle, first for

Latin American emigrants, a little later for Asian emigrants, and most recently (and in the

future) for the Africans. While the migrant stock effects tend to fade over time, they




                                             28
nevertheless cause migration rates to persist long after the other fundamentals have

turned down. This is an important reason why the impending decline in Third World

emigration rates has been obscured from view.

Data Sources

Immigration to USA: Five-year total immigration to the United States by country of birth is taken
from the Department of Homeland Security, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (before 2002
entitled the Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service). Five year totals
calculated from annual data, with an adjustment to the years 1976 and earlier for the change in the
fiscal year. The country of origin classification used here is country of birth rather than country of
last residence. This ensures consistency with the immigrant flow and the immigrant stock as
measured in the census.

Immigrant stock in the US: Foreign born stock data for the census years 1970, 1980 and 1990 are
taken from C. J. Gibson and E. Lennon (1999), “Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-born
Population of the United States, 1850-1990,” US Census Bureau Population Division, Technical
Working Paper No. 29. Data for 2000 were obtained from the 2000 US Census. The intervening
years 1975, 1985 and 1995 using the stock accumulation equation St+1 = (1-d)St + Mt where M is
the migrant inflow, S is the migrant stock and d is the ‘depreciation ‘ rate calculated for each
intercensal period.

Source country population: Total population and share aged 0-14 taken from United Nations
(2007), “World Population Prospects: the 2006 Revision” (CD ROM).

Years of education: Average years of education for the population age 15 and over, at five-year
intervals from the database of Barro and Lee, available at: http://www2.cid.harvard.edu.




                                                 32
Income per capita: Income per capita at constant 2000 prices (chain series) for years ending in 0
and 5 from A. Heston, R. Summers and B. Aten, Penn World Table 6.2, University of
Pennsylvania, Center for International Comparisons of Production Income and Prices, available
at: http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu/php_site/pwt_index.php.

US immigration policy: The immigration policy constraint is modeled as the number of
immigrants coming under the overall quota. These include non-immediate relatives, employment
visas, diversity immigrants, refugees and asylees, and those admitted under the Immigration
Reform and Control Act (1986). We take the effect of IRCA to be an increase in immigration of
2.7 million spread over the three years 1989-1991. This measure of the overall quota is applied to
all countries, rather than being tailored to each country. It amounts to two thirds of total
immigration between 1970 and 2005, with the other third accounted for by those family-reunified
migrants that do not fall under the US quota. The calculation of these categories is discussed in
full in Clark et al. (2007).The total of these categories for each five-year period is expressed per
thousand of the population in the three world regions at the beginning of the period.
