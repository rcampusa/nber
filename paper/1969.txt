                The Prewar Business Cycle Reconsidered:
          New Estimates of Gross National Product, 1869-1918




                                ABSTRACT




     This paper shows that the existing estimates of prewar gross national

product exaggerate the size of cyclical fluctuations. The source of the

exaggeration is that the original Kuznets estimates are based on the

assumption that GNP moves one—for—one with commodity output valued at

producer prices. New estimates of GNP for 1869—1918 are derived using the

estimated aggregate relationship between GNP and commodity output for the

interwar and postwar eras. The new estimates of GNP indicate that the

business cycle is only slightly more severe in the pre—Worid War I era

than in the post—World War II era.

                                  INTRODUCTION




     The existing estimates of gross national product for the seventy years

before World War II have perhaps done more to shape economists' perceptions of

prewar business cycles than any other macroeconomic series. The historical GNP

data have been analyzed in great detail and are constantly cited in research on

prewar fluctuations in economic activity. Hence, much of what economists

believe about prewar cyclical fluctuations is derived directly from the cyclical

behavior of prewar GNP. As a result, the accuracy of the prewar estimates of

GNP is one of the main determinants of the accuracy of our views are about the

prewar cycle.

     The importance of the prewar estimates of GNP has, if anything, increased

in recent years. Economists interested in a variety of cyclical relationships

have recently included the historical GNP series in their analyses. Much work

has been done, for example, on the changing severity of cycles over time.

Studies by Baily (1978) and DeLong and Suimners (1984) use prewar GNP movements

to argue that cycles have become less severe in the postwar era. Much current

research also concerns the changing cyclical relationship of prices and output

(see, for example, Schultze, 1981, and Gordon, 1982) and money and output (see,

for example, Friedman and Schwartz, 1982). In all these studies the existing

historical estimates of GNP play a key role in the analysis.

     While the short-term cyclical behavior of the prewar GNP series has been

analyzed in detail, the accuracy of the existing prewar estimates of GNP for
                                        -2-




 such cyclical analyses has rarely been discussed. The standard estimates of GNP

 before 1929 are still those derived by Simon Kuznets. Several economists have

 amended the Kuznets series, most notably Robert Gailman and John Kendrick, but

 these amendments have not changed the cyclical behavior of the Kuznets series.

 Most of the alterations of Kuznets's series concentrate on correcting the long-

 term trend of the prewar GNP series or making the Kuznets series conceptually

 similar to the modern Department of Commerce GNP series. Few economists have

questioned whether the Kuznets estimates reflect cyclical movements accurately.

     There is reason to believe, however, that the representation of cyclical

movements in the Kuznets estimates should be critically examined. Kuznets

clearly never intended for his estimates of GNP to be used for the analysis of

short-term cyclical movements. While he is very careful about determining

long-run movements of various series, but he is less careful about cyclical

movements. Annual movements in various components of GNP are often derived by

simply interpolating by means of another series, without taking into account the

actual cyclical relationship between the series being created and the interpo-

lating series. As a result, it is very likely that the existing GNP estimates

are not adequate for the detailed cyclical analysis to which they are being put

today.

     Kuznets himself believed that his annual series did not represent cyclical

movements accurately. He states in Capital in the American Economy that the

version of his prewar estimates of GNP that are most frequently used today

"would not be acceptable measures of the amplitude of short-term changes"

(Kuznets, 1961, p. 546). He repeatedly warns readers not to use his data for

short-term cyclical comparisons and urges them to use the data in five-year

moving average form.
                                       —3—




    This paper examines Kuznets's pre-1918 GNP series and finds that Kuznets's

caveats concerning the accuracy of the annual estimates are justified. There is

evidence that Kuznets's methods accentuate the size of cyclical movements in the

prewar GNP series. The basic problem with the Kuznets estimates is that they

are derived almost entirely from data on commodity output at producer prices.

Total output at consumer prices, including the value added in transportation and

distribution, is essentially assumed to move proportionately with commodity

output at producer prices. This, however, may not be true. A variety of

interwar and postwar evidence shows that gross national product moves less over

the cycle than does commodity output. If the same is true in the prewar era,

then Kuznets's series will exaggerate cyclical fluctuations.

     Because the existing estimates of GNP may not be accurate for the

short-term cyclical analysis to which most economists wish to put them, I derive

what I believe is a more accurate prewar GNP series for 1869-1918. I create a

new series by explicitly modeling the fact that GNP does not move as much over

the cycle as does commodity output. Data from the interwar and postwar eras are

used to estimate the relationship between GNP and commodity output. In estimat-

ing this relationship, the sensitivity of cyclical movements in GNP to cyclical

movements in commodity output is allowed to change over time.   I then use the

resulting time-varying sensitivity estimate to convert pre-1918 data on commodi-

ty output into estimates of GNP for this period. In this derivation I do not

alter the Kuznets/Gallman estimates of long-run trend GNP. Rather, I change

only the representation of short-term cyclical fluctuations.

     The cyclical properties of the new estimates of GNP that I derive are very

different from those of the standard GNP series. The pre-1918 business cycle

appears to be much less severe in the new data than in the existing Kuzuets

series. As a result, the decline in the severity of the business cycle between
                                       -4-




the pre-1918 and the postwar eras is also much smaller than is typically be-

lieved. In fact, the average amplitude of the cycle for 1869-1918 using the new

data is only slightly larger than the average amplitude for 1947-1983.

     This reworking of the historical estimates of GNP is organized as follows.

Section I describes the Kuznets estimates of GNP. Section II discusses the

possible problems with these data and provides empirical evidence that the

Kuznets estimates are excessively volatile. Section III suggests a new method

for deriving annual estimates of prewar GNP and presents the new series.

Section IV examines the basic volatility characteristics of the new GNP series

and analyzes the degree of stabilization between the pre-World War I and

post-World War II eras.

                                    SECTION I



              KUZNETS'S ESTIMATES OF PREWAR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT




     The first step in forming new estimates of prewar gross national product is

to analyze the existing historical estimates. It is important to discover

whether there is reason to believe that the existing GNP data do not measure

short-term cyclical fluctuations correctly. In this section I describe the

methods that Kuznets uses to estimate real prewar GNP. I also discuss briefly

the revisions of Kuznets's estimates suggested by Galiman and Kendrick.

     Kuznets provides estimates of gross national product and its components for

1869-1938. For the most part his estimates after 1928 have been superseded by

independent estimates by the Department of Conmierce. For the period before 1928

Kuznets derives several versions of GNP estimates and uses different methods for

various subperiods.

     For the period after 1919, the Kuznets estimates are derived using the

income-payments approach. These estimates are described and presented in

Kuznets's book National Income and its Components 1919-1938 (1941). While the

accuracy of the GNP data after 1919 has not been thoroughly established, there

is reason to believe that this series is relatively accurate. For the period

after 1919 Kuznets has ample income data for most sectors and uses methods very

similar to those used by the Commerce Department after 1929. Therefore, it is
                                       -6-




likely that the Kuznets data for 1919-1928 are not substantially worse than the

Commerce Department data after 1929.

     For the period 1869-1918 Kuznets does not have the income data necessary to

derive income-side estimates of GNP. As a result, he must use different methods

to construct data for this period. Kuznets actually forms two annual series for

1869-1918 which he identifies as the components series and the regression

series. Both these series are derived by what can best be described as the

product-side approach. Both use data on commodity output to estimate GNP. The

two series differ in how they convert this base data into estimates of GNP and

at how fine a level of disaggregation the conversion is made.

     The pre-1918 series are described in two sources. National Product since

1869 (1946) describes the derivation of decadal averages of GNP. These decadal

averages form the long-term trend for both the components series and the regres-

sion series. The annual components and regression series are described in

Capital in the American Economy (1961). Only some of the actual data are

published. The components series for 1869-1918 is only published in five-year

moving average form. The annual regression series is published in Capital in

the American Economy only for the period 1889-1918.

     Because the GNP estimates before 1918 are based on much less data than are

the later estimates and are derived using methods that are quite different from

those used after 1919, it is reasonable to be more suspicious of the earlier

estimates than of the later series. For this reason, this study focuses on the

quality of the GNP data before 1918. It analyzes both the components series and

the regression series for the period 1869-1918 to see if Kuznets's methods may

have yielded GNP estimates that misrepresent cyclical movements.
                                       —7—




1. Components Series

     The Kuznets components series for 1869-1918 is by far the more important of

the two series to analyze. It is the one that is most cosinonly used in modern

econometric analyses. This fact may seem odd given that it has only been

published by Kuznets in moving-average form. The reason for its widespread use

is that it forms the basis of the widely used Kendrick estimates of GNP (see

Kendrick, 1961). Kendrick adjusts the Kuznets components series for 1889-1918

to be conceptually similar to the post-1929 Department of Couunerce series.

While Kendrick's adjustments are quite important for classifying aggregate GNP

into its various components and for determining the level of output in wartime,

his correction factors do not change the cyclical properties of Kuznets's

components series. This fact can be seen by comparing the cyclical movements in

the Kendrick GNP series to those in the Kuznets components series. This compar-

ison shows that cyclical movements are very similar in the two series.1

     The same is true of other modifications of Kuznets's series. Friedman and

Schwartz present estimates of real net national product back to 1869 in their book

Monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom (1982). This series

is a combination of the Kuznets components series and revisions to some individ-

ual components of GNP prepared by Robert Gallman (see Gallman, 1966). While the

trend of this series is quite different from that of the Kuznets components

series, the cyclical movements are nearly identical.2 Gallman's revisions are

primarily revisions of decada]. averages, not of annual movements. Again,

therefore, the accuracy of the representation of cyclical movements in the

Kuznets components series is the key determinant of the accuracy of the cyclical

properties of this important revision of Kuznets's data.

     The base data underlying the Kuznets components series come from a study by

William H. Shaw entitled Value of Conodity Output since 1869 (1947). Shaw uses
                                       -8-




data from the Census of Manufactures to derive comprehensive benchmark estimates

of commodity output for various census years starting in 1869. He then forms

annual estimates of commodity output for 1889-1938 by interpolating between

benchmark observations by various annual series. The annual data come from a

plethora of state reports and industry publications. Shaw presents commodity

output data for a variety of major and minor subgroups valued in current and in

1913 prices.

    Kuznets extends the annual Shaw series on commodity output to cover the

earlier period 1869-1888. He uses annual series similar to those used by Shaw

to interpolate between Shaw's census year benchmarks for 1869, 1879, and 1889.

Kuznets also transforms Shaw's data on real commodity output to correspond to a

1929 base year rather than a 1913 base year. While Kuznets's contribution to

the derivation of the basic commodity output data is substantial, in what

follows I refer to the Shaw/Kuznets series on real finished commodity output

simply as the Shaw series. I do this primarily to distinguish the commodity
                                        3
output data from the Kuznets GNP series.

     It is important to be very clear about what the Shaw series does and does

not cover. The Shaw series appears to be a very good compilation of data on the

value of finished commodity output. This series provides a good measure of the

gross value of finished commodity output valued at producer prices. However,

this series does not include the value added to a good after it reaches its

final physical state. Because goods are valued at producer prices, the value

added associated with transportation and distribution is excluded. Furthermore,

this series also excludes many components of GNP not represented by commodity

output such as the flow of services to consumers and the value of new

construction.
                                       -9-




     Kuznets's derivation of the components GNP series centers on converting the

commodity output data into estimates of GNP. In this transformation Kuznets

uses very little data other than the Shaw series. For the components series

Kuznets makes the transformation from commodity output to GNP at a fairly

disaggregate level. He derives estimates of the flow of goods to consumers and

gross capital formation. For the flow of goods to consumers he estimates the

flow of four categories of goods: perishables, semidurables, durables, and

services. For gross capital formation he estimates construction, the flow of

producer durables, the change in total inventories, and the change in net claims

held by foreigners. For all the components of GNP Kuznets first derives esti-

mates of real quantities and then converts them to nominal estimates by means of

a price index for that component. For this reason, I only discuss the proce-

dures he uses to derive estimates of real GNP.4

     Though he is working at a disaggregate level, Kuznets's methods are quite

similar for three categories. For the flow of perishable, semidurable and

durable goods, Kuznets's problem is to convert the Shaw series on commodity

output valued in 1929 producer prices to the value of the flow of goods to

consumers at the cost to them in 1929 dollars. To do this, Kuznets begins by

taking the ratio of the average- flow of a category of goods to consumers to

average commodity output in that category for overlapping decades. He then

forms a series of the linear trend of this ratio.    For the most part, the

decadal averages of the flow of goods to consumers are formed by scaling up the

decadal averages of commodity output. The scale factors are determined by an

analysis of the trends in distributive margins and transportation charges. This

analysis is described in National Product Since 1869.

    To form the annual series on the flow of a category of goods to consumers

in 1929 prices, Kuznets multiplies the trend ratio of the flow of goods to
                                      -10-



consumers to commodity output in a given category by commodity output in that

category. The key assumption used in the derivation of the annual series is

that the relationship between the flow of goods to consumers and commodity

output does not vary over the cycle. This is the same as assuming that the

components of the flow of goods to consumers not included in commodity output

valued in producer prices, primarily the value added in transportation and

distribution, move one-for-one with commodity output.

     Kuznets's methods for other sectors use similar assumptions. Estimates of

the flow of gross producer durables and total construction form the main compo-

nents of Kuznets's series on capital formation. Both these series are estimated

in ways completely analogous to those for the flow of goods to consumers. For

producer durables, the Shaw series on the output of producer durables at produc-

er prices is multiplied by the trend ratio of the flow of producer durables to

ultimate users to commodity output. For construction, Kuznets forms the trend

ratio of construction output to the output of construction materials by linearly

interpolating between decadal averages. This trend ratio is then multiplied by

the annual Shaw series on the output of construction materials in 1929 prices to

form an annual series on total construction output. Again, the key assumption

used by Kuznets is that the relationship between commodity output at producer

prices and total product does not vary over the cycle.

     Whereas for most pieces of GNP Kuznets uses simple linear interpolation by

commodity output, he uses a different method for measuring components of GNP not

directly involving commodities such as the flow of services to consumers or the

net change in inventories.   For these series he estimates the actual sensitiv-

ity of the component in question to commodity output or to the flow of goods to

consumers in a period for which he has good data on both items. He then uses
                                      —11—




the estimated sensitivity to transform pre-1918 data on commodity output or

consumption into estimates of the needed components.

     Kuznets's method for estimating the flow of services provides an example of

this procedure. Kuznets has reasonably good data on the flow of both goods and

services to consumers for 1919-1941. He calculates the trend level of the two

series for this period by connecting overlapping decadal averages. He then

regresses the deviation of the flow of services from trend on the deviation of

the flow of commodities to consumers from trend. The parameter estimates are

then used to create fitted values for 1869-1918 where independent estimates of

services do not exist. In creating the fitted values, Kuznets uses his pre-1918

estimates of the flow of goods to consumers. As discussed before, these esti-

mates are themselves created using only a very simple filter of commodity output

valued in producer prices.

     There are two possible problems with this procedure. The first is that the

sensitivity estimate that is used to convert data on consumer expenditures on

goods into estimates of consumer expenditures on services is much higher than

expected. While the coefficient that Kuznets uses is substantially less than

one, it is much larger than the sensitivity estimate for other sample periods.

For example, in the postwar era the relationship between consumer expenditures

on goods and consumer expenditures on services is actually negative.5 As a

result, the Kuznets prewar estimates of the flow of services may move too much

over the cycle.

     A second problem is that Kuznets's procedure involves estimating the

relationship between true data on consumer expenditures on services and true

data on consumer expenditures on goods in the interwar era. He then uses the

sensitivity estimate to form prewar estimates of services. The possible flaw in

this procedure is that the base data on the flow of goods to consumers may not
                                      -12-




be uniformly good between the pre-1918 era and the 1919-1941 period. From the

description of the methods used to form the pre-1918 consumption estimates it is

clear that these estimates may be excessively volatile because they are formed

using the assumption that the flow of goods to consumers moves one-for-one with

commodity output. If this is true, then using the coefficient based on accurate

consumption data will pass on too much of the movement in the flawed data on the

flow of goods to consumers to the estimates of the flow of services. The

resulting estimates of the flow of services to consumers could thus be exces-

sively volatile.



2. Regression Series

     The second GNP series that Kuznets creates for the period 1869-1918 is

called the regression series. The regression series is derived by estimating

the aggregate relationship between real commodity output and real GNP for the

period 1909-1938. This relationship is then used to convert Shaw's pre-1918

data on commodity output into estimates of GNP. This method attempts to take

into account at the aggregate level the fact that GNP does not vary as much over

the cycle as does commodity output valued in producer prices.

     The actual derivation of the regression series is not complicated. Kuznets

first forms estimates of trend GNP and trend commodity output. To do this he

calculates averages for overlapping decades and uses these to represent trend

GNP or commodity output for the midpoint of the decade. Annual trend values are

derived by linear interpolation between these midpoints.6 GNP and commodity

output for 1909-1938 are then expressed as percentage deviations from trend.

Kuznets then fits "a freehand regression curve" to a scatter plot of the devia-

tions of real commodity output and real GNP from trend (Kuznets, 1961, p. 537).

This curve is used to form fitted values for the pre-1918 era.
                                      —13—




    Though Kuznets asserts that the regression curve cannot be expressed as a

simple mathematical function, it is actually very close to a simple linear

regression. One can replicate Kuznets's pre-1918 regression series very accu-

rately using the results of a simple linear regression of the percentage devia-

tions of GNP from trend on the percentage deviations of the Shaw series on total

commodity output from trend and a constant. The actual parameter estimates are:


                       gnp = -0.001 + 0.896 co +
                             (0.005)  (0.046)




where small letters denote percentage deviations from trend.7 The fitted values

from applying this relationship to the pre-1918 era differ from Kuznets's

regression estimates usually by less than one-half of one percent and only for

two years by more than one percent.

     From this representation of the derivation of the regression series it is

clear that it has much in common with the components series. Though the two GNP

series are derived at very different levels of aggregation and using somewhat

different assumptions, both series suggest that the cyclical movements in GNP

move very closely with those in commodity output. The components series for the

most part assumes that GNP moves one-for-one with commodity output. The regres-

sion series uses the estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity output over the

period 1909-1938 to estimate GNP for 1869-1918. The assumption derived from

this procedure is that cyclical movements in GNP are 90 percent as large as

those in commodity output.

     While the basic procedures underlying the components and regression series

 are quite similar, there are obvious differences between the two series. The

 regression series is derived at a much more aggregate level than is the compo-

 nents series. Also, the regression methodology removes the random movements in
                                         -14-



GNP   that   are not perfectly correlated with commodity output. Finally, the

regression series is derived using the assunption that the deviations from trend

of GNP move 0.9-for-one with the deviations of
                                                  commodity output from trend
rather than one-for-one as is assumed in the derivation of the components

series. The comparison of volatility properties of the two series given in

Section IV shows that the effect of these differences
                                                        is exactly what one would
predict. The regression series is consistently less volatile than the compo-

nents series. However, the magnitude of the difference in volatility is small

and the prewar regression series is still substantially more volatile than the

actual postwar GNP series.

                                  SECTION II



                EXCESS VOLATILITY IN TUE KIJZNETS GNP ESTIMATES




     The description of the Kuznets components and regression estimates of GNP

points out a key similarity between the two series:   both data sets are derived

by postulating that the deviations of GNP from trend move very closely with the

deviations of commodity output from trend. This section analyzes the accuracy

of this key assumption underlying both Kuznets GNP series for 1869-1918.



1. Possible Sources of Excess Volatility

     At an abstract level there is reason to suspect that both of Kuznets's

procedures yield estimates of GNP that overstate the size of cyclical movements.

The key problem is that commodity output represents a very cyclically sensitive

portion of GNP. Data on commodity output valued at producer prices do not

include the pieces of GNP that are typically considered to be the less cyclical-

ly sensitive components of total national output such as trade, transportation,

and services. As a result, assuming that the total GNP has cyclical movements

 identical (or nearly so) to those in commodity output yields a GNP series that

 overstates the size of cyclical fluctuations.

      That commodity output is an unrepresentative fraction of GNP is for the

 most part a simple empirical regularity in postwar data. However, this regular-

 ity is plausible at a theoretical level. First, in the case of consumer
                                        -16-



 expenditures on services it is likely that the demand
                                                          for many services is
 invariant to the state of the cycle. Except under
                                                      extreme circumstances one
 would not expect expenditures on haircuts or physicians' services to fluctuate

 dramatically. The same is not true of expenditures on commodities (especially

 durable goods) where demand may not have a strong time-specific character.

 Hence, one would not expect expenditures on services to vary closely with

 commodity output.

      Fixed costs may provide an explanation of why the trade and transportation

 component of consumer expenditures on goods does not move one-for-one with

 commodity output valued at producer prices. It is certainly possible that fixed

 costs for trade and transportation firms are
                                                relatively larger compared to
variable costs than they are for manufacturing firms. This could be due, for

example, to the fact that retail firms are
                                             typically quite small. As a result,

overhead expenses may be very large relative to labor costs.

     If this is true, then one would expect the value added in transportation

and distribution to be less cyclically volatile
                                                  than commodity output. In a
cyclical downturn, a retail distributor or a transportation firm may be unable

to cut costs proportionately with the decline in volume simply because variable

cost is a small fraction of total cost. In this case, the distributive margin

on each good will rise. As a result, the final gross value to consumers of the

commodity in question will not have fallen by as much as the value of the

commodity to producers. Hence consumer expenditures on commodities will tend to

be less cyclically volatile than commodity output valued at producer prices.



2. Evidence of Excess Volatility

    While it is easy to construct stories about why GNP should not move

one-for-one with commodity output valued at producer prices, such stories do not
                                     —17—



provide evidence that both the Kuznets GNP series are in fact excessively

volatile. However, estimates of the actual sensitivity of the deviations of GNP

from trend to the deviations of commodity output from trend from periods where

good data are available on both quantities does suggest that Kuznets's assump-

tions of a one-to-one relationship or a .9-to-one relationship are erroneous.

     To examine the validity of Kuznets's assumptions I regress the deviations

of aggregate GNP from trend on the deviations of aggregate commodity output from

trend for various time periods. That is, I estimate the equation



           (1)




where gnP is the logarithm of aggregate real gross national product, co is the

logarithm of aggregate real commodity output, and bars over a variable denote

trend values. As is discussed in detail in Section III, trend values are

calculated using piecewise linear trends between years that are identified as

times of full employment (rather than times of exceptionally low unemployment).

This method yields estimates of trend values that correspond to normal output,

not to peak or potential output.

     The earliest time period that can be examined begins in 1909. For
                                                                   8
 1909-1918 Kuznets provides very rough income-side estimates of GNP.   While the

estimates surely have a great deal of random measurement error, they should be

 free of the cyclical exaggeration present in the product-side estimates. Hence,

 they should provide a consistent estimate of the sensitivity of cyclical move-

ments in GNP to the cyclical movements in commodity output.

      The relationship between GNP and commodity output can be examined in the

 postwar era as well. Data on commodity output valued at producer prices are

 available from the Federal Reserve Board in the series titled the gross value of
                                         -18-




 final products.9 Since this series is only available after 1954, I also examine

the relationship between GNP and the FRB value-added index of final goods

production over the entire postwar era. The similarity in the results using

both the gross value and value-added series for the same sample period suggests

that this approximation is very close.

     The coefficient estimates from the regression of the cyclical movements in

GNP on the cyclical movements in commodity output for various time periods are

shown in Table 1. For most sample periods over the interval 1909-1983 the

coefficient estimate is substantially below 0.9 or 1. It generally ranges

between 0.6 and 0.7. The coefficient estimates for the postwar era are somewhat

smaller than those for the interwar era.

     The one exception to this pattern involves any sample period that includes

the Great Depression. When the 1930s are included in any regression, even a

pooled sample covering both the interwar and postwar eras, the coefficient

estimate is approximately 0.9 or higher. This result explains why Kuznets in

deriving his regression estimates of GNP found that GNP and commodity output had

very similar cyclical properties. He specifically estimated the relationship

between the two series over a period that was dominated by the Great Depression.

     There can be little doubt that the results from the Depression are anoma-

lous. For no other sample period is the coefficient estimate anywhere near as

high. As Table 1 shows, the relationship between GNP and commodity output is

very stable in periods outside the Depression. In both the periods 1909-1918

and 1919-1928 the coefficient estimate is approximately 0.65. In contrast, the

coefficient estimate for 1929-1938 is 0.97. These results are completely robust

to minor changes in the definition of decades.

     That the Great Depression should show a much higher sensitivity of move-

ments in GNP to movements in commodity output than do other periods is not

surprising. Most theories of consumer and producer behavior suggest that agents

will respond much differently to a particularly long and severe depression than

they will to a recession that is expected to be mild or brief. For example,

while consumers will typically smooth their expenditures on services, in a very

severe depression they are likely to reduce those expenditures. This could be

due to revisions in estimates of permanent income or to increasingly binding

liquidity constraints. Similarly, while distributive margins typically rise in

a recession, they may actually fall in a long and severe depression. This could

be caused by bankruptcies among transportation and retail establishments that

allow remaining firms to have sufficient volume to cover fixed costs. Both of

these responses to severe economic decline can explain why GNP moves much more

closely with commodity output during the 1930s than during any other period.

     The fact that the sensitivity of movements in GNP to movements in commodi-

ty output for most sample periods excluding the Great Depression is substantial-

ly below that assumed by Kuznets suggests that both the Kuznets components and

regression series are excessively volatile. This is especially true given how

anomalous the decline of the 1930s is in comparison to the economic fluctuations

of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Judging from the cyclical behavior of

commodity output, the percentage decline in production during the Great Depres-

sion was nearly three times as large as the percentage decline in the worst

depression of the 1869—1918 period)0 Hence it is much more reasonable to

believe that the relationship between GNP and commodity output is more like that

exhibited in both the interwar and postwar eras than during the 1930s. In this

case, GNP would be far less volatile than the Kuznets estimates suggest.



3. The Decline in the Ratio of Commodity Output to GNP

    While the available evidence suggests that the Kuznets series are
                                      -20-




excessively volatile, conclusive proof is impossible to find. Most importantly

one must worry that GNP moved more closely over the cycle in the period

1869-1918 than it did in the interwar and postwar eras. It is possible that

structural changes in the economy caused the sensitivity of GNP to commodity

output to have been larger in the prewar era than in the postwar era. If this

is true, then Kuznets's estimates of prewar GNP may not overstate cycles as much

as the previous evidence suggests.

     The prime structural change that might have caused the relationship between

GNP and commodity output to change over time is the relative decline in the

commodity sector of the economy. If commodity output represented a larger

fraction of GNP in the pre-1918 period than in later periods, then it is possi-

ble that GNP should move more closely with commodity output in the earlier

period than it does today.

     Two observations on the decline of the commodity sector suggest that this

change is not a major cause for concern. The first is that the decline in the

size of the commodity sector is a modern occurrence. Furthermore, the decline

in the size of the commodity sector within the modern period has been quite

small. The second observation is that the change in the relative size of the

commodity sector between the interwar and postwar eras has little effect on the

sensitivity of cyclical fluctuations in GNP to fluctuations in commodity output.

     Evidence on the changing share of commodity output in GNP is of differing

quality. For the period after 1909 we possess independent estimates of both

real GNP and real commodity output valued in producer prices. Hence one can

simply examine the ratio of these two series. The ratio of commodity output to

GNP in selected years beginning in 1910 is given in Table 2. The years shown

are the same benchmark years used to construct the piecewise linear trends

discussed earlier. The ratio shows a definite downward trend over time in the
                        TABLE 2

share of commodity output in GNP. However, it is crucial to observe that the

magnitude of the decline is quite small. Over the period 1909-1983 the ratio

only fell from approximately 0.46 to 0.35. This suggests that even if this same

downward trend were present from 1869 on, the ratio of commodity output to GNP in

the prewar era would not be dramatically larger than it is in the postwar era.

     Fragments of prewar evidence suggest that the decline in the ratio of

commodity output to GNP in the pre-1918 era was less pronounced than the modern

behavior of this ratio suggests. In deriving the components series on GNP,

Kuznets assumed that the ratio of commodity output to GNP in various sectors

from 1869-1918 was the same as the ratio of the two quantities over the period

1919-1928. Kuznets based this assumption on the behavior of the shares of total

income accruing to workers in the transportation and distribution sectors in

census years in the prewar era. He felt that while the income studies showed "a

mild downward trend" in the ratio of commodity output to GNP, the trend was both

slight enough and variable enough that it was best to assume that the ratio of

commodity output to GNP was essentially flat over the period 1869-1929 (Kuznets,

1946, p. 67).

     A study by Harold Barger on the role of distribution in the American

economy confirms Kuzuets's belief to a large degree. Barger finds that as the

cost of distribution rose slowly, the cost of transpQrting goods from producers

to distributors fell steadily. As a result, "the ratio of distribution cost

plus freight charges to producers' value scarcely rose at all" between the Civil

War and the Great Depression (Barger, 1955, p. 63). Barger does suggest that

there may nevertheless have been a slight fall in the ratio of commodity output

to GNP over time simply because more goods began to enter the distribution

process rather than remain on the farm or within the household (Barger, 1955,
                                      -22-




p.64). However the implied change in the ratio of real commodity output valued

in producer prices to real GNP between 1869 and 1929 is still very small.

     The Barger and Kuznets results are important because they suggest that

there is little reason to suspect that the relationship between GNP and commodi-

ty output changed significantly between the prewar and interwar eras. Since the

ratio of commodity output to GNP declined only very slightly (if at all) between

these two periods, it is hard to believe that the sensitivity of GNP to commodi-

ty output was much different between the two periods.

     One further piece of evidence on the excess volatility of the Kuznets GNP

series is the effect of changes in the ratio of commodity output to GNP on the

sensitivity of cyclical movements in GNP to movements in commodity output. As

mentioned earlier, the ratio of commodity output to GNP fell somewhat between

1909-1983. The coefficient estimates shown in Table 1 suggest,. however, that

this fall did not cause dramatic changes in the measured sensitivity of GNP to

commodity output. For example, the coefficient estimate for 1909-1918 is 0.66

while the estimate for 1973-1983 is 0.59. This implies that even if the ratio

of commodity output to GNP were noticeably larger in the prewar era than it is

in the interwar and postwar eras, the estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity

output would be substantially lower than 0.9 or 1. Hence, Kuznets's GNP esti-

mates would still be excessively volatile.

                                   SECTION III



                 NEW ESTIMATES OF PREWAR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT




     The preceding descriptions and analysis of the two Kuznets series suggest

that the existing estimates of prewar GNP do not measure cycles correctly.

Rather, both the Kuznets components and regression series exaggerate the size of

cyclical fluctuations in the period 1869-1918. Given that there are problems

with the Kuznets estimates, it is only natural to attempt to create better

estimates of prewar GNP. Since none of the analysis has challenged the accuracy

of the trend values of GNP, the derivation of new estimates presented in this

section will concentrate on improving only the representation of cyclical

movements.



1. Overview of Methods

     In deriving new estimates of prewar GNP the most obvious problem is a lack

of data. Obviously, modern researchers are forced to estimate prewar GNP

precisely because we do not have data on many of the components of total output.

Kuznets is quite convincing that we possess little data on the components of GNP

other than comprehensive figures on the value of commodity output in producer

prices. Data on distributive margins, the change in inventories, and consumer

expenditures on services are very scarce and subject to exceedingly large

margins of error. While it is possible that new and extensive research could
                                      -24-



provide adequate direct estimates of these components of GNP, for now it is

necessary to assume that the main information we possess about movements in GNP

is provided by the available data on commodity output.

     Given the limitations on data, it is thus sensible to view the creation of

new estimates of GNP as finding the best method for transforming data on commod-

Ity output into estimates of GNP. If one views the problem this way, it is

clear that one should use some sort of regression technique. Simply imposing a

one-to-one relationship between the two series will not yield the best estimates

of GNP. As Friedman shows in his article on linear interpolation, using some

estimate of the relationship between the series to be created and the interpo-

lating series (perhaps derived from a fragment of data or from a different

sample period) will, in most circumstances, yield a more accurate series than

simply imposing a one-to-one relationship (Friedman, 1962).

     The method that I use to derive new estimates of prewar GNP corresponds

very closely to Kuznets's aggregate regression technique. I assume that the

deviations of aggregate real GNP from trend are correlated with the deviations

of aggregate real commodity output from trend. The actual sensitivity of

cyclical movements in GNP to cyclical movements in commodity output is estimated

from a sample period that includes both the interwar and postwar eras, but

excludes the Great Depression.

     The main improvement that I make in Kuznets's procedure is to allow the

measured sensitivity of aggregate GNP to aggregate commodity output to change

over time. As shown in Section II, there is some evidence that aggregate GNP is

less sensitive to movements in aggregate commodity output in the postwar era

than in the interwar era. This is probably due to the modest decline that has

occurred in the ratio of commodity output to GNP. Since the same trend may

extend to the pre-1918 period as well, it is useful to allow the estimated
                                      -25-




sensitivity to decline over time as well.11 By doing so, one can derive an

estimate of the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output for the period 1869-1918

that represents this time period more accurately.

     The decision to create a new aggregate regression series is a choice that

should be defended. The obvious alternative procedure is to employ regression

techniques at a disaggregate level. For example, one could estimate the rela-

tionship between GNP and commodity output for each sector and use these rela-

tionships to create new prewar GNP data. The obvious benefit of this approach

is that it allows the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output to vary across

sectors. Furthermore, to the extent that the relative size of sectors changes

over time, it allows the aggregate sensitivity of GNP to commodity output to

vary over time as well.

     The main reason that I choose not to follow the disaggregate approach is

that by using a time-varying sensitivity estimate, the aggregate regression

methodology preserves the main benefit of the disaggregate approach. The key

argument in favor of the disaggregate approach is that it allows GNP to move

more closely with commodity output in the pre-1918 era when the noncommodity

components of GNP were slightly smaller. The modified aggregate regression

approach that I employ also allows the estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity

output to be higher in the prewar era. However, it does so in a way that is

much more straightforward and much less time consuming than does the

disaggregate approach.



2. Specifics of the Deviation

     The basic procedure that I use to create new GNP data is thus

straightforward. In some period when I have good aggregate data on both GNP and

commodity output I estimate the relationship between the deviations from trend
                                       -28-



      The choice of sample period is also influenced by the sensitivity analysis

 of Section II. The regressions reported in Table 1 show that the relationship

between GNP and commodity output during the Great Depression was much different

than the relationship during any other time period. Since the Great Depression

appears to be a downturn of unprecedented magnitude, it is best not to let the

experience of the 1930s determine the relationship between GNP and commodity

output in the prewar era. Hence, I exclude the Great Depression from the sample

period over which I estimate equation (2).

     Trend Values. The calculation of trend values for GNP and commodity output

is a third complicating factor in the derivation of new estimates of GNP. To

estimate equation (2) and form new estimates of GNP for 1869-1918, one must

specify trend values for both GNP and commodity output for the entire period

1869-1983. The methods that can be used are limited by the fact that the

procedures for forming trend values must be applicable to the pre-1918 period

for which we do not possess estimates of GNP that represent cycles accurately.

The method I use for calculating trend values involves interpolating
                                                                       linearly
between benchmark estimates of the logarithms of GNP and commodity output.

Since the benchmark values chosen are generally only 8 to 12 years apart, this

method allows the trend of each series to change frequently over the period in

question.

     In using piecewise—linear trends, the key step is deciding which years to

use as benchmarks. Often, researchers choose to connect peak years and thus

form an estimate of potential rather than trend GNP or commodity output (see,

for example, Gordon, 1982). For this study, I specifically choose years that

correspond only to trend output or unemployment at the natural rate rather than

to peak output. This was a necessary change because the existing Kuznets

estimates of prewar GNP accentuate the size of cyclical fluctuations. As a
                                      -29—




result, the only years for which the pre-1918 GNP estimates are accurate are

years when the economy is neither below or above trend.

     Deciding during which years the economy was on trend involves an admittedly

arbitrary and imperfect procedure. In choosing benchmark dates I use a mixture

of examining a plot of the data in logarithms and a qualitative knowledge of

which prewar and postwar years are typically considered to correspond to periods

of boom and recession. From the plot of the data I try to choose years that

correspond to points of mid-expansion in the business cycle. For the postwar

era I also use data on the unemployment rate to confirm that the years chosen do

correspond to conventional estimates of full, rather than over-full, employment.

     The actual years chosen as benchmark estimates for both GNP and commodity

output are: 1869, 1874, 1884, 1891, 1902, 1910, 1918, 1924, 1937, 1947, 1955,

1962, 1972 and 1981.13 Figures 1 and 2 show the resulting trend values of GNP

and commodity output and the existing underlying actual data. From these

graphs, it should be clear that the years chosen as benchmarks do correspond

reasonably well to points of mid-expansion in the cycle.14 Another fact that

should be apparent from Figures 1 and 2 is that even relatively large changes in

the choice of benchmark years would not alter the trend values substantially.15

     Data. The final issue to consider in deriving new estimates of prewar GNP

involves which data to use. For estimating the relationship between GNP and

commodity output in the interwar and postwar eras, the choice of data is fairly

obvious. For real GNP the Kuznets income-side estimates are used for 1909-1928.

The Commerce Department GNP series is used for 1955-1983. For real commodity

output, the Shaw series is used for 1909-1928. The Federal Reserve Board series

on the gross value of final products (amended to include the gross value of

 construction materials) is used for 1955-1983. All data are expressed in terms

 of constant dollars.

         Notes and Sources: For 1869—1938 the Shaw/Kuznets series on commodity output
         in 1929 prices is used. This series is published in Capital in the American
         Economy (1961, Table R—2l, pp. 553—554). For 1954—1983 the Federal Reserve
         Board series on the gross value of final products is used. I amend this series
         to include the gross value of construction supplies. The gross value data for
         1954—1967 (on a 1963 base) are available in Industrial Production, 1971 edition.
         The data for 1967—1975 (on a 1972 base) are available in Industrial Production,
         1976 edition. The data for 1976—1983 are available from monthly Federal Reserve
         Board releases. The 1963 and 1972 base year series are combined using a ratio
         splice based in 1967. Trend values are calculated using the procedures
         described in the text.

     In forming new estimates of prewar GNP, the choice of data is less

straightforward. For commodity output the Shaw series is the obvious series to

use. However, for calculating trend GNP there are some alternatives. One can

either use the original Kuznets series or one of the revisions of this series to

derive benchmark estimates.    I choose to use Gailman's amended version of the

Kuznets components series.    I do this because the Galiman series appears to

correct some of the suspected anomalies in the trend of the Kuznets series)6

Again, both commodity output and GNP are expressed in constant (1929) dollars.



3. Results

     Parameter Estimates. The ultimate result of following the procedures

described is the derivation of new estimates of real GNP for 1869-1918. An

important intermediate step is the estimation of the time-varying relationship

between the deviations from trend of aggregate real GNP and aggregate real

commodity output. When equation (2) is estimated over the period 1909-1928 and

1955-1983 the parameter estimates are:



          (2)        nP -           = (.667   -                       -
                                      (.094)
                                                    .OO25.trend)(co
                                                  (.0020)
                                                                          cot)
                     S.E. = 0.017


where standard errors are in parentheses.'7

     The coefficient estimates are perfectly sensible. They suggest that the

deviations from trend of GNP are substantially smaller than those of commodity

output and that the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output has declined over

time. However, the change in the coefficient over time is reasonably small.

According to the estimates, the time-varying coefficient measuring the sensitiv-

ity of GNP to commodity output fell from 0.664 in 1909 to 0.483 in 1983.
                                      —31-




      The presence of a nontrivial trend in the coefficient implies that the

coefficient one should use in converting prewar data on commodity output into

estimates of GNP is bigger than any of the coefficients one finds using an

interwar or postwar sample. Indeed, projecting the simple linear trend back in

time, the coefficient ranges between 0.763 in 1869 and 0.642 in 1918. By using

these time-varying estimates of the coefficient, one is able to capture the very

plausible decline in the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output.

      New Estimates of Prewar GNP. The new estimates of prewar gross national

product that result from following the procedures described are given in Table

3. The new estimates cover the period 1869-1918 and represent real GNP in

constant (1929) dollars. I create new estimates of GNP for 1909-1918 despite

the fact that rough income-side estimates of GNP are available for this decade.

I do this because the data for the 1910s have sufficient measurement error that

using the new methods is likely to provide point estimates of GNP that are more

accurate than the original series. The best evidence for this proposition is

that Kuznets also chose to use his regression procedure to create estimates of

GNP for 1909-1918 rather than use the income-side series.

      The new estimates of prewar GNP are graphed in Figure 3. For comparison,

the Kuznets/Gallman components series is also presented in Figure 3. Two

characteristics of the new series are apparent from the figure. The first is

that the new estimates of prewar GNP are identical to the Kuznets/Gallman

estimates in benchmark years. This is to be expected given the procedures used

to derive the new series. The second is that cyclical movements in the new

series are noticeably smaller than cyclical movements in the Kuznets/Gallman

series. This difference between the two series is analyzed in detail in Section

Iv.

        For anyone interested in using the new estimates, certain facts are

relevant. One is that the current estimates are in constant dollars. A nominal

series can be formed by multiplying the new estimates by the Kuznets implicit

price deflator series given in Friedman and Schwartz (1982, pp. 122-129).

Another is that the new GNP series is designed to be consistent with the origi-

nal Kuznets series after 1918. While the new estimates incorporate Galiman's

revisions to the trend of the Kuznets series before 1909, they are consistent

with the Kuznets data for the 1920s and 1930s. Thus, the new series can easily

be extended through 1938 using the Kuznets estimates of GNP in 1929 dollars

(Variant III) given in Capital in the American Economy (1961, Table R-2, p.

487).

        While the new estimates are consistent with the Kuznets series after 1918,

they are not consistent with the modern Department of Commerce estimates. In

the derivation of the new estimates I abstract from the work of Kendrick and the

Department of Commerce that amends the Kuznets data to fit modern Department of

Commerce procedures. I do this for two reasons. The main one is that the

amended base data using Commerce Department concepts begin in 1889. Since the

goal to this paper is to form new data back to 1869, following Kendrick would

have required a tremendous amount of research before one could even begin to

analyze problems with cyclical representations. While the derivation of

Kendrick-like corrections for 1869-1888 is certainly a useful endeavor, it was

clearly out of the range of this study.

        The second reason is that for cyclical analyses, the Kendrick/Commerce

Department corrections are of essentially no importance. These corrections

primarily involve the treatment of military expenditures. They also involve

separating government expenditures into a separate category rather than includ-

ing them in the flow of goods to consumers and capital formation categories as
                                      -33-



Kuznets does. There is nothing in the corrections that significantly changes

the cyclical properties of the underlying Kuznets components series. As a

result, they can be ignored for the purpose of deriving new GNP estimates that

measure cycles more accurately.

                                   SECTION IV



                   VOLATILITY PROPERTIES OF THE NEW GNP SERIES




     Having derived new estimates of GNP, it is natural to ask how these esti-

mates change one's perception of the prewar economy. Since the new estimates

are designed to measure short-term cyclical fluctuations more accurately than do

the original Kuznets estimates, the most interesting application is to analyze

the business cycle properties of the new GNP data. This section considers the

basic volatility properties of the prewar GNP series. Various measures of the

severity of cycles are used to compare Kuznets's GNP estimates, my new esti-

mates, and postwar data on actual GNP.

     The cyclical properties of the Kuznets components series are analyzed in

detail in existing studies. Several studies use the existing prewar GNP data to

argue that business cycles are more severe and the economy is in general more

volatile in the prewar era. This is certainly the case in two recent articles,

one by Martin Neil Baily (1978) and one by J. Bradford DeLong and Lawrence

Summers (1984). While neither of these studies uses Kuznets's data directly,

both use amended versions of prewar GNP data that derive their cyclical move-

ments from the Kuznets components series.18

     Both of these studies conclude that there has indeed been a dramatic

stabilization of the postwar economy. Even when the Great Depression is exclud-

ed, cyclical fluctuations in prewar GNP are nearly twice as large as
                                          -35-



  fluctuations in postwar GNP. However, the
                                                 discussion in Sections I and II
  should make one skeptical of these results. That discussion shows that
                                                                         there is
  reason to believe that both the Kuznets
                                            components series and the regression

 series exaggerate cyclical movements in GNP. Given that the new estimates of

 GNP are derived in such a way that they should represent cyclical movements
                                                                             more
 accurately, it is interesting to see if these estimates also show that cycles

 were more severe in the prewar era.



 1. Measures of Volatility

      Table 4 shows three common
                                   measures of volatility for the various GNP
 series. I analyze the Kuznets/Gallman
                                          components series and the Kuznets regres-
 sion series on real GNP,
                            my new prewar estimates of real GNP, and the standard
 Commerce Department series on postwar GNP in 1972 dollars. For the three
                                                                          prewar
 series I examine the volatility
                                 properties over the period 1869-1918. For the
postwar series I use the sample period 1947-1983.

     The first measure to consider is the
                                             mean cyclical amplitude of the
detrended GNP series. This is obviously a measure of the severity of cycles in

the two periods. The various GNP series are detrended using the piecewise

linear trends discussed in Section III.
                                            Peaks and troughs are defined by the
actual turning points in detrended commodity output.'9 Peaks and troughs

defined this way are somewhat different from NEER reference dates which are

derived using undetrended data.2°    Cycles with declines in GNP of less than two
percent are excluded from calculations of the
                                                  mean. The results, however, are
very similar when only cycles of less than one percent are excluded from the

calculation of the mean.

     The results are quite striking. A comparison of the average amplitude of

the prewar components series and the actual postwar series shows the usual

bThe constructed postwar regression series is formed using the same methods and
 time-varying coefficient that is used to form the new estimates of prewar GNP.
 This series can only be constructed for the period 1955-1983 because the com-

 of volatility for actual GNP for 1955-1983 are: Mean Cyclical Amplitude - .054;

 tions from Trend - .028.

stylized fact. There appears to be a dramatic decline in the severity of cycles

between the prewar and postwar eras. The average amplitude of the prewar

Kuznets/Gallman components series is approximately 64 percent larger than that

of the postwar GNP series. This damping of business cycle fluctuations over

time is also apparent when one compares the Kuznets regression series to the

postwar GNP data. However, the degree of stabilization is somewhat smaller when

the regression series is used in place of the components series. The average

cyclical amplitude of the regression series is approximately 14 percent smaller

than the average amplitude of the components series. Thus, some of the apparent

volatility of the prewar economy is simply an artifact of the problem that

modern researchers have continued to use the components series despite Kuznets's

belief that the regression series provides the better measure of pre-1918

cyclical fluctuations.

     The new estimates of prewar GNP are much less volatile than either the

Kuznets components or regression series. The average amplitude for the new GNP

series for 1869-1918 is 31 percent smaller than that of the Kuznets/Gallman

components series and 17 percent smaller than that of the Kuznets regression

series. The average cyclical amplitude of the new prewar GNP series is also

larger than that for the postwar Commerce Department series. The cyclical

amplitude of the new prewar series is 33 percent larger than that of the postwar

GNP series. From these results it is clear that the measured severity of

cyclical movements in the new prewar GNP series is approximately midway between

that of the prewar Kuznets/Gallman components series and the postwar Commerce

Department series.

     The results using different measures of volatility are roughly similar to

those using the mean cyclical amplitude. I consider both the standard deviation

of the percentage changes in GNP and the standard deviation of deviations from
                                      -37-




trend. These two measures are more indexes of general volatility than of

cyclical severity. Using these measures, the prewar Kuznets/Gallman components

series is again roughly twice as volatile as the actual postwar GNP series. The

Kuznets regression series is only slightly less volatile than the components

series.2' The new estimates of real prewar GNP are substantially less volatile

than either the prewar components or regression series. The standard deviations

of both percentage changes and deviations from trend for the new GNP series are

approximately halfway between those for the prewar Kuznets/Gallman components

series and those for the postwar GNP series.

     One issue that arises in examining the standard deviations of the new GNP

series involves the fact that the new GNP estimates are derived as the forecast

values of a regression. As a result, one would expect the new prewar estimates

to have a lower standard deviation than a true GNP series would have just simply

because the variance of the residual has been suppressed. One way to gauge the

importance of this effect is to construct a GNP series for the postwar era using

the same methods as those used to create the new prewar estimates. Since this

constructed postwar series will also be the fitted values of a regression, it

too should have standard deviations that are biased downward. By comparing the

standard deviations of the actual and constructed postwar series, one can

estimate the magnitude of the possible bias.

     The volatility properties of the constructed postwar GNP series are given

in Table 4. A comparison of the standard deviations of both percentage changes

and deviations from trend for the actual and constructed postwar series suggests

that the bias resulting from using fitted values is very small. The standard

deviation of percentage changes for 1955-1983 is only 4 percent smaller for the

constructed postwar estimates than for the actual data. While the variance of

the residual could certainly be larger in the prewar era, the simple postwar
                                      -38-




comparison suggests that the standard deviation estimates of the new prewar GNP

series are not very biased. As a result, these measures of volatility probably

do provide a good indication of the amount of stabilization that has occurred

over time.



2. Interpretation of Results

     The comparisons of the various measures of volatility suggest that econo-

mists may have greatly overstated the degree to which the U.S. economy has

stabilized over time. While the Kuznets/Gallman components series for 1869-1918

is by most measures approximately 69 percent more volatile than the Commerce

Department GNP series for 1947-1983, the new GNP series for 1869-1918 is on

average only 35 percent more volatile than the postwar series. This suggests

that almost exactly half of the often-noted stabilization of gross national

product over time disappears when the new estimates of prewar GNP are used in

the calculation.

     While it is crucial to note that much of the observed-stabilization of GNP

is due to flaws in the original Kuznets data, it is also important to stress

that even the new estimates of prewar GNP reveal some stabilization between the

prewar and postwar eras. The business cycle before 1918 continues to look

somewhat more severe than the cycle after 1947 even when more accurate estimates

of prewar GNP are examined. However, the change over time now appears to have

been mild rather than dramatic.

     It is useful to note that some of the remaining evidence of stabilization

may be due to the fact that in deriving the new estimates of prewar GNP, I have

deliberately erred on the side of creating a series that is too volatile rather

than too smooth. This tendency is most obvious in the use of a time-varying

estimate of the relationship between GNP and conmrndity output. Despite the
                                         -39-




evidence of Kuznets and Barger that the ratio of commodity output to GNP was

roughly stable between 1869 and 1929, I allow the sensitivity estimate used to

create new data to be higher in the prewar era than in the interwar and postwar

eras.

        Other steps in the derivation have also tended to overstate the volatility

of the new pre-1918 GNP series. For example, I have not taken into account the

possible measurement error in the prewar commodity output data. If early

commodity output is measured with error as Weir suggests, then using a sensitiv-

ity estimate derived using predominantly good postwar data will overstate

cyclical movements in prewar GNP. As a result, a comparison of the new prewar

estimates and the postwar GNP series will, if anything, overstate the amount of

stabilization of the business cycle that has occurred over time.

        Given that the new prewar estimates of GNP reveal significantly less

stabilization over time it is useful to try to understand the source of the

results. The key fact to consider in this regard is that commodity output has

stabilized only very slightly over time. Table 4 reports various measures of

volatility for both the prewar Shaw series and the postwar Federal Reserve Board

data on real commodity output. These measures show that commodity output was

only 12 percent more volatile on average in the prewar era than in the postwar

era.

        Given the slight stabilization in commodity output, one might reasonably

expect only a slight stabilization in GNP. Indeed, if the relationship between

GNP and commodity output had been stable between 1869 and 1983, GNP would also

have decreased in volatility by 12 percent. The new estimates of prewar GNP

show a 35 percent stabilization precisely because the relationship between GNP

and commodity output is allowed to have declined slightly over time as the

noncommodity sectors of the economy have expanded. The key point is that most
                                      -40-




of the stabilization shown by the new series stems not from the underlying

commodity output data, but from assumptions and estimates about the relationship

between commodity output and GNP.

     The same is true to a much larger degree for the original Kuznets esti-

mates. The dramatic stabilization shown by the Kuznets components and regres-

sion series is due almost entirely to Kuznets's assumption that GNP moved nearly

one-for-one with commodity output from 1869-1918, while GNP only moved about

0.6-for-one with commodity output in the postwar era. Since the analysis of

Section III suggests that this assumption is not accurate, neither are the

estimates of the degree of stabilization that can be derived from the Kuznets

series.

                                  CONCLUSION




    The comparisons of Section IV show that perceptions of the prewar business

cycle are very different when the new GNP series is used in place of Kuznets's

prewar estimates. Using the new GNP series business cycle fluctuations from

1869-1918 appear to be much less severe than is conventionally thought. As a

result, one of the most often cited generalizations about business cycles, the

dramatic damping of economic fluctuations, disappears when the new estimates of

prewar GNP are considered. In its place is the much more modest stylized fact

that the severity of business cycles has declined only slightly over time.

     Given that the new prewar data presented in this paper offer such different

conclusions about the prewar economy, it is important to evaluate the quality of

the new series and to stress its limitations. In presenting the derivation of

the new series in Section III, I stress the assumptions being made to derive the

new estimates. The key assumption is that prewar GNP moves significantly less

than one-for-one with commodity output. This assumption is justified on the

basis of the estimated relationship between GNP and commodity output over the

period 1909-1928 and 1955-1983. Even when one allows the measured sensitivity

of GNP to commodity output to decline over time, one's best estimate is that

cyclical movements in prewar GNP are only about 60-70 percent as large as those

in commodity output. As a result, it seems likely that the key assumption

underlying the new estimates is correct.
                                      -42-



     In addition to the evidence concerning the validity of my assumptions, a

further piece of evidence about the cyclical accuracy of the new estimates of

GNP is provided by my research on the historical industrial production and

unemployment data (see Romer, 1986a, 1986b). In these studies, a variety of

historical evidence is used to show that the assumptions underlying the indus-

trial production and unemployment data are incorrect and that the true data

should be substantially less volatile. If one believes that various output and

employment series should show roughly similar cyclical movements, then the fact

that the existing Kuznets series is more volatile than the new estimates of

unemployment or industrial production provides evidence that the Kuznets series

is excessively volatile. By the same reasoning, the fact that my new estimates

of GNP show cyclical movements of approximately the magnitude the previous

studies suggest is accurate for industrial production and unemployment provides

evidence that the new GNP series is reasonably reliable.

     While the analysis above stresses the accuracy of my new estimates of GNP

for cyclical analysis, it is important to realize that the new series is still

subject to many limitations. The most important of these is the fact that the

new estimates of GNP are still derived entirely from data on commodity output.

Since the necessary data on most noncommodity components of GNP do not exist,

this limitation is essentially inevitable. However, this fact means that any

movements in GNP not perfectly correlated with commodity output will be missed

by the new GNP series as they are by the existing Kuznets series.

     Another limitation of the new estimates is that no adjustments have been

made to the trend level of GNP. The new estimates have also not been derived to

be completely consistent in trend values with the Kendrick or Department of

Commerce estimates. Therefore, my new estimates of GNP should not be used for

analyzing long-run trends or in any application where actual levels are
                                       - '+3 -




important.   The new estimates have been derived to represent cyclical movements

more accurately than do existing estimates of GNP. It is thus in cyclical

analyses that the new estimates of real gross national product will be both most

accurate and most useful.

       I would like to thank Robert       Barro, J. Bradford DeLong, Rudiger

      1Various measures of cyclical volatility are very similar for the
Kuznets and Kendrick series. The standard deviation of percentage changes
for the original Kuznets components series for 1889-1918 is 0.064. The
same measure for the Kuznets/Kendrjck series for 1889-1918 is 0.059. The
standard deviation of deviations from trend for the Kuznets series for
1889-1918 is 0.052, while that for the Kuznets/Kendrick series is 0.047.
Hence, the Kuznets components series is the main determinant of the cycli-
cal movements in the Kuznets/Kendrjck estimates of GNP.

      2The standard deviation of percentage changes for the Kuznets
components series for 1869-1918 is 0.063 while that for the Kuznets/Gallman
series is 0.058. The standard deviation of deviations from trend for the
Kuznets series for 1869-1918 is 0.055, while that for the Kuznets/Gallman
series is 0.054.

      3The Shaw/Kuznets series on commodity output in 1929 prices for
1869-1938 is published in Capital in the American Economy, Table R-21, pp.
553-554.

      4Kuznets also derives three statistical variants of his components
estimates of GNP. The only difference between the three variants is how
the trend level of the flow of services to consumers is measured. Variant
III derives the trend level of services by interpolating the trend from the
Commerce Department series after 1929. Since this series is considered to
be the variant most consistent in levels with the postwar GNP series, this
variant of the Kuznets components series is used in the all of the follow-
ing analysis.

      5To estimate the sensitivity of the real flow of services to
consumers to the real flow of commodities to consumers, Kuznets regresses
the deviations from trend of the two series on one another. Trends are
calculated by connecting overlapping decadal averages. Kuznets's results
for 1919—1941 are:

               SERt -

               R2= .20
                        it   =

where SER is the level of the real flow of services to consumers, CF is the
level of the real flow of commodities to consumers, and bars over variables
denote trend values. (See Kuznets, 1961, notes to Table R-28, p. 571, for
details.) The same regression for the period 1952-1976 yields estimates:

                SERt -SER     -.154(CF -CF)+e
                              (.139)
                                        t         t
               R2 = .05

where data on SER and CF are from the National Income and Product Accounts and
are measured in 1972 dollars.

      6An example may help to clarify Kuznets's procedure. Kuznets calculates
averages for decades that overlap by five years, say, for 1899-1908, 1904-1913,
and 1908-1917. He then uses these decadal averages to represent the midpoint of
the decade. In this example the midpoints would be 1903.5, 1908.5, and 1913.5.
He then interpolates linearly between these values to form an annual trend
series.

      7Trend values of GNP and commodity output are calculated in the same way
Kuznets calculates trends: by connecting midpoints of overlapping decadal
averages.

      8Kuznets's income-side estimates of GNP for 1909-1918 are described in
detail in Capital in the American Economy, (1961, pp. 546-552).

      9The gross value series is described in the Federal Reserve Board
publications Industrial Production for 1971 and 1977. I amend both the
gross-value and value-added indexes of final goods production to include the
output of construction materials. I do this because Shaw's measure of commodity
output includes construction materials production.

     10The detrended Shaw series on real commodity output declined by 49.3
percent between 1929 and 1932. The decline in commodity output in the worst
depression in the period 1869-1918, 1880-1885, was 17 percent. The Shaw series
is detrended using a piecewise linear trend.

     The evidence from Kuznets and Barger suggests that the trend is almost
certainly milder in the period 1869-1918 than in the postwar era. As a result,
this procedure will overstate the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output in the
prewar era.

     2The FRB gross value series actually begins in 1954. But, since 1955 was
chosen as a benchmark year, it is better to use the data beginning in 1955.

     13To calculate trend values for years not between two benchmarks, the trend
from the nearest two benchmarks is continued either forward or backward.

     14The two exceptions to this pattern are 1918 which corresponds to a mild
trough in production and 1937 which corresponds to a mild boom. 1918 is includ-
ed because it seemed likely that the apparent decline in production is due to
the unusually high level of wartime production in 1916 and 1917. As a result,
                                       -46-



 1918 appears to be a year when output may have been essentially on trend. 1937
 is included because it appears to only be a boom in relation to the severe
 depression of the early 1930s. Given the relatively low level of output in 1937
 it seems plausible that production in that year only reflects trend output
 rather than potential output.

      15i have tested the effects of the choice of benchmark years on the
estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity output over the interwar period. In
addition to constructjng trend values using the years 1910, 1918, 1924, and 1937
as benchmark values, I construct alternative trend values
                                                           using the years 1911,
1925, and 1936 as benchmark values. The alternative trend values are different
from the original trend values in that GNP and commodity output are now substan-
tially below trend during World War I and very much above trend in the late
1920s. Despite these changes in trend values, the estimated sensitivity of GNP
to commodity output for the period 1909-1928 does not change substantially. The
coefficient estimate using the original trend values is 0.649. The estimate
using the alternative trend values is 0.733.

     16The actual data that I use are presented in Friedman and Schwartz
                                                                         (1982,
Table 4.8, pp. 122-129). Friedman and Schwartz compile a series on GNP that is
essentially identical to Kuznets's components series except that it includes
Gailman's unpublished adjustment of trend levels for certain components of GNP
for the period before 1909. Friedman and Schwartz actually only present data on
net national product. To form a series on real GNP I add Kuznets's unpublished
data on capital consumption for 1869-1918.

     171n estimating equation (2) the simple linear trend jumps at 1955 to take
account of the missing observations. For reference, the trend series is equal
to one in 1909.

     8Baily uses the Kendrick estimates of GNP reported in Historical
Statistics. DeLong and Summers use Gordon's quarterly data set, which, depend-.
ing on the version used, derives its annual movements from either the
Kendrick/Commerce Department series or the Kuznets/Gallman series presented in
Friedman and Schwartz (See Gordon, 1982).

     19The commodity output series is used to determine peaks and troughs
because it is the one series that is nearly uniformly good over the prewar and
postwar eras. In nearly all cases the cycles in GNP correspond perfectly with
those in commodity output.

     20The actual dates of prewar business cycles using my method of dating are,
peak to trough, 1869-1871, 1873-1875, 1880-1885, 1887-1888, 1892—1894,
1895-1896, 1901-1902, 1903-1904, 1906-1908, and 1913-1914. The dates for
postwar business cycles are 1947-1949, 1953-1954, 1956-1958, 1959-1961,
1966—1967, 1968—1971, 1973—1975, and 1979—1982.

     2Some of the similarities between the components and the regression series
may be due to inconsistencies between the two series. The components series
includes Galiman's corrections to the trend of GNP, the regression series does
not. One of Galiman's main corrections is to raise the 1869 level of GNP
substantially. As a result, percentage changes and deviations from trend may
appear quite large in the early 1870s in the uncorrected regression series.
However, even when the early 1870s are excluded the Kuznets regression series
has volatility properties very similar to those of the components series.
