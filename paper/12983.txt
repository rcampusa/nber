A banking crisis began in Austria in May 1931 and intensified in July, when runs struck banks throughout
Germany. In September, the crisis compelled Britain to quit the gold standard. Newly discovered data
shows that failure rates rose for banks in New York City, at the center of the United States money
market, in July and August 1931, before Britain abandoned the gold standard and before financial
outflows compelled the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Banks in New York City had large exposures
to foreign deposits and German debt. This paper tests to see whether the foreign exposure of money
center banks linked the financial crises on the two sides of the Atlantic.

1. Introduction

       In May 1931, the largest financial institution in Austria, the Creditanstalt, collapsed,

marking what is generally held to be the beginning of an international banking crisis. During the

next month, financial difficulties spread throughout central Europe, as troubles beset banks in

Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland, and Germany. On July 13, the failure of a large

German bank, the Darmstadter- und Nationalbank, triggered runs throughout that nation and

compelled the German government to close all depository institutions. Banks reopened for

limited operations after two days and resumed normal operations after one month. Later that

summer, the crisis spread to Britain. In September, sales of sterling and withdrawals from British

banks accelerated. In order to halt financial outflows, Britain abandoned the gold standard (Barry

Eichengreen, 1992; Peter Temin, 1989 and 1993; Charles Kindleburger, 1986).

       According to the conventional academic wisdom, Britain’s departure from gold

transmitted the financial crisis from Europe to the United States (Milton Friedman and Anna

Schwartz, 1963; Eichengreen, 1981 and 1992; Temin, 1989 and 1993). Anticipating a similar

action on the part of American monetary authorities, central banks and private holders in Europe

converted dollar assets in the New York money market into gold. The unloading of bills swiftly

assumed panic proportions. Gold outflows rose rapidly, draining funds from the U.S. financial

system. To stop the international drain, the Federal Reserve System raised the discount rate from

1½ to 3½ percent between October 9 and October 16. This was the

       sharpest rise within so brief a period in the whole history of the system, before or
       since … the move intensified internal financial difficulties and was accompanied
       by a spectacular increase in bank failures and runs on banks … in the six months
       from August 1931 through January 1932, 1,860 banks with deposits of $1,449
       million suspended operations, and the deposits of those banks that managed to
       keep afloat fell by a much larger sum. Total deposits fell over the six-month
       period by nearly five times the deposits in suspended banks or by no less than 17




                                                 1
         percent of the initial level of deposits in operating banks (Friedman and Schwartz,
         1963, p. 317).

Golden fetters, in other words, compelled the Federal Reserve to raise the discount rate and

restrict the supply of credit, contributing to (or in many accounts, causing) the largest surge in

bank suspensions in United States history.

         Recent research, however, reveals additional links that may have existed between the

banking systems in the United States and Europe. Documents from the archives of “the Bank of

England show that an intricate system of cross-deposits was set up by the Austrian Central Bank

covertly to direct funds to the Creditanstalt via American and British banks – to compensate it

for taking over the bankrupt Bodencreditanstalt (Iago Gil Aguado 2001, p. 199).” All of the

American institutions involved in this shell game operated in New York City, the central money

market of the United States. The cross-deposit involved tens of millions of dollars, a substantial

multiple of the capital of the banks involved. In addition, bank balance sheets and clearing-house

association reports show that New York banks’ foreign branches held deposits totaling over $600

million dollars. Foreigners also held large sums in New York City. Thus, banks in the United

States’ central money market had large, direct exposure to European deposits.

         Records resulting from the Senate Hearings on the Sale of Foreign Bonds or Securities in

the United States, which took place from December 18, 1931 to February 10, 1932, illuminate

another link between banks in New York and Europe.1 New York banks organized over $1.4

billion in loans to German corporations, utilities, and governments (including local, state, and

national) from 1924 through 1930. Nearly $1 billion of those loans floated in the United States

were outstanding in June 1931 (Robert Kuczynski, 1932). Econometric analysis of the links

between the German and United State’s economies during the 1930s suggests that German debt

                                                          2
played a role, perhaps substantial, in transmitting financial shocks across the Atlantic (Albrecht

Ritschl and Samad Sarferaz, 2006). Analysis of equity returns also suggests a link through this

channel (Hanan Morsy, 2002).

        An initial inspection of recently discovered data on bank failures in the United States

reinforces the appearance of a direct link between the German and American banking crisis.

Previously available evidence aggregated information on bank suspensions for Federal Reserve

Districts at the quarterly level and for states at the annual level. This aggregation prevented

scholars from determining whether bank failures in the central money market of the United

States occurred in July and August, contemporaneous with the German crisis, or in September

and October, when golden fetters bound. The disaggregated data show that almost all of the

failures of banks in the central money market coincided with the crisis in Germany and preceded

Britain’s departure from gold. Bank distress in New York City, in other words, rose when bank

distress rose in Germany. Bank distress peaked in the weeks following the German panic. The

banking crisis struck the central money market of the United States more than a month before

financial pressures forced Britain off gold.

        This correlation raises questions about the channels that transmitted banking crises across

the Atlantic. Temin (1993, pp. 93-4) describes three potential channels for the international

transmission of banking crises. The first is a contagion of fear which jumps across nationally

boundaries, when domestic depositors panic as foreigners withdraw funds. The second is the

impact on portfolios when values of foreign assets fall and patterns of financial flows change.

The third is the impact of capital flows on national economies and central bank policies,

particularly in nations on the gold standard which raise interest rates to defend gold reserves.

Temin indicates




                                                  3
that

       … it would be nice to choose between the alternative models, [but] this does not
       seem possible at the current state of our knowledge. … Economists do not yet
       know enough about international transmission of financial crises to have a single
       model, or even to choose which transmission channel was most important (Temin
       1993 p. 93-4).

Our data-collection endeavors enable us to answer question such as: which channel transmitted

the banking crisis from Europe to the United States in the third quarter of 1931? Did direct links

exist between the banking crises in Germany and the United States? Did deposits, debt,

correspondent relationships, or some other financial factor link the fate of money-center banks in

New York to the fate of banks in Germany?

       This remainder of this essay answers those questions. Section 2 describes the

quantitative, qualitative, and narrative sources of evidence. Section 3 examines patterns in the

aggregate evidence which suggest a direct link between the crisis in Europe and the United

States. Section 4 describes our statistical tests and econometric results. Section 5 examines

contemporary evidence of the causes of bank distress in the central money market during the

summer of 1931. Section 6 examines contemporary accounts of the regulatory regime changes

that raised rates of bank distress in the central money market of the United States during the

summer of 1931. Section 7 discusses the implications of our analysis.

       While the aggregate evidence suggests that a direct link existed between the financial

crisis in Europe and the surge in bank failures in the central money market of the United States

during the summer of 1931, the microeconomic evidence proves otherwise. Banks in New York

City with substantial exposure to foreign financial flows survived the crisis of 1931 and the




                                                 4
contraction as a whole. Many of them remained profitable and paid dividends throughout the

1930s.

          The correlation between the financial crisis on the continent and bank distress in New

York City was coincidental, not causal. Bank distress in the central money market of the United

States peaked during the summer of 1931 for reasons unrelated to financial incidents across the

Atlantic. Political pressure and regulatory reform determined the timing of events in New York

City. The impetus for these reforms arose from the failure of The Bank of United States in

December, 1930, and the criticism directed at the Superintendent of Banks for the State of New

York for his role in that institution’s collapse.


2. Data

          Several sources provide the quantitative, qualitative, and narrative information needed to

investigate the issues at hand. Quantitative sources contain data useful for econometrically

analyzing the performance of New York City banks. Qualitative sources report contemporary

conclusions concerning the causes of bank distress. Narrative sources describe events in the

central money market during the financial crisis in the summer and fall of 1931 and the change

in the regulatory regime that occurred at that time.

          Several sources provide quantitative information on banks’ characteristics. Rand

McNally Bankers’ Directory provides data balance sheet figures, correspondents networks,

Federal Reserve membership, and the services provided to depositors. Rand McNally also

indicates for most sizeable New York banks whether the institution provided its customers with

international transaction services and whether the institution possessed foreign branches. Rand

McNally published biennially. Observations drawn from the July issue provide a panel of annual

observations on state and national banks at their spring calls.



                                                    5
        The Annual Report of the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York provides

more detailed financial data for state-chartered banks and trust companies. The information

comes quarterly. It includes details of bank balance sheets, including the composition of

investments (e.g. loans by type of collateral, stocks, bonds, discounts, cash, and deposits in other

banks) and the composition of liabilities (e.g. time deposits, demand deposits, and borrowings

from banks). The New York Times provides information on bank balance sheets in a weekly

column entitled “New York Weekly Bank Statements.” The information includes demand, time,

and foreign-branch deposits for all members of the clearing house and for many additional

institutions. The Senate Hearings on the Sale of Foreign Bonds or Securities in the United States

report loans to Germany arranged by banks in New York and outstanding when the banking

crisis ignited on the continent.

        The call reports collected by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve

Board provide more detailed information for banks belonging to the Federal Reserve System.

For state-chartered member banks, balance sheets and income statements survive for the

December and June calls for the first five years of the depression (i.e. December 1929 through

December 1933). For national banks, balance sheets survive from the December 1929 and

December 1931 calls. Income statements survive from the December 1929, June 1931, and

December 1931 calls. The balance sheets provide detailed data about bank’s foreign exposure.

Schedule G indicates holdings of foreign government bonds and other foreign securities.

Schedule I indicates balances due in dollars and foreign currencies from foreign banks and

foreign branches of U.S. banks. Schedule J indicates balances due to banks in foreign countries.

Schedule L indicates time deposits of foreign banks and trust companies. Schedule D indicates




                                                 6
the number of branches in foreign countries. A balance sheet also exists for each foreign branch,

which provides additional information about overseas operations.2

         Information on changes in banks’ status – such as suspensions, liquidations, mergers of

solvent institutions, and consolidations forced by financial difficulties – comes from the archives

of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Division of Bank Operations. From 1929 through

1933, the Board recorded information about changes in bank status on the St. 6386 series of

forms. The forms included information identifying each bank, financial information on the date

of the change in status, and additional information about the transaction, such as the identities of

the institutions with which it merged and whether a bank reorganized before it reopened. Form

St. 6386a reported bank consolidations. A consolidation was the corporate union of two or more

banks into one bank which continued operations as a single business entity and under a single

charter. Some consolidations involved banks in financial difficulties. These consolidations often

occurred at the behest of regulators, who sought to combine solvent but illiquid banks with

healthier institutions. The Federal Reserve classified these events as consolidations due to

financial difficulties.3

         Form St. 6386b reported bank suspensions. A suspension occurred when a bank closed its

doors to depositors and ceased conducting normal banking business for at least one business day.

Some, but not all, suspended banks reopened for business. A liquidation was a permanent

suspension. A liquidating bank closed its doors to the public, surrendered its charter, and repaid

depositors, usually under the auspices of a court appointed officer known as a receiver.

        Form St. 6386b included a section indicating the cause of a bank’s suspension (for

descriptions of the process that Federal Reserve agents used to determine the cause and tests of

the quality of their conclusions, see Gary Richardson, 2006b and 2006d). Federal Reserve

attributed most suspensions to one (or more) of five common causes. The first was slow,

doubtful, or worthless paper. The term worthless paper indicated an asset with little or no value.

The term doubtful paper meant an asset unlikely to yield book value. The term slow paper meant

an asset likely to yield full value in time, but whose repayment lagged or which could not be

converted to full cash value at short notice. The second common cause of suspension was heavy

withdrawals, the typical example being a bank run. The third was failure a banking

correspondent. Correspondents were banks with ongoing relationships facilitated by deposits of

funds. A typical example is a county bank (the client or respondent) which kept its reserve

deposits within and cleared its checks through a national bank in a reserve city (the

correspondent). The fourth common cause was mismanagement. The fifth was defalcation, a

monetary deficiency in the accounts of a bank due to fraud or breach of trust.

        Form St. 6386c reported all other changes in bank status, including reopenings of

suspended banks and voluntary liquidations. The latter was a category of closure in which banks

ceased operations and rapidly arranged to repay depositors the full value of their deposits.

Voluntary liquidations did not require the services of receivers and were not classified as

suspensions. The categories of bank distress were typically construed to be temporary

suspensions, terminal suspensions (i.e. liquidations), voluntary liquidations, and consolidations

due to financial difficulties.




                                                 8
       Combining the St. 6386 forms and the bank-balance sheet data described above yields a

cross-sectional database of banks on the eve of the financial crisis at the beginning of July in

1931. These sources also yield a panel database of banks in July of each year from 1929 through

1932. These databases contain information about banks’ characteristics, financial health, and

fates of greater detail than in any other extant source.

       Data on economic conditions comes from several sources. Bradstreet’s Weekly, Dun’s

Review, The Commercial and Financial Chronicle, the Federal Reserve Bulletin, and the Annual

Reports of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provide data

on building permits, business failures, commodity prices, market interest rates, Federal Reserve

discount rates, prices, and industrial production. The same sources also data on international

flows of gold, goods, and funds.

       Several of the sources described above provide qualitative information on the causes of

bank distress. The St. 6386 database indicates the Federal Reserve Division of Bank Operation’s

conclusions concerning the cause of each bank suspension. The database also describes the

financial difficulties that forced banks to seek consolidations, typically with the encouragement

and assistance of regulators. The Annual Report of the Superintendent of Banks of the state of

New York and press releases from the office of the bank superintendent (published in the New

York Times and Wall Street Journal) indicate the conclusions of New York’s regulatory

authorities concerning the cause of each bank closure. The Annual Report also indicates

recoveries from banks in liquidation and payments to depositors, which reveals the extent of

insolvency at institutions in receivership. The microfilmed call reports for national and Federal

Reserve member banks contain examiners reports on the financial health of each institution.

These assessments indicate the extent of each bank’s losses on investments (both past and




                                                  9
predicted) and recommendations as to whether the bank should remain in operations, increase its

reserves, consolidate with another institution, or cease operations.

        Several sources provide a narrative history of events influencing the central money

market in New York City during the summer and fall of 1931. The Annual Report of the

Superintendent of Banks discusses events perceived to be important, changes in the regulatory

regime, and the closure and consolidation of institutions. The report also indicates the number,

salaries, experience, and assignments of bank examiners as well as the reason for changes in the

size of the examination staff. Newspapers and periodicals – including the New York Times, Wall

Street Journal, Bradstreet’s Weekly, Dun’s Review, Commercial and Financial Chronicle, and

Bankers’ Magazine – regularly discussed events influencing banks in New York City. All of

these outlets, for example, published articles about the demise of The Bank of United States, the

investigation into the causes of its collapse, the public and legislative outcry over regulators’ role

in these events, and the regulatory agencies reactions to this adverse publicity.


3: Aggregate Patterns – Apparent Link Between Germany and New York

        An initial inspection of the evidence suggests the existence of a direct connection

between the banking crisis in Germany and bank distress in New York. The chronological

correlation is striking.

       Figure 1 illuminates the relationship. The figure plots weekly hazard rates for liquidation

and consolidation due to financial difficulties for banks in New York City from July 1930

through March 1933. The hazard function is a non-parametric estimate constructed by smoothing

raw hazard rates (i.e. the number of bank liquidations divided by the number of banks at risk

each week and the number of consolidations due to financial difficulties divided by the number

of banks at risk in each week). The kernel is Epanechnikov. The bandwidth is two weeks, which



                                                 10
is wide enough to reveal trends without obscuring short-term shifts in the probability of failure.

       Figure 1 shows that the probability of failure rose rapidly at the beginning of July, as the

European banking panic spread through central Europe. The increase accelerated as bank runs

swept Germany, and the German government shut down their nation’s banking system. The

probability of failure peaked in August, immediately after the reopening of banks in Germany but

preceding Britain’s departure from gold.

       Table 1 provides additional details about the banks that failed in New York City during

the Great Contraction. The table lists all of the banks forced to change status due to financial

difficulties from January 1, 1929 through December 31, 1933. The fourth column indicates the

type of change forced on the bank. Two types of changes predominated. The letter L indicates

that the bank entered receivership and experienced liquidation. In all cases but one, the

liquidation began at the behest of the superintendent of banks of the state of New York, after

bank examiners determined that the institution faced financial difficulties so severe that it had to

be closed to protect the interests of depositors and usually after determining that no other bank

wished to consolidate with the afflicted institution. The exception was the Queesnboro National

Bank, whose directors decided to turn the institution over to receivers. The letter C indicates that

financial difficulties compelled the bank to consolidate with another institution. Most of these

consolidations occurred at the behest of regulators after examinations revealed looming financial

problems. Typical situations involved banks lacking liquidity or banks whose capital had been

consumed by investment losses. Regulators threatened to close such institution unless their

directors resolved the problems by injecting additional funds or merging with another institution.

Many institutions that liquidated (i.e. L) had also sought consolidation, but failed to reach an

agreement with another organization in time to forestall receivership.




                                                 11
       Table 1’s first column indicates the date at which the bank closed its doors to depositors

or consummated a consolidation with another institution. More than 60% of these transactions

(16 out of 26) occurred during the two month period bounded by the failure of the Darmstadter-

und Nationalbank on July 13, 1931 and Britain’s departure from gold on September 21, 1931.

Only two banks failed in the wake of Britain’s departure from gold. One additional institution

temporarily suspended payments during that period. For the sake of comparison, only two banks

failed in December 1930, a period that Friedman and Schwartz referred to as the First Banking

Crisis. Only one bank failed during the winter of 1933, when the drain of gold threatened to shut

down the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and forced the President to declare a national

banking holiday.

       The pattern of events appears clear. Bank distress in the central money market of the

United States peaked during the European banking crisis in the summer of 1931. The correlation

suggests that a direct connection existed between financial events in New York and on the

continent, particularly Germany. Several channels could have linked banks on both sides of the

Atlantic including foreign deposits, foreign debts, and correspondent relationships.


4. Econometric Methods and Results

       The existence of detailed microdata on the potential channels of transmission allows us to

test for a direct link between bank distress in Europe and New York. Our econometric methods

resemble those of Isabel Schnabel (2004), Martin Petri (1998), and Richardson and Troost

(2006). We regress indications of banks’ performance on (i) variables gathered from banks’

balance sheets, (ii) variables indicating banks’ financial health, (iii) variables indicating banks’

exposure to international debts, deposits, and financial flows, and (iv) variables indicating




                                                  12
fundamental forces affecting the aggregate economy. We examine a wide array of specifications

commonly used in the literature, and test the statistical robustness of our results.

       Table 2 raises issues important for analyzing the evidence. The table reveals raw

correlations between distressed departures from the banking business (i.e. liquidations,

consolidations due to financial difficulties, and voluntary liquidations) and characteristics of

banks. The correlations come from data on national and state member banks because for them

detailed data on foreign exposure exists. The data comes from Comptroller of Currency call

reports described in the preceding section. Similar data does not exist for state banks that did not

belong to the Federal Reserve System. For those institutions, data on foreign holdings is limited.

For non-member banks, the New York State Bank Superintendent’s Office did not publish

information on the topic, in large part, because non-members lacked substantial foreign

operations. Rand McNally Bankers’ Directory published limited information on the topic,

consisting of the names of foreign correspondents institutions, and in some case, and in a few

cases, foreign branches and foreign holdings. The extant information indicates non-member

banks had little (and usually no) foreign operations and had limited foreign exposure. Excluding

them from our econometric analysis does not distort our findings.

       In Table 2 column (3) reports results for the 51 national banks that operated in New York

City during the summer of 1931. For national banks, the only call reports that survive from the

five years preceding the time under investigation come from December 1929. This specification,

therefore, utilizes data from that source. Column (2) reports results for the 29 state-member

banks that operated in New York City during the summer of 1931. For state-member banks, call

reports survive for each of the June and December calls during the late 1920s and early 1930s.

The high frequency of the extant evidence enables us to draw data from the June 1931 call,




                                                 13
which indicates their financial status on June 30, 1931, a few weeks prior to the events under

investigation. This specification employs that source. Expanding the data to the entire available

panel yields similar results.

       Column (1) reports results for the national and state-member banks pooled together, a

total of 80 institutions. For the variables in group (A), the correlation coefficients indicate the

relationship between basic indicators of financial health and distressed departures from the

banking business. The correlations are consistent with those commonly found in the literature.

Banks with higher net worth failed less often than banks with lower net worth. Banks with more

reserves failed less often than banks with fewer reserves. Banks with more liquid resources as a

percentage of assets failed less often than banks with less liquid resources. The correlation

coefficients in group (B) indicate the relationship between foreign exposure and distressed

departures from the banking business. All six of the correlation coefficients are negative,

indicating that the more foreign exposure possessed by banks, the lower the likelihood of their

failure. The correlation coefficients in group (C) indicate the relationship between bank distress

and foreign exposure as a share of total resources. The majority of these correlation coefficients

are negative, indicating once again, that banks with greater foreign exposure failed at lower rates.

The inverse correlation between foreign exposure and failure found in the microdata suggests

that foreign exposure may not have been the reason that banks failed in New York City during

the summer of 1931.

       Table 3 reinforces this result. The table reports cross tabulations between the incidence of

bank distress and several measures of foreign exposure. The cross tabulation shows that none of

the banks that departed from the banking business in the summer of 1931 possessed foreign

branches, while two of the banks that survived the summer possessed such branches. The second




                                                  14
cross tabulation shows that none of the banks that departed from the banking business in the

summer of 1931 possessed time deposits from financial institutions in foreign countries, while

eight of the banks that survived the summer possessed such deposits. The third cross tabulation

shows that none of the banks that departed from the banking business in the summer of 1931

belonged to syndicates that extended loans to Germany during the 1920s, while four of the banks

that survived the summer lead such syndicates.

       The final cross tabulation indicates the number of state and national banks forced to

depart from the banking business by the different forms of bank distress. For example, regulators

compelled two state-chartered banks belonging to the Federal Reserve System and seven

nationally-chartered banks to consolidate with other institutions. Regulators liquidated four state

member banks and one national bank. This cross tabulation highlights a feature of the data that

shapes our econometric strategy.

       Discrete choice methods are a natural way to analyze the data at our disposal. For

example, logistic models yield optimal estimates for binomial choices (such close doors to

depositors or remain in operation) under a wide range of conditions. Multinomial logistic models

yield optimal estimates for multinomial choices (such as remain in operation, consolidate, enter

receivership, or voluntary liquidate) under a wide range of conditions. Table 3 reveals that for

our data, those conditions do not exist. Perfect classifiers are the principle problem. Many

measures of foreign exposure are perfect classifiers. Banks with foreign branches, for example,

never experienced distress. Many characteristics of banks are also perfect classifiers. State banks,

for example, never voluntarily liquidated. Perfect classifiers bedevil discrete choice methods,

because discrete choice estimators cannot be calculated in the cases of perfect classification.

Near perfect classifiers also impede accurate inference via discrete choice methods.




                                                 15
       One way to circumvent this problem is to drop the perfect classifiers from the regression.

But in our case, that strategy appears unpromising. The perfect classifiers include three key

measures of foreign exposure: branches, deposits, and loans. In each case, banks that possessed

this type of foreign exposure survived the crisis of the summer of 1931 (and the remainder of the

contraction). This information is important and should not be discarded from the analysis for

computational convenience. The other measures of foreign exposure turn out to be near perfect

classifiers. For example, almost all banks with foreign exposure of any type survived the crisis in

the summer of 1931 (and the entire depression). In such circumstances, discrete choice

estimators do not possess optimal properties.

       A solution to this problem is the linear probability model. This model incorporates

perfect classifiers without difficulty although coefficients estimated from it may be inefficient

and, in certain circumstances, biased. These properties could be cause for concern, but our

examination of the residuals from our regressions suggests that neither problem afflicts our

estimates to a substantial degree.

        Table 4 presents estimates based upon this model. The unit of observation is an

individual bank. The data for each bank is drawn from the call report for the date closest to June

30, 1931. The dependent variable equals one if the bank consolidated due to financial

difficulties, entered receivership at the behest of regulators, or liquidated voluntarily between

July 1, 1931 and December 31, 1931. The dependent variable equals zero otherwise. This

indicator for bank distress is regressed on a vector of explanatory variables, including various

measures of exposure to foreign financial forces and a vector of bank characteristics. The

balance sheet characteristics includes standard measures of financial health such as net worth as

a share of total resources, government securities as a share of total resources, other securities as a




                                                 16
share of total resources, reserves as a share of total resources, total deposits, and demand deposits

as a fraction of total deposits. Other bank characteristics include the number of correspondents,

the jurisdiction of its charter, and the age of the organization. All of these coefficients possess

signs and magnitudes consistent with previously published studies, and therefore, are not

reported in the table. The coefficients of interest are those on the variables indicating exposure to

potential channels for the transmission of the foreign financial crisis.

       Column (1) reports these coefficients for a regression pooling data on all of the national

and state member banks operating in the central money market on July 1, 1931. The signs of

many coefficients are negative, indicating that increasing foreign exposure along that dimension

reduced the likelihood of failure. For example, the coefficient on Foreign Government Bonds

Owned, -0.034, suggests that increasing a bank’s holdings of foreign government bonds by

$1,000,000 reduced the likelihood of the bank’s failure by 3.4%. The magnitudes of the positive

coefficients are small, suggesting that if increasing foreign exposure along that dimension

increased the probability of failure, the increase was minimal. The standard errors of the

coefficients are large relative to the magnitudes. T-tests indicate that for each coefficient, the

hypothesis that the coefficient equals zero cannot be rejected. An F-test indicates that the

hypothesis that the all of the coefficients jointly equal zero cannot be rejected.

       Column (2) indicates the results when the sample is limited to the 29 state-member banks

that operated in New York City during the summer of 1931. The results are similar. The signs of

most of the coefficients are negative. The magnitudes of the positive coefficients are small. T-

tests indicate that for each coefficient, the hypothesis that the coefficient equals zero cannot be

rejected. An F-test indicates that the hypothesis that the all of the coefficients jointly equal zero

cannot be rejected.




                                                  17
       Column (3) indicates the results when the sample is limited to the 51 national banks that

operated in New York City during the summer of 1931. The results resemble those for the first

two regressions. The signs on several of the coefficients are negative. An F-test indicates that the

hypothesis that the all of the coefficients jointly equal zero cannot be rejected. T-tests on

individual coefficients reject the hypothesis of equality with zero in four cases at the five percent

level and in another case at the ten percent level. Their statistical significance entails an

examination of the magnitude of these effects.

       Table 5 undertakes this task by comparing for each bank their foreign financial exposure

with the probability of failure predicted by the regression (1) in Table 4. The seven dimensions

of foreign financial exposure for which we have data are closely correlated. From the seven

vectors of these variables, we can create an index of foreign financial exposure by deriving the

principal components. The first principal component is a linear transformation of the vectors that

explains the greatest possible variance in the data. This first principal component serves as our

index. Banks for which the value of the index is lowest have the least foreign financial exposure.

Banks for which the value of the index is highest have the most foreign financial exposure.

       For quintiles organized according to the extent of foreign exposure, Table 5 reports the

average probability of distress predicted by regression (1) in Table 4 and the standard deviation

of that average. The probability of failure appears constant across quintiles. Two-tailed tests

cannot reject the null hypotheses of equality among the averages of the quintiles at standard

significance levels. Only the banks with the largest foreign financial exposure appear to have a

significantly lower probability of distress. For the eight banks with the highest foreign exposure,

the predicted probability of distress is approximately 2%. For the two banks possessing networks

of foreign branches, the predicted probability of distress is less than 1%.




                                                  18
       Figure 2 summarizes these results. The vertical axis indicates the predicted probability of

distress. The horizontal axis indicates our index of foreign financial exposure. The observations

plot the predictions for each of the 80 banks in our sample. The pattern appears clear. For banks

possessing low levels of foreign financial exposure, the probability of distress was independent

of the extent of exposure. For banks possessing the highest levels of foreign financial exposure,

however, the probability of distress was low and inversely correlated with the extent of exposure.

In other words, banks with substantial foreign exposure failed much lower rates than other

institutions, and as the extent of foreign exposure increased, the probability of failure fell. This

econometric result seems reasonable, since all of the banks in New York City with substantial

foreign financial exposure survived the depression.


5. Contemporary Conclusions about the Causes of Bank Distress

       Econometric evidence has advantages and disadvantages. Econometrics employs the

power of statistics to illuminate relationships between variables after controlling for the influence

of others. But, statistical inference remains vulnerable to the dangers of misspecification and

misinterpretation. Statistical studies are also limited by paucity of data which, for financial

institutions operating during the Great Depression, consists of infrequent observations of a subset

of the relevant variables.

       The conclusions of contemporary observers complement such statistical evidence.

Observers such as Federal Reserve agents, bank examiners, accountants, economists, and

journalists had access to an array of information unavailable to modern scholars, including

detailed, daily data about the financial status of and events affecting commercial banks.

Contemporary observers also had the ability to talk with the man on the spot and possessed in-

depth knowledge about the institutions and issues at hand.



                                                  19
           Detailed records survive from several sets of contemporary observers. The first (and

arguably the most important) is the St. 6386 database constructed by the Federal Reserve

Board’s Division of Bank Operations. Table 6 summarizes the results of the Division’s analysis

of bank suspensions. In 11 of 14 cases, the primary cause of suspension was the depreciation in

the value of the bank’s assets. In two cases, heavy withdrawals were the primary cause of

suspension. In another case, a bank failed after losing a substantial share of its capital to

embezzlement. Comments written on the St. 6386 forms discuss reasons for the depreciation in

the value of the bank’s portfolio, principally the declining value of stocks, corporate bonds, and

real estate. In all cases, the comments refer to declines of domestic assets. In no instance do the

comments refer to foreign investments or German debt.

           The Division of Bank Operations also tracked consolidations due to financial difficulties.

Table 7 summarizes the results of this endeavor. All but one of the banks forced to consolidate in

1931 suffered from frozen assets or impaired capital. The examiners who discovered these

afflictions reached conclusions like Midwood Trust Company’s condition was “such as to

necessitate its being taken over by some other institution.”4 Long Island National Bank’s health

was “such as to necessitate an immediate absorption.” “The condition of the International Trust

Company was such as to make desirable their being taken over by a stronger institution.” In

almost all of these cases, the absorbing bank took all of the assets of the troubled bank in

exchange for assuming the deposits and some, but not all, of the other liabilities of the troubled

institution. The Division of Bank Operations attributed the financial difficulties to domestic

factors. In no instance does the Division discuss international events, deposits, or debts.

           Like the Division of Bank Operations, the New York State Bank Superintendent’s office

investigated the cause of suspension for each state-chartered bank, trust company, and private

    Footnote number 3 explains how to locate the archival documents quoted in this paragraph.

bank. These amounted to 13 of the 14 institutions that closed their doors to depositors during the

summer of 1931. The superintendent released initial statements about the cause of each closure

on the date that the institution closed its doors and in the weekly bulletin of the Department of

Banking. Final conclusions appeared in the Department of Banking’s Annual Report. So did

information about the rate of recovery from institutions undergoing liquidation. These sources

described the cause of Chelsea Bank’s and Trust Companies demise to be “rumors” that

circulated “which have caused abnormal withdrawals of deposits,” prompting the examiners to

close the bank to conserve its assets. In all other instances, the sources contained statements such

as ‘because of a non-liquid condition and depreciation of its assets, it is unsafe and inexpedient

to permit the institution to continue in business.’ The Department of Banking attributed the

financial difficulties of all of these institutions to domestic factors, particularly the declining

values of securities, bonds, and real estate, which reduced the value and liquidity of banks’

portfolios. In no instance does the Department of Banking discuss international factors, such as

foreign deposits or German debt.

        The conclusions of contemporary observers seem clear. During the summer of 1931, the

banks that ceased operations did so for reasons unrelated to the financial crisis in Europe. The

source of distress was the declining value of domestic assets – principally real estate, stocks, and

bonds – and withdrawals from banks which appeared to be headed for financial trouble. The

banks that closed their doors or consolidated with other institutions did not due so because

foreign depositors withdrew funds or because German debt declined in value.

        Might there be something that contemporary observers missed? Perhaps the banking

crisis in Germany altered patterns of mergers among American banks. For years, depository

institutions had been combining operations, as growing banks absorbed smaller competitors and




                                                  21
turned them into branches. Perhaps patterns of these mergers changed, forcing banks that would

have merged voluntary into the hands of regulators who ordered them either to consolidate on

less advantageous terms or to depart from the banking business.

       Figure 3 addresses this issue. It compares a non-parametric estimate of the hazard rate for

consolidations due to distress to a non-parametric estimate of the hazard rate for voluntary

mergers. The estimate for the former is identical to that in Figure 1. The estimate for the latter is

constructed by kernel-smoothing raw hazard rates for mergers of healthy banks (i.e. mergers per

week divided by number of banks at risk). The kernel is Epanechnikov. The bandwidth is five

weeks. The rate of mergers follows no discernible trend. It varies from month to month but the

distribution remains roughly constant over time. The rate of consolidations due to distress

follows a dramatically different pattern. Almost all the banks that consolidate this way do so

during 1931. The largest cluster occurs during July and August, the months when the banking

panic peaked on the continent.

       Consider another possibility. Perhaps widespread withdrawals from foreign accounts

occurred, putting pressure on the central money market as a whole, which forced the weakest

banks in New York City out of business. Our econometric analysis might have missed an event

such as this, because the annual, quarterly, and cross-sectional databases which we analyze lack

high-frequency deposit data which could detect such shifts. But, other data sets contain weekly

data on deposits in New York City banks. These data sets include the column “New York

Weekly Bank Statements” published each week in the New York Times and the compilation of

member bank balance sheets released weekly by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,

published in many periodicals (e.g. Bradstreet’s Weekly, Dun’s Review, The Commercial and

Financial Chronicle, and in the New York Times entitled “New York City Reporting Member




                                                 22
Banks”), and recapitulated in the records of the New York Fed and Board of Governors. Both

data sets show that deposits at New York City banks in August 1931 were comparable to

deposits at New York City banks in August 1930. The small fall in deposits during the summer

of 1931 (approximately 4%) resembled typical seasonal variation.


6. Contemporary Accounts Reveal the Cause of the Correlation

       This essay began with an observation about the financial crises – the period of acute bank

distress in the central money market of the United States followed closely on the banking crisis

in Germany and preceded Britain’s abandonment of the gold standard – and then this essay

produced a puzzle. No financial link appears to have existed between the banking crisis on the

continent and in New York City. The banks that failed in New York lacked exposure to foreign

deposits, German debt, and other factors that might have transmitted the financial crisis across

the Atlantic. Numerous banks in New York had substantial exposure to such sources of

contagion. This exposure included hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign deposits, over one

billion dollars in German debt, and large holdings of foreign assets. But, the institutions engaged

in the international banking business survived the contraction. These internationally-oriented

institutions were an island of strength in a sea of turmoil. Their prosperity seems surprising,

relative to the performance of other American banks, which failed in droves during the

downturn.

       What can resolve the riddle? Why was bank distress in the central money market

chronologically correlated with the banking crisis on the continent despite the fact that banks

with financial links to Europe weathered the storm? Our research reveals an important piece of

the puzzle. The behavior of the New York’s Banking Department changed during the summer of

1931. Eight months before, in December 1930, The Bank of United States failed. It was the



                                                 23
fourth largest depository institution in New York and the eighth largest in the nation. From

December 1930 through June 1931, “practically the entire examination force in the metropolitan

district was engaged in the liquidation of the Bank of United States (Superintendent of Banks

1931, p. 19).” The concentration of examination resources on this case compelled the

superintendent’s office to expand the size of its staff. The rigidity of civil service regulations,

however, slowed the process and impeded the hiring of experienced individuals. Eventually, “it

was necessary to obtain executive permission to employ temporary examiners not taken from

Civil Service lists and to reinstate former examiners whose wide experience was desperately

needed (Superintendent of Banks 1931, p. 19).” The Civil Service Commission insisted that for

each examiner appointed who was not a civil servant, an appointment had to be made from the

civil service list, which at the time, included few individuals with the training, talent, or aptitude

for bank-examination work. These restrictions slowed the department’s effort to respond to the

emergency.

       The department managed to increase the examination staff to 192 members at the end of

1931, up from 131 in December 1930. In addition, for a period of seven months, the department

“obtained the assistance of twenty-eight men whose services were donated by various banks as

well as the aid of fifteen Federal Reserve examiners who were temporarily lent to the department

(Superintendent of Banks 1931, p. 17).” Bureaucratic delays and the time to train the new

examiners meant that the size of the effective examination staff increased substantially during

the summer of 1931. At the same time that these new resources came on line, the permanent

examination staff for the metropolitan district, which had focused on The Bank of United States

from January through June, finished that investigation and returned to regular duties. Thus, in the

summer of 1931, the effective number of examiners in New York City increased substantially.




                                                  24
The number of bank examinations, which had been conducted infrequently for many months,

increased commensurately.

       The examinations also increased in intensity. The banking department adopted “new

regulations for the purpose of obtaining more complete information on loans and security

portfolios (Superintendent of Banks 1931, p. 17).” These changes included new reporting forms

designed to “instantly reflect trends and policies of each state bank and trust company” and new

methods for “arriving at fair values of securities (Superintendent of Banks 1931, p. 17).” These

innovations stemmed from a reorganization of the banking department begun in the spring of

1929 and completed in the wake of the failure of The Bank of United States.

       The post-examination powers of the banking department also increased. In the spring, the

state legislature passed several reform bills introduced at the request of the state bank

superintendent. The first bill permitted the hiring of additional examiners in an emergency. The

second reduced from 30 to 20 days the time allowed for filing claims against a bank by the

superintendent after notice had been sent to creditors. The third allowed the superintendent to act

on the findings of Clearing House examinations as if they were examinations conducted by the

state banking department. Two other bills failed to progress past the banking committee. One

would have permitted the superintendent to consolidate banks overnight in emergencies. The

other would have authorized the superintendent to remove officers of a bank upon evidence

showing them responsible for improper conditions (Wall Street Journal, March 13, 1931, p. 8

“State Banking Bills”). The superintendent argued that the rejected reforms would have provided

him with the ability to forestall the failure of The Bank of United States. Critics of the

Superintendent, including many legislators on the banking committee, asserted that the




                                                 25
superintendent possessed more than enough authority to have prevented the crisis had he acted

when irregularities at The Bank of United States were first brought to his attention in 1929.

       Criticism of the superintendent, Joseph Broderick, peaked in June, when the case against

the directors of the Bank of United States reached trial. A New York Times headline blared

“STATE CALLED LAX IN BANK FAILURES (New York Times, June 14, 1931, p. 1 –

emphasis in original).” Another headlined reported that the superintendent had been accused of

“Gross Negligence” for his performance on The Bank of United States (New York Times, June

27, 1931, p. 2). A former state attorney general circulated a letter calling for a general

investigation of the banking department and drawing parallels between its performance in the

current case and problems in the past. The chairman of the Republican State Committee sent a

letter to Governor Roosevelt requesting an inquiry and demanding the removal of Superintendent

Broderick (New York Times, June 26, 1931, p. 7). The state legislature discussed the creation of

a special committee to investigate the banking department and considered a bill authorizing suits

against state bank employees who performed their jobs negligently.

       The chorus of criticism focused on the banking department’s slow response after

discovering the financial problems faced by The Bank of United States. In statement and

testimony in hearings concerning The Bank of United States, the superintendent revealed that the

irregularities which lead to the bank’s demise were first brought to his attention in the summer of

1929. Then, he believed that “he would have been ‘gravely remiss in his sworn duty if he did not

exhaust every possible resource to save the situation before deciding that the doors must be

closed’ (Wall Street Journal, March 6, 1931, p. 2).” He allowed The Bank of United States to

continue operations for more than a year, and during that time, to continue conducting certain




                                                 26
transactions, “which he admits were dishonest even if inside the letter of the law,” and to

continue to accumulate losses, in hopes that some remedy for the situation would be found.

       Now, in the summer of 1931, the superintendent planned to deal with such situations

expeditiously, and requested an expansion of his powers to enable him to take control of banks

whenever he deemed it in the public interest. He planned to encourage the consolidation of banks

“in cases where it appeared the result would be generally beneficial. This tendency toward

consolidation, resulting as it does in the disappearance of many independent units, effects a

concentration of banking resources and improved management which should lend itself to the

development of sound policies and the elimination of unwarranted competition (Superintendent

of Banks, 1931, p. 7).”

       The impact of the superintendent’s new policies and increased authority can be seen in

the wave of examinations that swept New York City in the summer of 1931. New stringent

procedures highlighted investment losses and potential problems at numerous institutions. The

superintendent’s office moved swiftly to rectify such shortfalls. The department demanded that

the bank’s shareholders, directors, and management come up with capital to cover the losses, or

consolidate with other institutions, which typically required them to realize large losses (in many

cases, their entire investment), or face seizure by the superintendent’s office. A dramatic climax

of the campaign came on August 5, when the Superintendent Broderick seized three banks

(American Union, International Madison, and Times Square Trust), on the same morning. The

seizures upset the plans of the joint legislative committee on banking to hold a hearing at the Bar

Association Building that afternoon to discuss the recommendations of Mr. Broderick and the

performance of the banking department. The announcement cancelling the hearings noted that

“the taking over of the three banks made it impossible for Mr. Broderick or the bankers to appear




                                                27
before the committee (New York Times, August 6, 1931, p. 32).” During the next three weeks,

Superintendent Broderick oversaw the liquidation of those three depositories, compelled the

consolidation of an additional five New York City banks, and supervised the examination and

sanctioning of number other institutions. His office remained so busy that the public hearings on

his performance appear to have been postponed indefinitely.

       While it is impossible to know for sure why bank supervision became more aggressive

during the summer of 1931, it seems likely that the change stemmed from pressure on the bank

superintendent, changes in the incentives and attitudes of the superintendent and his staff, the

growth of resources available to the banking department, and the expansion of de jure and de

facto regulatory authority. It seems clear that the aggressive behavior of the banking department

produced the spike in suspensions in the central money market that appears to be closely

correlated with the financial crisis in Europe. The timing of the suspensions in New York

appears to have been a delayed reaction to the failure of The Bank of United States. The reaction

took place eight months after the trigger because it took time to deploy additional regulatory

resources and because it took time for political pressures (and perhaps learning by doing) to alter

the mindset of the regulators. It is possible that concern about the banking crisis on the continent

could have played a role in altering the behavior of banking authorities, but our extensive

searches have uncovered no evidence to support this hypothesis.


7. Discussion

       A chronological correlation exists between the banking crisis in Germany following the

collapse of the Creditanstalt and the banking crisis in New York City during the summer of

1931. Banks in New York City sponsored billions of dollars in German debt and held hundreds




                                                 28
of millions of dollars in European deposits. Those debts and deposits provided potential channels

for the transmission of the banking panic across the Atlantic.

       A wide range of evidence indicates, however, that American banks with substantial

foreign exposure survived the contraction. Most continued to pay dividends throughout the

depression. In other words, the debt and deposit links between the banking systems in Europe

and America did not convey the banking crisis across the Atlantic. The chronological correlation

of the banking crises in Germany and New York was coincidental, not causal.

       This realization raises several issues regarding the study of bank distress during the Great

Depression. The first pertains to the uniqueness of the United States central money market.

Scholars have long recognized that the pattern of bank distress in New York City differed from

the pattern of distress for the national as a whole. In New York City, few banks closed their

doors to depositors; while in the rest of the nation, nearly half of all banks went out of business.

Our study suggests that the behavior of the New York state banking department had much to do

with the stability of banks in the central money market. The superintendent’s office actively

merged weak banks with stronger institutions. The law required banks in New York City to hold

larger reserves and greater capital than depository institutions elsewhere in the nation. These

legal requirements left a large cushion between the onset of difficulties and the point of no

return. The superintendent used this cushion as a window of opportunity to resolve bank distress

short of receivership. The superintendent’s vigilance meant that few institutions failed in New

York City and those that did go out of business returned substantial sums to depositors.

       A second issue is the political economy of bank regulation. Regulators determined the

fate of many banks. What influenced the decisions made by bank regulators, such as the New

York Superintendent of Banks and his subordinates? Ideology, experience, politics, legislation,




                                                 29
and self interest all played a part. The superintendent’s treatment of troubled banks changed over

time. Changing economic conditions may have been one reason. The optimal method of

resolving financial difficulties depends on the short-term prospects for sustaining cash flow and

the long-term prospects for earning profits. Both factors fluctuated during the 1930s. Changing

legislation was another reason. Politicians provided the banking department with additional tools

for dealing with bedeviled banks. Political decisions also changed the incentives of the

superintendent, who had been appointed as a reformer in the spring of 1929 and was criticized as

incompetent two years later. The failure of The Bank of United States was the principal cause of

criticism. Its demise led to political pressures which pushed the superintendent of banks to take a

prophylactic approach towards imperiled banks.

       A third issue concerns correlations between events in financial centers in the United

States and Europe. Causal links may have created some of these correlations. But, this essay

shows that coincidences created others. This realization suggests that there is a danger of

drawing false inferences from correlations between events in different countries during the Great

Depression. With so many things going wrong in so many countries in such a short span of time,

numerous chronological correlations would have been generated by random chance.

       A final issue concerns the international transmission of the banking crisis in the summer

and fall of 1931. Numerous channels could have transmitted the financial crisis across the

Atlantic. Direct links between banks in Europe and the United States appear to have been

plausible candidates, but this essay demonstrates that those direct links did not, in fact, spread of

the affliction. Thus, golden fetters remain the principal explanation for the trans-Atlantic

transmission of the financial panic in the fall of 1931.

       While our conclusion conflicts with the claims of several recent scholars, it concurs with

the consensus of seminal scholars who have studied the issue, including Eichengreen, Friedman,

Schwartz, and Temin (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963; Eichengreen, 1981 and 1992; Temin, 1989

and 1993). Temin expresses this consensus clearly when he writes:

       In one of the most memorable acts of misguided monetary policy in history, the
       Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply in October 1931 to protect the dollar
       – in the midst of the greatest Depression the modern economy has ever known
       (Temin 1993 p. 96).

Our essay supports this statement, by demonstrating that the Federal Reserve’s actions were the

principal mechanism transmitting the banking panic of 1931 from Europe to the United States.

Banks operating in New York City held more foreign deposits and had greater foreign exposure

than banks operating elsewhere. Since high levels of foreign exposure did not force banks out of

business in New York City, it is unlikely that low levels of foreign exposure forced banks out of

business in other places. The policy predispositions engendered by the gold standard and the

Federal Reserves monetary missteps were the ultimate cause of the banking crisis that struck the

United States in the fall of 1931.

Notes: Deposits indicates the deposits held by the bank on the last call date before suspension. Deposit losses indicates the decline in
deposits between the last call date and the date of suspension. The information needed to calculate this figure exists only in the listed
cases. Days lost indicates the number of days between the last call date and the date of suspension, or in other words, the number of
days over which the decline in deposits was calculated. Borrowings indicates loans outstanding from the Federal Reserve and other
banks on the date of suspension. See Section 2 for definitions of the primary and contributing causes of suspensions. Asset indicates
that slow, doubtful, or worthless investments were a source of bank distress. Withdrawal indicates that withdrawals of deposits were a
source of bank distress. Defalcation indicates that embezzlement was a source of bank distress.

Notes: The consolidating bank was the institution suffering financial difficulties. The absorbing bank was a healthy
institution which took over the affairs of its weaker compatriot. Description of consolidation describes the financial details
of the transaction. “All except capital” indicates that the absorbing bank assumed all liabilities except the capital liability of
the consolidating institution and acquired all of its assets. “Assets and deposits” indicates that the absorbing bank assumed
only the deposit liabilities of the consolidating institution while acquiring all of its assets. “Liquidation basis” indicates that
the absorbing bank acquired all assets and liabilities of the consolidating bank, and if the assets proved more valuable than
the obligations of the consolidating institution, returned a portion of the surplus to the shareholders. Disposition indicates
what became of the offices of the consolidating bank. “Branch” indicates that the offices of the consolidating bank became
a branch of the absorbing institution. “Discontinued” indicates that the offices of the consolidating bank ceased operations.

Notes: The hazard function is a non-parametric estimate constructed by smoothing raw hazard
rates (i.e. the number of bank liquidations divided by the number of banks at risk each week and
the number of consolidations due to financial difficulties divided by the number of banks at risk
in each week). The kernel is Epanechnikov. The bandwidth is two weeks, which is wide enough
to reveal trends without obscuring short-term shifts in the probability of failure.

Notes: The series for consolidations is identical to that in Figure 1. The hazard rate for mergers
is a non-parametric estimate constructed by kernel-smoothing raw hazard rates (i.e. mergers per
week divided by number of banks at risk). The kernel is Epanechnikov. The bandwidth is five
weeks.
