                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines the depth and duration of the slump that invariably follows severe financial crises,
which tend to be protracted affairs. We find that asset market collapses are deep and prolonged. On
a peak-to-trough basis, real housing price declines average 35 percent stretched out over six years,
while equity price collapses average 55 percent over a downturn of about three and a half years. Not
surprisingly, banking crises are associated with profound declines in output and employment. The
unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points over the down phase of the cycle, which
lasts on average over four years. Output falls an average of over 9 percent, although the duration of
the downturn is considerably shorter than for unemployment. The real value of government debt tends
to explode, rising an average of 86 percent in the major post–World War II episodes. The main cause
of debt explosions is usually not the widely cited costs of bailing out and recapitalizing the banking
system. The collapse in tax revenues in the wake of deep and prolonged economic contractions is
a critical factor in explaining the large budget deficits and increases in debt that follow the crisis. Our
estimates of the rise in government debt are likely to be conservative, as these do not include increases
in government guarantees, which also expand briskly during these episodes.

                                      I. Introduction

       A year ago, we (Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2008a) presented a

historical analysis comparing the run-up to the 2007 U.S. subprime financial crisis with

the antecedents of other banking crises in advanced economies since World War II. We

showed that standard indicators for the United States, such as asset price inflation, rising

leverage, large sustained current account deficits, and a slowing trajectory of economic

growth, exhibited virtually all the signs of a country on the verge of a financial crisis—

indeed, a severe one. In this paper, we engage in a similar comparative historical analysis

that is focused on the aftermath of systemic banking crises.

       In our earlier analysis, we deliberately excluded emerging market countries from

the comparison set, in order not to appear to engage in hyperbole. After all, the United

States is a highly sophisticated global financial center. What can advanced economies

possibly have in common with emerging markets when it comes to banking crises? In

fact, as Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b) demonstrate, the antecedents and aftermath of

banking crises in rich countries and emerging markets have a surprising amount in

common. There are broadly similar patterns in housing and equity prices,

unemployment, government revenues and debt. Furthermore, the frequency or incidence

of crises does not differ much historically, even if comparisons are limited to the post–

World War II period (provided the ongoing late-2000s global financial crisis is taken into

account). Thus, this study of the aftermath of severe financial crises includes a number

of recent emerging market cases to expand the relevant set of comparators. Also included

in the comparisons are two prewar developed country episodes for which we have

housing price and other relevant data.




                                              2
       Broadly speaking, financial crises are protracted affairs. More often than not, the

aftermath of severe financial crises share three characteristics. First, asset market

collapses are deep and prolonged. Real housing price declines average 35 percent

stretched out over six years, while equity price collapses average 55 percent over a

downturn of about three and a half years. Second, the aftermath of banking crises is

associated with profound declines in output and employment. The unemployment rate

rises an average of 7 percentage points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on

average over four years. Output falls (from peak to trough) an average of over 9 percent,

although the duration of the downturn, averaging roughly two years, is considerably

shorter than for unemployment. Third, the real value of government debt tends to

explode, rising an average of 86 percent in the major post–World War II episodes.

Interestingly, the main cause of debt explosions is not the widely cited costs of bailing

out and recapitalizing the banking system. Admittedly, bailout costs are difficult to

measure, and there is considerable divergence among estimates from competing studies.

But even upper-bound estimates pale next to actual measured rises in public debt. In

fact, the big drivers of debt increases are the inevitable collapse in tax revenues that

governments suffer in the wake of deep and prolonged output contractions, as well as

often ambitious countercyclical fiscal policies aimed at mitigating the downturn.

                          I. The Historical Comparison Group

       Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a) included all the major postwar banking crises in the

developed world (a total of 18) and put particular emphasis on the ones dubbed “the big

five” (Spain 1977, Norway 1987, Finland, 1991, Sweden, 1991, and Japan, 1992). It is

now beyond contention that the present U.S. financial crisis is severe by any metric. As a




                                              3
result, we now focus only on systemic financial crises, including the “big five” developed

economy crises plus a number of famous emerging market episodes: the 1997–1998

Asian crisis (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand);

Colombia, 1998; and Argentina 2001. These are cases where we have all or most of the

relevant data that allows for thorough comparisons. Central to the analysis is historical

housing price data, which can be difficult to obtain and are critical for assessing the

present episode.1 We also include two earlier historical cases for which we have housing

prices, Norway in 1899 and the United States in 1929.

         II.      The Downturn after the Crisis: A Comparison of Depth and Duration

       Figure 1 looks at the bust phase in housing price cycles surrounding banking crises,

including the current episode in the United States and a number of other countries now

experiencing banking crises: Austria, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Spain, and the United

Kingdom. Ongoing crises are in dark shading, past crises are in light shading. The

cumulative decline in real housing prices from peak to trough averages 35.5 percent. 2

The most severe real housing price declines were experienced by Finland, the

Philippines, Colombia and Hong Kong. Their crashes were 50 to 60 percent, measured

from peak to trough. The housing price decline experienced by the United States to date

during the current episode (almost 28 percent according to the Case–Shiller index) is

already more than twice that registered in the U.S. during the Great Depression.

    In Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b), we look at financial crises in 66 countries over 200 years, emphasizing

the broad parallels between emerging markets and developing counties, including for example the nearly

universal run-up in government debt.

    The historical average, which is shaded in black in the diagram, does not include the ongoing crises.

             Notably, the duration of housing price declines is quite long-lived, averaging roughly

         six years. Even excluding the extraordinary experience of Japan (with its 17 consecutive

         years of price declines), the average remains over five years.

                                                                    Figure 1

Notes: Each banking crisis episode is identified by country and the beginning year of the crisis. Only major
(systemic) banking crises episodes are included, subject to data limitations. The historical average reported does not
include ongoing crises episodes. For the ongoing episodes, the calculations are based on data through the following
periods: October 2008, monthly, for Iceland and Ireland; 2007, annual, for Hungary; and 2008:Q3, quarterly, for all
others. Consumer price indices are used to deflate nominal house prices.


             As figure 2 illustrates, the equity price declines that accompany banking crises are far

         steeper than are housing price declines, if somewhat shorter lived. The shorter duration of

         the downturn when compared with real estate prices is consistent with the observation

         that equity prices are far less inertial. The average historical decline in equity prices is

         55.9 percent, with the downturn phase of the cycle lasting 3.4 years. Notably, during the


                                                                           5
            current cycle, Iceland and Austria have already experienced peak-to-trough equity price

            declines far exceeding the average of the historical comparison group.

             It is interesting to note in Figure 3 that when it comes to banking crises, the emerging

         markets, particularly those in Asia, seem to do better in terms of unemployment than do

         the advanced economies. While there are well-known data issues in comparing




                                                                    7
unemployment rates across countries, 3 the relatively poor performance in advanced

countries suggests the possibility that greater (downward) wage flexibility in emerging

markets may help cushion employment during periods of severe economic distress. The

gaps in the social safety net in emerging market economies, when compared to industrial

ones, presumably also make workers more anxious to avoid becoming unemployed.

      Figure 4 looks at the cycles in real per capita GDP around banking crises. The

average magnitude of the decline, at 9.3 percent, is stunning. Admittedly, for the post–

World War II period, the declines in real GDP are smaller for advanced economies than

for emerging market economies. A probable explanation for the more severe

contractions in emerging market economies is that they are prone to abrupt reversals in

the availability of foreign credit. When foreign capital comes to a “sudden stop,” to use

the phrase coined by Guillermo Calvo, Alejandro Izquierdo, and Rudy Loo-Kung (2006),

economic activity heads into a tailspin.4

      Compared to unemployment, the cycle from peak to trough in GDP is much shorter,

only two years. Presumably, this is partly because potential GDP growth is positive, and

we are measuring only absolute changes in income, not gaps relative to potential output.

Even so, the recessions surrounding financial crises have to be considered unusually long

compared to normal recessions that typically last less than a year.5 Indeed, multiyear

recessions typically only occur in economies that require deep restructuring, such as

    Notably, widespread “underemployment” in many emerging markets is not captured in the official

unemployment statistics.

    When no foreign financing is possible, emerging markets have seen consumption and investment

implode during severe financial crises.

         (the latter not only due to its financial collapse, but also due to the need to reorient the

         economy in light of China’s rise). Banking crises, of course, usually require painful

         restructuring of the financial system, and so are an important example of this general

         principle.

         historical data on domestic debt, show that this same buildup in government debt has

         been a defining characteristic of the aftermath of banking crises for over a century. We

         look at percentage increase in debt, rather than debt-to-GDP, because sometimes steep

         output drops would complicate interpretation of debt–GDP ratios. As Reinhart and

         Rogoff (2008b) note, the characteristic huge buildups in government debt are driven

         mainly by sharp falloffs in tax revenue and, in many cases, big surges in government

         spending to fight the recession. The much ballyhooed bank bailout costs are, in several

         cases, only a relatively minor contributor to post–financial crisis debt burdens.

                                III. Concluding Remarks

       An examination of the aftermath of severe financial crises shows deep and lasting

effects on asset prices, output and employment. Unemployment rises and housing price

declines extend out for five and six years, respectively. On the encouraging side, output

declines last only two years on average. Even recessions sparked by financial crises do

eventually end, albeit almost invariably accompanied by massive increases in

government debt.


       How relevant are historical benchmarks for assessing the trajectory of the current

global financial crisis? On the one hand, the authorities today have arguably more

flexible monetary policy frameworks, thanks particularly to a less rigid global exchange

rate regime. Some central banks have already shown an aggressiveness to act that was

notably absent in the 1930s, or in the latter-day Japanese experience. On the other hand,

one would be wise not to push too far the conceit that we are smarter than our

predecessors. A few years back many people would have said that improvements in

financial engineering had done much to tame the business cycle and limit the risk of

financial contagion.

       Since the onset of the current crisis, asset prices have tumbled in the United States

and elsewhere along the tracks lain down by historical precedent. The analysis of the

post-crisis outcomes in this paper for unemployment, output and government debt

provide sobering benchmark numbers for how the crisis will continue to unfold. Indeed,

these historical comparisons were based on episodes that, with the notable exception of

the Great Depression in the United States, were individual or regional in nature. The

global nature of the crisis will make it far more difficult for many countries to grow their



                                             11
way out through higher exports, or to smooth the consumption effects through foreign

borrowing. In such circumstances, the recent lull in sovereign defaults is likely to come

to an end. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b) highlight, defaults in emerging market

economies tend to rise sharply when many countries are simultaneously experiencing

domestic banking crises.
