                                               ABSTRACT



        We consider the effect of abortion legalization on births in the United States.         A simple

theoretical    model demonstrates     that the impact of abortion     legalization   on the birth rate is

ambiguous, because both pregnancy and abortion decisions could be affected.             We use variation

in the timing of legalization      across states in the early 1970’s to estimate the effect of abortion

on birth rates.     Our findings indicate that states legalizing abortion experienced    a 5% decline in

births relative to other states.    The decline among teens, women over 35, and nonwhite women

was even greater: 1390, 8Y0, and 1290 respectively.        Out-of-wedlock    births declined by twice as

much as births in wedlock.      If legalization in some states affected birth rates in neighboring   states

(through travel to obtain an abortion), comparing births between states will underestimate              the

actual reduction.     Using more distant comparison states increases the estimated impact of abortion

legalization   on birth rates to about 8%. Applying this estimate to the current level of births, a

complete decriminalization      of abortion would result in 320,000 additional births per year.

I. INTRODUCTION

        Since the early 1970’s, and certainly following the Supreme Court decision in Roe v.

Wade in 1973, abortion policy has been one of the most contentious issues in American politics.

Although    positions   are largely developed        on philosophical    and moral grounds,     the empirical

magnitude    of the effect of legal access to abortion is both important and rarely studied.                 Our

purpose in this paper is to estimate the effects of abortion legalization and the Roe decision on

birth rates in the United States.

        Recent research regarding the effects of abortion policy on fertility behavior has focused

on relatively minor restrictions     on abortion access, such as Medicaid funding restrictions               and

parental consent laws, rather than abortion legalization itself (c. f. Blank et al., 1994; Lundberg

and Plotnick,     1995; and Currie,      et al. , forthcoming).         Occasionally,   researchers     obtained

surprising restilts.    Papers by Kane and Staiger (1996), bvine            et al. (1996), and Matthews et

al. (1995) indicate that restrictions on the use of state Medicaid funds to pay for abortions leads

to fewer abortions,       but to either no change or possibly even a reduction             in births.     These

findings are consistent with a model of fertility behavior where women are less likely to get

pregnant in response to an increase in the cost of an abortion.           If criminalized abortion is viewed

as a very substantial increase in its cost, then an extrapolation          of these findings would suggest

that birth rates may similarly be unaffected or even reduced if abortion was made illegal.

        Our purpose in this paper is to address the impact of abortion legalization             in the United

States on women’s fertility behavior.            First, we present a model indicating it is quite possible

that the effects of abortion      legalization     are different than an extrapolation      of the effects of

relatively minor restrictions    on abortions,      such as Medicaid funding.       The fact that birth rates

appear to be largely umffected       by those restrictions     does not necessarily imply that we should

expect birth rates to be unaffected by legalization.           Second, we use variation in the timing of

abortion liberalization     across states to estimate the effects on birth rates in the United States.

Using birth data from Vital Statistics between the years 1965 and 1980 and data from the 1980


                                                         1
Census, we examine three different types of quasi-experiments.           First, the change in birth rates

in “treatment     group” states following    liberalization   can be compared    to changes in “control

group” states, where the legal status of abortion was unaltered prior to 1973,          Second, in 1973

the treatment reversed.      States that previously had not legalized abortion underwent a treatment

and can be compared to states that legalized before Roe v. Wade.           Finally, birth rates in states

legalizing   abortion prior to 1973 can be compared to control group states that vary by their

distance to a legal state.    Since women could travel to a legal state and are more likely to do so

if they are closer, such comparisons       by distance can examine the extent to which birth rates in

control group states also declined as a result of access to legal abortions in other states.

        Our findings indicate that legalization of abortion prior to Roe v. Wade in a handful of

states in 1970 resulted in a 5 % decline in birth rates in those states.    The Roe decision itself led

to a decline in births in affected states of roughly equal magnitude.      Teens, women over 35, and

nonwhite women in early legalization        states experienced   a greater reduction in births of 13%,

8%, and 12% respectively.          Out-of-wedlock    births declined by twice as much as births in-

wedlock.      Further   evidence   indicates that these statistics are understated    because of travel

between states.    The overall birth rate in states legalizing abortion in 1970 fell by 4% relative

to births in neighboring     states but by twice that relative to far away states.   Incorporating   these

“spillover effects” increases the estimated impact of abortion legalization on birth rates to about

8% nationwide.



II. PREVIOUS       RESEARCH        ON ABORTION        LEGALIZATION

        Before proceeding      with this amlysis,   we briefly summarize     the research conducted     to

date on the effects of abortion legalization.       Most studies have focused on the experience of a

few states that fully legalized abortion in 1970 (Bauman, et al., 1977; Joyce and Mocan, 1990;

Kramer, 1975; Quick, 1978; and Tietze, 1973), ignoring the impact of the Roe v. Wade decision

in 1973.     These studies typically rely on a comparison of fertility behavior before and after the


                                                     2
change in law within those states.           This approach is likely to be confounded by general declines

in fertility occurring in the 1960s and early 1970s.

           The exception is Sklar and Berkov (1974), who compare the decline in birth rates from

1965 to 1971 in states that liberalized their abortion laws versus states that did not.          While they

find abortion liberalization       was associated with a 2% decline in birth rates, this estimate may

understate the true effect because women from states with restrictive abortion laws were known

to travel to the more liberal states to obtain abortions (Pakter et al., 1973; Potts et al., 1977),

Moreover,      births in states with no legal changes are compared to all states that had undertaken

any type of liberalization,       from outright repeal to modest reform laws that would be expected

to have very different         effects on the birth rate.        Furthermore,   it is unclear   whether     the

experience of these early liberalization         states is applicable to the states that were later affected

by the Roe decision,         since women in more conservative       states that did not liberalize might be

less likely to obtain an abortion even after legaltiation.



III. MODEL OF FERTILITY               BEHAVIOR

           In this section we develop a stylized model that shows that the relationship between birth

rates and the cost of abortion         is ambiguous.        Impo~ntly,   this model demonstrates        that if

abortion     is relatively   inexpensive,    a large increase in the cost of abortion could reduce the

number of abortions and lead to a higher birth rate.             A small increase in the cost of abortion,

however, may lower the number of abortions through a reduction in the number of pregnancies,

leaving the number of births largely umffected.             Thus, we cannot necessarily expect the impact

of, say, a repeal of Roe v. Wade to be similar to the recent experience with modest restrictions

on abortion access.

           In this stylized model, suppose that a woman can choose her risk of getting pregnant,

PP,~~. There is a cost associated            with pregnancy     avoidance,   C(PP,.B), that increases     at an

increasing rate as the probability          of getting pregnant is reduced (C’ < 0 and C”        > O). If a


                                                        3
woman becomes pregnant, she can either give birth or have an abortion.                     Let the cost of having

an abortion be A and of giving birth be B, where both types of cost include monetary                                   and

psychic costs. 1 If a woman acts to minimize costs, then the optimal choice of PP,,~can be found

by working backwards.             Once a woman becomes pregnant,              she chooses to give birth only if

B <A. Thus, the cost of a pregnancy is min(A,B).                Prior to becoming pregnant, a woman solves

a simple cost minimization          problem:


                                    Minimize    PP,.~omin(A,B)         + C(PP,,~)
                                     PP,.E

The assumption       that there are increasing          marginal      costs of reducing    the risk of pregnancy

(C” > O) guarantees that dPP,,~/dA <0.                 Thus, an increase in the cost of abortion will induce

a women to reduce her pregnancy risk.

          The implications       of this model are illustrated in Figure 1, This figure shows that if the

cost of an abortion       is low enough        (i.e.    less than the cost of giving        birth,     B),         then all

pregnancies     are aborted.       Within this range, an increase in the cost of abortion                    lowers the

probability     of getting       pregnant   as the      alternative     of using    more   effective         and     costly

contraception     becomes more desirable.         The probability       of giving birth, however, is unaffected

by the increase in abortion cost.           On the other hand, if there is a large increase in the cost of

abortion so that it passes the threshold set by the cost of giving birth (A > B), then women who

become pregmnt        will choose to give birth rather than abort.              Since abortion is no longer an

option,    further   increases     in the cost of abortion         beyond    this level have no effect on the

probability     of becoming pregmnt.

          The implications       of the model are similar if the cost of giving birth is uncertain at the

time pregnancy       decisions     are made.     Between the time of getting pregmnt                 and the time of




     lFor those women who want to have a baby (i.e. B is negative), it is straightforward to show
that the solution to this problem is to set P ,eg = 1 and the abortion decision is irrelevant. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that fi 1s positive.

                                                            4
deciding on an abortion (generally 2-3 months), a woman may update her expectations              about the

cost of giving birth based on new information such as the reaction of the father or other family

members to the pregnancy. 2 Such a model would indicate that responses to a change in the cost

of abortion are “smoothed”,        rather than discrete as highlighted    in Figure 1. For example,      as

the cost of abortion approaches the expected value of the cost of giving birth, some women may

receive a relatively     low realized value of B and choose to give birth rather than abort.             In

addition,    small increases in the cost of abortion may actually reduce the probability        of giving

birth in a model with uncertainty:       When the cost of abortion is very low, births may increase

as more women         get pregnant    so that they may observe      the value of B and then make a

subsequent decision regarding birth. 3 Thus, when the cost of giving birth is uncertain at the time

of becoming      pregnant,    the relationship   between   the birth rate and the cost of abortion       is

ambiguous     and may even be non-monotonic.

        This simple model demonstrates           that small increases in the cost of abortion     may be

associated    with large decreases      in abortion   but no change      or even a decrease     in births.

However,     the relationship between the cost of abortion and the birth rate can be both non-linear

and non-monotonic        so that larger increases in the cost of abortion may lead to more births.

Thus, even the sign of the relationship between abortion cost and the birth rate is necessarily an

empirical question.    Moreover,     the recent experience with relatively modest abortion restrictions

is of no use if one wishes to evaluate the potential         impact of more dramatic     restrictions   on

abortion access.




     2Within this framework, access to abortion is different from access to birth control in at least
one important respect: abortion access alone provides insurance against the contingency that the
information learned after pregnancy makes motherhood less attractive.

     3The implications       of this model are similar to the model developed      in Kane and Staiger
(forthcoming).

                                                      5
IV.   DATA AND METHODOLOGY

        We use the legislative history of abortion legalization across states to identify the effects

of the policy change on birth rates.        Table 1 summarizes      this legislative history.     For several

decades prior to 1967, all abortions were illegal in every state in America.            Between 1967 and

1970 a number of states implemented           modest reforms making it legal for women to obtain

abortions under special circumstances,      such as rape or incest. Abortion became widely available

in five states in 1970 following          repeal of anti-abortion     laws in four states (New York,

Washington,   Alaska, and Hawaii) and a “de facto” legalization           in Califomia.4        Following     the

1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, abortion became legal in all states.

        This legislative history enables us to categorize states by abortion legality in different

years and provides the means to estimate the nationwide impact of legalization.                 We employ a

quasi-experimental   design, defining so-called control and treatment groups and analyzing them

in much the same way that analysts examine randomized trials.             Three different types of quasi-

experiments   are considered.    First,    the effect of liberalization     in states that changed          their

abortion laws prior to Roe v. Wade (the treatment group) can be identified by comparing                     birth

rates in these states to birth rates in states where the legal status of abortion was unaltered prior

to 1973 (the control group).    Two treatment groups are available to compare to control group

states. 5 In the analysis to follow we label these groups “repeal states” (among which we include



     41n late 1969, the California State Supreme Court         ruled that the pre-1967 law outlawing
abortion was unconstitutioml.     Furthermore, evidence       indicates that legal abortion was widely
available in California beginning in 1970, with legal         abortion rates among women living in
California being comparable to rates for women living          in New York. See Potts et al. (1977)
pp. 75-77, 149, and see Garrow (1994) pp. 377-80,              410-411, 457, and references cited in
footnotes 25 and 76 from chapter 7.

     5Another group of states may also be defined in which the status of existing abortion
prohibitions was unclear on the basis of lower court rulings. We have attempted to analyze this
group of states as an alternative treatment group and found no significant difference in fertility
patterns between women in these states and control group states. The power of this analysis is
limited, however, because of the difficulty involved in defining which states belong in this
category. Complications include the level of the court decision, the status of an appeal, and
temporary stays on prior rulings. For this reason, these states are included in the “control

                                                     6
California   beginning   in 1970), “reform states, ” and “control states, ” as classified in Table 1.

Second, in 1973 the treatment reversed.          The effect of Roe v. Wade in treatment group states

that had not previously     legalized abortion can be identified by comparing          birth rates in these

states to a control group of states that had legalized earlier.

        The results of these analyses may be biased toward zero if, prior to the Roe decision,

women travelled to early legalization         states to have an abortion.      To examine this bias, we

consider a third quasi-experiment,       comparing    birth rates in states legalizing abortion prior to

1973 to control groups of states that vary by their distance to a legal state.         Since women could

travel to a legal state and are more likely to do so if they are closer, such comparisons                 by

distance can address the extent to which birth rates in control group states also declined as a

result of access to legal abortions in other states.        Among states that had not legalized abortion

prior to 1973 (“non-repeal states”), we calculate whether the state is within 250 miles of a repeal

state, 250-750    miles from a repeal state, or more than 750 miles from a repeal state.                 All

distances are calculated as the straight-line distance from each state’s population centroid to the

population   centroid of the nearest county in a repeal state.

        Two types of amlyses are performed within this quasi-experimental           framework.     The first

simply compares average birth rates between groups of states (weighted by state population                of

women age 15-45) over the period 1965-1980.               Second, we use regression analysis to estimate

the differences   in log birth rates between groups of states.       These regressions control for fixed

state and year effects, state-specific     linear trends, and a set of state-level control variables that

capture the socioeconomic     environment      that vary across states in a nonlinear reamer       and may

influence birth rates. b The regressions       are weighted by state population      and utilize over 800



group” in the amlysis     reported here.

    bThe state-level control variables include per capita income,         the crime rate,    and the insured
unemployment rate, The first two variables are obtained from               the Statistical   Abstract of the
United States, and the insured unemployment rate is obtained              from the U.S.       Department of
bbor, Employment and Training Administration (1983), Per                  capita income      and the insured

                                                      7
observations     (16 years for each of the 50 states and Washington       D. C. ).7     In both types of

analyses we examine whether any difference         in birth rates emerges between groups of states

following liberalization,   and whether this difference dissipates after abortion is legalized in all

states in 1973.

        We estimate the effects of abortion policies on birth rates, which are defined as the

number of births observed per 1,000 women of the appropriate demographic             group.   The number

of births by age and race of the mother, state of residence, and year are obtained for the years

1965-80 from Vital Statistics of the United States.     The age groups we consider are 15-19, 20-

34, and 35-44.     Population estimates are obtained from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses, and

the population    for intercensal years is linearly interpolated using these data.     We also examine

the impact of abortion legalization on births by “legitimacy status” using data from the 1980

Census. g These data contain the state of birth and quafler and year of birth for all respondents

as well as quarter and year of first marriage for all adults.      For all births occurring      between

1965 and 1979, we identify an “illegitimate” birth to be one where the child was born prior to

the mother’s first marriage.9




unemployment    rate are included to control for differences in economic conditions across
locations and the crime rate is included to control for differences in the social environment
within which pregmncy/birth    decisions are made.

    7A few observations     are omitted because of missing data on some of the control variables.

     ‘Births by legitimacy status are only reported for a subset of states in Vital Statistics, For
this research, the lack of statistics for California and New York in the earlier years of our
sample period makes the use of these data impossible. Sklar and Berkov (1974) circumvented
this problem by contacting these states directly. We attempted this approach as well, but were
informed that some of these unpublished records from so long ago were no longer available.

     9Legitimacy status cannot be detemined for about 10% of children in the Census.        We
estimated models of births by legitimacy status treating the missings as both legitimate and by
dropping them from the sample. We report results obtained when the missing data are dropped,
but results from both sets of estimates were similar.

V, RESULTS

A.   Nationwide    Patterns

        Figure 2 graphs birth rates on a log scale from 1965 to 1980 separately for women age

15-44 living in repeal states and for women living in states that had no law change until 1973.

Birth rates fell sharply in repeal states between 1970 and 1972, by approximately       10%. It is not

surprising that the declines in birth rates first appear in 1971, since most abortions are performed

in the first trimester and would show up in birth rates 6-9 months later.         The decline in birth

rates is difficult to interpret,   however, because birth rates were falling in states with no law

change as well.     It is possible that some other factor was causing a general decline in birth rates

for all women, and that the decline in repeal states camot be attributed to abortion legalization.

Alternatively,    the observed decline in states with no law change may have been the result of

improved abortion access for those women who were able to travel to a repeal state.

        The difference      in birth rates between repeal states and states with no law change is

presented in Figure 3. The pattern shows that differences are roughly constant through 1970.

A sharp drop of about 6% is observed in 1971 that remains through 1973, indicating that birth

rates fell in repeal states relative to states with no law change during this period. Through 1974-

75 the difference narrows and then by 1976 and onward, there is very little difference again.

In other words, birth rates fell in repeal states relative to states with no law change in exactly

the years in which abortion was only legal in repeal states. The partial rebound in 1974-75 may

indicate that abortion access in states affected by Roe v. Wade may have grown less quickly

following   this decision compared to the rapid introduction     of abortion services in repeal states

in 1970.    Corresponding     figures for reform states versus states with no legal changes show no

distinctive pattern and are not displayed here for purposes of brevity.

        The effect of abortion legalization on births by age are presented in Figure 4. The first

pattern that may be observed in this figure is that repeal states and states with no law change had

very different time series patterns in births by age.     In particular,   a delay in childbearing   that


                                                    9
was stronger in repeal states relative to states with no law change is apparent.              Births to teens

fell over time in repeal states when compared to states with no law change; the opposite was true

for women 35-44.        Nevertheless,     a reduction in births in 1970 and a rebound in 1973 in repeal

states relative to states with no law change is observed in all age groups.           The trend among teens

and older women makes it difficult to assess the size of the treatment effect for these groups.

For women 20-34 it appears that births to women in repeal states dropped                     by roughly   5%

relative to women in states with no law change after 1970 and then fully rebounded by 1974.

         Differences    in birth rates among nonwhite women between repeal states and states with

no law change are shown in Figure 5. Here, we see that a tremendous drop in births of roughly

15-20 % occurred during the 1971-73 period in repeal states compared to the pre-1970 period.

However, the rebound in births in states that legalized abortion in 1973 is quite small. This may

indicate that other changes took place in the early 1970’s that differentially           affected birth rates

of nonwhite women in repeal and other states.

        Figure 6 displays differences         in legitimate    and illegitimate   birth rates between repeal

states and states with no law change.           Illegitimate   births appear to be a noisier measure and

estimated differences    are somewhat erratic.       Nevertheless,     a significant downward drop on the

order of 10-15% in the difference in the rate of illegitimate births is observed between 1971 and

1973.   The difference in the legitimate birth rate is roughly 5 % over this period.

        These results can be summarized           and extended by the regression         results, reported in

Table 2, where the dependent variable is the log birth rate. The regressions control for state and

year fixed effects, state-specific trends and some socioeconomic characteristics           of the state. The

coefficients   reported in Table 2 are for a series of dummy variables that indicate whether the

state was in a repeal or reform state and also whether it was a year of abortion liberalization

prior to Roe (e.g. 1971-73 in repeal states), one of the years immediately following Roe (1974-

75), or a later year (1976-80).         Note that these time periods lag the legal changes by one year,

since abortion access is expected to influence birth rates with a 6-9 month lag.                The omitted


                                                        10
category in the regressions is states with no law change prior to Roe, so all estimates are relative

to these states.     Inclusion of state effects in the regressions accounts for any differences that exist

between     states prior to abortion      liberalization.    Thus, for example,   the first coefficient   in

Column 1 of Table 2 indicates that birth rates were about 5 % lower in repeal states relative to

states with no law change in 1971-73, net of any difference that existed prior to 1971.

          Findings reported in Table 2 are strongly supportive of an effect of abortion legalization

on birth rates.      Overall, births in repeal states fell by 5 % relative to states with no law change

between 1971 and 1973.          No statistically significant difference in births between the two sets of

states is observed        in 1974-75 or 1976-80.      Parameter   estimates by age, race, and legitimacy

status are consistent with the patterns found in Figures 4 - 6.           In repeal states, teen and older

women’s birth rates fell by 13% and 8%, respectively,              compared to women in states with no

law change.        This difference disappeared     in the years following Roe v. Wade, although more

slowly for teen births.        Births to nonwhite women in repeal states fell by 12% just following

repeal,   but were still over 7 % lower than births in other states by the 1976-80 period.

Illegitimate   births also fell by twice the rate of legitimate births (7,2% versus 3.6%) in repeal

states between 1971 and 1973.10 This difference was also eliminated in the years following Roe

v. Wade.       Further,    a comparison   of reform states and states with no law change provides no

evidence that modest abortion liberalization reduced birth rates.         Therefore,   states are combined

into repeal and “non-repeal”       states in all subsequent amlyses.




     l~he larger effect of legalization on teens and older women, and on illegitimate births is
consistent with the fertility model presented above. In that model, abortion restrictions could
only reduce births for those women with a positive cost of giving birth. Women who “want”
to have a baby would have a negative cost of giving birth and the model predicts no effect on
births for these women. The groups whose birth rates are most affected by legalization are those
for whom the cost of giving birth is more likely to be positive.

                                                        11
B. GeoErauhic Patterns

          Women from non-repeal states are known to have travelled to repeal states to obtain an

abortion before Roe v. Wade. 11 In effect , this amounts to a contamination              of the experimental

design,    i.e. birth rates in non-repeal     states may have fallen as the result of access to legal

abortion in nearby repeal states.       To the extent that this occurs, the relative decline in birth rates

in repeal states will understate the true effect of abortion legalization on birth rates.           One way

to determine         the extent of such “spillover   effects” on birth rates in non-repeal       states is to

differentiate   them by how far they are to a repeal state.        If the cost of having an abortion rises

with travel distance, differences in birth rates between repeal states and more distant non-repeal

states may provide a more accurate estimate of the total effect abortion legalization had on birth

rates.

          Evidence of these geographic patterns is presented in Figure 7, which graphs differences

in birth rates between repeal states and non-repeal         states differentiated     by their distance to a

repeal state.    This figure shows that birth rates in repeal states were trending higher relative to

“neighboring”        states (within 250 miles), but trending lower relative to far away states (more than

750 miles).     Abstracting from these trends, differences in births show a significant dip and then

rebound     in all sets of states between       1971 and 1973.       This pattern     is exaggerated     when

comparing repeal states to farther away states, as we would expect if women living near repeal

states travelled to those states to get abortions.

          Patterns    observed   in these figures are formalized    in a regression     framework      and are

reported in Table 3. These regressions          are analogous to those reported in Table 2 except that

the effect of abortion legaltiation      is allowed to vary with the distance from the repeal state to

the non-repeal states.      Following legalization in 1970, births in repeal states fell by about 4.3%,

6.1 %, and 8% relative to non-repeal states that are less than 250 miles away, between 250 and




     llFor example,       see the discussion in Potts et al. (1977), pp. 76, 349, 354-56,

                                                      12
750 miles away, and greater than 750 miles away, respectively.                     This finding suggests that

abortion legalization          in repeal states had a sizable impact on birth rates in nearby states that

would make the relative decline in repeal states appear smaller.

         Another      interesting    pattern in the results reported in Table 3 is the rate at which the

difference in birth rates converged between early !egaltiation states and states legalizing in 1973.

In the set of states closest to early legalization              states, there was no statistically   significant

difference in birth rates by the 1974-75 period.               The rate of convergence    was slower in states

further away,        In the set of states furthest from early legalization         states, a smaller,   but still

statistically    significant    difference   in birth rates is observed during the 1974-75 period before

convergence       is observed by the 1976-80 period.           This pattern is consistent with a slower growth

in abortion access in these states.           As reported in Table 4, in 1976 states further from repeal

states still had lower abortion rates, had a lower percentage of women in counties with abortion

providers,      and had a much larger fraction of women living more than 50 miles from the nearest

abortion provider.

         These estimates         can be used to estimate the extent of spillover.          If we assume that

legalization in repeal states had no impact on the birth rate in states more than 750 miles away,

then these estimates imply that abortion legalization reduced birth rates by 8% in repeal states. 12

By implication,      spillover effects on birth rates in states within 250 miles of repeal states were

3.7 % (equal to the 8% reduction in births in repeal states relative to far away states less the

4.3 % reduction relative to states within 250 miles), and 1.9% (8% less 6.1%) in states between

250 and 750 miles from repeal states. Taking a weighted average of all women by their distance

to a repeal state, these estimates           imply that   births to women in all non-repeaf states fell by

about 2 % as some women travelled to repeal states to have abortions performed before Roe v.

Wade legalized abortion mtionwide.



     12To the extent that this assumption           is invalid, the estimated effect of repealing abortion
prohibitions will still be understated.

                                                          13
VI.    DISCUSSION

           This analysis has examined the effect of abortion legalization     on births in the United

States.     A stylized model of fertility behavior was presented indicating that the predicted effect

cannot be extrapolated     from the effect of more modest restrictions on a woman’s ability to have

an abortion.     In particular, more modest restrictions may reduce abortions as well as births while

more severe restrictions     may lead to an increase in births.

           Then we presented three separate quasi-experimental    estimates of the effect of abortion

legalization.    We showed that birth rates in states that legalized abortion prior to Roe v. Wade

took about a 5 % drop following legalization relative to states that experienced no change in their

law.      This effect was completely reversed following the Roe v. Wade decision.      The reduction

in births following legalization was largest for teens (13%) and older women (8%), for nonwhite

women (12 %), and for illegitimate births (7%). We also provided evidence suggesting that these

estimates are actually too low because women living near repeal states travelled to those states

to obtain an abortion.    Based on a comparison with states far from repeal states, we estimate that

spillover effects led to at least a 2% reduction in birth rates in non-repeal states before Roe v.

Wade.      Combining these estimates, we find that abortion legalization led to about a 7-8% decline

in births nationwide,     and the Roe decision itself led to a 5-6% decline in births in non-repeal

states. 13

           What do these results tell us about the potential effects on births of a change in the

current legal status of abortion?     If abortion became illegal everywhere    in the United States as

a result of, say, a constitutioml    amendment outlawing abortion, we might expect an 8 YO rise in

birth rates.    If Roe v. Wade was overturned     by the Supreme Court and states had the right to



     ‘3These estimates may be obtained in one of two ways. The total effect of legalization may
be implied from the 8% effect on birth rates in 1971-73 between repeal states and control states
more than 750 miles away from a repeal state. It may also be derived from the initial 5 % effect
estimated in Table 2 plus the estimated 2% spillover effect. The effect of the Roe decision itself
can be calculated as the 7-8% total effect of Iegaltiation less the 2% spillover effect generated
from women traveling to repeal states prior to the Roe ruling.

                                                    14
outlaw abortion, the effect would depend upon the number of states in which abortion remained

legal and their geographic    distribution. 14 If only a few states, including California   and New

York, maintained the legality of abortion, then our findings indicate that births may still increase

by as much as 5-6% in those states that decriminalize abortion.      Obviously,   if more states kept

abortion legal, the effect on births would be smaller as spillover effects arising from interstate

travel to obtain abortions would increase.   Applying these estimates to the current level of births,

a reversal of the Roe decision that left abortion legal in the five states that had legalized in 1970

would result in an increase in births on the order of 150,000 per year (5% of the roughly 3

million births in those states that decriminalized).   Based on the approximately    4 million births

nationwide   in 1993, we estimate that a complete decriminalization     of abortion would result in

perhaps as many as 320,000 additional births per year.




      14Currently, 13 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and South Dakota) have laws on the
books that would likely make abortion illegal if Roe v. Wade was overturned (Alan Guttmacher
Institute, 1989).

Court’s decision that the pre-1967 state abortion law was     unconstitutional and evidence
that legal abortions were comrnordy practiced in the state    by 1970 (c. f. Garrow, 1994;
