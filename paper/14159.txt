                                             ABSTRACT

We investigate whether information technology can help physicians more efficiently acquire new knowledge
in a clinical environment characterized by information overload. Our analysis makes use of data from
a randomized trial as well as a theoretical model of the influence that information technology has on
the acquisition of new medical knowledge. Although the theoretical framework we develop is conventionally
microeconomic, the model highlights the non-market and non-pecuniary influence activities that have
been emphasized in the sociological literature on technology diffusion. We report three findings.
First, empirical evidence and theoretical reasoning suggests that computer based decision support will
speed the diffusion of new medical knowledge when physicians are coping with information overload.
 Secondly, spillover effects will likely lead to "underinvestment" in this decision support technology.
 Third, alternative financing strategies common to new information technology, such as the use of
marketing dollars to pay for the decision support systems, may lead to undesirable outcomes if physician
information overload is sufficiently severe and if there is significant ambiguity in how best to respond
to the clinical issues identified by the computer.

1. Introduction

       Economists who study incentives in organizations have given much attention to problems

that arise when information is scarce. Indeed the premise of the vast literature on optimal

incentives is that principals have incomplete knowledge about agents and their actions. It has

long been recognized, however, that other important features of organizations are the result of

managing a superabundance of information, but economic research on these aspects of

organizations is less well developed (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000). We consider economic

issues that arise when agents are presented with more information than they can handle.

       The focus of our study is information overload among physicians. In medicine, the

number and variety of diseases and treatments threaten to overwhelm the information processing

capacities of individual doctors. This complexity is magnified by the rapid growth of new,

medically- relevant, knowledge. Failure to cope with this flood of information can cause

physicians to overlook important new treatments or new findings concerning the recommended

use of existing treatments. The net result is reduced care quality and slow diffusion of new

medical innovations (Institute Of Medicine Committee On Quality Of Health Care In America,

2000; 2001).

       We investigate how information technology (abbreviated as IT) can help physicians cope

with information overload. Our analysis focuses on a particular type of computer system that has

drawn considerable attention in the medical community and in public policy debates: a physician

decision support tool. The system we study combines information from insurance billing records,

pharmacies and labs to construct an electronic medical record for each patient. Information from

this record is then passed through a sophisticated artificial intelligence program that compares

treatment received with protocols drawn from the medical literature. If a discrepancy between
actual and recommended care is observed, a message is sent to the physician. This message

might recommend that a certain patient is a good candidate for a specific lab or test.

Alternatively the message might suggest that specific medications should be taken or stopped.

The message includes citations to the medical literature, allowing the physician to read and

assess the relevance of the literature to the patient’s particular circumstances. By sending timely

and targeted messages to physicians about evidence-based treatment protocols, the system can

help doctors improve care quality and also increase the rate of diffusion of new medical

knowledge.

       Our analysis is both empirical and theoretical. On the empirical side we review evidence

about the diffusion of medical knowledge. This review provides necessary context for

understanding findings from a randomized prospective trial suggesting that computer based

decision support tools can substantially enhance the diffusion of new medical knowledge among

physicians. On the theory side we construct a model of physician learning that is consistent with

the stylized facts about knowledge diffusion. Although the framework we develop is

conventionally microeconomic, the model highlights the non-market and non-pecuniary

influence activities that have been emphasized in the sociological literature on technology

diffusion (Skinner and Staiger, 2005). Using this model we consider both the likely effect of IT

systems on physician learning and whether private incentives are sufficient to support optimal

investments in information technology. This last issue is particularly important for public policy

because the Federal government is beginning large scale projects to promote the use of IT




                                                                                                   1
enabled decision support tools in health care (Mullaney, 2005; President's Information

Technology Advisory Committee, 2004). 1

        The remaining sections are organized as follows. In section two, we briefly review the

key empirical findings concerning the diffusion of new medical knowledge. In section three, we

present evidence from a randomized prospective trial suggesting that computer based decision

support tools can substantially enhance the diffusion of new medical knowledge among

physicians. In section four we develop a model of physician learning that is consistent with these

empirical findings. We then use this model to consider whether private incentives to invest in

computer based decision support technology are sufficient to assure adequate investment. We

conclude by assessing the policy implications of our model and suggest future directions for

research.

        2. The Diffusion of Innovations in Medicine

        The use of beta blocker drugs following heart attacks substantially reduces mortality

rates. This fact has been established for decades yet in 2000/2001 the level of compliance with

appropriate beta blocker use in the median state was just 69 percent. In some states the rate of

appropriate usage was as low as fifty percent and in others as high as eighty six percent (Skinner

and Staiger, 2005). This slow and variable take-up of an effective and inexpensive treatment

protocol for an important illness is a specific illustration of a more general phenomenon: some




   1
       Reference to the use of IT to reduce errors appeared in President Bush’s Economic Report
        of the President in 2004 (President's Council of Economic Advisors, 2004) and in his
        State of the Union Address. “By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous
        medical mistakes, reduce costs, and improve care.”(President's Information Technology
        Advisory Committee, 2004).



                                                                                                   2
innovations appear to diffuse through the health care system much more slowly than one would

expect on the basis of their cost and efficacy. 2

       Perhaps the broadest evidence supporting the slow and uneven diffusion of innovations

comes from the vast medical literature on the geographic variation in practice patterns. The

central finding in this literature is that the care delivered by doctors varies greatly from one

geographic region to another in ways that cannot be accounted for by underlying differences in

patient population, medical prices, technology or other exigencies. In the absence of other

explanations, it is hard to escape the implication that these variations are due to the incomplete

diffusion of the “best” medical practices to physicians. 3 These variations have substantial

economic implications as well – some states spend 40-60% more per patient on heart attack

treatment than others with no improvement in outcomes (Skinner and Staiger, 2005). A Rand

study described in the New York Times finds similarly wide geographic divergence in the

treatment of various cancers (Altman, 2005). Skinner, Fisher and Wennberg ( 2001) find that a

large component of Medicare expenditures (nearly twenty percent) is the result of geographic

variation in expenditures across 306 hospital referral regions. These expenditures, which are

associated with the treatment of the chronically ill, appear to offer no benefits in terms of

survival and the effects on quality of life are unclear. If even a portion of this variation is due to

cross region productivity differences, then slow diffusion of new best-practice methods may

have very substantial economic consequences. The source of geographic variations in practice


2
       Of course not all slow diffusion of innovations is “too slow”. Some new innovations may diffuse
       gradually because it takes time for providers to fully exploit the potential of the treatment for cost
       reductions and quality improvement. This appears to be the case, for example, with the use of
       percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), an important alternative to bypass
       surgery for patients with coronary artery disease (see Cutler and Huckman, 2003).
3
       For a discussions of this literature from an economist’s perspective see (Phelps, 1992 and 2000).
       For a comparison of sociological and economic perspectives in the diffusion of innovations see
       (Skinner and Staiger, 2005).

                                                                                                            3
styles is poorly understood, but these variations suggest that physicians learn about treatments

and protocols from colleagues with whom they interact on a regular basis. These interactions

will play an important role in the theoretical analysis we develop in section four, below

       Other evidence suggesting an imperfect diffusion of medical knowledge comes from the

resources that drug companies spend promoting their products. If the results of clinical studies

percolated swiftly and easily to providers, pharmaceutical companies would not need high-

powered marketing campaigns and sales forces. Avorn ( 2004) describes how these campaigns

influence the decisions of practicing physicians. He also documents a number of instances

where pharmaceutical marketing appears to successfully promote the use of favored drugs even

when there is good clinical evidence that these drugs were ineffective or less effective than

inexpensive alternatives. In Avorn’s cases it was the clinical evidence concerning the

ineffectiveness of heavily marketed drugs that appears to spread too slowly. 4

       A recent econometric study of the diffusion of anti-ulcer drugs finds that equilibrium

market shares are strongly determined by the resources drug companies devote to advertising

(Berndt et al., 2003). 5 This study also finds some evidence for consumption externalities that

enhance the diffusion of drugs towards their equilibrium market shares. Consumption

externalities occur when the use of a brand of drug is enhanced by the fact that many others are

using it. The authors argue that these consumption externalities are largely informational in

character, i.e. physicians and consumers make inferences about the qualities of a brand by the

fact that many others are using it. The existence of consumption externalities is important



4
       A recent study of the use of anti-psychotics in Medicaid patients (Duggan, 2005) documents the heavy use
       of expensive new generation anti-psychotics in spite of evidence that they perform no better than older and
       less-expensive anti-psychotics.
5
       The authors report that the elasticity of minutes of drug detailing to equilibrium market share is around 1,
       suggesting that physicians are highly susceptible to this form of influence.

                                                                                                                      4
because they can inhibit the ability of superior new drugs and treatment modalities to enter the

market. 6

       The rate of diffusion of new knowledge is of self-evident importance in an industry as

technologically dynamic as health care. Given this, it is surprising that the large and growing

literature on the effects of IT systems in health care pays so little attention to the issue. A recent

survey of 100 published studies of computer based decision support programs (Garg et al., 2005)

finds that the effects of these programs can be variable. No effort was made in the review,

however, to examine whether the variation in efficacy could be linked to how “new” the

recommendations were. Another survey of 257 studies of health IT systems (Chaudhry et al.,

2006) finds that these systems generally increased adherence to guideline care, but the analysis

did not consider potential differences between well-established guidelines and guidelines

embodying relatively new clinical protocols.

       One reason for this gap in the literature is that it is often difficult to distinguish protocols

embodying relatively new knowledge from those that do not. Consider for example the

treatment for diabetes, an important and quite costly chronic disease. Disease management

programs for diabetes generally embody well understood treatment protocols (Gertler and

Simcoe, 2006; Beaulieu et al., 2007) but, as we document in the next section regarding the use

of ACE inhibitors, new discoveries can modify these protocols in subtle but important ways.

Tracking the differential effects of similar protocols requires sophisticated electronic medical

records systems and these record systems are still quite rare. Survey data collected in 2007-2008

reveals that only four percent of physicians have a fully functional electronic medical record


6
       In the specific case of anti-ulcer drugs, the authors found that consumption externalities were not strong
       enough to prevent a superior late entrant, Zantac, from overcoming the initial advantage of an entrenched
       incumbent, Tagamet. Zantac overcame it’s disadvantage due to its superior medical qualities and also due
       to unusually large expenditures on drug detailing (Berndt et al., 2003)

                                                                                                                    5
system in their office and only thirteen percent have a basic system (DesRoches et al., 2008).

Similarly low rates of IT adoption are reported for electronic medical records in hospital

emergency rooms and outpatient departments (Burt and Hing, 2005) and physician order entry

systems in hospitals (Cutler et al., 2005). The problem of studying the effects of the diffusion of

new knowledge is further limited by the fact that much of the research on IT comes from a small

number of organizations that are likely to be front-runners in adopting new evidence-based

protocols. Chaudry et. al.( 2006), in their comprehensive review, point out that a large portion of

the empirical work on health IT systems comes from the study of only four institutions: the

Regenstrief Institute; Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Partners Health Care ; the Department of

Veterans Affairs; and LDS Hospital/ Intermountain Health Care.


       3. Empirical Evidence on the Influence of Computer Generated Messages.

       Physicians are highly trained and highly motivated professionals. It is reasonable to

assume, therefore, that the slow and uneven distribution of new and effective therapies is not the

result of simple inattention. A more likely explanation is that it is difficult for physicians to keep

up with the rapidly changing state of medical knowledge and to understand what these changes

mean for the treatment of specific patients. If this is the case, then we should expect that an IT

based decision support system could help doctors learn about new treatments. In this section we

present empirical evidence from a randomized trial indicating that IT based decision support

tools might enhance the rate of diffusion of new medical treatments.




                                                                                                     6
        The data we use comes from a randomized controlled trial of a decision support

technology. 7 In this study patients under age 65 who were members of a single HMO were

randomly assigned to a study and a control group. Data from insurance billing records,

laboratory feeds and pharmacies were combined to construct a virtual electronic medical record

and the information in these records was passed through a sophisticated program that scanned for

clinical mistakes and also deviations from evidence based, best-practice protocols.

        For patients in the study group, the information was scanned in real time and, if an issue

was detected, a message was sent to the physician. The message stated the name of the patient,

described the potential issue, and referenced the relevant medical literature. Roughly speaking

the messages sent could be divided into three categories: “start a drug”, “stop a drug” or “do a

test”. For patients in the control group, the clinical data was saved but not analyzed. After the

study was completed, the control group data was analyzed by the software and messages were

generated that would have been sent to physicians if the control patient had been in the study

group. The trial therefore allowed us to compare the rate of resolution of issues when physicians

enjoyed decision support (the study group) with the rate of resolution of the same issues when no

such support was available (the control group). The difference in resolution rates between the

study and control group is thus a measure of the influence of the information technology on

physicians. 8




7
        For detailed descriptions of this trial see Javitt, Reisman et. al. ( 2005); and Javitt, Rebitzer and Reisman (
        2008).
8
        Although the system we describe used cutting edge information technology, the source of the
        information (billing records, and data feeds from pharmacies and lab) ensured that physician’s
        information about the patient was almost always superior to that available to the computer
        system. For these reasons, the messages generated by the system were communicated as
        recommendations that the physician should feel free to ignore. Thus it was not at all certain at the
        start of the study that the messages would have any influence at all.

                                                                                                                          7
       For our purposes, we would like to know if the messages from the decision support tool

increased the rate of adoption of new medical evidence. We therefore focused our attention on

messages concerning the class of medications known as ACE-inhibitors. ACE-inhibitors were

first approved by the FDA in 1981 for treatment of severe hypertension. Shortly before the

randomized trial began in 2001, several major clinical trials established the beneficial effect of

ACE-inhibitors for patients with mild and moderate hypertension, heart failure, past heart

attacks, chronic renal disease, certain subgroups of diabetics and patients at high risk for

cardiovascular events. Taken together, these trials greatly expanded the number of patients for

whom an ACE-inhibitor was indicated. One particularly important trial was the Heart Outcomes

Prevention Evaluation or HOPE trial. The computer system was set up to include

recommendations from the HOPE trial among the messages it sent to physicians. By comparing

the resolution rates for patients in the study group who triggering the HOPE trial based

recommendations with control group patients who would have triggered those recommendations,

we can directly assess the influence of computer generated messages on newly discovered

medical protocols.

       The sample of participants in column one of Table 1 consists of those who would have

qualified for an ACE-inhibitor on the basis of the HOPE trial criteria, but who were not receiving

the drug. The dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the issue of ACE-inhibitor

use is successfully resolved, i.e. if records indicate that the patient received ACE-inhibitors

within 270 days of the message being sent to the physician. The coefficient on the variable Study

captures the differences in success rates between the study and the control group. Patients in the

study group whose physician received computer generated messages regarding ACE-inhibitors,

were thirteen percentage points more likely to take up the ACE-inhibitor than those in the control



                                                                                                     8
group. To put this result in context, the resolution rate in the control group whose physicians

received no messages was about 0.14. Thus the decision support tool nearly doubled resolution

rates.

         In column two of Table 1, we run analogous probit regressions for participants who

received “add a drug” recommendations other than those relating to HOPE trial

recommendations. We observe that the rate of resolution of these “add a drug”

recommendations was 0.258 in the control group. The effect of being in the study group was to

increase the resolution rate by 0.035. This difference is statistically insignificant and

behaviorally not very important.

         Comparing columns 1 and 2 it is clear that the decision support system had a more

substantial effect on the relatively new ACE-inhibitor recommendation than on all other

recommendations that suggested adding a drug. At the time of our study, the new clinical

evidence regarding ACE-inhibitors was widely promoted in the conventional manner, i.e. via

disease management programs and journal articles. We suspect, on the basis of informal

conversations with providers, that the computer generated messages had extra influence because

they were reliable, timely, and focused physician attention on a specific issue concerning a

specific patient. Put differently what the IT support tool did that other conventional

communication channels did not, was link a useful general recommendation to a specific

patient’s situation.

         The results in Table 1 are consistent with the possibility that IT based decision support

can enhance the diffusion of new medical knowledge, but it is important to observe that they do

not constitute a definitive proof of that claim. Non-ACE “add a drug” messages are a mix of

many different recommendations. If these messages have heterogeneous effects, pooling the



                                                                                                     9
drugs together may create the impression that the entire set of non-ACE, “add a drug” messages

are ineffective when some of them were in fact quite effective. Pursing this alternative

interpretation of the data would require a larger study that would allow us to better analyze

specific sub-sets of the non-ACE “add a drug” recommendations.


        4. Influence and Physician Learning: A Simple Analytical Framework

        In this section we develop a model of physician learning in an environment characterized

by information overload. The evidence in the preceding discussions suggests that a reasonable

model of physician learning must account for three empirical relationships. Firstly, new clinical

knowledge does diffuse through the health care system, but the rate of diffusion is often slow.

Secondly, as the geographic variations in practice patterns suggest, physicians learn about new

medical treatments from other physicians with whom they interact on a daily basis. Thirdly, IT

based decision support technology can influence physician behavior and this influence is greatest

for newly discovered treatment protocols.

        We introduce slow diffusion of new knowledge into our model by assuming that

physicians are hampered by two cognitive limitations: the flow of new medical knowledge

exceeds the fixed information processing capacities of individual physicians; and it is difficult

for physicians to link the new medical knowledge they acquire to the clinical needs of specific

patients.

        To capture the role of informal interactions in the process of knowledge diffusion we

assume that physicians compensate for their cognitive limitations by relying on the

recommendations of colleagues with whom they interact on a day-to-day basis. Colleague

recommendations are helpful because they can link specific treatments to the clinical needs of

particular patients under a physician’s care, but these recommendations are not sufficient to


                                                                                                    10
resolve the problem of information overload. After all, physicians making recommendations

have limits on their own cognitive abilities and these limits will generally make it hard for them

to keep abreast of all the newest procedures. For this reason, physicians will also have to devote

time to independent reading in medical journals. Reading journal articles may expose the

physician to the newest innovations, but journal articles do not identify for the physician the

specific patients for which the innovation applies. The influence of IT enabled decision support

follows naturally in this set-up. In comparison to traditional learning modalities (colleagues’

recommendations and independent reading of medical journals) the computer based decision

support tools are more likely to suggest treatments that are both new and relevant to the care of a

specific patient. 9 As a result, the new information technology will have greater influence on

physicians and will, under plausible conditions, enhance the rate of diffusion of new knowledge.

       Model Set-up

       In every period medical research generates s new treatments that are relevant to the care

of a physician’s patients. A physicians’ objective when reading about new medical treatments is

to maximize the sum of medical benefits from treatment adoption across his patients. We

introduce limitations in physician information processing capabilities in the simplest possible

way by assuming that in each period physicians can read n articles with n < s. 10 Physicians are

also limited in their ability to apply information about new treatments to specific patients. We

capture this aspect of limited cognition by stipulating that when reading about a new treatment in




9
        One might argue that specialists are at least as good as computer data bases in keeping up with
       new developments in their discipline. This may be so, but computer based decision support
       systems have the advantage of giving primary providers access to the relevant knowledge of
       specialists in many disciplines.
10
       We could easily endogenize n by including doctor’s effort cost of reading about treatments. This
       would complicate the analysis, but not add any additional insight.

                                                                                                          11
a medical journal, the likelihood that a physician identifies the treatment as relevant to their

patients is r , where r < 1 . The value of r is determined by the relevance of the new treatment to

his or her patient population and by the probability that the physician will recognize the

relevance of the treatment. Because physicians cannot read about all new treatments produced in

each period and sometimes fail to see the relevance of a treatment, there will always be a stock

of potentially relevant treatments that the physician will have missed in the period in which they

were introduced.

       In fields as technologically dynamic as medicine, the value of innovations tends to

depreciate over time. We capture this depreciation through the assumption that patients

experience benefits B when the physician adopts a relevant treatment in the same period it was

discovered, a benefit Bq, where q<1, when the physician adopts a relevant treatment in the

period after discovery, and benefit 0 from treatments that are more than two periods old. Because

treatments older than two periods are clinically irrelevant, we can unambiguously refer to

established treatments as treatments whose discovery occurred in the prior period.

       Physicians can learn about the relevance of established treatments from interactions with

other doctors. The advantage of learning from other physicians is that colleagues identify

treatments that are relevant to specific patients. The disadvantage is that colleagues are also

overloaded by new information and therefore cannot keep abreast of the newest procedures. We

represent this feature by assuming that colleagues recommend only relevant established

treatments – never new ones. Thus, the expected marginal benefit of reading a journal article

about a treatment recommended by colleagues is qB . We model the heightened relevance of

treatments recommended by colleagues by assuming that q > r . In this way, information flows

have a local flavor because the physician always prefers reading about the highly relevant


                                                                                                   12
treatments recommended by informal interactions with colleagues than independent reading

about new treatments in journals.

       We focus on an equilibrium in which the behavior of all doctors in a region can be

captured by a single representative physician. Let xt and yt respectively denote the number of

established and new treatments the physician chooses to read about in period t. Let zt denote the

number of recommendations a doctor receives from her colleagues. We endogenize zt by

assuming that the recommendations a doctor gives come from the new treatments that he has

adopted for his own patients in the previous period. Formally we capture this by assuming that

zt = α ryt −1 , where α is a parameter and ryt −1 simply denotes the average number of new

treatments that physicians adopted in the previous period. Since the physicians always prefer

reading about treatments recommended by colleagues to reading about new treatments in

journals, this implies that physicians learn about the following number of treatments from

colleagues

       (1)      xt = α ryt −1 ,

so that information on the remaining treatments comes from reading medical journals. Thus

       (2)      yt = n − xt .

       We focus on the steady state equilibrium in which a physician does not change her

learning choices from one period to the other, i.e. xt = x and yt = y for all t . This, together with

                                                                                 n

       Introducing Computer-based Decision Support

       We now introduce computer based decision support systems. As described above, these

systems compare a patient’s treatment with best practice protocols drawn from the medical

literature. If the system finds a discrepancy, a message is sent to the physician. New treatments

are written into the computer’s software in each period and we assume that the technology only

sends messages concerning new treatments that are clinically relevant for a physician’s

patients. 11, 12 The physician can expect to receive θ m messages from the decision support

technology each period, where m is the number of new treatments entering the data base in each

period and θ is the fraction of treatments relevant to the physician’s patients. From the

physician’s perspective, the benefit of reading about a treatment recommended in a computer

generated message is given by B (it is always new and relevant), whereas the benefit of reading

about a treatment recommended by a colleague is qB, where q is the discount factor reflecting

the delay in learning about new treatments from colleagues. Thus a doctor will always prefer

reading about a computer generated recommendation over a colleague’s recommendation.

       It is costly to incorporate new innovations into the decision support software, so it is

unlikely that the decision support software will ever be sufficiently comprehensive to serve as

the sole source of recommendations for physician learning. Rather than modeling these costs

explicitly, we assume that θ m < n , implying that a doctor who has access to the technology will

read about all the treatments recommended in the computer generated messages and still have

enough mental “shelf space” to continue learning about established treatments recommended by




11
       Relaxing this assumption by allowing the technology to send messages about both new and
       established treatments would complicate the analysis considerably, but not affect the results.
12
       Assuming instead that the technology also sent out some erroneous messages would not change
       the results of our analysis as long as the likelihood that a message is useful is larger than q.

                                                                                                        14
other sources. Put differently, the heightened timeliness and specificity of computer generated

recommendations displaces, but doesn’t eliminate, the use of other learning modalities.

       In the US health care system, clinical data about patients rarely sits in a common

electronic data base. The IT revolution has been slow coming to hospitals and only in recent

years have large expenditures in electronic medical record systems begun. Physicians’ offices

are typically paper based and, where they have moved to electronic records, these systems often

do not interface neatly with hospital systems (DesRoches et al., 2008). 13 Common standards for

electronic medical records systems are only now being put in place.

       Efficient decision support software requires that patient information reside in a single

data base or a set of interconnected data bases, and this sort of integration is precluded by the

Balkanized system of medical records maintained by providers. Insurance companies, in

contrast, are well positioned to act as aggregators of medical information because most clinical

transactions involving their members appear coded into their data bases for billing purposes.

This is why the decision support technology we discussed in section three was designed to use

insurers’ data and perhaps this also explains why the informatics company that developed the

decision support technology was eventually purchased by a large health insurer.

       Insurers’ data systems are also fragmented in that they are confined to individuals who

are current policy holders. For this reason, computer based decision will have both a direct and




13
       “…to be effective, CDSS [clinical decision support systems] diagnostic systems require detailed, patient-
       specific clinical information (history, physical results, medications, laboratory test results), which in most
       health care settings resides in a variety of paper and automated datasets that cannot easily be integrated.
       Past efforts to develop automated medical record systems have not been very successful because of the lack
       of common standards for coding data, the absence of a data network connecting the many health care
       organizations and clinicians involved in patient care, and a number of other factors.” Institute Of Medicine

                                                                                                                  15
an indirect effect on physician learning. The direct effect is captured by the θm computer

generated messages a physician receives. The indirect effect results from the way that

knowledge acquired from the computer system spills over to other physicians who have no

access to the computer system. To capture these spillovers we stipulate that a share β of

physicians have access to a particular decision support technology and a share (1 − β ) does not

have access to the technology. Both groups of physicians interact with each other so that

information that flows directly to physicians with access to the technology can flow via

recommendations to other physicians not included in the system. 14

       Let the subscript i ∈ {1, 2} reflect whether the physician has technology access ( i = 1 ), or

does not have technology access ( i = 2 ). As in the previous section let z denote the number of

recommendations a doctor of type i receives from colleagues, where z = α (the average number

of new treatments that physicians adopted in the previous period.). Because a physician will

always read about all the care messages generated by the decision support technology

and θ m < n , we have

       (3)     z = α ( β (θ m + ry1 ) + (1 − β ) ry2 )

       As in the previous section, the expected benefit from reading about a treatment generated

by a colleague’s recommendation is greater than the expected benefit from reading

independently selected newly published articles (q>r). Thus all physicians will read all

colleagues’ recommended treatments before reading independently selected journal articles. We

focus our analysis on the equilibrium in which all read about some new treatments, i.e.




14
       Our analysis would not change if we assume that share (1-β) of physicians had access to a
       different computer based system.

                                                                                                   16
θ n + z < n . In this case x1 = x2 = z and the number of independently selected journal articles a

doctor chooses to read about is given by

        (4)     y1 = n − θ m − z

        (5)     y2 = n − z

        Equations (3) - (5) determine steady state equilibrium y1* , y2* and x1* = x2* = z * . The steady

state disposition of new knowledge with computer support software is depicted in Figure Two.

From this set-up it is easy to prove the following lemma.

Lemma 1: The Effects of Computer Support Systems on Physician Learning: If
n > θ m (1 + α r + αβ (1 − r ) ) , then there exist a steady state equilibrium in which the doctors with
access to the technology will read about all treatments recommended by the technology and by
colleagues, and some treatments from independently selected journals. Doctors without the
technology will read about all treatments recommended by colleagues and some treatments from
independently selected journal articles. Doctors with the technology access will read fewer
independently selected journal articles than doctors without technology access.
        Proof: see appendix

        We are interested in understanding how the decision support technology affects

knowledge diffusion. For this purpose, we define knowledge diffusion among doctors of type i

as:

        (6)     η1 ( m ) = ry1* + θ m + qx1*

        (7)     η2 ( m ) = ry2* + qx2*

where ηi simply denotes the total number of relevant treatments that a doctor of type i will learn

about and adopt in each period. As before, established treatments are discounted by q. We

define the diffusion of knowledge about a treatment included in the technology and a treatment

not included in the technology respectively as:

                             ⎛       ry1* ⎞            ry2*     ⎛ ⎛       ry1* ⎞            ry2* ⎞
        (8)     μt ( m ) = β ⎜ θ +        ⎟ + (1 − β )      + q ⎜ β ⎜ θ +      ⎟ + (1 − β )      ⎟
                             ⎝        s ⎠               s       ⎝ ⎝        s ⎠               s ⎠

                                                                                                       17
                             ⎛ ry1* ⎞            ry2*     ⎛ ⎛ ry1* ⎞            ry2* ⎞
       (9)     μ nt ( m ) = β ⎜     ⎟ + (1 − β )      + q  β
                                                          ⎜ ⎜      ⎟ + (1 − β )      ⎟
                             ⎝ s ⎠                s       ⎝ ⎝ s ⎠                s ⎠

       In (8) and (9), the first term denotes the likelihood that doctors using the decision support

technology adopt the treatment in the first period. The second term denotes the likelihood that

doctors without the technology adopt the treatment in the first period. The last term denotes the

likelihood that any doctor adopts the treatment in the second period as a result of

recommendations from colleagues. Comparing (8) and (9) we can see that adding a new

treatment protocol to the decision support data base increases the likelihood of adoption by θ in

the first period and by qθ in the second period. Let ω denote total adoption of new knowledge

among all doctors. Note that equations (6) and (7), and equations (8) and (9) are necessarily

related as follows:

       (10)    ω = ( s − m ) μ nt + mμt
                 = βη1 + (1 − β )η 2

By differentiating (6)-(10) with respect to m we establish the following proposition:

Proposition 1: Expanding Computer Based Decision Support Enhances The Rate of
Knowledge Diffusion: Increasing the number of treatments in the technology increases overall
knowledge diffusion among all doctors, even among those who do not have access to the
technology. This holds even though the rate of diffusion of treatments not in the computer
database will decline.

       Proof: see appendix


       An important implication of the analysis so far is that the spread of IT-based decision

support is likely to reduce geographic variation in practice patterns. To see this assume that:

underlying patient clinical needs are the same across regions; and that the medical informatics

company offers the same decision support technology in all the regions in which it operates.

What differs across regions then are: (i) the degree to which the technology has penetrated a


                                                                                                  18
region (captured by β) and (ii) the degree to which physicians in a region rely upon their

idiosyncratic reading of articles in medical journals. We have shown in Lemma 1 that the

presence of information technology displaces reading that is not stimulated by recommendations

from colleagues or the IT system. Inspection of the proof of Lemma 1 shows that as m increases,

both steady state y1 and y2 decrease. Thus in a steady state as m increases, the idiosyncratic

reading of journals (the sort of reading that leads to variation across regions) becomes less

important for all physicians. The same proof also shows that as m increases, steady state

recommendations from colleagues (z) increases. By the logic of our model, the only reason that z

would increase with m is that as m increases, the IT system identifies more relevant protocols in

the first period that they are released. This source of new information is, however, common

across regions. Thus, as m increases, cross-regional variation in observed practice patterns

should decline.

       Private Incentives to Invest in Decision Support System

       Given the central role that health insurers currently play as information aggregators in our

health care system, we begin by analyzing their incentives to invest in physician decision support

systems.   We simplify our analysis by assuming that the insurer is a Health Maintenance

Organization (HMO) that must attract physicians to sign on to its network of providers (Cooper

and Rebitzer, 2006). Maintaining our assumption that providers derive a direct benefit from

offering their patients better care, the HMO will be able to attract physicians to the network at

lower cost by investing in a decision support technology that improves care quality. 15




15
       Alternatively we could assume that the purchasers of health insurance would pay more for
       insurance if the insurer supplied decision support technology to physicians that improved care
       outcomes. Because physicians in our setup experience the same utility from improved outcomes
       as patients do, the results under these assumptions would be unchanged.

                                                                                                    19
         The flow of new knowledge with decision support is depicted in Figure Two. It is clear

from this Figure that doctors who do not have access to the decision support technology still

benefit in period two from the learning induced by the computer technology in period one. This

learning spillover leads to Corollary 3. To establish this, let p be the cost of adopting a new

treatment. Then, the net private benefits of an insurer with technology access is given by

η1 ( B − p ) , whereas the total net benefit to providers is given by (η1 + η2 )( B − p ) . Thus, the

Corollary follows from the fact that both η1 and η2 are increasing in m, which was established in

Proposition 1.


Corollary 1: Insurers will Under-invest in Computer Based Decision Support.

         The underinvestment in the new technology is the result of knowledge spillovers from

one set of providers to another. The conventional economic response to positive externalities is

to internalize them with subsidies financed by lump sum taxes. This approach is, however,

famously difficult to implement. In this case, however, an alternative approach might be feasible

because what appears as externalities to health care providers and insurers are actually sources of

revenue to other market actors. The pharmaceutical and device manufacturers profit from the

informal spread of new information about their products and may therefore have more powerful

incentives than providers and insurers to promote the spread of computer based decision support

tools.

         A pharmaceutical or device manufacturer’s increased profit from including a treatment in

the decision support system is given by

                 Δπ = ( μt ( m + 1) − μnt ( m ) ) p




                                                                                                        20
The next proposition shows that for a sufficiently large price of treatment, p, the seller of the

treatment is willing to pay more for the inclusion of a new treatment than would a provider or an

insurer.

Proposition 2: Pharmaceutical and Drug Makers Can Have More Powerful Incentives to
Invest in Computer Based Decision Support than Insurers: There exists a p1 < B , s.t. if
 p > p1 then the seller of a new treatment is always willing to pay more than the HMO for
including this treatment into the technology.

       Proof: see appendix

       Proposition 2 has potentially important public policy implications. It suggests that one

might create appropriate incentives to invest in computer support technology by allowing

pharmaceutical firms and device manufacturers to invest in decision support technology. For

concreteness imagine that this investment takes the form of paying the IT company who runs the

decision support system to include their new products into the computer system’s database. This

sort of investment might avoid cumbersome government bureaucracy while ensuring that the

health care system has a sufficiently comprehensive decision support technology.

       This strategy raises, however, a concern when one considers the cognitive limitations

under which physicians operate. Paying for the inclusion of one or another company’s products

in the computer support technology displaces other forms of learning that might lead physicians

to adopt different treatments. This crowding out of learning about other products creates

negative externalities and therefore creates incentives to over-invest in the decision support

technology- a point made in the following proposition:

Proposition 3: Pharmaceuticals and Device Makers May Have Incentives to Over-invest in
Computer Based Decision Support Technology. There exists a p2 < B , s.t. if p > p2 then the
seller of a new treatment is willing to pay more than the social marginal benefit for including this
treatment in the technology. Other pharmaceuticals will bear the full cost of this overinvestment.
Health care providers and insurers will benefit from the overinvestment.

       Proof: see appendix

                                                                                                    21
       If one overlooks the effects of wasted resources resulting from over investment by

pharmaceutical and device makers, Proposition 3 seems to suggest that private financing of

decision support systems may be a sensible way to offset the investment shortfall resulting from

knowledge spillovers. Just as Google finances enhanced information flow on the internet

through the use of marketing dollars, so might the marketing efforts of pharmaceutical and

device makers be used to support enhanced information flows about treatment protocols in the

health care system. As we demonstrate in the next section, however, this conclusion rests on

unrealistically strong assumptions about the unambiguous nature of new knowledge.

       Ambiguity, Influence and Marketing

       We have so far considered messages whose information content is unambiguously

correct. In many settings, however, the right drug or treatment is less clear. Suppose, for

example, that a pharmaceutical company has a patent for an anti-ulcer medication, a class of

drugs for which there exist a number of competing brands (Berndt et al., 2003). Assume that all

of these anti-ulcer drugs are effective, but no single drug dominates the others. Rather each drug

works better for a subset of the ulcer population, but it is hard to identify ex-ante which patient

would benefit most from which drug. In this setting the pharmaceutical company might

profitably subsidize a message that suggests this drug to all physicians with ulcer patients

because the message may prove relevant to some subset of physicians. We will refer to this sort

of message as a marketing message because its expected relevance to the treatment of a specific

ulcer patient is low.

       As before, assume that the technology sends each physician θ m targeted messages. In

addition the technology sends marketing messages for k treatments. For each patient, there is

some probability, δ > 0, that the marketing message will prove relevant to some of his patients,


                                                                                                      22
but the relevance of the marketing message is less than other messages included sent by the

system so that δ < θ . Doctors know that the decision support software includes both marketing

and non-marketing messages, but cannot identify any individual message as the result of

marketing. Thus doctors respond to each message by consulting the cited literature and deciding

whether the recommended drug is appropriate for their patient. The likelihood that the message

is suggesting a new relevant treatment is given by

             δ k +θm
        λ=
              k +θ m

       Proposition 4 states that marketing messages can have a negative impact on the rate of

diffusion of new knowledge and overall welfare. The intuition is very simple: As long as λ > r ,

the expected relevance of messages sent by the decision support tool exceeds that available

through other channels. Thus a doctor will prefer reading about a treatment recommended by the

decision support tool to any other learning modality, despite his knowledge that the messages

include k marketing messages. Getting doctors to read the k marketing messages is profitable for

the drug company because some of these drugs will actually prove relevant to a patient and

therefore generate sales. Offsetting this private benefit, however, is the opportunity cost of

inducing physicians to read about relatively low value suggestions contained in marketing

messages. Such reading displaces physicians’ reading about treatments from independently

selected journal articles. This displacement has a negative impact on knowledge diffusion if δ< r,

i.e. the expected relevance of a marketing message is lower than expected relevance of

independent reading in journal articles. This reasoning leads directly to the following

proposition:

Proposition 4: Marketing Messages: If δ < r, then the inclusion of marketing messages has a
negative impact on the rate of diffusion of new knowledge and overall welfare, even though the
firm will benefit from such a message.

                                                                                                 23
       Proof: see appendix

       This result suggests that although it might be privately profitable to use decision support

software as a sophisticated cybernetic drug detailer, doing so could undermine the social benefits

produced by the technology.

       5. Conclusion

       Physicians are overwhelmed by the task of managing vast amounts of information

relating to patient conditions and new treatment protocols. This information overload acts as a

drag on the diffusion of new knowledge. IT enabled decision support tools have attracted the

attention of health care providers and policy makers because they offer a way to alleviate this

drag and hence to improve care quality. Increasing the rate of diffusion of new knowledge might

also have the effect of increasing returns to innovative activity and therefore stimulate more

rapid innovation. Just as small increases in productivity growth rates accumulate over time to

transform living standards; so enhanced innovation rates resulting from the faster diffusion of

new knowledge could yield transformations in the quality of health care.

       Because of the fragmented state of the IT infra-structure in the health care system,

insurance companies currently play a central role as information aggregators and are therefore in

a good position to finance investments in decision support. Our model suggests, however, that

insurers’ incentives to invest will generally be inadequate. The problem is the result of

knowledge spillovers: doctors who learn about a new treatment protocol from the IT system will

likely transmit that information to other physicians through informal interactions. These

spillovers improve care quality, but the benefits do not accrue to the insurers financing the

decision support software. Our analysis of limited mental “shelf space” and clinical ambiguity

suggests that alternative approaches, such as financing investment in improved information flows



                                                                                                  24
with marketing dollars, may undermine the social value generated by decision support

technology.

       Given the current surge in investments in health care IT and the positive and negative

externalities inherent in these investments, the role of public policy in guiding these investments

should be an important area of future research.

                           1+αr
                    α rn + αβθ m (1 − r )
                z=
                           1+α r

This denotes an equilibrium if q1 , q2 and z > 0. Thus, we must have n > θ m (1 + α r + αβ (1 − r ) ) .



Proof of Proposition 1: Differentiating equations (6)-(10) with respect to m yields:

                ∂η1              1 + α r (1 − β ) + qαβ
                    = θ (1 − r )                        >0
                ∂m                        1+ αr
                ∂η2                   q−r
                    = αβθ (1 − r )            >0
                ∂m                   1+ α r
                ∂μt                      1 + qα
                    = − β rθ (1 + α )               <0
                ∂m                     s (1 + α r )
                ∂μnt                     1 + qα
                     = − β rθ (1 + α )              <0
                ∂m                     s (1 + α r )
                ∂ω               qα + 1
                   = βθ (1 − r )        >0
                ∂m               1+ αr



Proof of Proposition 2: First note that

                Δπ = ( μt ( m + 1) − μnt ( m ) ) p
                                     s + sα r − r − α r
                    = βθ ( qα + 1)                      >0
                                         s (1 − α r )

The pharmaceuticals’ willingness to pay for including the treatment is Δπ ⋅ p , whereas an

HMO’s willingness to pay is η1 ( B − p ) . Thus, the pharmaceutical is willing to pay more than the



                                                                                                     26
                  η1
HMO if     p>           B . Since Δπ > 0 this implies that there exist a p1 < B , s.t. if p > p1 then
                Δπ + η1

the seller of a new treatment is always willing to pay more than the HMO for including this

treatment into the technology.



Proof of Proposition 3: The net benefits of the HMOs are given by ω ( B − p ) . The net benefits

                                                                                     ∂ω
of the pharmaceuticals are ω p . Thus, the social marginal net benefit is               B . Using the
                                                                                     ∂m

calculations from the proof of Propositions 1 and 2, the pharmaceutical’s marginal net benefit is

larger than the social marginal net benefit if

                               s + sα r − r − α r                 1+ α q
                βθ ( qα + 1)                      p > βθ (1 − r )        B
                                   s (1 − α r )                   1+ α r


This implies p >
                        (1 − r ) s       B , where
                                                          (1 − r ) s      < 1 since s > 1. Thus, there exists
                   s + α sr − r − α r                s + α sr − r − α r

a p2 < B , s.t. if p > p2 then the seller of a new treatment is willing to pay more than the social

marginal benefit for including this treatment in the technology.



Proof of Proposition 4: Now we need to distinguish between diffusion of three different types of

treatments: treatments in the technology that are marketed, treatments in the technology that are

not marketed, and treatments that are not in the technology. Diffusion of a treatment in the

technology that is marketed is given by:

                              ⎛        ry1* ⎞            ry2*     ⎛ ⎛      ry* ⎞          ry* ⎞
                μl t ( m ) = β ⎜ δ +        ⎟ + (1 − β )      + q ⎜ β ⎜ δ + 1 ⎟ + (1 − β ) 2 ⎟ )
                              ⎝         s ⎠               s       ⎝ ⎝       s ⎠            s ⎠

Thus, total adoption is given by


                                                                                                                27
               ω = ( s − m − k ) μnt + mμt + k μl t
                                                             1+ α q
                   = ( βθ m (1 − r ) + nr + β k (δ − r ) )
                                                             1+ αr

                  ∂ω
We can see that      < 0 if δ < r . Thus, if δ< r, then the inclusion of marketing messages has a
                  ∂k

negative impact on the rate of diffusion of new knowledge.

                    l ( m ) to μ ( m ) we can see that adding a new treatment protocol to the
       By comparing μ t         nt



decision support data base increases the likelihood of adoption by βδ in the first period and by

qβδ in the second period. Thus, the pharmaceuticals have positive willingness to pay for

inclusion of marketing messages.

In column 1, the sample consists of participants who would have qualified for an Ace inhibitor on the basis of the
HOPE trial criteria, but who were not receiving the drug according to computer records.
In column 2 the sample consists of participants who received an "add a drug" message other than that in column 1.

The message is successfully resolved if there is evidence in the data base that the patient started the
relevant drug within 270 days after the message was sent.

Coefficients are expressed as "derivatives". Thus in column 1 members in the study group were 13
percentage points more likely to have resolved the issue successfully than those in the control group.
