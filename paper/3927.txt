              CHANGES IN RELATIVE WAGES, l9631987:
                    SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS




                            ABSTRACT



     A simple supply and demand framework is used to analyze

changes in the U.S. wage structure from 1963 to 1987. Rapid
secular growth in the demand for more-educated workers1
more-skilled' workers, and females appears to be the driving

force behind observed changes in the wage structure. Measured

changes in the allocation of labor between industries and

occupations strongly favored college graduates and females
throughout the period. Movements in the college wage premium

over this period appear to be strongly related to fluctuations in

the rate of growth of the supply of college graduates.

      Wage inequality among both men and women increased substantially in the United States

during the 1 980s. Changes in the wage structure along three primary dimensions played an

important role in rising inequality. First, there was an Increase in wage differentials by education

with a particularly sharp rise in the relative earnings of college graduates. Second, the average

wages of older workers increased relatrve to the wages of younger workers for those with

relatively low levels of education. The combination of these two changes generaled en increase

In the weekly wages of young male college graduates by approximately 30 pei'cent relative to

young males with twelve or fewer years of schooling from 1979 to 1987. Third, earnings inequality

also increased greatly within narrowly defined demographic and skill groups. Although the male

and female wage structures widened considerably, differences in earnings between men end

women narrowed throughout the 1980s. The average wage of women increased by about 8

percent relative lo the average wage of men from 1979 to 1987.

      Although the pattern of movements in the U.S. wage structure in the 1980S Is well-

documented.1 much disagreement remains concerning the fundamental causes of the changes.

Several explanations have received much attention. One class of explanations postulates that

changes in the U.S. wage structure during the 1980s are driven primarily by shifts in the relative

demand for labor favoring more-educated and more-akillect workers over less-educated and

iess-skilled workers and tavoring females over males. One variant emphasizes technological

changes (possibly associated with the computer revolution) that are likely to have raised the

relative demand (or more-educated and flexible workers and reduced the demand for physical

labor basis and Haltiwanger, 1991; Krueger, 1991; Mincer, 1991]. A second hypothesizes that

shifts in product demand largely essociated with large trade delicits in the l980s have led to a

 sharp decline in manulacturing employment and a shift in employment towards sectors that are

 education and female intensive (Murphy and Welch, 19911. Alternative explanations focus on

 changes in wage-setting Institutions such as ihe decline in unions (Freeman, 19911, changes in

 pay norms (Mtchell, 1989] and the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage (Blackburn,
                                                  2
  Bloom,   and Freeman 1990].

        In this paper, we examine how tar one can go towards explaining recent changes in relative

 wages in the United States using a simple supply and demand framework. Ftather than focusing

 on changes in relative wages during the 1 980s In Isolation, we analyze relative wage movements

 over the longer 25 year time period from 1963 to 1987, By examining this longer time period, we

 ara able to evaluate the ability of competing explanations to explain a wide range of wage

 observations (such as both falling college wage premia in the 19705 and risIng college wage

 premia in the 19805) as well as differences in timing in changes in wage differentials.

       The paper is organised as follows. Section It describes the data from the March Current

 Population Surveys that we use throughout the pape. Section III uses these data to describe the

 basic patterns of change in real and relative wages in the United   States over the 1963 to 1987
 period. Section IV outlines the simple factor demand model that we use to interpret these relative

 wage data and evaluates the ability of simple demand shift stories to explain the observed

 patterns of changes in relative factor prices and supplies. Section V expands the basic model

 to incorporate both within and between industry components of relative factor demands. Section

 Section VI uses the basic framework to examine changes in education end experience

 differentials. Section VII summarizes our conclusions.

       We conclude that rapid secular growth in the relative demand for more.skilled workers is

a key component of any consistent explanation for rising inequality and changes in the wage

structure over the last twenty-five years. Although much of this shift in relative demand can be

accounted for by observed shifts in the industrial end occupational composition of employment

towards relativoty skill-intensive sectors, the majority reflects shifts in relative labor demand

occurnng within detailed sectors. These within-sector shifts arc likely to reflect skill-biased

technological changes. Differences in the time pattern of rising education differentials and rising

withln.group inequality suggest they are distinct phenomena. Our results indicate that observed

fluctuations in the rate of growth of the relative supply of college graduates combined with smooth

trend demand growth in favor of more-educated workers can largely esplsin fluctuations in the
                                                 3

college/high school differentIal over the 1963-1 987 period. Steady demand growth In Favor of

more highly-skilled workers over the last twenty years appears consislent with both movements

in education differentials and within group inequality.



                                          II. THE DATA

      The data we use in this paper conic Iron) a series of 25 consecutive March Current

Population Surveys (CPS5) for survey years 1964 to 1988. These CPS data are from the March

Annual Demographic Supplement and provide information on earnings and weeks worked In the

calendar year preceding the March survey. These surveys provide wage and employment

information on epprosimately 1.4 million workers for the 1963 to 1967 period. From these GPS

data, we create two samples: (I) a wage sample which we use to measure weekly wages of full-

time workers by demographic group and (2) a count sample that we use to measure the amount

of labor supplied by each of these demographic groups. The taxonomy we use dMdes the data

into 320 distinct labor groups, distinguished by sex, education (less than 12. 12, 13-iS, and 16

or more years of schooling), and 40 single-year potential experience categories (corresponding

to the first 40 years since the estimated age of labor market entrance).2

      The wage measure which we use throughout the paper is the average weekly wage of

full-time workers (computed as total annual earnings divided by total weeks workec within a

gender-education-experience cell. Our wage sample includes full-lime wage end salary workers

who participated in the labor force for at least 39 weeks In the calendar year prior to the March

survey, worked at least 1 week, and did not work part year due to school, retirement, or military

service. Self-employed workers and those working without pay were excluded from the wage

sample. The sample includes individuals for whom the Census imputed wages but makes a

correction For the tact that the imputation procedures changed between the 1975 and 1976 March

CPS surveys.4 Workers with top coded esmings were imputed annual esrnings at 1.45 times

the snnusl topcode amount. This correction is based on our estimates of the conditional average
                                                  4

 earnings of those with earnings above the topcode. In addition, we excluded workers with real

 weekly earnings belowSGl,00 in 1982 dollars (equal to 1/2 of the 1982 real minimum wage based

 on a 40-hour week), As best ss we can escerlain from experimentation, our results are not highly

 sensitive to these exclusion criteria.

       The count sample includes alt individuals that worked at least one week in the preceding

 year (regardless of whether they were wage and salary workers, self employed or otherwise), We

 compute total hours worked for each cell in each year by computing the product of total annual

 hours (weeks worked times usual weekly hours) and the individual CPS sample weight for each

 individual in the cell and then summing over alt the individuals In the cell.5 We use these total

 hours measures as estimates of the total labor supplied to the U.S. market by individuals with

 given characteristIcs, The totat hours calculations for each cell are then deflaled by the sum of

 total hours worked over all cells so that hours for each cell in each year are expressed as a

fraction or total annual hours that year.

       The use of two separate samples, one (or measuring supplies and one for measuring

prices, retlects the different criteria each sample must meet. The primary concern with the wage

sample is to obtain data on a group that maintains a reasonably constant composition through

tirse thus providing estimates of the prices received by workers of given skills. In this regard our

goal was to maximize the comparability through time. This is why we tried to focus on full-time

workers with reasonably strong labor force attachment. For purposes of computing supply, the

desire for homogeneity is overridden by the requirement of measuring an aggregate quantity.

      Our wage data can be summarized by the 320 by 25 matrix W which contains the average

weekly wage from the wage sample br each of our 320 groups in each year from 1963 to 1987.

When we describe wages for more aggregated groups we uses fixed-weight aggregation scheme

where the fixed weights are given by the 320 element venter 01 average employment shares over

the 1963 to 1987 period which we denote N. In addition, we use this same vector ot fixed-weights

to construct wage Indices (or each year as NW. Deflating wages in each of year by the value of
this index for the year generates a time series of relative wages by groups (where each group's

wage is indexed to the wages for a fixed bundle of workers). The average of these relative wages

through time provides an estimate of the average relative wage of a given group and hence

provides a natural basis for aggregating quantities of labor supplied across groups in terms of

efficiency units. Accordingly, when we measure quantities of labor in efficiency units, we

compute mare aggregate aupplies from the IndIvidual cell supplies by weighting hours worked

in each cell contained in the aggregsta by the average relative wage of that cell and summing.



                    ill. REAL AND RELA11VE WAGE CHANGES, 1983-1987

      Table I describes changes In the real weekly wages of the full labor force and of Individual

demographic groups for the 1963-1987 perIod and for 3 sub-periods. 1963-1971, 1971-1979 and

1979.1987.6 Over the entire period average real weekly wages increased by 16.1 percent! This

growth in real wages breaks down Into a 19.2 percent increase between 1963 and 1971 and small

declines during life 1971-1979 and 1979-1967 sub-periods. me malor dtference between these

computations and more standard measures of average real wages is that the measures In Table

I refer to wages for a feted demographIc dIstribution (the average employment distribution over

the 1963 to 1957 perio4 and hence do not reflect changes in the level of wages arising from

shifts in the education, gender or experience composition of the labor force.

      The next two rows of the table indicate that wages & women increased by 9 percent

relative to the wages of men over the entire periot This reduction In the overall gender gap in

earnings was concentrated in the 1 960s. In fact, the eamings of women Increased relative to

those of men in almost all experience-education cells during the 19805. Panel A of Figure I

contrasts the time patlem of changes in the female/male wage ratio for high school and college

graduates from 1963 to l987'. Although the narrowing of the gender gap in wages started

earlier for college graduates than for high school graduates, the increase in the female/male wage

ratio is much more substantial in the 19805 for nigh school graduates.

       The next four rows of Table I show real wage changes by education level. For the full

period, real wage changes are monotonically increasing in education level reflecting a rise in

education-based wage differentials. The timing ol the growth in education returns is very uneven

however. From 1963 to 17I college graduates gained about 8 percent on other groups.

Between 1971 and 1979 real wages fell the most for college graduates, by 10.1 percent, and

actually increased slightly for the two least-educated groups. hi contrast, from 1979 to 1987

college graduates gained 14.1 percent on high school dropouts and 11.7 percent on high school

graduates. Since those changes more than make up for the decline in the relative wages of

college graduates over the 1970's, tile college wage premium was higher In the late 1980s than

at any other lime during our sample and most likely at any other time during the postwar period

[l3oldin and Margo, 1992].

       Panels B and C of Figure I further illustrates changes in the earnings of college graduate

relative to high school graduates. Panel B documents movements in the fixed-weighted average

college/high school wage ratio for all workers and for workers wIth I to 5 years of experIence.

The figure highlights much larger swings in educational differentials for young workers than for

older workers in the 19705 and 1980s. In fact, the college/high school wage ratio (or young

workers tell from 1.61 in 1969 to 1.44 in th7g and then increased sharply to 1.82 in 1987. Panel

C shows that fluctuations in the college wage premium were quite similar for men and women.

      The next two rows of Table I examine real wage changes by experience level for males.

Over the entire sample period the wage gap between older and younger workers expanded with

peak esrners, those with 26 to 36 years of experience, gaining 12 percent on new entrants, those

with 1 to 5 years of experience. Although experience differentials for men espanded throughout

the period, they increased most substantially during the 1980s.

      The final rows of Table I present real wage movements (or education by experience cells

tor males, Two distinct patterns emerge. First, high school graduates and high school dropouts

show the largest increases in experience differentials (16.3 and 10.8 percent respectively) and for
                                                 7

both groups thIs increese Is accounted for entirely by the rise In experience returns in the final

lime Interval. For college graduates the time series of experience returns Is quite different.

Experience differentials Increase sharply In both of the first two time intervals so that from 1963

to 1979 experienced college graduates gained 16.5 percent on new entrants. However, during

the 19805 the relative wages of young college graduates increased sharply. The differences in

the patterns of changes in experience differentials for high school and college graduates are

graphed in Panel 0 of Figure I.

      We have so far referred to changes In real wages for groups distinguished by sex,

education, and experience. However, given that these factors account for only sbout one-third

of the differences in wages across workers, there Is significant room for relative wage changes

within these categoriea as well. We use the dispersion of relative wages within our gender-

education-experience cells as a measure of the spread in relative wages across different skill

levels within the cells. Empirically we do this by looking at the distribution of residuals from a

regresaion of log weekly wages on a quariic in experience fully interacted with sex and four

education-level dummies and linear terms in education within these categories. The distributIon

of residuals from this regression essentially captures the dispersion of wages within the

demographic groups.
       We summarize these results In panel A of Figure II where we plot the differences the log

wage residuals of those at the 90th and at the 10th percentIles of the distribution of log wage

 residuals for men and women. Within-group (resIdua wage Inequality has expanded enormously

 for both women end men from 1963 to 1987. The log wage gap between the 90th and 10th

 percentile worker within experience-education groups increased by approximately 0.26 for men

 end 0.21 for women from 1963-87. This striking increase in wage Inequality within groups means

 that the not only have less-educated and less-experienced workers lost out over our sample

 period but so too have the 'least -skilied or least-lucky' workers within each category.

Inequality started to expand In the early 1970s and continued rather smoothly Increasing In the

1 980a. This lime pattern contrasts sharply with the pattern for education differentials. We

conclude from these differences in timing that the general rise in within-group inequality and the

rise In education premia over the 1963-87 period are actually somewhat distinct economic

phenomena. The earlier Increase In within-group inequality suggests a rise in the demand br

akilr that predates the recent rise in returns to education.

      We nest examine changes in overall wage inequality by sex. Panel B of Figure II plots

movements in overall wage dispersion as measured by the log wage differential between worirers

at the 90th and 10th percentiles of the wage distribution for men and for women, The 90-10 log

wage differential for males remained stable in the 1960s, increased substantially from I .18 in 1970

to 1,29 in 1979, and then expanded sharply by 0.t8 log points from 1979 to 1987. Wage

inequality for females remained fairly stable In the I 960s and 19705, and then increased sharply

from 1.08 in 1979 to 1.32 in 1987. The log wage gap between the 90th and 10th percentile

workers increased by 0.26 for men and by 0.25 for women from 1963 to 1987. The pattern ot

changes In overall wage inequality over our sample period is quite similar It one uses altematrve

summary measures such as the variance of log wages the interquartile range, or a gini coefficient

[Juhn Murphy, and Pierce, 1989; Karoty. 1990; Levy and Mumane, 1991]. In fact, the weekly and

hourly wage distributions for both men and woman appear to have spread out fairly evenly across

all percentiles from 1963 to 1987.

      We conclude that all msjor relative wage ditferentisis with the exception of the male/female

differential increased from 1963 to 1987. These basic changes in the U.S. wage stnicture can be

summarized as follows:

    1) The college wage premium rose from 1963 to 1971, tell Irom 1971 to 1979, and then rose

sharply from 1979 to 1987. The changes in the college/high school wsge ratio were greatest for

the youngest workers in the 1970s and 1980s and grestest for prime age wort<ers in the t960s.

    2) Espeflence differentials expanded substantially from 1963 to 1907. The most dramatic
                                                 9

 Increases In experience differentials occurred for less-educated males from 1979-87.

      3) Overall and residual weekly wage inequafty for both men and women (as measured by the

 90-ID log wage differential) were stable during the I 9eos and then increased by almost 30

 percent from the late 1 960s to 1987. The increase in residual inequality has been quite steady

 since the early 1970s, while the growth in overall inequality accelerated in the 1980s,

      4) After remaining fairly stable in the 1 960s and 1 970s, male/lemale wage differentials

 narrowed substantially from 1979 to 1987.



                       IV. A SIMPLE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FRAMEWORK

        We begin our examination of the between-group relative wage changes documented in the

previous section using a simple supply and demand framework in which different demographic

groups (identified by ses, education, and experience) are treated as distinct labor inputs. We

think of the relative wages of demogrsphic groups as being generated by the interaction of the

relative supplies of the groups and an aggregate production with ifs associated factor demand

schedules. To the extent these different demographic groups are imperfect substitutes in

production, we can view changes in relative wages ss being generated by shifts in relative

supplies and shifts in the factor demand schedules, Theiramework is distinctly partial equfibrium

in that we do not specify the deterrriioants of relative factor supplies. We only require that

observed prices and quantities must be on the demand curve.'



A. The Basic Framework

        Our basic framework involves an aggregate production function consisting of K types of

labor inputs, We sssume the associated factor demands can be written as



(1)                                            D(W,   )

where
                                               1O

           = Kxl vector of labor inputs employed In the market in year

        W1 = Kxl vector of madcet prices for these inputs in year

           = mxl vector of demand shift variables in year 1.



The demand shifters, 4 reflect the effects of technology, product demand, and other non-labor

Inputs on demands for labor Inputs.

      Under the assumption that the aggregate production function is concave, the (KxK) matrix

of cross-price effects on factor demands D, is negative aemidefinite Equation (1) can be written

In terms of differentials as



(2)                                   dX = DWdWI    +   D1C1Z.




The negative semidefiniteness of D,, implies



(3)                            dW(dX1 - DZdZ.)      dw;ocfw, 0.


Changes in factor supplies (net of demand stilt(s) and changes in wages must negatively covary.

      One hypothesis that has attracted much atiention in previous related research [e.g.

Freeman, 1979; Welch, 19791 Is whether shifts in relative supplies are the driving force behind

observed changes in relative wages. A test of an extreme version of this hypothesis is to examine

whether the data are consistent with stable factor demand. In this case, wage changes are

generated by relative supply changes arising from changing demographics and school completion

rates. In the case of two inputs, the basic implication of stable relative factor demand is that an

increase in the relative supply of a group must lead to a reduction in the relative wage of that

group. More generally, if factor demand is stable (Z1 fixed), equation (3) implies dWdX1 x 0 We

use our estimates of the time series, Qç, Wi), t=1963            1987, and a discrete version of this
                                                   11

 equation to test for stable demand. Specifically, we test for fixed factor demand between the year

  and year, by evaluating whether



 (4)




       This inequality provides a natural way in which to evaluate the pure supply shifts story.

 Periods of time in which the inequality In (4) Is satisfied (i.e., the inner product of changes In

 wages and changes in factor supplies is nonpositive) have the potential to be explained solely

 by supply shifts. When this inequality is not satisfied, no story relying entirely on supply shifts is

consistent with the data. In this case, we can evalaule alternative hypotheses concerning relative

demand shifts (alternative proxies for 2) using the discrete version of (3) given by



(5)                        (W, - W7)'[Qç -X) - (D(WVZJ - D(W,,Z,))J 0,



where we compute the inner product of I he change in wages from year r to year t with the

changes in net supplies (equal to the actual change in supply less the change in demand for X

that would have happened at fixed factor prices).

       In our implementation of this framework, we are concerned with explaining telattve wage

changes as a function of relative supply and relative factor demand shifts. We abstract from

changes in absolute wages arising from factor-neutral technological Change and from neutral

demand shifts associated with changes in the scale of the economy. To do so, we use a relative

wage measure (actual wages W1 deflated by the wage index N'W, where N is the (Ks 1) vector

of average employment shares over the entire sample for the K labor inputs) and a relative supply

measure (actual supplies )l deflated by the total supply of labor in the economy measured in

efficiency units rZX where a is I he (1< x 1) vector of average relative wages over the entire

sample) when we empirically evaluate (4) and (5).
                                                12

B. Relative SuooIv Changes

      Table II summarizes changes in relative lactor supplies (where each groups supply Is

measured relative to the total supply in efficiency units) over the 1953-1987 penod and the

sub-periods 19631971, 1971-1979 and 1979-1981 fOr the same aggregates used to analyze

changes in wages In Table I. The table Illustrates thaL there has been subatantiat tong run growth

In the relative supply of more-educated workers, younger workers, and women. The increase in

the average educational attainment of the labor lorce is particulaily striking. The share of

aggregate hours worked contributed by college graduates increased from 13.0 to 26.3 percent

trom 1963-1987, white the share for high school dropouts tell from 39.2 to 12.6 percent over the

same period. Shine the relative supplies and wages of more-educated workers and women

increased over the sample, relative demand changes favoring these groups are likely to be

necessary to explain I he observed data

      On the other hand, the table does illustrate the possibility that differences in the rate of

growth In the relative supply of college graduates may help explain the time pattern of changes

in the college wage premium, The largest increase in the supply ot college graduates comes

during the 1971-1979 period in which the cotege wage premiuth declined, and the smallest

growth of supply comes during the 1979-1987 period in which the college wage premium

expanded sharply. A smooth secular increase in the relative demand for college graduates

combined with the observed tiuctuations in the rate of growth of relative supply could potentially

explain the movements in the college wage premium trom 1963 to 1987.

       An analogous story emphaslang smooth trend growth in the relative demand for women

and relative supply growth variation seems less likely to provide a complete story for changes in

the gender gap in earnings. The rate of growth 01 the share of the labor torce accounted for by

women is more rapid in the 1970s than in the 1960s or 1980s. The deceleration in the rate of

growth of temate labor supply in the 1 980s combined with a secular growth in the relative demand

for industries and occupation in which conan have bean concentrated may help explain the

greater earnings gains made by women in the I 980s than in the l9flis. On the other hand, the

acceleration In the growth rate of relative supply from the 19605 to the 1970a bodes pootly for an

explanation based on supply growth Iluctuatlons since the relative earnings 01 women declined

in the 1960s.

      Changes in the age structure of the labor force may be an important pan of an explanation

for secular increases in the relative earnings ot older workers. The share of labor supply

(measured in efficiency unlts} accounted for by workers with I to 10 yesrs of experience

lnceased rapidly from 18.9 percent in 1963 to a peak of 30.8 percent in 1980 and then decreased

to 27.4 percent in 1987. The secular increase in the share of young workers consisted of

dramatic increases In the relative supply of new entrants from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s as

the baby boom cohorts entered the labor force combined with a sharp decline in the share of new

entrants in the I 980s with the pessage of the baby boom cohorts into mid-career. This pattern

of changes in relative supplies can help explain increase in experience differentials in the 1970s,

but It baa some difficulties with the sharp increases in experience differenliala for less-educated

males in the 1980s.



C. Can Relative Supply Changes Explain Relative Wage Changes?

      To more formally examine how relative supply changes line up with the relative wage

changes, we implement the framework outlined above. For the analysis in this section, we divide

our data into 64 distinct labor groups, distinguished by sex, 4 education categories (8-11. 12, 13-

15, and 16-4- years of schooling) and 8 experience categories (1-5, 6-10, 11-151 18-20, 21-25, 26-

30, 31-35, and 36-40 years). We begin wIth equation (4) and compute the inner products of

changes in relative wages with changes in relative factor supplies between time periods. To

reduce the number of computations and minimize the Impact of measurement en-or, we aggregate

our 25 years into five 5-year intervals and compute average reiative wages (relative to our wage

index) and average relative suppiles for each of our 64 groups within these sub-periods. We
                                                 14

then compute the inner products of the changes in these measures of wages and supplies

between each pair of these five intervals.

       The results of these calculations are given in the top part of Table lii. The data appear to

be reasonably consistent with the stable demand hypothesis for the 1965-80 period. Five ot the

aix comparisons for this period are negative and the positive one is quite small and mIght be

difficult to distinguish from sampling error. In contrast, all comparisons involving the interval

centered in 1985 are positive and thereby reject a stable factor demand structure. Our tindings

are quite similar when we limit the analysis to men.

       Figure III illustrates these patterns by plotting changes in log relative supplies against

changes in log relative wages for the 64 labor groups br the period as a whole and for the three

sub-periods. Tho lines drawn in the figures represent predicted values from weighted least

squares regressions of the changes in log wages on the changes in log factor supplies (or each

interval with the weights being the employment shares of each group in the initial period. The

tour graphs shown in the figure reinforce the tindings from the inner products: tor the 1963-87

period as a whole and moat strong for the l9aos, the groups with the largest increases in

relative supplies tended to have the largest increases in relative wages. Thus, when looking

across groups, diFferential supply growth alone seems like an unlikely candidate to explain the

ohserved changes in relative wages for the entire period, in tact, we tnd a negative relationship

between growth in factor supplies and in relative wages only during the 1971-1979 period. These

findings indicate that demand growth was an important component of the change in factor prices

dyer the period as a whole and particularly during the lgaos. Delineating the time pattern and

nature of these relative demand shifts is our next goat.

      We first examine the whether the observed wage changes can be made consistent with the

observed pattern of relative quantity changes simply by allowing for smooth trend changes in

retative demands. Such trend demand shifts might reflect a steady pace on non-neutral

technotogicat changes or steady changes in the industrial composition of employment. To do

this, we regress the time series of relative wages and of quantities for each of our 64 groups on

a constant and a linear time trend. We then average the residuals over five-year cantered

Intervals for each group and compute the inner products in changes In detrended relative prices

and relative quantities. The resists of tI-us procedure are shown in the bottom half of Table III.

Comparing these numbers with those obtained without con-ectlng for trend changes, we see that

many more of the comparisons now show negative inner products. We infer from this that trend

demand growth alone can make almost all of the observed price and quantity changes consistent

with otherwise stable demand, although the remaining positive inner pwduct for the leans in

dotrended changes suggests some acceleration in the rate of growth of demand for women and

more-educated workers in the I 9805 appears necessary.



             V. MEASURING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE DEMAND FOR LABOR

      It is clear that substantial shifts in relative labor demand are necessary to explain observed

changes in the wage structure since the early 1 960s as reflecting changes in relative competitive

wage levels. Changes in the structure of product demand, increased international competition,

and skill-biased technological change have attracted much attention as possible reasons for shifts

in labor demand against less-educated males. We find it usetul to think of relative labor demand

shifts as coming from two types of changes: those that occur within industries (i.e. shifts that

change the relative factor intensties within industries at fixed relative wages) and those that occur

between industries (i.e. shifts that change the allocation of total labor demand between industries

at heed relative wages). Imponant sources of within-industry shifts include factor non-neutral

technological change, changes in prices of nonlabor inputs (e.g. computer services), snd

outsourcing (shifts of ponions of industry production out of the United States). Between-Industry

shtts in demand may be driven by shifts in product demand across industries, sectoral

differences in factor neutral tot at factor productivity growth, and shifts in net international trade

whch change the domestic share of output at fixed relative wages.
                                                  16

       The effect of between-industry shifts in labor demand on the relative demands for different

 demographic groups depends on group differences in industrial employment distributions. Table

 IV presents the distributions of employment among twelve broad industries and three major

 occupational categories of six gender-education groups.t° The distributions in the table are the

 average distributions for each group over the 1967 to 1987 period.11 The substantial differences

 in employment distributions indicate that shifts in labor demand across industries and occupations

 may greatly affect the relative wages of these groups.

       Table V illustrales thst large changes occurred in the industrial and occupational

distribution of total empioyment over the 1907-87 period- The shift over the entire period in the

industrial employment distribution out of low tech and 'bssic manufacturing and into

professional and business services is suggestive of a trend demand shift in favor of college

graduates and of women and agsinst less-educated males. The subsfanfiaf decline in importsnce

of production wort<er jobs poinfs towards similar demand shifts.

       It within-industry relative factor demand is stable so that changes in the wage structure are

entirely explained by between-industry shifts in labor demand and relative supply changes, then

the shares of industrial employment of groups whose relative wages have increased should tend

to fall inside every industry. Thus the hypothesis of stable within-industry demand implies that

the shares of women and college graduatos should have declined in all industries. Since the

shsre of aggregate empoyment of women and college graduates incressed over this period, this

scenano requires s substantial shift in employment into industries that intensively employ women

sod more-educated workers. In fact, an examination of our Cf'S data indicates that the shares

of employment (measured either in total hours or efficiency units) accounted for by women and

by college graduates increased in almost every Iwo-digit industry both from 1963 Ic 1987 sod

during the 19805.12 This finding indicates that within-industry demand shifts favoring these

groups must have occurred. On the other hand, the finding that wthin-induslry shifts must have

occurred does not rule out the possibility that the between-industry shifts suggested by Table V

  are an Important factor In relative wage changes. We next more formally develop arid Implement

  a procedure for assessing the magnitude ot' between-sector shifte in relative labor demands,



  A, Conceptual Framework

        One widely used measure of the effect of between-sector demand shifts on relative labor

  demands ts the lixed-coefticlertt msnpower requirernentv Index [e.g. Freeman, 1975, 1980]. This

 index measures the percentage change in the demand for a demographic group as Il-ta
                                                                                            weighted
 average of percentage employment growth by industry where the weights are the Industrial

 employment distribution for the demographic group In abase period)3 In this section, we clarify

 the Interpretstion of these demand shift measures, These simple demsnd shift indices
                                                                                             provide
 appropriate demand shift measures for implementing equation (3) to determine whether within-

 sector relative demand shifts are necessary to explain observed shifts in relative wages. On the

 other hand, when relative wages are not fixed, such demand shifts measures era biased

 indicatom's of 'lue' between-sector relative demand shifts. Nevertheless, the nature of the bias can

 be determined. These demand shift indices tend to understate the relative demand shift
                                                                                            favoring
 groups with increases in relative prices.

       We begin our tormal analysis by considering an economy that consists of J sectors (which

can be thought of as industries or as industry-occupation cells) and 1< labor inputs. We denote

output in sector .1 by 'Y and assume production takes place under constant returns to scale in

all sectors, We can write the If by 1 vector of tactor demands in sector,
                                                                             X as


(6)
                                             iç = Cj(W)Y1,



where Cj1(W) a the K by t vector of unit factor demand curves (i.e. the partial derivatives of the

unit cost function in sectorj with respect to each group's own wage). Equation (6) can be written
in terms of differentials as
                                                      18

(7)                                    dX = C(W)dY + Y1C(W)CfW,


under the assumption that within-sector demand is stable. Pre-muttiptying by W and using the
result that unit actor demands are homogeneous of degree tern in factor prices, we derive



(9)                                         Wd = WX (dY/f1)
or

(Ba)

                                                  v1 w•

so that we can measure the percentage change in outputs by the value weighted percentage

change in inputs.

             This result is particularly usetul since aggregating (7) across sectors yields



  (0)                       dX - EXII + CdW -                            + CdW.



where dX is the (K xl) vector of employment changes, C is the (K x K) maths that corresponds

to the production-weighted average of the Hessians (second pailial derivathes) of the unit cost

 functions for the J industries and is negative semidefinite. Equation (9) implies that



      (10)                       [dX - x_.53] - dW'CdW                       0.




             Equation (10) is of the form given in equation (3). Thus an appropriate between-sector

 demand shift measure to evaluate whether the data are consistent with stable demand within-

 sectors is the (Ks 1) vector
                                                            —-                                —- —.

  (Ii)                                    AD -
                                                    liwi
 which is simply the vector of weighted sums of sector employments for each factor with the

weights given by the percentage changes in the value of inputs in each sector, This demand shift

 index is exactly the standard fixed-coefficients index with sectoral employment changes measured

in efficiency units rather than in raw hours. The intuitive interpretation of the index is that those

inputs employed heavily in expanding sectors will have increased demand, while those inputs

employed mostly in contracting sectors will have falling demand.

         It is important to note at this point that all quantities in equation (11) are the equilibrium

changes in factor employments and are thereby directly measurable. No presumption has been

made as to the source of the changes in employments other than the tact that the sector-specific

unit cost functions are being held fixed)4 Although the demand index given in equation (t 1)

can be directly inserted into equation (10) to test for the stab1lity of demand within sectors, this

demand index does not provide an unbiased measure of tme between-industiy demand shifts

when relative wages are changing.

         The reason for this bias is that changes in relative wages can affect the distribution of

sectoral outputs so that AD will not measure the effects ot changes in the allocation of labor

demand across sectors at fixed relative wages. The output shares of sectors that intensively

employ groups with relative wage increases are likely to fall relative to what they would have been

at stable relative wages. Thus AD is likely to be downward biased measure of demand shifts in

favor of groups with relative wage increases.

       More formally, we can write the (J x 1) vector of changes in relative outputs, dY, as



(t2)                           dY= dY -t-YdP = d'( + YCdW.
                                                 20

where dC Is the (J x 1) vector 01 true' product demand shifts computed at used factor prices,

P ix the (.1 x 1) vector of sector output prices, V Is the (J x J) matrix of derivatives with respect

to the price vector of the secloral demand functions, and C1 is the (.1 x K) matrix of derivatives

of the unt cost tunction with respect to own wages. The second equality arises from the

assumption ot constant returns to scale which implies that dP CW(% dW. Using equations (6),

(Ba), (11), and (12), we can write our demand index as



(13)               AD = CL(W) dY1 = (C)'dV = (CJ'd'( + (C_)' V, C_ dW.


Equation (13) gives our demand shift mease In terms of the true factor demand shift (CJ'd'C

and a bias term (0)'P0W dW. If (C)'VCw is negative semidetinite (as will be the case in the

absence of income effects), this bias term will be inversely related to wage changes on average

(i.e. the inner product of dW and the bias term will be nonposfive). In the two factor case the

between-sector demand index given in equation (Ii) will understate the demand increase for

those groups with rising relative wages. More generally, our demand shift index will tend to

understate the magnitude of the true relative demand shifts favoring groups with an increases in

relative wages.



B. Measured Demand Shiftsj 967-87

       To implement this approach to measuring demand shifts, we divide the economy into 50

two-digit industries arId a occupation categories and take the resulting 150 industry-occupation

cells as our sectors. The advantage of adding occupations to the industry taxonomies used in

most previous work is that doing so allows us to look at some dimensions of within-industry shifts

in labor demand, as well as between-industry shifts, Within our framework, we can think of

occupations as producing intermediate goods within industries.

       Empirically we construct our demand shift measure to correspond to the index AD defined
                                                                                                           /1

to 1967. Since education differentials expanded and gender differentials narrowed overthe 1967-

87 period, the actual between-sector demand shifts toward more-educated workers and women

that would have occurred at fixed-factor pricea are likely to have been even greater than the

increases indicated in Table Vt. The overall measure indicates that between-sector shifts In

employment Increased the demand for male college graduates by over 30 percent relative to

males with 12 or fewer years of schooling. Demand shifts in favor of women are much greater

for high school graduates and those with some college than for high school dropouts and college

graduates. These difference reflect the concentration of males but not females with 12 to Is

years of schooling in production occupations and manufacturing industries.

      Although the measured demand shifts toward more-educated workers and towards women

have been substantial, they are significantly smaller than the observed relative supply changes

documented in Table II. Thus changes in relative wages and changes in relative supplies net of

changes in the between-sector demand shift index positively covary over the 1907-87 and the

1979-87 period. Demand shifts within our industry-occupation cells are required to explain the

observed extent of positive covariation in changes in relative wages and relative supplies.

      Table VI also suggests that the pace of overall demand growth for college graduates

appears to have been relatively steady over the 1967-87 period. On the other hand, their are

some differences in the lime paftern of shifts in the demand for Female and male college

graduates. The magnitude of relative demand shifts favoring college males appears to have

increased In the 1980, while demand shifts favoring female college graduates are smatler in the

lSBOs than in the earlier periods. These differences reflect the rapid growth of the professional

and business services in the 1980s and the decline in relative employment in education and the

public sector in this same period. Furthermore the overall demand shift index masks important

differences in the between- and within-industry measures of demand shifts. Between-industry

shifts for college graduates appear to have decelerated in the 1 980s, while within-industry

demand shifts (largely reflecting an accelerating rate of decline in the share of production jobs
                                                 23

within industries) have accelerated throughout the period.



C. Demand Shifts Arising From Changes In International Trade

       We next examine the importance oF changes In net International trade in manufactured

goods as a source of relative labor demand shifts.15 Many have argued that increased import

competition particularly with the large U.S. trade deficits of the 1980s has played an important role

in shifting in employment out of manufacturing sectors and shilling relative demand against less-

educated workers.

       To estimate the labor supply equivalents of trade, we transform trade flows Into equivalent

bodies on the basis of the utilization of labor inputs in the domestic manufacturing industries that

constitute the bulk of the traded goods sector. We do this by estimating the direct labor supply

embodied in trade, Ignoring Indirect input-output effects. Thus the implicit labor supply in trade

is the labor input required to produce traded output domestically. Formally, we let l be net

imports in industry i in year . '5 be domestic output of industry I In year I, and E.5 be ihe share

of total efficiency units in the U.S. economy in year t employed in sector i ( E 1). The Implicit

supply of labor embodied in net imports in industry i in year I measured ass fraction of lolal U.S.

labor input is given by E.I/Y.J*IW The implicit supply of labor of demographic group Ii contained

in net trade in year t as a fraction of total domestic labor supply of K is given by



(15)                                     L = e E(lj4)

where e the average proportion of employment (measured in efficiency units) in industry I made

up of workers in group j over the 1967-87 period.

       We measure ft-re effect of trade on relative demand for demographic group k in year t as



(16)                         T -(1/E); [e E(Ijt)] + z E(l/Y)
                                                24

where E Is the average share of total employment In efficiency units of group k for the 1967-87

period. The first term is simply the implicit supply of the labor of group k contained in trade

normalized by base year employment of k with the sign reversed to convert this supply shift

measure into a demand sniff measure, The second term adjusts the demand shift measure so

that trade only affects relative demands for labor.'7

       In equatIon (16) we assume that trade-Induced changes in an industry's output alter the

employment of production and nonproduction workers in that Industry in the same manner as

would domestic-induced changes in output. Aiternetively, however, it is plausible that exports and

imports may affect quite different portions of an industry and may have differential impacts on the

employment of production and nonproduction workers. In particular, while exports and

production for domestic consumption may create employment for both kinds of workers In a

similar manner, Imports may displace production workers to a far greater extent than they

displace nonproduction workers. In fact, many activities of nonproduction workers (e.g marketing.

sales, accounting) may be relatively complementary with production workers overseas. To take

into account this issue, we provide two estimates of the effects of trade on employmenL Under

the First method which we denote 'equal allocation? we directly employ equation (16) and treat

net imports in a manner analogous to domestic production for domestic consumption. Under the

second method which we denote 'production worker allocation? we modify the first term in

equation (16) so that exports are allocated to all workers in the same manner as domestic

production for domestic consumption, but imports are allocated to productIon workers only.'5

      We use data on imports, exports, output from the NBER Immigration, Trade, and Labor

Market Data Files to compute the trade ratios used in the construction of our indices of demand

shifts arising from trade. These data cover four-digit SIC manufacturing industries for each

year from 1967 to t 985. we aggregate these data into 21 two-digit manufacturing industries.

   Table VII presenis the changes in relative labor demand predicted by changes in international

trade in manufactures for the 1961-73, 1973-79, and igi-as periods. The table indicates that

the effects on relative labor demands of trede were quite moderate until substantial trade deficits
developed in me i 980a. The adverse effects of trade on relative labor demand are concentrated

on high school dropouts. Female dropouts who have traditionally been employed intensively as

production workers in import-competing industries such as apparel and textiles are the group

most affected by trade. In fact, demand changes from trade are large for lemale high school

dropouts in the 1 983s than are domestic sources of between-sector demand shifts. The table

also indicates the effects of trade on relative labor demand are substantially larger when imports

are assumed to disproportionately effect production workers. Although trade-induced changes

in relative demand move in the coned direction to help explain rising education differentials in

the 1 980s, they sre quite small relative to (he increases in the relative supplies of more-educated

workers over the same period.




     VI. UNDERSTANDING CHANGES IN EDUCA11ON AND EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTIALS

A. Education Differentials

      The college/high school wage premium Increased from 1963 to I 971 • lelt from 1971 through

1979, and then rose sharply alter 197g. There are two primacy types of explanations for these

movements in the college/high school wage differential. The first Interprets these changes in

relative earnings as representing changes in the relative market price of skills possessed by

college and high school graduates.

       The second type of explanation focuses on changes in the composition of college and high

school graduates that effect the relative skill levels of the two groups. This type of explanation

interprets the decline in the college wage premium in the 1 970a as reflecting a decline in the

relative quality of college graduates and the rise in education returns in the 1 SBOs as reflecting

a decline in the relative quality of high school graduates. Because within-cohort comparisons are

likely to hold the relative qualify of college and high school graduates relatively constant, this
                                                  26
hypothesis suggests one should not lInd Important within-cohort changes in the college wage

premium. Since movements in the college/high school wage differential are quite similar within

cohorts and within experience levels over our sample period [Blackburn, Bloom, end Freeman,

1900; Kati and Murphy, I 99O, we conclude it is appropriate to view differences in the movement

in the college wage premium In the 1960s, 1970S, and 1980s as largely reflecting changes in the

relative price oF college skills rather ihan es primarily reflecting changes in the relative quality of

college graduates. Thus we turn to evaluating supply and demand explanations for changes In

the relative price of college skills.

       We take the overall college/high school wage ratio For males and females combined as the

relattve price to be explained?5 We amalgamate our 320 groups into two labor aggregates:

college equivalent workers and high school equ'ivalent workers. We use the relative quantity of

college and high school equIvalents as our relative supply variable in assessing explanations for

movements in the college/high school wage ratio,

       We create our measures of college and high school equivalents as lollows. We construct

aggregate labor inputs (using a f'wed-weight total supply measure with weights proportional to

average wages over the I 963-87 period) for each of our tour education groups (8-11, 12, 13-45,

and 16+ years of schooling). We treat high school graduates (those with 12 years of schooling)

as pure high school equivalents and we treat college graduates as pure college equivalents, We

allocate other categodes of workers (those with less than twelve years of schooling and those with

some college) to our two aggregate groups on the basis of regressions determining the extent

to which their wages move with the wage of high schoot graduates and college graduates

respectively. For those with less than a high school degree and those with some college, we

regress the average wage series for each of these two groups on the wage series for high school

graduates and For college graduates over the 1963-87 pertod.21 (The implicit assumption Is that

each group is a linear combination of college and high school graduates). The regression results

suggest that one person with some college is equivalent to a total of 0.69 of a high school
                                                    27

graduate and 0.29 of a college graduate while a hIgh school dropout Is equivalent to 0.93 of a

high school graduate and -0.05 of a college graduate. We use these coefficIents to allocate the

corresponding quantities of high school dropouts end those with some college to the high school

and college quantities to form the supplies of high school and college equivalents.

       We consider the simplest CEO technology with two factors (college and high school

equivalents) so that relative wages In year t, w1(t)/w2(t). and relative supplies in year t, xi (t)1x2(t),

satisfy the relationship



(17)      Iog(w1(t)1w2(t)) = (ho) (0(1) - log(x1(t)/x2(t))I,



where a is the elasticity of substitution between college and high school equivalents and 0(1)15

the time series of relative demand shifts measured in log quantity units. Given that there are other

Inputs in the production lunction, this is a conditional factor demand framework which requires

that demand shifts be defined to include the eltects of changes in the prices (or equivalently the

supplies) of these other Inputs.

       The elasticity of substitution is an unknown parameter and the time series of 0(t) Ia

unobservable. Under the aaaumption that the economy operates on the demand cuive given by

equation (17), a given value of the elasticity of substitution between factors (e = a0) implies a

time aches of demand shifts:



cia)      0(t) = o, iog(w1(t)1w2(t)) + log(x1(t)1x2(t)).



The greater the elasticity of substitution between the Iwo factors, the smaller ihe impact of shifts

in relative supplies on relative wages and the greater must be the fluctuations in D(t) to explain

any given time series of reiative prices for a given time series of observed relative quantities.

       We take two approaches to developing atones consistent with the observed time series on
                                                  26
prices and quantities. The first Is to estimate by running (IT) by ordinay least squares under

the assumption that D(t) is approximated by a simple linear time trend. We are somewhat

skeptical of estimates 01 a recovered From 25 non-Independent time series observations.

Our second approach is to use equation (18)10 impute D(t) conditional on a choice for the value

of a. For any given value of a, we can evaluate the implied explanation by examining whether

the implied time seriea For D(t) matches well with the measures of between- and within-industry

demand shifts developed in the previoua section.

      The basic movements In our relative price and relative quantity measures over are sample

period are summarized in the top part of Table VIII. The relative supply of college equivalents

grew tremendously over this period and the college wage premium increased substantially. A

regression of the log of the ratio of the supply of college to high school equivalents on linear time

trend for the 1963-87 period yields a coefficient of 0.045 (t=41 .5), and the log relative price series

is slmoat orthogonal to trend. Hence the relative demand for college equivalents has grown by

about 4.5 percent per year on average over the sample period.

      The key question to be addressed is the degree to which the time series of the college

wage premium has been driven by fluctuations in the growth of supply versus the extent to which

it has been driven by fluctuations in demand-side factors. Figure IV graphs the detrended wage

and price series in Panels A and 8). Since the price series has little trend, the series in Panel A

is quite similar to the overall retuma to college series. The quantity series plotted in Panel 8 and

summarized in Table VIII reveals aome Important features, however: supply grew slower than

average from 1963-71, faster than average from 1971 until about 1979, and then slower than

average again in the I 980a. It appears that an explanation emphasizing fluctuations in supply

growth has the potential to explain observed fluctuations In the college wage premium.

      Thus the model in equation (17) in which D(t} Is proxied by a linear time trend may tit the

data reasonably well. OLS estimation of this equation for the 1963-87 period yields

 with an R2 of 0.52. The estimate of o in (19) implies an elasticity of substitution between college

 and high school labor of about 1.41. The actual time series of college returns and the fitted

 values from this regression are shown together in Panel C of Figure IV. The figure shows that this

 model does a tolerable job of explaining the movements in the college wage premium except for

 the perIod from the late 1 970s lo the early I 980s.

         Panel D in Figure IV shows the implied demand series derived from (18) for elasticities of

 substitution of 0.5 1.41, and 4 with demand normalized to equal 0 in 1963. The figure illustrates

 that there is a one dimensional family of implied demand shifts (indexed by a) that are consistent

 with the observed price and quantity lime series. The implied demand shifts range from relatively

 steady demand growth when is small (0.5 to 1) to demand growth which slows significantly in

 the 1970s and accelerates greatly during the 1980s when is moderate to high.

         To see how alternative demand shift scenarios compare with the observed pattern of

 between-sector demand shifts calculated in the previous section, we aggregate the demand shift

measures by educaliongender groups presented In Table VI into demand shifts for college

equwslents relative to high school equivalents. Table VIII compares these shifts to movements

in the relative supply of college equivalents. Our demand shift index implies that the relative

demand for cotlege graduates Increased by 10.2 percent from 1971 -79 and by 9.9 percent from

1979-87. There a little direct indication of an acceleration in the growth of the relative demand

for more highly educated workers from these demand shill indices. On the other hand, our

analysis of the nature of the bias in these Indices indicates that the demand shift index

understates the iruof between-sector growth for college graduates relative to high school

graduates in the 1980s and overstates the shifts in the 19705. Furthermore, the overall demand

shift measure masks a combination of a deceleration in measured between industry demand shifts

and an acceleration in measured within industry demand shifts from the 1 970s to the 1 980s. The
                                                  30

measured demand shifts explain about one-third of the implied trend demand shifts consistent

with the obseried time series of prices and quantities.



B. xpprience Differentials

       We next examine explanations for movements in experience differentials for males over the

I 963-87 period. We locus on males since our measure of potential experience is likely to be a

worse indicator of actual experience for women than tor men. We take the ratio of the wage of

males with 26 to 35 years of experience (old workers or peak earners) to the wage of males with

I to 5 years of experience (young workers or new entrants) as the relative price to be expIained

       me path of fhe log old/young wage differential for all males over our sample period ls

presented in Panel A of Figure V. The overall old/young wage differential for males was

reasonably constant from the mid-I 960s to 1970, Increased sharply in the early 1970a, remained

stable in the late I 9705, and increased greatly in the 1980s. The log old/young wage differential

increased by approximately 0.12 over the entire period. The time pattern of the changes in

experience differentials for all men are dominated by changes For those with less than lit years

of schooling. Panel 0 of Figure 1 showed that experience differentials increased markedly from

 1979 to 1987 for high school graduates and actually fell for college graduates over the same

period. These sharp differences in a period of rising education differentIals are suggestive of the

active labor marker hypothesis of Freeman (1975) in which changes in the labor market show

 up most sharply for new entrsnta because more senior workers are insulated by labor market

 institutions, such as seniority layoff systems, and valuable firm-specific capital. In particular, I he

 collapse of new employment opportunities for less-educated workers in the manufacturing sector

 in the 1980s is likely to have had its most severe impact on young less-educated males.

       We first examine the ability of changes in the relative supply of more- to less-experienced

 workers to explain changes in experience differentials. Table 11 indicates that the relative supply

 of workers with I to 10 years of experIence Increased greatly over the entire 1963-87 period but

actually declined In the 1960s as the baby boom cohort workers became more experienced end

the baby bust cohort entered the labor market- This suggests that the growth In relative supply

or young workers can help explain the secular growth in experience differentials but will have

trouble explaining changes In the 1980a. On the other hand, the fraction of workers with 11 to

20 years of experience grew rapidly In the 1 980a, and it is a priori unclear how an expansion of

the supply of workers in this group affects the earnings or new entranta relative to peak earners,

      We attempt to deal with the issue of how multi-dimensional changes in the age structure

of the labor force affect the relative earnings of old to young workers by using a relative supply

variable that aggregates all experience groups into two groups (old and young equivalents). The

construction of this variable Is exactly analogous to the construction of college and high school

equivalents above. We treat workers with 26 to 35 years or experience as pure old equivalents

and those with 1 to S years or experience as pure young equivalents. We allocate workers in the

five other 5-year experience brackets (6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, 36-40 years( to our two

aggregate groups on the basis of regressions (without intercepts) of their wages on the wages

of those with 26-35 and I-S yearn of experience.

      We display the time path of the log relative supply of young to old equivalents in panel 6

of Figure V. The basic movements In the relative supply of young to old equivalents look quite

similar to a smoothed version of the changes in the old/young wage ratio illustrated in panel A

of the figure. in particular, the long-term growth in experience differentials is quite consistent with

the tong-term increase in the share of young equivalent workers. Yet the timing or the changes

in experience differentials (particularly movements in the mid-1970s and the 1980s) doss not

match up well with the srsoothly declining rate of growth of the relative supply or young

equivalents.

       These points are brought out by a comparison of movements in actual experience

differentials and the predicted values from a regression over the 1963-87 of the log old/young

wage ratio on the log relative supply of old to young equivalents3 The actual and predicted
                                                  32

values from this regression are contrasted in panel C of Figure V. The regression does a good

job of explaining the secular growth In experience differentials but fells to explain the sharp

increase in the 1980s. The active labor market hypothesis suggests that a weak market for less-

educated workers may help explain widening experience differentials for less-educated workers

since young less-educated workers will bear the brunt of adjustment to changing market

condition. The addition of the log of the overall college/high school wage ratio to our specification

(essentially as a proxy br relative demand shifts in favor of older workers} improves tlie ability of

the regression to explain movements in overall experience differentials as is illustrated In panel

D of Figure V, Relative supply movements combined with the state of the labor market for

educated workers go a long way toward explaining changes in experience dilterentials for men.



                                        VII. CONCLUSIONS

       A simple supply and demand framework helps illuminate many aspects of changes in the

U.S. wage structure. The relative wages and quantities of more-educated workers and women

increased substantially trom 1963 to 1987. Within group and overall wage inequality atso

increased sharply over this period. Substantial secular growth in the demand br more-educated

workers, females, and more-skilled workers within groups is necessary to interpret the observed

changes in relative wages as changes in competitive skill prices. Measured changes in the

allocation of labor demand between sectors (150 industry-occupation cells) can account for a

large minority of the secular demand shifts in favor of groups with rising relative wages. Demand

shifts arising from changes in international change in manufacturing only stan to be ot quantitative

significance with the appearance 01 large trade deficits in the 1980s. The majority of the required

demand shifts in favor of more-educated workers and females reflect difficult to measure changes

in within-sector relative labor demand. Recent work by Krueger [1991] suggests that the spread

of computers in the workplace may be an imponant component of these within-sector changes

In the composition of labor demand.

      me pattern of changes in the wage structure differed substantially In the I aGOa, I 970a, and

 980s. The college wage premium increased moderately in the 1960s, declined In the 1970s, and

expanded dramatically in the 1980s. Differences across the three decades In the rate of the

growth of the supply of college graduates as a fraction of the labor force appear 10 play an

important role in explaining these large differences in the behavior of the relative earnings of

college graduates. Fluctuations in the rate of growth of relative supply do not greatly help

illuminate differences across decades in changes in the male/female wage ddferentiaL

Within-group earnings inequality wss stable In the 1 960s and has increased steadily since the

early 19705, The ditlerences in the time pattern of rising education differentials end rising within-

group inequality suggest I hat they are at least partially distinct economic phenomena.

      Much recent work indicates that economic pressures towards Increased inequslity and skill

differentials srising from between-industry shfts in labor demand and skill-biased technological

change appear importsnt in most DECD economies in the 1980s [e.g. t3ottschslk and Joyce

1991; Katz and Lovemsn, 1990]. Although wage structures appesr to have started to expand in

almost all QECD countries by the middle of the 1 980a, the magnitude of the changes very

substsntislly. The extent to which this divergence in wage structure changes across countries

is explained by differences in the supply and demand fsctors emphasized in this papor as

opposed to differences in wage-setting institutions is an importsnt topic for future research.

2, PotentIal experience Is calculated as min(age years of schooling - 7, age - 17) where age is
the age at the survey date.

3. Weeks worked are available only on a bracketed basis for survey years prior to 1976. To
impute weeks worked for the 1964-75 surveys, we divided the wage sample for the later survey
years into cells defined by the weeks worked brackets used in the earlier surveys and sex. We
used the means of weeks worked for these cells from the 1976-88 surveys as our esbmates of
weeks worked for individuals in the corresponding cells in the earlier surveys.

4. The Census began using a finer classification of observebles to Impute wages for workers who
failed to report wages in the 1976 survey. Since information on which workers had imputed
weges is not available for the years 1963-66, one can't a construct wage series using only
workers without imputed wages for our entire sample period. To edjust group average wages for
changes in the imputation procedures, we multiplied the average wages In each cell for the years
 1963-75 by etime-invariant, cell-specific adjustment factor. The adjustment factors were picked
to Impose the condition that the average percentage wage difference between the wages of all
workers and those of workers wIthout wage Imputations were the same in the 1967-75 and 1 975-
87 periods. Our quatt alive findings for the 1967-87 period are quite similar when we use our
adjusted series including workers with imputed wages and when we use only workers without
wage imputations. See Lillard, Smith, end Welch [1996] for a discussion of the changes in
techniques to impute missing data implemented with the 1976 survey.

5. Total hours worked for group j in year t is given by; h16 ca, where i indexes indwiduels, h is
annual hours worked, and Ca is the CPS sample weight. Usual weekly hours for the previous year
are only available in the CPS since 1976. For survey years 1964-1975, we use hours worked
during the survey week to measure of usual weekly hours in the previous year. For individuals
who did not work during the survey week, we imputed usual weekly hours using the mean of
hours worked last week for individuals of the same sex and same full-time/pert-time status who
reported hours worked last week on that year's survey.

6. We compute real wages by deflating nominal wages in each year by the implicit price deflator
for personal consumption expenditures from the National Income and Product Accounts.

7. We refer to 100 times log changes as percentage changes in this section.

8. The female/male wage ratios reported in the figure are computed by first sorting the data into
cells defined by education level and five-year potential experience intervals. The reported
female/male wage ratios are fixed-weighted averages of the ratios of the average weekly wage
 of females to the average weekly wage of mates in each cell where the fixed weight for each cell
 Is the cell's average share 01 total employment over the entire 1963-87 period. The wage ratios
 reported in the other panels of Figure I are analogous fixed-weighted averages of wage ratios for
 cells defined by gender, education level, and five-year experience interval.

9. The use of these relative wage and quantity measures can be formally juslilied as follows. We
first assume the aggregate production function can be written as y = .Fpc) where indexes
the state of technology of the economy and 9) is concave. The concavity of 9) implies
                                               37

where F Is the tOrt vector of derivatives ol F with respect to the K Inputs. Under the assumption
that marginal products ere set equal to factor prices, we have W = FjX1) for all t so that the
inequality can be rewritten as

                                  [(WJcJ - (W11ø1)j (X - X) 0.

II we further assume that there are constant returns to scale in production so that 9) is a linear
homogeneous function, then F,QçXJ = F1(XJ for any scalar k1. Thus, W1 = F(k1XJ and W1
,F(kX,) for any scalars Ic and Ic. This Implies that the inequality

                                        - (W/,)]QcX1 - IcX) a 0

also holds for any scalars Ic and tc• This final inequality is the form of (4) that we use in our
empirical tests. We approximate the level of productivity at time I, , using the value of our wage
index NW1, and we multiply the factor quantities      in year t by one over the total supply in
efficiency units.

to. We locus on gender-education groups because differences in industrial distributions by sex
and education are much more significant than differences by experience level.

II. Because of incompatibilities between the Industry and occupation codes available in the 1964-
1967 OPS surveys and those in the later surveys, we limit our analysis of shifts in labor demand
arising from shifts across industry and occupation cells to the 1967-87 period.

12. DavIs and Haltiwanger [1991J and Gottschalk and Joyce [19911 similarly report for the 1960s
that the within-industry employment shares increased of groups with increases In relative wages.

13. This proxy tor the percentage change In demand tor demographic group k can be written as
i. A(AE/E-) where j indexes industry, E is 101st employment of all demographic groups in
industry j, Aik = E1J(E1J in s base year, and   is the employment of group kin industry].

14. Katz and Murphy 11990] show that this demand measure is appropriate even in the presence
of within-sector, factor-neutral technological change.

15. Our basic qualitative findings concerning measured demand shifts are insensitive to choice
of base year.

16. See Borjas, Freeman, and Katz [1992J end Murphy and Welch [1991] for more detailed
treatments of the effects of intemational trade flows on relative labor demands.

17. This demand shift Index has the property that; TEk = 0. Murphy and Welch [1991] provide
a formal justification for this type of demand shift index.

18. We replace the first term on the right-hand side of the equation (16) with

                            .(lfEk) z{[e E.X11NiJ] - 1p Er(MJY?)J},
where X measures exports, M measures imports, snd p is group its average share of production
worker employment in industry i over the 1967-87 period. We classify as production workers
                                                38
those workers In the manulacluflng sector In the following broad occupational categories: craft
 workers, handlers and laborers1 operatives, transport operatives, and service workers.

19. Abowd (1991) provides a detailed discussion of this data set and the construction of trade
data on a four-digit SIC industry basis, The data on output and employment in each industry
given by the NBER data set are from the Annual Survey of Manufactures.

20. In this section, we measure the college/high school wage ratio as the fixed-weighted average
 Of the ratio of the average weekly wage of college graduates to the average weekly wage of high
 school graduates for 16 cells defined by sex and live-year experience brackets. The tixed weight
for each cell is the cell's average share of total employment over the 1963-87 period. This series
 is plotted in Panel B of Figure t as the college/high school wage ratio for all experience levels.

21. The regressions do not contain Intercept terms.

22. On the basts of these regressions, we define the number of otd (NJ and of young equivalents
(Nt) as:

    N n + .92*n2 + ,86*n + 63*n + .38tn5 + .07n5 .07*n7 - .Oln9
   N, = 23*n + 39*n + .66Th4 + .77n5 + 97*p + 1 .037*n7 + .98n4

where n is the fixed-weight total supply of workers in the jth five-year esperience group (i.e. n:
is the supply of those with I to 5 years of experience, etc.).

23. This regression yielded a coefficient (standard error) of -0.342 (0.032) on the tog relative
supply variable and an P2 of 0.63.

24. The regression of the tog relative earnings of old tn young males (RE) on the log relative
supply of old to young equivalents (PSUP) and the log of the overati college/high school wage
premium (CHSPREM) yields a coefficient (standard error) of -0.348 (0.028) on RSUP and of 0.292
(0.106) on CHSPREM and has an R2 of 0.87.
