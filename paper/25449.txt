                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the ability of existing and new factor models to explain the comovements of G10-
currency changes, measured using the novel concept of “currency baskets”, representing the
overall movement of a particular currency. Using a clustering technique, we find a clear two-
block structure in currency comovements with the first block containing mostly the dollar
currencies, and the other the European currencies. A factor model incorporating this “clustering”
factor and two additional factors, a commodity currency factor and a “world” factor based on
trading volumes, fits currency basket correlations much better than extant factors, such as value
and carry, do. In particular, it explains on average about 60% of currency variation and generates
a root mean squared error relative to sample correlations of only 0.11. The model also fits
comovements in emerging market currencies well. Economically, the correlations between
currency baskets underlying the factor structure are inversely related to the physical distances
between countries. The factor structure is also related to the exposure of the corresponding
pricing kernels with respect to the global pricing kernel and is apparent in cross-country retail
sales growth data.

Introduction

According to recent Bank for International Settlement Surveys, more than half the trading
volume in foreign exchange arises from trades with “financial” customers, institutional investors,
mutual funds, hedge funds and other portfolio managers (Rime and Schrimpf, 2013), a
phenomenon that mostly reflects increasing globalization of financial markets over time. While
the need for foreign exchange (FX) transactions often arises merely as a by-product of buying or
selling international securities, increasingly, there are also profit-seekers in currency markets,
seeking to profit from selling and buying currencies.1 With active currency management
becoming more commonplace, the need for models to explain the risks and comovements of
currencies has increased. There is also renewed interest in the pricing of currency risk in
international equities (see e.g., Brusa, Ramadorai and Verdelhan, 2015), but standard theory (see
the famous Adler and Dumas, 1983 survey) suggests that all currency risks are priced for each
equity market. A parsimonious currency factor model may therefore help the implementation of
international equity pricing models. It may also help characterize currency commovements for
determining optimal currency hedge ratios (see Campbell, Serfaty-De Medeiros, and Viceira,
2010; De Roon, Eiling, Gerard, and Hillion 2012).

The academic literature so far has focused almost exclusively on detecting currency factors that
generate attractive return profiles. Two important currency factors include the carry factor of
Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2011) and the global FX volatility factor of Menkhoff, Sarno,
Schmeling, and Schrimpf (2012a). Other extant currency factors include currency-value (see e.g.,
Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf, 2016) and currency-momentum factors (see e.g.,
Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf, 2012b, and Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo,
2011), which also feature in practitioner indices created by Deutsche Bank. Practitioners also
recognize that there is a commodity factor in currencies, and the Australian and Canadian dollar
are typically categorized as “commodity currencies,” see Chen and Rogoff (2003) and Ready,
Roussanov, and Ward (2017). Just as the Fama–French model (1996) for equities is also a good
risk model to explain equity return comovements (see Bekaert, Hodrick, Zhang, 2009 and Hou,




1
  Hafeez (2007), then the Global Head of FX Strategy at Deutsche Bank, estimated that between 5% and 25% of the
trading volume in the FX market can be categorized as profit-seeking.

                                                       1

Karolyi and Kho, 2011), it may be that these factors are effective in explaining currency
comovements.

Developing an adequate factor model for currency movements raises special issues however. If
we take the dollar as the numeraire currency, a factor model that explains the bilateral dollar
movements perfectly, will, by triangular arbitrage, also fit other bilateral exchange rates
perfectly, whatever the perspective. However, if the fit is imperfect, a good dollar model may be
a poor yen model and vice versa. This tension is obvious in the recent work of Verdelhan (2018).
Verdelhan (2018) introduces the dollar basket factor, the average appreciation of the U.S. dollar
relative to a basket of currencies, as a common factor and shows that it has a very strong
explanatory power (high adjusted R2s) for the contemporaneous bilateral exchange rate changes
w.r.t. the U.S. dollar. However, its explanatory power is quite poor for other currency
perspectives. To address this issue, Verdelhan (2018) introduces a “dollar beta” factor, but we
show that this factor is still highly correlated with the dollar basket and thus does not explain
global currency correlations well.

In this paper, we set out to examine various factor models to explain currency comovements and
document their fit with the data from a global perspective. That is, we attempt to identify a factor
model that works well whatever the currency perspective is. To facilitate a global perspective on
currency comovements, we introduce the concept of a “currency basket.” The currency basket
simply averages all bilateral currency changes relative to one particular currency. As we show
formally, by analyzing 10 currency baskets for the G10 currencies, we span all possible bilateral
currency movements. We then contrast the explanatory power of the extant risk factors
mentioned previously with the explanatory power of various new factors.

Most importantly, we use a clustering technique to introduce several new currency factors. When
selecting two clusters, a very clear factor structure emerges, with the dollar currencies
(Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and US) and the Japanese yen in one block and the
European currencies in the other. When using three clusters, a commodity type currency factor
also emerges. Combining these statistical factors with a “market” factor, based on currency
trading volumes, and a commodity currency factor, we propose several parsimonious factor
models and run a horse race versus models incorporating the existing factors.



                                                  2

Among the extant currency factors, the carry and value factors exhibit the highest explanatory
power for currency variation. This is not surprising because both factors are relatively highly
correlated with the first principal component in bilateral currency rates. However, a new
parsimonious factor model incorporating the two-block clustering factor, a commodity factor and
the market factor easily beats factor models created from extant risk factors, even models that
feature double as many factors.    The new factor model explains on average about 60% of the
variation in currency basket values. Moreover, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) relative to
sample correlations is only about 0.11, which is statistically significantly better than any model
based on extant risk factors.

Our proposed factor structure has economic content. We demonstrate that currency basket
correlations intuitively decrease with the physical distance between the corresponding countries.
In addition, we use the link between currency changes and pricing kernels to show that countries
with pricing kernels exhibiting similar (dissimilar) exposure to the global pricing kernel have
currency baskets that are positively (negatively) correlated. When we use a monthly proxy for
consumption growth to compute pricing kernels under a simple Lucas (1978) power utility
model, the global exposure of the pricing kernels mimics that of the currency baskets. The
European countries (with the exception of the UK) have high exposures, the dollar countries and
Japan low exposures. As a result, the correlation structure among currency baskets is similar to
the correlation structure in consumption growth rates.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Section I, we describe our methodology
and introduce the concept of a currency basket. Section II explains our clustering technique and
introduces a new factor model for currency returns. In a contemporaneous paper and using a very
different methodology, Greenaway-McGrevy et al. (2017) also find a two factor structure in
bilateral exchange rates. We briefly discuss similarities and differences in this section. Section III
examines the explanatory power of the standard currency factor models for currency
comovements. Section IV runs a horse race of a variety of different factor models, using
primarily the RMSE for correlations as the metric. In Section V, we investigate the recent factor
model of Verdelhan (2018) and re-interpret the results in Lustig and Richmond (2016), who
uncover a gravity equation in the factor structure of bilateral exchange rates. We also relate our
work to the tradeable currency factors marketed by Deutsche Bank. In Section VI, we examine

the explanatory power of our new factor model for emerging market currencies showing it to
explain a smaller portion of their variation but to fit comovements only slightly worse as for
developed currencies. Section VII explains the economics of currency baskets linking currency
baskets to pricing kernels and international risk sharing and exploring the relationship between
currency basket and consumption growth correlations. Section VIII concludes.




   I.          Explaining Currency Comovements

We study the G10 currencies—AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, JPY, NOK, SEK, NZD, GBP, and USD.
We use end-of-month mid spot rates from Barclays Bank International (BBI) and WM/Reuters
(WMR) that are available via Thomson Reuters Datastream to calculate (logarithmic) currency
changes. The time period is from January 1973 to December 2015. For the Euro before 1999, we
use Deutsche mark rates.




        I.1.      Bilateral Correlations

To set the stage, we first focus on bilateral correlations from two perspectives. In Table 1, Panels I
and II show correlation matrices. Panel I takes the perspective of a U.S. dollar investor, and
reproduces the full sample correlation matrix for all currency pairs relative to the dollar expressed
in foreign currencies per dollar; e.g., CAD/USD is the amount of Canadian dollar equivalent to one
U.S. dollar); Panel II takes the perspective of a yen investor. Panel III provides the differences
between correlations in Panels I and II.

Most of the pairwise currency correlations are higher in Panel II compared to those in Panel I,
reflecting a variable Japan specific factor. Thus, the correlation differences in Panel III are mostly
negative and often quite substantially so. In particular, if we contrast the correlation between the
AUD, CAD, and NZD with dollar yen rates either from the yen (Panel II) and the dollar (Panel I)
perspective, the correlations are respectively 46%, 82%, and 32% higher from the yen perspective.
Yet, for some currencies (CHF and GPB for example) the differences are small; for others (CAD
and AUD for example), they are huge.

                    Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
Clearly, the correlation structure among currencies is very numeraire dependent. A factor model
that fits “dollar based” correlations well, may not fit “yen based” correlations well. However,
there appears to be, nonetheless, an overall factor structure in currencies with certain currencies
correlating more with one another irrespective of the base currency. The correlations in Panel I
and II show that the “dollar currencies” (USD, AUD, CAD, and NZD) seem more correlated
with each other and less correlated with the other currencies in both panels. We seek to find
factor models for currencies that maximize overall fit, across all base currencies.

                                               [Table 1]




       I.2.    Currency Baskets

Explaining currency comovements globally is non-trivial. The 10 currencies imply 45 different
currency pairs, which are linearly dependent through the triangular arbitrage relation. To resolve
this problem, we introduce the concept of a currency basket.

A currency-basket is an equally-weighted average appreciation of one currency relative to a
basket of all currencies in our sample. In other words, the currency i-basket is calculated as

                                               1
                                        CBi = 9 ∑10
                                                 𝑗=1 ∆s𝑗,𝑖                                         (1)

where ∆sj,i is the log spot rate change of currency i w.r.t. currency j that is, the (logarithm)
change in the value of currency i relative to currency j. For example, the U.S. dollar-basket
denoted by CB𝑈𝑆𝐷 is an equally-weighted average of log changes in the value of the U.S. dollar
w.r.t. AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, JPY, NOK, SEK, NZD, and GBP. Note that ∆si,i = 0.

Under the absence of triangular arbitrage, we can replicate all bilateral rates by having only N-1
non-repeated exchange rates. It should therefore not be surprising that our 10 currency baskets
span all bilateral rates. Because the concept of the currency basket is essential to this article, we
show this spanning property in some detail.

Triangular arbitrage implies that:



                                                   5



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
                                       ∆s𝑘,𝑖 = ∆s𝑗,𝑖 + ∆s𝑘,𝑗                        ∀𝑗.                    (2)

In the absence of arbitrage, this equation holds for any third currency. Therefore, we can add up
"n" of those triangular equations for a basket of third currencies to find the relation between the
log appreciation of a bilateral exchange rate and the currency baskets. From Equation (2), we
have;

                                       1                           1
                           ∆s𝑘,𝑖 =         𝑛 (∆s𝑘,𝑖 ) =                ∑𝑛𝑗=1[∆s𝑗,𝑖 + ∆s𝑘,𝑗 ]               (3)
                                       𝑛                           𝑛


                                                 1                          1
                                 ∆s𝑘,𝑖 =             [∑𝑛𝑗=1 ∆s𝑗,𝑖 ] − 𝑛 [∑𝑛𝑗=1 ∆s𝑗,𝑘 ]                     (4)
                                                 𝑛


If there are “n” currencies, there will be “n-1” exchange rates (∆s𝑖,𝑖 = ∆s𝑘,𝑘 = 0). Therefore,

                                  𝑛−1        1                             𝑛−1        1
                       ∆s𝑘,𝑖 =                       [∑𝑛𝑗=1 ∆s𝑗,𝑖 ] −                     [∑𝑛𝑗=1 ∆s𝑗,𝑘 ]   (5)
                                   𝑛       𝑛−1                              𝑛       𝑛−1


                                                         𝑛−1                𝑛−1
                                           ∆s𝑘,𝑖 =                 𝐶𝐵𝑖 −            𝐶𝐵𝑘                    (6)
                                                           𝑛                    𝑛


Equation (6) simply shows that the appreciation of currency k w.r.t. currency i (∆s𝑘,𝑖 ) is spanned
by the average appreciation of a basket of currencies w.r.t. currency i (𝐶𝐵𝑖 ) minus the average
appreciation of a basket of currencies w.r.t. currency k (𝐶𝐵𝑘 ). Empirically, we have nine bilateral
exchange rates among G10 currencies to estimate CBs. Therefore, using the definition of
currency baskets in Equation (1), it follows:

                                                           9                9
                                            ∆s𝑘,𝑖 = 10 𝐶𝐵𝑖 − 10 𝐶𝐵𝑘                                        (7)

Table 2 reports summary statistics on currency baskets. Over the sample period, CBSEK has the
highest annualized depreciation rate of 1.2 %, whereas CBCHF has the highest annualized
appreciation rate of 3.7 %. Annualized volatilities range between 5.8% for CBEUR and 10.5 % for
CBJPY. Importantly, currency baskets show little serial correlation with the first-order
autocorrelations never higher than 0.10 in absolute value.

                                                        [Table 2]




                                                               6



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
Note that the U.S. dollar basket (CBUSD) corresponds to the dollar factor introduced in Lustig,
Roussanov and Verdelhan (2011). It is likely that this factor explains bilateral exchange rate
changes from the dollar perspective well, but how well does it explain currency changes from other
perspectives? To examine this, we construct currency baskets for each currency and test their
explanatory power (average adjusted R-squares) for bilateral exchange rate changes. Table 3
compares the contemporaneous explanatory power of currency-baskets for bilateral exchange rates
from different currency perspectives. That is, we run regressions of the form,

        ∆sj,i = aj + bj CBk + ej,i , for all currency perspectives i and currency baskets k.     (8)

Not surprisingly, each currency-basket has the highest explanatory power for its own bilateral
rates. For example, the second column of Table 3 shows that the U.S. dollar-basket (CBUSD)
explains 55.4% of the variation in the bilateral exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (USD rates),
which is analogous to the explanatory power documented in Verdelhan (2018). However, the
explanatory power of CBUSD is low for the other bilateral rates, varying from 7.7% for JPY rates
to 23.4% for CAD rates. More interestingly, although CBUSD explains on average 16.7% of all
exchange rate variation, the Swiss franc basket (CBCHF) explains on average 19.8 % of all
exchange rate variation, constituting the highest explanatory power among the G10 currency-
baskets. The last row represents the average off-diagonal adjusted R-square. CBAUD, CBEUR, and
CBCHF deliver the highest explanatory power among the G10 currency-baskets. Clearly, by
triangular arbitrage, there is dependence among these rates. Yet, Table 3 shows that it is not
obvious which combination of currencies would capture correlations well for all currency
perspectives. By focusing on currency baskets, we collapse a total of 45 different bilateral rates
that are codependent into 10 manageable baskets.

In the right two columns, we use the top three or five currency baskets in each row to explain
bilateral currency movements and report the adjusted R2. These always include the own basket.
By the spanning argument that we discussed earlier, the R2 rapidly increases and reaches on
average 82% with 5 baskets. For the remainder of our paper, we examine which factor models
best describe the correlation structure of the currency baskets. These models will then
automatically also describe comovements between any bilateral rates.

                                              [Table 3]


                                                 7



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
In Table 4, we report the currency basket correlations. They range between -0.56 for the
CHF/CAD pair and 0.54 for the CAD/USD pair. That correlations can go negative is not
surprising given that bilateral rates may appear with different signs in two different currency
baskets but has also an intuitive economic interpretation, which we explore further in Section
VII. It is already apparent that the correlations are also linked to geography with the European
currency baskets mostly positively correlated.

       I.3.    Numeraire issues

All our computations have made use of logarithmic exchange rate changes. This generates two
unit issues. First, investors care about returns not just currency changes. Second, by considering
various nominal currency baskets simultaneously, we aggregate economic variables expressed in
different currencies. Both issues are in fact immaterial given our objective of creating a factor
model that works from all currency perspectives. The main reason for this is that the variability
of currency changes is almost an order of magnitude larger than the variation of interest and
inflation differentials and thus nominal currency changes are the main driver of currency return
comovements.

To verify this, we compute excess bilateral exchange rate returns as well as two real concepts:
bilateral real exchange rate changes and real foreign exchange returns. The interest rate and
inflation data are non-seasonally adjusted and available on Datastream. The excess returns are
calculated as the one-month exchange rate changes plus the monthly interest rate differentials.
Correlating the equivalent currency baskets in excess return space with the currency baskets using
currency changes, the lowest correlation is observed for the GBP currency basket, equalling 99.7%.

Excess returns are still priced by different nominal pricing kernels in different currencies. In an
integrated economy, a world pricing kernel should price real returns in various countries;
alternatively, if purchasing power parity holds, the real return from investing in any country would
be equalized whatever the numeraire perspective. We therefore also formulate the currency baskets
in real return space. The real exchange rate changes are calculated as the one-month exchange rate
changes plus monthly inflation rate differentials. Real returns are computed as the nominal
exchange rate changes plus the foreign interest rate deflated by domestic inflation. Here, the
correlations between “real” currency baskets (real currency changes) and our nominal exchange


                                                 8



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
rate ones vary between 95.6% for the EUR currency and 99.1% for the AUD currency. For actual
real returns, the correlations vary between 98.68% for the USD perspective and 99.92% for the
CAD perspective.



       I.4.    Factor models

We examine a variety of linear factor models to maximize “global” fit:

                                      CBj = aj + β′ j × F + ej ,                                   (9)


where F is a set of factors and βj the vector of factor exposures. To examine and compare fit, we
focus on a number of different statistics.

First, we simply examine the significance of the betas in Equation (9) and calculate a global R-
square as the equally weighted average of the R2’s for each CBj. We redid all computations with
R2’s based on trading volumes (see below) as well. Because our conclusions are robust to using
such alternative global R2’s, we do not discuss them further (results are available upon request).

Second, we examine how well the various factor models explain the comovement structure
present in exchange rates. Let 𝜎̂
                                𝑖,𝑗 be the empirical covariance between CBi and CBj . Using the

implied covariances from a particular factor model, we can compare the correlation fit of
different factor models. The covariance matrix produced by a particular factor model with factor
covariance matrix VF is, as usual,

                                        Cov𝐹 = β𝐹 ′ VF β𝐹                                      (10)

where β𝐹 is the 10xK matrix of factor loadings, K the number of factors, and Cov𝐹 the model-
implied covariance matrix for the currency basket factors.

We then compute the correlation fit for model F as

                                                  1

are the sample variances, 𝜌̂𝑖,𝑗 is the sample correlation, and RMSE stands for root mean squared
error.

Finally, we compare the correlation fit of various currency factor models, seeking models that
minimize the RMSE for correlation. To account for sampling error in those computations, we
conduct a bootstrap exercise, in which we bootstrap the 10 currency baskets with replacement.
The bootstrap creates artificial samples of equal length to our sample by randomly selecting and
concatenating blocks of 6 months of currency basket changes. The contemporaneous correlation
structure is therefore preserved. For each random sample, we estimate the correlation matrix as
well as the factor model. Then, we use the factors exposures to compute model-implied
correlations and finally the RMSEs. We use 1000 replications.




    II.     A New Factor Model for Currency Returns

Here we propose a new currency factor model that incorporates a statistical factor, a factor based
on trading volumes (akin to the market model often used in equity trading) and the one currency
factor that is perhaps most often referred to in practitioner’s circles, a commodity currency factor.
Importantly, an intuitive clustering technique uncovers a very prevalent two-block factor
structure in currencies, which is the main focus of this section.

    II.1.      Cluster Analysis

The correlations in Tables Table 1 and Table 4 are suggestive that there may be a two or three
factor structure in currencies. Dollar rates seem highly correlated, as do rates within continental
and Scandinavian Europe. To investigate this formally, we use a clustering technique introduced
by Ormerord and Mounfield (2000), and used to investigate the clustering of currencies just
before the Euro was introduced. Ahn, Conrad, and Dittmar (2009) apply the algorithm in a stock
portfolio formation context to create “basis assets.” They show that their algorithm produces
cluster portfolios that are correlated with the standard firm characteristics, display significant
dispersion in returns, and generate a relatively well-conditioned return covariance matrix.


                                                  10



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
The algorithm starts by defining a distance measure, which is a negative function of correlation:


                                       𝑑𝑖𝑗 = √2 ∗ (1 − 𝜌𝑖𝑗 ),                                      (12)


where 𝜌𝑖𝑗 denotes the sample correlation between currency baskets i and j, 𝐶𝐵𝑖 and 𝐶𝐵𝑗 ,
respectively. Perfectly positively correlated currency baskets have the minimum distance of 0
whereas perfectly negatively correlated currency baskets have the maximum distance of 2. Note
that 𝑑𝑖𝑖 = 0. The clustering algorithm then creates clusters aiming to maximize within-group
correlation and minimize across-group correlations.

An obvious way to use the distance concept to cluster currencies into N clusters, is to find the
combination of currencies that minimizes the total distance between currency baskets within a
cluster. This absolute clustering algorithm therefore minimizes,

                                                      (𝑘)
                                       𝑘=1 ∑𝑖,𝑗 𝑑𝑖𝑗 ,
                              𝑆𝐷(𝑁) = ∑𝑁                    (i,j ϵ kth cluster),                   (13)

where k indexes a cluster of currencies, N is the number of clusters and SD stands for sum of
distances between all members of the cluster.

In other words, to cluster currencies, we first consider all possible allocations of G10 currency
baskets in N different clusters (1≤N≤10) and calculate their in-cluster distance as the sum of
distances among all members of each cluster. Then, we calculate the total distance as the sum of
all in-cluster distances for each possible allocation. The currency allocation that minimizes the
total distance for each N constitutes the optimal clustering of the G10 currency baskets in N
clusters.

Given our limited set of currencies, we can easily consider all possible combinations of currency
allocations for a given number of N clusters. However, in the aforementioned papers, the
authors apply a sequential clustering procedure. We relegate a discussion of this alternative, but
sub-optimal procedure to the Online Appendix, focusing the discussion here on the results using
the absolute algorithm




    II.2.      Optimal Currency Clusters

                                                 11



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
To gain some intuition regarding the methodology, Table 5 reports the results of clustering G10
currency baskets in N clusters, with N varying from 0 to 10. The end points are trivial: for 10
clusters, each currency basket is in its own cluster and the total distance is zero; for the case of 1
cluster, the distance reflects the average correlation of all currency baskets. For 9 to 5 clusters,
optimal clustering is achieved by pairing currencies along regional lines, starting with CBCAD and
CBUSD, then CBCHF and CBEUR, CBNZD and CBAUD, CBNOK and CBSEK, and finally CBJPY and
CBGBP.

                                                      [Table 5]

To cluster the G10 currency baskets in 3 clusters, the algorithm produces (CBAUD, CBCAD, and
CBNZD), (CBCHF, CBEUR, CBNOK, and CBSEK) and (CBUSD, CBJPY, and CBGBP) with a total
distance of 14.830 (average within-cluster correlation of 0.577). While the second factor
comprises European currencies, the first factor appears to contain three well-known “commodity”
currencies.2

Figure 1 shows how the clustering algorithm lowers the total distance for all clusters, N=1
through 10. Because we seek to construct a parsimonious factor model, let’s focus on N=2. For
two clusters, the worst grouping generates a total distance of 53.4, which corresponds to an
average within-cluster correlation of 0.125. When we use the algorithm to minimize the distance,
it more than halves to 26.2, and the average within-cluster correlation is much higher at 0.416.

Optimal clustering for two clusters puts the dollar currencies plus the Japanese yen (CBUSD,
CBAUD, CBCAD, CBNZD, and CBJPY) in the same block, and the European currencies (CBCHF,
CBEUR, CBNOK, CBSEK, and CBGBP) in the other block. The currency basket correlations reported
in Table 4 confirm that currency baskets are more positively correlated within these blocks and
more negatively correlated across the blocks. Note that the first block involves all “dollar”
currencies plus the Japanese yen, whereas the other block involves all European currencies.
Therefore, the countries in each currency block share commonality in language, border, legal
origin, culture, and resources, or have colonial linkages, features stressed in recent work by
Lustig and Richmond (2016). We explicitly link our work to theirs in Section V. In Section VII,

 Results with clusters from the sequential algorithm are available upon request, but it underperforms the clusters
smaller than 5.

                                                          12



                     Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
we show that the pricing kernels associated with currencies within one block are likely to have
similar exposures to the world pricing kernel and provide an empirical verification of this fact.
Section VII also shows a link between currency basket correlations and international risk sharing.
The factor structure in currency basket changes thus suggests more risk sharing between the
“dollar” bloc countries on the one hand, and the European countries on the other hand. The latter
is especially not surprising given the efforts at bringing about economic and financial integration
within Europe in the context of the European Union and the European Free Trade zone. The
result is also reminiscent of the results in Greenaway-McGrevy et al. (2017), who identify a
“dollar” and “euro” factor in bilateral exchange rates.

Based on these currency blocks, we introduce a currency factor (CFabs), as the sum of the dollar
currency basket returns plus the Japanese yen basket return, as follows:

                             CFabs = CBUSD+CBAUD+CBCAD+CBNZD+CBJPY                              (14)

Because each currency pair appears in two currency baskets with opposite signs, the sum of all
currency baskets equals zero; that is,

       CBUSD+CBAUD+CBCAD+CBCHF+CBEUR+CBJPY+CBNOK+CBSEK+CBNZD+CBGBP=0.                           (15)

Therefore, the sums of currency basket changes in the two blocks are perfectly negatively
correlated, and can be collapsed into one factor. In addition, using the definition of a currency
basket in Equation (1), we can show that:

      CBUSD+CBAUD+CBCAD+CBNZD+CBJPY = (-ΔsAUD,USD-ΔsCAD,USD-ΔsJPY,USD-ΔsNZD,USD
                       +ΔsEUR,USD +ΔsNOK,USD+ΔsSEK,USD+ΔsCHF,USD+ΔsGBP,USD) ×5/9 (16)

Equation (14) shows how the CFabs factor represents an investment strategy of longing dollar
currencies as well as Japanese yen and shorting European currencies.




   II.3.       A New Factor Model

The bottom row of Table 4 presents the correlations between our CFabs factor and the currency-
baskets. Not surprisingly, CFabs is positively correlated with CBUSD, CBAUD, CBCAD, CBNZD, and
CBJPY, and negatively correlated with CBCHF, CBEUR, CBNOK, CBSEK, and CBGBP. CFabs is most

                                                 13



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
highly correlated with CBAUD, CBCAD, CBCHF, and CBEUR. Its absolute correlation with currency
baskets varies from 19% to 75%, averaging 54.2%, making it an excellent candidate as a
currency factor.

In Table 6, the first column shows regression coefficients from regressing the currency baskets
onto the CFabs factor. The coefficients are highly statistically significant for all currency baskets,
with R2s ranging between 14% and 43%, averaging 32%. The distribution of average R2s across
all possible cluster factors ranges between 6% and 32% with a median of 15.42%. Not
surprisingly, the coefficients for the dollar rates (and the JPY) are positive and those for the
European rates are negative. The Online Appendix shows that the CFabs factor is also highly
correlated with the bilateral rates directly, with its explanatory power better than any “off-
diagonal” currency basket.

We consider two avenues to come up with a parsimonious model for currency comovements.
First, we create three clusters instead of two clusters. Going back to Table 5, this yields two
currency factors (as the third one is co-linear with the other two),

                                    CF31 = CBUSD + CBGBP + CBJPY                                   (17)

                                   CF32 = CBAUD + CBCAD + CBNZD                                    (18)

The first factor combines the USD with the British pound and the Yen; whereas the second factor
combines all the other dollar rates. The third cluster thus contains the non-UK European
currencies. Interestingly, the latter factor would be close to what practitioners would dub a
commodity currency basket (which would also involve the NOK). In Table 6, we regress the
currency baskets on both factors, showing that both are highly statistically significant for all
currency baskets. The R2s now range between 35% and 59%, averaging 48%.

                                               [Table 6]

Second, we continue to use the CFabs factor but add two “economic” factors. The first is the
commodity factor (CFcom), computed as the sum of commodity-driven currency baskets including
CBAUD, CBCAD, CBNZD, and CBNOK:

                               CFcom = CBAUD+CBCAD+CBNZD+CBNOK                                     (19)


                                                  14



                   Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
Because of their link with commodity prices, we expect commodity currencies to be naturally
correlated, and the clustering algorithm endogenously created a commodity factor. The second is
the market factor (CFTW) computed as the trading-volume weighted average of all G10 currency
basket returns:

                               CFTW = ∑10
                                       𝑖 𝑤𝑖 𝐶𝐵𝑖 , i ϵ{G10 currencies}.                             (20)

where i indexes the G10 currencies and 𝑤𝑖 represent the trading-volume weights reported by the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) every three years from 1998 to 2013. We fix the weights
before 1998 at the 1998 weights. In addition, the BIS weights include non-G10 currencies and
add up to 200%, because each currency trade is counted twice for both trading parties. Thus, we
calculate a new weight for each G10 currency as its BIS weight divided by the sum of all G10
currencies’ BIS weights (see Appendix A, Table A1). The weights are highest for the dollar
(around 50%), followed by the euro (around 20%) and the yen (around 10%). Therefore, the
factor may have significant correlation with the “dollar” factor, examined in Verdelhan (2018),
but economically makes more sense when the goal is to explain currency correlations globally.

The explanatory power of these two factors in isolation is quite substantial but somewhat lower
than that of the CFabs factor (full results are relegated to the Online Appendix).

In Table 6, Panel III, we report the results from a regression of the currency baskets onto this
first candidate factor model with three factors, including CFabs, CFcom and CFTW. The bulk of the
individual coefficients is highly statistically significant with only 3 out of 30 not significant at the
10% level. The R2s now range from 41% to 81% and average 58%. While it is always hard to
interpret partial regression coefficients, the dominance of the USD, and the EUR in the TW factor
implies that their currency baskets and currency baskets highly positively correlated with them
(the CAD, respectively, the NOK) load positively on this factor with very high t-statistics. This in
turn lowers the exposure of the USD and the CAD to the cluster factor.

As a second candidate model, we supplement the CF31 and CF32 factors with the CFTW factor.
Recall that the CF32 factor is almost a commodity factor so adding the trade-weighted market
factor makes the most sense. The last block in Table 6 shows the explanatory power of this
candidate factor model. The model’s explanatory power is equally impressive with the


                                                  15



                   Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
coefficients mostly highly statistically significant and only 4 coefficients not significant at the
10% level. The R2’s range from 46% to 70%, but also average 58%.




    III.      Standard Currency Factors

The extant currency literature has spawned a number of factors inspired by risk considerations
(e.g., carry), economic value (PPP based factors) or trading models (momentum). Here, we
provide a new perspective by examining the ability of these currency factors to explain the
correlation structure among currency changes. The portfolios are, consistent with the literature,
computed from a USD perspective. Given that they are spread portfolios, expressing them in a
different currency would generate highly correlated return profiles (see e.g., Bekaert and
Panayotov, 2018).

           III.1. The Factors

Currency Carry Factor

We use the currency carry factor of Lustig, Roussanov, Verdelhan (2011) representing the return
of going long a portfolio of high interest rate (developed) currencies and going short a portfolio
of low interest rate (developed) currencies.3 This monthly factor is available on Verdelhan’s
website.

Currency Volatility

Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf (2012a) suggest that global foreign exchange
volatility is important in cross-sectional tests of currency portfolios sorted by the forward
discount. Similar to Menkhoff, et. al (2012a), we calculate the absolute daily log exchange rate
change (|∆𝑠𝑘 |) for each currency k on each day τ in our sample (we take all currency
perspectives and not only the U.S. dollar). We then average over all currencies available on any




3
  Their dataset contains the currencies of 15 developed countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, euro area,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom;
the portfolio is the difference between the highest and lowest quintile portfolios.

                                                        16



                    Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
given day and average the daily values within each month. Our global FX volatility proxy in
month t is therefore given by

                                                  1                  |∆𝑠𝑘 |
                                           𝜎𝑡𝐹𝑋 = 𝑇 ∑𝜏∈𝑇𝑡 [∑𝑘∈𝐾𝜏 (            )] ,                         (21)
                                                   𝑡                  𝐾𝜏


where 𝐾𝜏 denotes the number of available currencies on day 𝜏 and 𝑇𝑡 denotes the total number of
trading days in month t. The variable 𝜎𝑡𝐹𝑋 represents our currency volatility factor. Note that the
currency-volatility factor does not represent a return or currency change, thus its units are not as
easy to interpret as those of the other factors.

Currency Value

By far the most popular fundamental exchange rate model is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) (see
e.g., Abuaf and Jorion (1990) and the survey of Lothian and Taylor (1996)). If exchange rates
revert back to their long-term PPP values (see e.g., Mark (1995) for empirical evidence), similar
deviations from PPP can be a source of currency comovements.

We create a PPP factor return in three steps. First, we obtain PPPs for 28 countries from the
OECD for the period from January 1973 to December 2015.4 These PPPs reflect annual averages
of monthly values and vary over the year. The OECD constructs PPPs for detailed items that are
part of GDP and aggregates them using relative expenditures.

Second, for each month and each currency, we create a currency value index as a currency’s
nominal exchange rate divided by its PPP last year. For example, the value ratio for GBP/USD is
     GBP/USD
    𝑆𝑡                      GBP/USD
         GBP/USD   , where 𝑆𝑡         is the average daily GBP/USD spot rate over the last three months
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡−12

              GBP/USD
and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡−12              is the average annual PPP for GBP/USD over the last year.

We then sort the currencies into three groups based on those valuation ratios relative to the USD.
Finally, our value factor represents the returns (including interest rate differentials) on the



4
 Our dataset to construct the value factor includes currencies from 28 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Europe, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,
and the United Kingdom. For more details, please visit the website of the OECD.

portfolio of under-valued currencies minus the returns on the portfolio of the over-valued
currencies. The portfolios are rebalanced every three months.

Currency Momentum

We create a currency momentum factor return in two steps. First, we obtain spot exchange rates
for 28 countries (see Footnote 3) for the period from January 1973 to December 2015. Second,
we sort the available currencies into three portfolios based on their returns (including exchange
rate changes relative to the US dollar and the interest rate differential) over the last month. Our
momentum factor represents the equally-weighted average return on the portfolio of the highest
lagged return currencies minus the return on the portfolio of the lowest lagged return currencies.
At the end of each month, we rebalance the portfolio. This factor is similar to the 1-month
momentum factor of Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf (2012b).

Commodity Factor

The values of the commodity currencies (AUD, CAD, NOK, and NZD) are correlated with
commodity prices. In addition, changes in commodity prices have predictive power for currency
carry returns (Bakshi and Panayotov (2013)) as well as for bilateral forex returns (Aloosh
(2012)). Our commodity price factor uses monthly changes in the Raw Industrials sub-index of
the CRB Spot Commodity Index, which is available on Datastream for the period from January
1951 to December 2015.

World Equity Factor

Finally, we include a global equity factor. Whereas the correlation between equity returns and
currency returns is low for developed markets (see Bekaert and Hodrick, 2011), some standard
currency factors (such as carry) show non-negligible equity exposure (see Lustig, Roussanov,
Verdelhan, 2011). To proxy for the equity risk in the markets of the G10 currencies, we construct
an equally-weighted world equity market return (in domestic currencies) based on MSCI equity




                                                 18



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
price indices in Australia, Canada, Europe (an index of equity markets in the Euro zone), Japan,
Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.5

        III.2. Factor Regressions

In Table 7, we examine the explanatory power of the above existing currency factors for the
variation in our 10 currency baskets. The top panel shows results for univariate regressions, the
bottom panel shows the multivariate regression.

                                                   [Table 7]

In the top panel, the overwhelming majority of the factor loadings are statistically significantly
different from zero for the carry, value, and equity factors. These factors have reasonably high
explanatory power for the majority of the currency-basket factors. The carry and value factors
explain on average 13% and 12% of the variation in the currency basket factors respectively, but
the R2 is only 4% on average for the equity factor. The average R2s for the other factors are even
lower. Most of the factor exposures make economic sense. For example, the typical funding
currencies (JPY and CHF) load significantly negatively on the carry factor whereas the typical
investment currencies (AUD and NZD) have significantly positive betas. The dollar has no
significant exposure to carry. The AUD, NZD, NOK and SEK are the most exposed to
commodity price changes.

In the bottom panel, we see that the number of significant factors varies from currency to
currency, being as low as 2 for the GBP and as high as 4 for the AUD and CHF. The commodity
factor is surprisingly not significant for CAD. Interestingly, except for the volatility factor, every
factor is significant at least once, but carry is significant for 8 and value for 9 out of 10
currencies. The R2 for the multivariate models varies between 10% and 37% and is 23% on
average.

 Because equity market data for New Zealand are not available for the full sample, we use equity market data for
Singapore instead. We also construct a value-weighted world equity market return as the market capitalization
weighted average of these equity market returns, based on equity market capital values available on Datastream.
However, the equally-weighted equity market return has more explanatory power for exchange rate (co)movements.
Using the MSCI world market index (expressed in U.S. dollars) nevertheless produces very similar results to the
ones reported here.

The table reveals that the carry and value factors are the most promising candidates to feature in a
factor model aimed at explaining currency comovements. However, the explanatory power is
distinctly lower than the explanatory power of the new factors we proposed in Section II. Of
course, the models here were not developed to maximize explained variation in currency changes
or fit their comovements.

   IV.      The Fit of Various Factor Based Models

We have now introduced a total of 11 factors, 5 new ones and 6 factors that have been considered
before, mostly in pricing exercises. Here we try to determine which model best fits the
comovements across currency changes. Before we run various horse races, we examine the
correlations between the factors and their relationship to the standard principal components.



         IV.1. Factor Correlations

To obtain further intuition on these factors, Table 8 produces their correlation matrix and their
correlations with the first three principal components of the bilateral currency changes. Note that
in an N-currency world, we have N (N-1)/2 different pairs. Thus, there are 45 (=10×9/2) non-
repeated bilateral rates among the G10 currencies. We denote the first three principal components
by 45FPC, 45SPC and 45TPC, respectively.

                                               [Table 8]

It is not surprising that our clustering technique yields a factor that is highly correlated with the
first principal component (the correlation with 45FPC is -83%). However, CFabs is also highly
correlated with the second principal component (53%). Going back to Table 4, we note that
CFabs is highly correlated (above 0.50 in absolute magnitude) with all individual currency baskets
with the exception of the JPY and GBP baskets. Moreover, the currency commodity factor
(CFcom) is more highly correlated with 45FPC (at -90%) than is our clustering factor. In Table 4,
we added a line with correlations between the first principal component and the various currency
baskets: the highest correlation (in absolute magnitude) is observed for the AUD. The CFTW
factor is 77% (41%) correlated with the second (third) principal component, but barely at all with
the 45FPC. Recall that the trading volume-weighted factor is dominated by the dollar currency
                                                  20



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
basket which implies that the first principal component in bilateral currency changes is not
dominated by dollar movements. The two factors resulting from selecting three clusters, CF31,
and CF32, are -37% correlated. CF31 includes two important currency baskets (CBUSD and CBJPY),
is not highly correlated with the first principal component, 45FPC, but is highly correlated with
45SPC (87%). It is CF32 that is very highly correlated with 45FPC (-97%)! Therefore, the cluster
of AUD, CAD and NZD is the set of currencies that best approximates the first principal
component in the G10 currencies.

Among the extant currency factors, the currency carry trade factor (denoted by Carry) is 62%
correlated with the first principal component, 40% correlated with the second principal
component, and 18% correlated with the third principal component. The currency value factor
(denoted by Value) and the equally-weighted world equity market return (denoted by Equity) are
respectively 56% and 33% correlated with 45FPC. The currency-volatility factor (denoted by
Volatility) and the changes in the CRB Spot Commodity Index (denoted by Commodity) are
respectively 25% and 33% correlated with 45SPC. The currency-momentum (denoted by
Momentum) factor is not highly correlated with any of the top three principal components. It is
not surprising that the carry and the value factors, which were shown to have high explanatory
power for currency comovements, are relatively highly correlated with the first principal
component of exchange rate movements.

To create factor models using the factors we introduced, it is important that the factors are not
multi-collinear. The correlation table shows that this is clearly not the case. The highest
correlations observed are those between the CF31 and the CFTW factors (at 74%), the carry factor
and the currency commodity factor (at 65%), and the currency commodity factor and the
clustering factor, CFabs, at 60%. There are some other high correlations (such as between CFcom
and CF32), but these factors are never considered together.



       IV.2.    Horse Race between factor models

We now focus on the RMSE in correlation space to determine the factor model that best fits the
currency comovements between the currency baskets. We have also conducted the full analysis
using covariances rather than correlations, with the results available in the Online Appendix. The

                                                 21



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
main results are very similar to those reached using correlations. The RMSE can be viewed as
the average correlation distance between the model and the data. Recall from Table 4 that the
data correlations vary between -56% and +54%. Of course, the RMSE statistics are estimated
from a finite data sample and we must take sampling error into account. We use the bootstrap
procedure described before to determine sampling error in the RMSE’s for the new factor models
proposed in this article and whether they perform significantly better than other models. Note that
the sampling error of the RMSE statistic is generally relatively low at about 0.01 to 0.02,
admitting relatively powerful tests.

To set the stage, Table 9 reports the RMSE for univariate factor models using all 11 factors we
consider in this article. This exercise immediately reveals the value of the new CFabs factor
which only has a RMSE of 0.176, with the 95% confidence interval being [0.163, 0.211]. Most
of the other factors have RMSE’s that are far above this interval. The second best individual
factor among the new factors is CF32 with a RMSE of 0.201. Among the extant factors, the best
factor is the carry factor with a RMSE of 0.264, but its confidence interval does not overlap with
that for CFabs.

In Table 10 (Panel I), we compare the fit of various multivariate models. We start with the two
three factor models we proposed in Section II. The three factor models significantly reduce the
RMSE, bringing it down to 0.112 for the model incorporating CFabs, and to 0.131 for the model
with the two clustering factors. In an absolute sense, a correlation error of about 10% seems
small and these models thus match the data correlations rather well. The differences in fit
between the two models are small economically and they are also not significant in a statistical
sense in that the RMSE generated by the second model is within the 95% convince interval of the
first one.

The rest of this Panel investigates the fit of various combinations of the extant currency factors.
When we use all 6 factors, the RMSE is 0.214, almost twice as high as the fit of our parsimonious
model. When we drop the two worst performing factors (volatility and momentum), the fit does
not improve. We also report the RMSE for two three-factor models adding to carry and value,
either the equity factor or the commodity price factor. Both models perform similarly with an
RMSE of 0.218. The RMSEs generated by these models are also outside the 95% confidence
intervals generated by the bootstrap for our 2 three-factor models. We conclude that the new
                                                 22



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
models we proposed are far superior to models created from extant currency factors in fitting
currency comovements.

It is still conceivable that the extant currency factors can help the fit of our proposed model. We
address this issue in Panel II of Table 10. We focus our attention on the carry and value factors,
which are the best extant currency factors. Adding these factors does decrease the RMSE most
of the time, but the decrease is both economically and statistically insignificant.

We conclude that a parsimonious factor model, using a factor obtained from a simple clustering
method, which groups mostly the dollar currencies, a commodity currency factor and a trading
volume weighted “market” factor fits currency comovements very well and does so better than
any other factor model extracted from the extant currency factors. Note that Greenaway-
McGrevy et al. (2017) also find that “carry” does not survive their factor identification
procedure, but they do not examine other extant currency factors.




   V.      Comparison to Recent Factor Models

In this section, we first link our results to some recent academic studies regarding currency
factors. We also reflect on the practicability of our factor model. Over the last few decades,
increased currency trading for speculative purposes has seen the birth of several tradeable
currency factors, e.g. through ETFs. We examine the link between our models and the well-
known Deutsche Bank currency factors.




   V.1.        A Dollar Factor

The currency risk model of Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2011) introduces the U.S. dollar
basket factor as a common currency factor. It is essentially the average excess return for a US
investor to investing in all the foreign currencies and is thus closely related to our dollar basket
(CBUSD). Verdelhan (2018) further shows that the U.S. dollar factor accounts for a large share of
bilateral exchange variations against the U.S. dollar. He identifies the U.S. dollar factor as a key
“global” risk factor and links its explanatory power for currency movements to its comovements

                                                  23



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
with different macro-economic variables (in particular capital flows). Importantly, he shows that
the “dollar factor “explains much more of bilateral currency comovements than does the carry
factor, which we have shown to be one of the better extant currency factors.

In this section, we show that the dollar factor’s explanatory power measured in Verdelhan (2018)
is not surprising and re-interpret it in terms of currency basket correlations.6 In addition,
Verdelhan’s dollar factor is numeraire dependent and therefore fits the currency movements in
other countries poorly. Verdelhan does create a factor that better captures global currency
movements but it is still closely related to the dollar basket. We show that this factor is
dominated by our CFabs factor.

Consider the main regression in Verdelhan (2018):

                           ∆s𝑘,𝑈𝑆𝐷,𝑡+1 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡+1 + 𝛾 𝐶𝐵𝑈𝑆𝐷,𝑡+1 + 𝜖𝑡+1                                           (22)

where, 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡+1 is the difference in returns between portfolios of high and low interest rate
currencies. Now, recall Equation (7) holding that each bilateral exchange rate change can be
described as (9/10 times) the difference between the two corresponding currency baskets.
Therefore:

                   9                    9
                       𝐶𝐵𝑈𝑆𝐷,𝑡+1 − 10 𝐶𝐵𝑘,𝑡+1 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡+1 + 𝛾 𝐶𝐵𝑈𝑆𝐷,𝑡+1 + 𝜖𝑡+1 ,                                  (23)
                  10

or:
                                   10        10                           10                      10
                  𝐶𝐵𝑘,𝑡+1 = −           𝛼−        𝛽 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡+1 + (1 −            𝛾) 𝐶𝐵𝑈𝑆𝐷,𝑡+1 −          𝜖𝑡+1 .          (24)
                                    9        9                            9                       9




The results of regressions (22) and (24) are reported respectively in Panels I and II of Table 11.
                                                                                                        10
As can be seen, the coefficients of carry in the right panel are almost equal to “− 9 ” times the

coefficients of carry in the left panel. In addition, the coefficients of CBUSD in the right panel are
                                   10
almost equal to one plus “− 9 ” times the coefficients of CBUSD in the left panel. Finally, the

adjusted R-squares in the left panel are much higher than those in the right panel. The presence of


6
 Curiously, Verdelhan at first seems to interpret the strength of the t-statistics in this regression as support for his
model but later does realize such high t-stats and R2’s are entirely expected.

                                                            24



                       Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
a common component on the left hand side and the right hand side in Equation (22) leads to a
somewhat different interpretation of the Verdelhan – results. First, the coefficients in Regression
(22) are difficult to interpret. For example, the “dollar factor” has virtually no independent effect
on CBGBP yielding an insignificant -0.06 coefficient; yet, regression (22) produces a coefficient of
0.95 (which is, of course nothing but 9/10 minus 9/10 times -0.06), with a huge t-statistic.
Second, the explanatory power of the carry and the CBUSD for bilateral exchange rates, using
Equation (22) (in the left panel) is artificially high because we use a component in the left hand-
side variable as a right-hand-side explanatory variable. For example, in the last row of Panels I
and II, the R2 of carry and CBUSD is 57% for the changes in the GBP/USD while in fact the R2 of
carry and CBUSD is only 1% for CBGBP. In contrast, in the second row, the R2 of carry and CBUSD
is the lowest at 39% for the changes in the CAD/USD while in fact the R2 of carry and CBUSD is
the second highest at 41% for the CBCAD. Third, the coefficients in Verdelhan’s original
regression do potentially reveal something about the correlation structure in currency baskets
when re-interpreted as in Equation (24). High coefficients in fact reveal a low beta with respect
to the US dollar basket, where the beta is conditional on the covariance with the carry factor.

Perhaps aware of the potential problem, Verdelhan (2018) excludes the left-hand-side exchange
rate in the composition of his dollar factor, but it is easy to see that this does not resolve the
problem.7 Moreover, this now aggravates the problem that the factor is not common across even
bilateral rates relative to the dollar. Furthermore, as we have shown before, the original dollar
factor, CBUSD, is not a suitable common factor for all bilateral rates.

                                                     [Table 11]

To resolve the numeraire currency problem, Verdelhan (2018) proposes the difference in
exchange rate changes between high and low dollar beta portfolios as a truly global factor,




7
  Assume that EUR/USD is the left-hand-side variable in the regression. If we exclude it in the composition of the
dollar basket factor as well as in the euro basket factor, we have:
        1                           1                                   8         8
𝐶𝐵$ = [∑9𝑗 ∆s𝑗,$ ] and 𝐶𝐵€ = [∑9𝑗 ∆s€,𝑗 ], and as a result, ∆s€,$ = 𝐶𝐵$ − 𝐶𝐵€ . As can be seen, the dollar basket
        9                           9                                   9         9
factor (𝐶𝐵$ ) is still a part of left-hand-side variable. Thus, our concern is valid even after excluding the EUR/USD
exchange rate changes (∆s€,$ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∆s$,€ ) in the composition of the basket factors, 𝐶𝐵$ and 𝐶𝐵€ respectively. The
supportive empirical evidence is available on request.

                                                         25

hereafter denoted by HML$.8 To create such a portfolio, he regresses currency changes in a
rolling fashion on the carry and dollar baskets and sorts currencies in 6 groups according to their
dollar basket exposures, taking the difference between the 1st and 6th portfolio. From our analysis
above, this exercise essentially sorts on the dollar basket exposure of other currency baskets and
is therefore potentially a valid global risk factor.

However, we now show that our simple currency factor (CFabs) has more explanatory power for
currency variation than the HML$ factor of Verdelhan (2018). We run the following horserace
regressions:

                                𝐶𝐵𝑘,𝑡+1 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 HML$𝑡+1 + 𝛾 CFabs,t+1 + 𝜖𝑡+1 .                                     (25)

The results are reported in Table 12. Panel I and II show the explanatory power of HML$ and
CFabs separately and Panel III shows the explanatory power of HML$ and CFabs jointly. The
adjusted R2‘s reported in Panel II are mostly higher than in Panel I. The HML$ has much higher
explanatory power (R2 of 71%) for the US dollar basket factor (CBUSD) while CFabs has more
balanced explanatory power for all other baskets compared to the HML$ factor (an average R2 of
34% versus only 17% for HML$). Furthermore, the coefficient of HML$ is significant for only 7
out of 10 currency baskets while the coefficient of our CFabs factor is significant for all G10
currency baskets.

It is puzzling that Verdelhan’s global factor has such high correlation with the dollar basket.
After all, the factor was created by differencing a basket of currencies with high dollar betas
versus one with low dollar betas and thus should be dollar neutral. However, it turns out that
Verdelhan includes pegged currencies such as the United Arab dirham, the Saudi riyal, Kuwaiti
dinar and Hong Kong dollar in his sample. These currencies have naturally very low dollar betas
by construction given that they are pegged to the dollar.9 These currencies are only added to the



8
  In the working paper version, Verdelhan also proposes to use the numeraire currency basket factor as the
explanatory variable; for example, a pound basket factor for the bilateral rates w.r.t. the British pound. Obviously,
such factors are not truly global and all will perform poorly in terms of global fit (see Table 3).
9
  That their tight link with the dollar results in a low not a high beta is again due to the nature of the Verdelhan
regression: with a pegged currency the dependent variable has little variation and is regressed onto the dollar basket,
which has plenty of variation. This results in a low beta. In our rewritten currency basket regression, the pegged
currencies would naturally show high dollar basket betas.

sample in July 1999, and indeed, the correlation between Verdelhan’s dollar factor and our dollar
currency basket increases from 74% to 92% after this sample date.

When we put both factors together in Panel III, the adjusted R2s increase, which shows that the
two factors contain different information. The coefficient of CFabs remains statistically significant
for all currency baskets except for the USD basket factor while the coefficient of HML$ is not
significant for the CAD, CHF, JPY, and NOK basket factors.

The bottom panel of the table reports the results of the comovement fitting horse race. The
HML$ factor has a RMSE of 0.214 relative to the data correlations, which is higher than the
0.191 RMSE generated by our CFabs factor. Moreover, the bivariate model has a better RMSE
(of 0.161) than the univariate models. We conclude that the explanatory power of our simple
currency factor (CFabs) is higher than that of the global dollar factor of Verdelhan (2018). Given
the nature of Verdelhan’s regression, his global factor is related to our factor structure. If the
regressions were done unconditionally (instead of using rolling samples), would not condition on
the carry factor and use only the G10 currency set (Verdelhan uses more than 20 currencies), the
procedure would effectively sort on the beta with respect to the USD currency basket and likely
reveal something close to the factor structure we uncover. In fact, we verified the identity of the
currencies in the high and low beta baskets, finding the CAD and the AUD to feature frequently
in the low beta buckets, and the European currencies in the high beta buckets. Pegged currencies
are always present in the low beta category, biasing the dollar factor to be non-dollar neutral.

We also examined the explanatory power of dollar-carry factor introduced in Lustig et al. (2014),
which goes long in a basket of foreign currencies and short in the dollar whenever the average
foreign short-term interest rate is above the U.S. interest rate and vice versa. However, the
explanatory power of the dollar-carry factor is much lower than even the HML$. The results are
reported in the Online Appendix.

                                              [Table 12]

   V.2. Re-interpreting the currency factor structure in Lustig and Richmond (2016)

Lustig and Richmond (2016) recently detect an interesting pattern in cross-currency correlations.
They regress bilateral exchange rate changes on “base factors,” which are closely related to our

                                                  27



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
currency baskets. They then show that the betas in these regressions and the R2s can be
interpreted using a gravity model: they are lower the closer the countries are in terms of distance
and other variables measuring economic closeness.

At first glance, this is somewhat surprising. For example, it is well – known that the variability of
exchange rate changes between closely connected countries (for example, Canada and the US;
countries within Europe) display less variability which is typically interpreted as reflecting close
economic ties. Rose (2000), and Baxter and Kouparitsas (2006), for example, show that FX
volatility is negatively correlated with trade volume. In the Lustig-Richmond world, the
currencies of these countries show low betas and low systematic risk. It is also surprising from
the perspective of our clustering model, where we measure distance as a negative function of
correlation and find a block structure that puts countries that are geographically close (the
European currencies) within one block (at least when we use two clusters).

However, our results can be reconciled. To illustrate this, let’s consider the US dollar as the base
currency. In that case, the base factor is in fact equivalent to our USD currency basket. The
regression that Lustig and Richmond run is essentially a regression of bilateral currency changes
relative to the dollar onto the dollar currency basket. Thus, it is a simpler version of the
Verdelhan regression (without the carry factor) in Equation (22). We replicate such a regression
for the 9 other currencies among the G10 in Table 13, Panel I. First, note that the left-hand side
variable is also contained in the independent variable, making the variability of the bilateral
exchange rate change a key component of the numerator in the regression coefficient. This
naturally biases the betas downward for neighboring countries because of the lower variability of
their exchange rate changes. Lustig and Richmond (2016) control for this bias by excluding the
bilateral exchange rate on the left from the right-hand side base factor. Nevertheless, this does
not quite fully control for the variability bias. Exchange rate changes with low absolute
variability must necessarily also show lower covariances with other variables (and the variance of
the independent variable is only marginally affected by the identity of the dependent variable).
This may help to explain the low coefficient for the CAD/USD rate in Table 13.

Second, our currency basket concept sheds direct light on the Lustig-Richmond findings.
Intuitively, currency baskets of nearby countries should be highly correlated (and they are, see
Table 5). How can the regression beta in the Lustig-Richmond regression then be positively
                                                  28



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
correlated with distance? Well, recall that a bilateral currency change is approximately the
difference between two currency baskets. Therefore, the Lustig-Richmond regression regresses
the difference between the dollar basket and another currency basket onto essentially the dollar
basket. Therefore, the regression beta, everything else equal, is decreasing in the comovement
between the currency baskets. The empirical results confirm this intuition. Within Europe, the
Lustig-Richmond beta is smallest for the economically close UK and higher for the further away
Scandinavian countries.

In this article, we opted to think about currency baskets globally to represent currency
movements. From that perspective, the USD and CAD currency baskets are positively
correlated (they show a short “distance”) as are the JPY and USD baskets (see Table 4). The JPY
and CAD have the lowest betas and R2s in the Lustig-Richmond regressions. Panel II shows that
if we recast the Lustig-Richmond regressions in our currency basket framework, the CAD and
JPY baskets are the only baskets with positive betas. Thus, our results can in fact be reconciled
and the Lustig-Richmond framework provides economic intuition for our correlation structure.10
In particular, our distance concept applied to currency baskets is intuitively positively correlated
with physical distance. For example, when we run a regression of the bilateral distances
(BDistance) between the currency baskets as used in the clustering algorithm on the population
weighted physical distance (PDistance) between the involved countries (as used in Lustig and
Richmond),11 we obtain:

                     BDistancei,j = 1.33 + 1.86×10-5 PDistancei,j + e                 (R2=0.09)                         (26)
                      t-statistics: (95.56) (7.77)

This means that for every physical mile the “correlation” distance increases by 1.86×10-5. The
coefficient is highly statistically significant. We also run the same regression using actual
correlations between the currency baskets finding statistically significant negative



10
   Examining other currency perspectives (such as the Euro) revealed that the Lustig-Richmond intuition does not
uniformly survive. In contrast, our factor structure, with currency baskets in Europe positively correlated within and
negatively correlated outside Europe, is a global feature of currencies.

coefficients. Hence, currency basket correlations also follow a gravity equation with correlations
decreasing roughly 2% per 1000 miles.




     V.3.        On The Deutsche Bank Factors

In the “active” currency management space, the Deutsche Bank (DB) currency factors are
frequently used to measure risk exposures and performance. Levich and Pojarliev (2008) show a
negative correlation between the performance of currency managers and the R2 of a regression of
their returns onto the DB factors. The DB factors include a carry, momentum and value factor.
The Appendix briefly discusses the construction of these factors, which is slightly different from
our construction of the analogous factors. For example, the DB carry factor is constructed by
ranking currencies on 3-month Libor rates, while we use government bond rates that are available
for a longer period of time. The DB momentum factor is constructed by ranking currencies
according to their 12 month rolling return against the USD, while we rank currencies according
to their 1 month rolling returns.      Yet, the factors show relatively high correlation. Over the
sample period available,12 the carry factors are 87% correlated, the value factors 88% correlated
but the momentum factors are only 20% correlated.

Because of the relatively high correlation, it is to be expected that the DB factors perform about
the same as the analogous standard currency factors that we examined before. Online Appendix
Table 6 confirms that a three-factor model using the DB factors performs similarly relative to the
analogous model using our factors, in terms of R2 and is slightly worse in terms of the RMSE for
correlations.

This also implies that the performance of the DB factors falls far short of the performance of our
new three-factor model involving the clustering, commodity and market factors. It would
therefore be of interest to create tradeable baskets corresponding to our three factors. We
discussed before that our “cluster factor” involves shorting (longing) the European (dollar)
currencies. Likewise, a proxy to the trade-weighted world factor can be obtained by going long in


12
  The DB FX factors are available for a shorter sample period. For example, the DB’s momentum and value factors
are available since July 1989 and the DB’s carry factor is available since October 2000.

all foreign currencies relative to the USD, roughly proportional to their trade weights (see
Appendix B).


     VI.     Explaining Emerging Market Currencies

As an out-of-sample exercise, we verify how well our new factor models and the extant currency
factors fit exchange rate variation and currency components in 21 emerging markets. Our sample
period for the emerging markets extends from July 1993 to December 2015.13 We consider our
two new models, one involving CFabs, the currency commodity factor (CFcom) and the market
factor (CFtw); the other involving the two cluster factors (CF31 and CF32) and the market factor.
We also consider the performance of our cluster factors separately.

Our set of emerging countries includes Brazil, Chile, China, Columbia, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Israel, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia,
South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. Note that our currency baskets in this
case include both emerging and developed currencies (that is, 31 currencies). For example, the
China Yuan basket factor is the average appreciation of Chinese yuan with respect to 20 other
emerging market currencies and the 10 G10 currencies. The correlations we consider however,
are the correlations between the emerging market baskets.

Table 14 presents the results in terms of average R2’s and RMSE’s with confidence bands. The
parameter estimates are reported in the Online Appendix. A single CFabs factor model explains on
average 5% of the variation in emerging currency basket changes and the coefficient on CFabs is
statistically significant for 18 out of 21 emerging currency baskets (see the Online Appendix).
The RMSE of its implied currency correlations is 0.189. Therefore, the CFabs factor has less
power to explain variation in emerging currency basket changes than in G10 currency baskets. It
also fits the correlations among G10 currency baskets slightly better than those among the 21
emerging currency baskets, but the fit is still rather good given the relatively low R2’s. While
surprising at first, the Online Appendix shows that the emerging market baskets show relatively



13
   Because the sample is shorter than for the G10 currencies, the results are not exactly comparable with our previous
results. However, in results available upon request, we find that the RMSE’s for the shorter sample are similar (albeit
slightly higher than) that for the full sample (0.12-0.13 for the two three-factor models).

                                                          31



                     Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
small correlations due to the large idiosyncratic risk displayed by emerging market currencies.
This fact both explains the low R2’s and makes the correlation error larger in relative terms.

                                              [Table 14]

Bivariate regressions of the 21 emerging currency-basket changes on the two factors from the
three-absolute clusters, CF31 and CF32, reveal that this model explains on average 12% of
currency variation. The coefficients for CF31 and CF32 are statistically significant for 17 and 9 out
of 21 emerging currency baskets, respectively. The RMSE of its implied currency correlations is
0.158. We ran a block bootstrap for this set of currencies too. Using the 95% confidence intervals
for this model, the drop from 0.189 to 0.158 is actually statistically significant, in that 0.158 is
below the 95% confidence interval generated by the CFabs-model.

We now consider the performance of the two new three factor models. In multivariate
regressions of the 21 emerging currency-baskets on our suggested three factors CFabs, CFcom, and
CFTW jointly, the commodity factor, CFcom, is statistically significant for 5 currencies and CFTW is
significant for 15 currencies. Our new three-factor model explains on average 15% of the
emerging currency basket variation and the RMSE of its implied currency correlations is 0.151.
The alternative three factor model, combining our currency trading-volume weighted factor,
CFTW, with CF31 and CF32, generates an average R2 of 15% and the coefficient on CFTW is
statistically significant for 13 out of 21 emerging currency baskets. The RMSE of the model’s
implied currency correlations is 0.151, which is only slightly lower than that of the two factor
model. Using our bootstrap exercise, the improvements produced by the two three factor models
relative to the model with the two cluster factors are economically and statistically insignificant.

It is undoubtedly true that emerging market currencies are quite different from developed market
currencies, featuring lower trading volumes, higher spreads, and more often than not more
government meddling. Moreover, many of these countries experience larger economic shocks
than developed countries do and emerging market currency values may reflect the economic
prospects of a country more than developed market currencies do. In addition, it is well known
that equity and currency markets are more correlated in emerging than in developed markets (see
Bekaert and Harvey, 2017). All these factors may cause emerging market currencies to have
more country specific risk. However, it is also conceivable that there is an emerging market

                                                  32



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
factor. Emerging markets is still a popular asset class among institutional investors, and currency
hedging for emerging market investments remains uncommon, so that large movements in the
asset class may be reflected in emerging market currencies overall. Moreover, emerging market
currency exposure may reflect “carry trade” exposure, with many emerging market currencies
featuring high interest rates.

We therefore create an emerging market currency factor (CFEM) using relative trade-weights as
we did for the G10 currencies. The trade weights are reported in the appendix. In the latest BIS
survey the Mexican peso was the most traded emerging market currency (almost 15.8% of
trading volume), followed by the Chinese Renminbi (13.9%) and the Russian ruble
(10.1%). Earlier in the sample, the South African Rand (ZAR) was the second most traded
currency, but the Mexican peso always has comprised an important part of trading volumes. In
contrast, the CNY represented a rather negligible part of trading volumes up and till 2007 but
since then its weight has increased to over 13%.

We either replace the CFTW factor in our preferred three factor model by the corresponding
emerging market factor or we add it to the basic three factor model. However, replacing the
CFTW factor by the emerging market factor worsens the performance of the model, with the R2’s
failing to improve and the RMSE’s becoming slightly worse. When we use the 4-factor model,
the R2 modestly increases to 19% but the correlation fit is similar to that of the parsimonious
three factor model. Yet, 12 of the emerging market currencies have significant exposure to the
emerging market factor. We performed the same analysis for the alternative three factor model
with CF31 and CF32. The results are very similar with the performance of both the three factor and
four factor models worse in terms of RMSE than the three factor models with the TW factor. The
R2s do improve slightly. We conclude that our new factor model also provides the best fit for
emerging market currencies.

Finally, we also verify the performance of the extant factors finding that they explain less of the
variation of emerging market currency baskets and generate higher RMSEs (see the last lines in
Table 14).

   VII.    An Economic Interpretation of Currency Baskets

Much recent currency research (see especially Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan, 2011, 2014) has
linked currency changes and factors to reduced-form models of pricing kernels. In this section,
we first show how currency baskets and their correlations are informative about the properties of
pricing kernels. In addition, we show that the currency basket comovements are closely linked to
comovements of idiosyncratic consumption growth rates of the corresponding countries, in line
with the predictions of a simple kernel model.

   VII.1 Pricing kernels and Currency Baskets

It is well-known that in complete markets economies, currency changes reflect the difference in
the log pricing kernels (or using the language of equilibrium models, marginal utility growth, or
intertemporal rates of substitution) in the two countries:

                                            ∆s𝑗,𝑖 = m𝑖 − m𝑗                                      (27)

To derive the equivalent expression for currency baskets, it is useful to define a “global” pricing
                                                                             1
kernel as the equally weighed average of individual pricing kernels: m𝑔 = n ∑𝑛𝑗=1 m𝑗 . Then, it

follows:

                                               𝑛
                                      CB𝑖 = 𝑛−1 [ m𝑖 − m𝑔 ]                                      (28)


The currency basket for country i is related to the difference between the pricing kernel for
country i and the global pricing kernel, that is, to the “idiosyncratic” component of the pricing
kernel. Equation (28) suggests that the variability of the currency baskets may be related to the
correlation between different pricing kernels, which is, in turn, directly related to the amount of
international risk sharing.

To obtain some quick intuition, consider a symmetric, homogenous world in which the variability
of all pricing kernel equals 𝜎𝑚
                              2
                                and their correlation is 𝜌𝑚 . Under these assumptions, the
variance of the global pricing kernel is:

                                                   1         𝑛−1
                              𝜎𝑔2 = 𝑣𝑎𝑟[𝑚𝑔 ] = 𝑛 𝜎𝑚
                                                  2
                                                    +                  2
                                                                   𝜌𝑚 𝜎𝑚                         (29)
                                                             𝑛



                                                   34



                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
That is, if the correlation between the pricing kernels across countries is zero the global kernel
variance would be second order relative to individual country pricing kernel variances, but with
perfect correlation it is identical to the country specific kernel variance.   Brandt, Cochrane and
Santa Clara (2006), studying bilateral exchange rates and kernels, derive a “risk sharing index,”
which under perfect correlation of the pricing kernel would equal 1. They make the point that the
relatively low variability of bilateral currency changes and relatively high variability of pricing
kernels (as implied by asset prices) implies a high degree of international risk sharing.
Combining Equations (28) and (29), the variability of currency baskets is directly informative
about the amount of risk sharing. Under the symmetry assumptions, we find:

                                                  𝑛−1
                                  𝑣𝑎𝑟[𝐶𝐵𝑖 ] =                      2
                                                        [1 − 𝜌𝑚 ] 𝜎𝑚                             (30)
                                                  𝑛


Therefore, if risk sharing is close to perfect in a complete markets world (and given conditions
close to symmetry), currency baskets should have very low variability. However, as Table 3
reveals the variability of currency baskets is non-trivial (about half the variability of
internationally diversified equity market indices).

Of course, many papers have pointed out that the explanation of puzzles such as deviations from
unbiasedness (Backus, Foresi and Telmer, 2001) or attractive carry returns (Lustig, Roussanov
and Verdelhan, 2011) require asymmetries in pricing kernels. A simple way to introduce
asymmetry is to assume that each pricing kernel has a “systematic” component and a country
specific component, which we assume uncorrelated across countries:

                                         m𝑖 = a𝑖 m𝑔 + m
                                                      ̅𝑖                                         (31)

where m
      ̅ 𝑖 is orthogonal to m𝑔 . In such an asymmetric world, the currency basket’s variation
depends on a systematic and idiosyncratic component, and the covariance between currency
baskets has a simple, intuitive expression:

                                          𝑛
                                 CB𝑖 = 𝑛−1 (( a𝑖 − 1) m𝑔 + m
                                                           ̅ 𝑖)                                  (32)

                                              𝑛    2
                         𝑐𝑜𝑣[CB𝑖 , CB𝑗 ] = (𝑛−1 ) (𝑎𝑖 − 1)(𝑎𝑗 − 1)𝜎𝑔2                            (33)




                                                   35



                   Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
Hence, if two pricing kernels have jointly high (a𝑖 , a𝑗 > 1) or jointly low exposure (a𝑖 , a𝑗 < 1)
to the global pricing kernel, the currency baskets of the two corresponding countries are
positively correlated; if not they should show negative correlation. We noticed such strong
separation in currency basket correlations (see Table 4), which nicely circumvents the common
factor issue in bilateral exchange rate correlations as apparent in Table 1.

     VII.2. Currency and consumption baskets

Do we see traces of the currency basket correlations and their factor structure in economic data?
To provide some preliminary analysis, we obtained data on seasonally adjusted monthly growth
rates in retail sales for our various countries (with the data for New Zealand missing). The data
for Australia (Sweden) only start in 1982 (1984) but are available for the full sample for the other
countries. We reconstructed the currency baskets, removing New Zealand, and start the sample
in 1984.    The resulting currency basket correlations are reported in the Online Appendix but are
close to the ones reported in Table 4.

We use retail sales deflated by the (de-seasonalized) CPI, both available at the monthly
frequency, as a proxy to aggregate consumption data.14 In a simple Lucas economy with power
utility, the pricing kernel (or the log of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution) equals –
𝛾 ∆𝑐𝑡 , with ∆𝑐𝑡 representing consumption growth and 𝛾 aggregate risk aversion. Therefore, the
a𝑖 coefficient depends on the country’s risk aversion relative to the world’s risk aversion, the
correlation of its consumption growth with the world’s and the variability of its consumption
growth relative to that of world consumption growth.              If we assume risk aversion coefficients
are not too different from each other across countries, a projection of a country’s retail sales
growth onto the world’s (measured as an equally weighted average of the growth rates of the
countries we consider) should deliver the a𝑖 coefficients of Equation (31).                In Table 15 (column
1), we report the projection coefficients. Because we spliced DEM data with Euro data, the retail
sales data we use are Germany’s before 1999, and the Euro area’s thereafter. Remarkably, the


14
  For the UK and Japan, the CPI data are not de-seasonalized before January 1988, respectively January 1985.
Results with these few data points de-seasonalized using seasonal dummies in inflation regressions deliver similar
results. We also perform the computations using nominal retail sales growth data because our exchange rate
changes are nominal as well (but recall that currency basket correlations in real and nominal terms are virtually
identical). These results are available upon request, and, if anything, show a tighter link between currency basket
and pricing kernel correlations than the one reported here,

                                                         36



                     Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3022623
factor structure we discovered in currencies is mimicked imperfectly but still visibly in retail
sales data: the consumption growth rates corresponding to the dollar rate currencies all have slope
coefficients lower than 1; whereas the European currencies have slope coefficients higher than
one, except for the Euro and the British pound. The UK’s coefficient is quite far below one
(albeit insignificantly so). However, recall that if we use three clusters, the GBP is clustered with
the USD and the JPY. For the Euro area, if we replace Germany by France, the coefficient for
the Euro is indeed above one. Because the pound is special, we also produce results excluding it
(see column 2). The pattern of the slope coefficients remains largely unaltered.

Because a currency basket is proportional to the “idiosyncratic” component in the pricing kernel,
the model would imply that the correlations among currency baskets should be similar to the
correlations of “idiosyncratic” pricing kernels. With idiosyncratic, we refer to consumption
growth minus its world counterpart.     Of course, the Lucas model is too simplistic for this to be
literally true, but the projection coefficients suggests that the correlation structure among the
“idiosyncratic” pricing kernels is similar to that among currency baskets. We report the full
correlation matrix in the Online Appendix. In Table 15, Column 3, we report for each currency,
the Pearson and rank correlation between currency basket correlations with the other currencies,
and the correlations between the corresponding idiosyncratic retail sales growth rate data. The
Pearson (rank) correlation is as high as 0.742 (0.667) for the NOK, but negative for the UK and
the Euro area. When we pool all correlations, the correlation is 0.243 (0.216), and increases to
0.287 (0.234) when the UK is eliminated. We actually report the worst recorded results over a
number of different specifications. For example, using German retail sales growth data over the
full sample increases the correlations, as does extending the sample to 1973 where we can.
Replacing Germany by France, substantially raises the correlations, with the overall Pearson
correlation almost reaching 0.4.

We conclude that there are tantalizing links between the correlation structure of currency baskets
and fundamental consumption growth data across countries, as predicted by a simple kernel
model. While intriguing, further analysis of the pricing implications of our results is beyond the
scope of the present article. This is especially true because analysis on pricing kernels alone does
not suffice to fully understand international market equilibria, which requires a full specification

(see Burnside and Graveline, 2014 for an insightful discussion).



   VIII. Conclusions

We examine various factor models to explain currency (co) movements and document their fit
with the data. Rather than studying bilateral rates with a specific numeraire currency, as is
customary in the literature, we focus on “currency baskets,” representing the average of each
currency’s changes relative to all other currencies. For the G-10 currencies, studying 10 currency
baskets is equivalent to studying all 45 unique currency pairs. This methodology together with a
clustering technique helps us detect a clear factor structure in currency comovements suggesting
two currency blocks. One block includes the dollar rates and the yen, and the other block includes
the European currencies.

The new factor is a very significant determinant of variation in the 10 currency baskets. When
combined with a currency commodity factor (including the AUD, NZD, CAD and the NOK) and
a market factor, which we construct from the currency baskets using trade volumes from the BIS,
a parsimonious factor model results that explains on average 58% of the changes in the various
currency baskets. It also fits the currency basket correlations quite well, generating a RMSE of
only 0.11. In addition, this parsimonious model also has significant explanatory power for
emerging currency baskets and fits their comovements well, with a RMSE of only 0.15.

We also compare the performance of the new model with that of extant currency factors. The extant
currency factors in our tests are the carry, volatility, value, and momentum currency factors, a
commodity prices factor, and a world-equity factor. We contrast the explanatory power of the
extant currency factors with the explanatory power of our new factors. The carry and value factors
fit currency variances and correlation much better than the other extant currency factors. However,
any factor model created from the extant currency factors performs much less well than the new
factor model. This result also extends to emerging market currency baskets. We also find that our
new currency factor—the sum of “dollar” basket factors and the yen— has more explanatory power
for global currency variation than the global dollar factor of Verdelhan (2018).

With active currency management becoming more commonplace, our findings should help
currency managers and international investors to better explain the risks and comovements of
currencies worldwide. The new factor model can also be of help in international asset pricing
exercises, where a multitude of bilateral currency rates can be collapsed into the factors we
uncovered. Economically, the correlations between currency baskets underlying the factors are
inversely related to the physical distances between countries. Moreover, the factor structure is
related to the exposure of the corresponding pricing kernels with respect to the global pricing
kernel. Proxying for monthly consumption growth using monthly retail sales growth data, we
find that this correlation structure is also apparent in in the pricing kernels generated by a simple
consumption-based asset pricing model with power utility.

Of course, much additional research is needed. We have only studied our factors in terms of their
ability to fit comovements, and have not considered the returns associated with them or their ability
to price the cross-section of currency portfolios.       We have also focused on unconditional
correlations, and it is well known that currency correlations vary through time (see e.g. Hau and
Rey, 2006). They may also depend on economic conditions (see Christiansen, Ranaldo, and
Söderlind, 2011) or be affected by structural shifts such as the introduction of the Euro in 1999. It
should be straightforward to use high frequency data to extend our methodology to a conditional
framework. Finally, the currency basket concept we introduced has additional applications, it is

                    Appendix A

                    Tables A1 and A2 present the currency trading weights reported by the BIS (Bank for
                    International Settlements). Table A3 reports the explanatory power of the trade-weighted
                    currency factor (CFTW). As the USD is the most traded currency (more than 47% of all currency
                    trading volumes), it has a high weight in the construction of CFTW and thus the CFTW has a high
                    explanatory power for CBUSD, with an R2 of 83%. However, CFTW has lower average explanatory
                    power than CFabs (see Table 6).

The table presents the optimal clusters of G10 currency baskets. In this absolute clustering technique, we consider all possible
allocations of G10 currency baskets in N clusters (1≤N≤10) and calculate their in-cluster distance as the sum of distances
among all members of the cluster. The average correlation “within” simply is the equally weighted average of all “within” the
cluster correlations, where the top number excludes the correlation with the own currency and the bottom number includes it
(that is, assigns a 1 to the correlation with oneself). The “across” averages all correlations between currencies not in the same
cluster.

The table presents results of regressing G10 currency baskets on our suggested currency factors. Our suggested currency
factors include a simple factor based on two absolute clusters as in Equation (23), CFabs, a commodity currency factor as in
Equation (28), CFcom, a currency trading-volume weighted factor as in Equation (29), CFTW, and two currency factors based on
three absolute clusters, CF31 and CF32 as in Equations (26) and (27), respectively. We combine these factors in one univariate
(Panel I) and three multivariate models (Panels II through IV). The t-statistics use White standard errors and are reported in
parentheses. The table also reports the average R-squares as well as their ranges in brackets. The sample extends from
01/1973 to 12/2015.

This table presents the RMSEs and the bootstrap results for the RMSE of implied correlations for various univariate models
with factors tested in Tables 6 and 7. We bootstrap the G10 currency baskets simultaneously with replacement. For each
random sample, we estimate the correlation matrix as well as the factor model. Then, we use the factors exposures to
compute model-implied correlations and finally the RMSEs. We use a bock-bootstrap using 6 month-blocks creating samples
of the same size as the actual sample. The number of replications is 1000. The sample extends from 01/1973 to 12/2015.

This table presents the RMSEs and the bootstrap results for the RMSE of implied correlations for various currency
multivariate models with factors tested in previous tables. Panel I reports models included either extant or new currency
factors. Panel II reports some models included both extant and new currency factors together. We bootstrap the G10 currency
baskets simultaneously with replacement. For each random sample, we estimate the correlation matrix as well as the factor
model. Then, we use the factors exposures to compute model-implied correlations and finally the RMSEs. We use a bock-
bootstrap using 6 month-blocks creating samples of the same size as the actual sample. The number of replications is 1000.
The sample extends from 01/1973 to 12/2015.

The table presents results of regressing 21 emerging currency basket returns on our suggested currency factors. The set of
emerging countries includes Brazil, Chile, China, Columbia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Indonesia, India, Mexico,
Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. The
emerging currency baskets are the average appreciation rate of the emerging currency w.r.t. 30 currencies; 21 other emerging
currencies and the G10 currencies. The different panels correspond to different factor models. Our suggested currency factors
include a simple factor based on two absolute clusters as in equation (23), CFabs, two currency factors based on three absolute
clusters as in equations (26) and (27), CF31 and CF32, a commodity currency factors as in equation (28), CFcom, a currency
trading-volume weighted factor as in equation (29), CFTW, and an emerging currency trading-volume weighted factor as in
equation (30), CFEM , where the weights are from the BIS and reported in Appendix A. The t-statistics are based on White
standard errors and reported in parentheses. The table also reports the average R-squares as well as their ranges in brackets.
The RMSE is the Root Mean Squared Error of implied correlations. The sample extends from 07/1993 to 12/2015.

This table reports the relation between real retail sales growth and currency baskets for the G10 countries. The first
column reports the exposure of individual real retail sales growth on the global real retail sales growth, measured as
the average of real retail sales growth of the G10 countries (excluding New Zealand). The second column reports
exposure of individual retail sales growth on the global retail sales growth, measured as the average of retail sales
growth of the G10 countries excluding New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third (fourth) columns report
correlation (rank correlation) between real retail sales growth implied correlations and sample currency basket
correlations for each G10 currency (excluding NZD, which its retail sales growth data is not available) in the middle
panel and those for all currencies together in the bottom panel. The last two columns report correlations and rank
correlations for a sample of G10 currencies excluding NZD and GBP. The real retail sale growths are inflated log
seasonally adjusted retail sale growths, using seasonally adjusted CPI data available on Thomson Reuters. The G10
real sales growth data are available from January 1973 to December 2017, except for Australia (retail sales series
starts in April 1982) and Sweden (retail sales series starts in January 1984). Therefore, the sample period is from
January 1984 to December 2017. The *, **, and *** represent significance levels at 10, 5 and 1 percent for the
coefficient to be less than 1 for USD, AUD, CAD, and JPY and to be more than 1 for CHF, EUR, NOK, SEK, and
GBP.
