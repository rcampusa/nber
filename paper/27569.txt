Enforcing Payment for Water and Sanitation Services in Nairobi's Slums
Aidan Coville, Sebastian Galiani, Paul Gertler, and Susumu Yoshida
NBER Working Paper No. 27569
July 2020
JEL No. C93,D04,O18

                                          ABSTRACT

Most of the recent focus in the delivery of public utility services has been on last mile
connections to water, sewerage and electricity grids. However, the high frequency of nonpayment
for services associated with this expansion has created a fiscal crisis for public utilities and has
forced utilities to ration services. Public utilities afraid that service disconnections will have
political consequences are reluctant to enforce payment with service cutoff. We test this
hypothesis using a field experiment in the slums of Nairobi with two interventions intended to
improve repayment for water and sewage services: a soft encouragement that informs tenants
about landlord's payment delinquency and, second, a hard threat of disconnection for
nonpayment with enforcement if landlords do not pay. While we find no effect of the soft
encouragement intervention, we find very large effects of the disconnection intervention on
repayment. Moreover, there seems to be no effect on landlord and tenant perceptions of utility
fairness or quality of service delivery, on community activism, on the relationships of tenants
with their landlords, or on child health. To counterbalance the effective increase in utility fees
paid, landlords increase their rental income by both renting out additional space in their
compounds and by marginally increasing tenant rents. These results suggest that strict
enforcement through disconnections increases payment and the financial position of the utility
without incurring political costs.

is exacerbated by weak institutions, where increasing enforcement may be difficult to
implement and susceptible to extortion (Ashraf et al. 2016). In fact, politicians may be
reluctanttocutservicesduetononpaymentforfearoflosingpublicsupport.

However,afterthreemonthsofbeingconnected,57%ofthecustomershadyettomakeany

   Inthiscase,whilethesubsidiesandcreditsignificantlyincreasedwaterandsanitation

customers making a payment, and the overall amount paid. In contrast, the face-to-face
intervention had a precisely estimated null effect. Using data from a survey conducted 9
months after the disconnection intervention, we find that water and sanitation service
connections and quality were not meaningfully different between treatment and control
compoundsdespitethedisconnectionsthattookplace.Moreover,wedonotfindevidenceof

   The study provides a unique opportunity to explore and contrast high-stakes

Starting from the group of 5,091 account customers that completed the landlord phone
survey in August 2018, just over 50% of these accounts (2,584) indicated that they had
tenantsresidingintheproperty.These2,584accountswererandomlyassignedintoagroup

   The two interventions were implemented sequentially. The engagement intervention
was implemented in September and October, while the enforcement intervention was
implementedinNovemberandDecember.

treatment landlords report being 3.6 percentage points less likely to have a piped water

    A first concern is the sheer number of disconnections. The treatment resulted in 97
disconnectionsoutof327eligiblecompounds(29%)withnoobviouspositivespilloversof
repayment behavior into control clusters. If disconnections permanently excluded
customersfromtheservice,thiswouldquicklybecomeself-defeatingifthiswasrepeated
regularly.However,inthiscasethedisconnectionislow-costandeasilyreversiblebyNCWSC
and we find that many of the originally disconnected households have reconnected nine
months later. There is a balance between ensuring that the disconnection is credible and
economically meaningful to the customer, while also being flexible enough to allow for
reasonableopportunitiesforremedialaction.NCWSCoptedformoreflexiblearrangements
withcustomers,requiringthemtomakeapaymentandsomecommitmenttoaddressthe
outstanding balance, rather than paying the full balance at once, which is a significant
barrier.InthiswayourresultsareconsistentwiththetheoreticalpredictioninAshrafetal

    Second,thereisaconcernthatincreasedenforcementmayincreasetherateofillegal

site inspections as part of their visits. In total, only 3 illegal connections were identified

    Third, the returns to increasing enforcement are a function of how sustainable the
repaymentbehaviorchangeis.NCWSCbillingdataclearlyshowalargespikeinrepayments

    Finally, a major reason for why governments and utilities are hesitant to implement
disconnections, particularly in low-income settings, is because of the political and social
costsinvolved.Sinceaprimaryobjectiveofconnectinglowincomehouseholdsinthefirst

   Note: ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent critical level. Payment outcomes are derived from the billing data and compound outcomes come from the landlord survey in August 2018.
   Baseline balance comparisons for the engagement intervention use administrative billing data from 6 August 2018 - the data used to draw the original sample for the landlord updating survey. Balance tests for the
   enforcement intervention use 28 October 2018 administrative billing data - the dataset on which the enforcement randomization was conducted. P-values for t-test comparisons between the engagement group
   treatment and control are presented in column (3). Comparison tests between the enforcement treatment group and controls within treatment clusters are presented in column (7). Comparisons between the
   enforcement treatment group and controls in control clusters are presented in column (8).
