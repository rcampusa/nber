                   The Ins and Outs of Unemployment: The Ins Win




                                      ABSTRACT



       This paper develops a framework for analyzing unemployment in terms of

  variations in the nt.imber and distribution of
                                                   people becoming unemployed and in
  individual probabilities of leaving unemployment.     Contrary to the emphasis on
  exit probabilities in the recent macroeconomics literature, we present

  empirical evidence in support of the proposition that changes in the size and

  distribution of the inflow Into unemployment are the primary determinant of

  the unemployment rate. Instead of falling at the beginning of a recession,

  the outflow rate rises (with a lag) in response to the increased inflows which

 drive the recession. In contrast to normal unemployment, cyclical unemploy-

 ment is concentrated in groups with low normal exit probabilities; so the

 observed procyclical variation in the average exit probability may largely he

 explained by predictable distributional effects.

     To understand changes in the unemployment rate, should we concentrate on

the factors that determine inflows into unemployment or outflows from it? Or,

are both flow concepts statistical ephemera without any substantial use? This

paper attempts to answer those questions and does so in a surprising way: The

main proximate determinant of changes in the unemployment rate is variations

in the level and distribution of inflows into unemployment. Since the prob—

ability of leaving unemployment is primarily determined by the characteristics

of those becoming unemployed and is little affected by the business cycle,

outflows from unemployment and hence the actual changes in the unemployment

rate are primarily determined by the inflows.

     Figure 1 provides preliminary evidence in support of the startling

hypothesis that the unemployment rate is determined primarily by the inflows.

The upper line labeled u is the unemployment rate. The solid line labeled

   is the quarterly average of monthly inflows into unemployment measured as a

percentage of the labor force. The dashed line labeled w measures the

outflow from unemployment in the same way. The change in the unemployment

rate over a quarter is three times the gap between the 4 and w lines.'

Statistical analysis reported below confirms the visual impression that

changes in inflows       preceded changes in outflows w. Note particularly

that the onset of a recession is characterized by a sharp increase in 4

followed quickly by an increase in w. Unemployment rises so long as the

increase in w lags behind the increase in        and then falls once      falls

below w.

        This rise In w at the beginning of recessions is inconsistent with the

predictions of the standard expectational—error/search paradigm in which a

recession is characterized by fooling workers into declining job offers which

they would take if they were aware of the decline in the offer distribution

available. This characterization of the business cycle has played a funda-

mental role in the macroeconomics literature during the last 20 years and is

the primary explanation of business cycles provided in many current

intermediate macroeconomics texts (e.g., Dornbusch and Fischer 1984, Gordon

1984). Yet, Figure 1 and our subsequent analysis suggests that business—cycle

analysts have placed too much emphasis on workers making expectational errors.

Instead, we contend that increases in the unemployment rate primarily reflect

more people passing through that state, not each individual spending an

where  y is the growth rate of the labor force. Since ru is negligible in
magnitude relative to 4r-w, we have that the cumulative change in u over a

  abnormally longer time in it.2

       In our (1985) paper we developed data which showed that the average

  probability   of leaving unemployment does fall during recessions. In this

  paper, we extend our heterogeneity hypothesis which relates
                                                                these changes in
 average probability to the much larger representation of
                                                             slow searchers in
 cyclical as opposed to normal unemployment.     We demonstrate in this paper that
 taking into account these distributional effects
                                                     on average probabilities
 tends to strengthen the result that it is the level and distribution of the

 inflows that dominates movements in unemployment.

      A useful analogy which clarifies our viewpoint is to think of the number

 of people traveling by air at a given moment. At major holidays, this number

 rises both because more people are
                                      making trips and their trips cover longer
 distances on average. While there may be some increase in the time required to

 make a certain trip, this is secondary to the number and type of trips as a

 determinant of the number flying at any given time. Even for the average dura-

 tion of trips, variation in the average length of trips may be a more important

explanation than variation in the average duration of a given type of trip.

     Our results here do not show that individual outflow probabilities

are constant. We do show that controlling for such
                                                                            ()

to explain persistent deviations of the probability of escape from unemploy-

     Our results bring us closer to the viewpoint of Liliert (1982) than in our

(1985) paper. Variations in the rate of industrial change do appear to be an

important determinant of the level and distribution of inflows and hence of

the unemployment rate. Much future research by us and others is needed to

understand exactly what determines the level and distribution of inflows, but

the point of this paper is that research focusing on the determinants of the

inflows is important if we are to answer Mitchell's (1951) question What

Happens During Business Cycles? Our working hypothesis is that such research

will indicate the importance of cyclical factors (structural change is

concentrated in recessions), the real exchange rate (which shifts resources

between the tradable and nontradable goods sectors), and wars (which greatly

reduce the number of bankruptcies, plant closings, and permanent layoffs).

     The first section of this paper develops the analytics of unemployment

dynamics and shows that the persistent, hump—shaped fluctuations in unemploy-

ment can be explained by these dynamics without necessary recourse to

persistent expectational errors. The next section applies these concepts in

the empirical analysis of both aggregate data and data disaggregated by

individual characteristics. In our final section we summarize the work and

propose a program for future research.


                                   I.    Theory
     In   this paper we use the search paradigm to analyze all of unemployment

although in principle we would prefer to use this theory to explain the search
                                        7




 unemployment rate and model the layoff unemployment rate separately.3     In
 future research,    hope to develop data and techniques which would permit us

 to pursue that strategy. Given the currently available data, we are

 pleasantly surprised that our model is able to explain changes in total

 unemployment so well as it does.


                    LA. An Unemployment Accounting Paradigm

      Let us begin by arranging people into groups indexed by i such that

 each individual in a particular group has the same probability in any given

 month of leaving unemployment if they are unemployed at the beginning of the

 month. This probability may change from month to month with business condi-

 tions but it changes in the same way for everyone within the group.4

      The change in the number unemployed   sj for each group is found by
subtracting the outflows from the inflows
                                            fj:
(l)                             —

     3Layoff unemployment is used here to refer to those unemployed expecting
to be recalled to their previous job while search unemployment refers to all
others. A person counted as layoff unemployed this month could remain so next
month or become employed at his previous job, employed at a new job, search
unemployed, or out—of—the labor force. For reasons to be discussed below, it
is likely that the probability of recall from layoff unemployment is affected
more by cyclical variables than is the probability that a particular
individual will leave search unemployment.

     41n our (1985) paper we concentrated on two such groups: a high—turnover
and low turnover group. Results reported below suggest at least four major
groupings: temporary—layoff unemployed, loosely—attached (to the labor force)
workers who have a low probability of getting a job and high probability of
leaving the labor force, strongly—attached high—turnover workers who have a
high probability of getting a job but a very low probability of leaving the
labor force, and strongly—attached low—turnover workers who have a low probab-
ility of getting a job (on the rare occasions that they are search unemployed)
and a very low probability of leaving the labor force. To fit the strict
definition of a group in the text, the number of distinct groups would have to
be multiplied by a large number.

Repeated substitution of lagged values of sj into identity (2) gives us an

expression for the number unemployed in terms of only the history of inflows

and outflow probabilities of the group:

                                           n=l          1=1

Identity (4) is unwieldy and further simplification is obviously needed in

moving from tautology to theory. We propose a decomposition of movements in

unemployment into those due to variations in inflows holding exit probabilit-

ies constant and those due to variations in exit probabilities holding inflows

constant.


      I.B. Unemployment Rate Dynamics without Persistent Expectational Errors

       Suppose that unemployed individuals are well informed about the state of

the labor market so that the expected offer distribution differs from the

actual offer distribution only by serially uncorrelated errors. In this

environment, it can be demonstrated (see, e.g., Lippman and McCall 1986,

Burdett and Ondrich 1985) that fluctuations in a representative searcher's

probability of finding a job will be serially uncorrelated as well (at least

to a first approximation). The underlying intuition for this result is as

follows. An anticipated shift in the offer distribution will primarily result

in rational searchers altering their reservation wage. Whether the new

reservation wage involves a higher or lower probability of accepting a job

depends on the exact nature of the shift, but the presumption is that any such
                                                  9



 change will be of second order in magnitude.5

            Under this well—informed worker hypothesis, it is reasonable to assume

 that a representative searcher's outflow probability
                                                                       is roughly constant
 over time except for random fluctuations. For purposes of empirical testing,

 we use an extreme characterization and identify this hypothesis with a constant

        for all individuals at all moments in time.6           This allows us to address

 the interesting empirical issue of how much of the variation in observed

 unemployment can be explained without resorting to any variation in individual

 in   'S.
            Note that under this hypothesis the rate at which firms make
                                                                              offers has
 little      if any effect on the level of unemployment because the reservation wage

 adjusts as the offer rate changes. The oniy influence of firms on the current

 rate of unemployment is through the rate at which different types of people

 (grouped by their constant
                                     in1)
                                            entered   unemployment in the past. For govern-

ment to influence cyclical unemployment, it must work on the rate at which

people enter unemployment per se, not the demand of firms for new workers.7




     5Note that Burdett and Ondrich (1985) have developed sufficient
conditions to sign the change in in associated with a shift in the offer
distribution. However, these sufficient conditions involve technical condi-
tions about the nature of the offer distribution which are not motivated by
empirical observation. Further, even If the effect can be signed, it still
appears that it is a second order effect relative to the change in the
reservation wage itself.

     6We recognize that asymmetric information may also play an important role
in the determination of layoff rates by firms (Grossman and Hart, 1983). Here
we concentrate on Its alleged role in the determination of        not
     7kgain we suspect that this statement is more nearly correct for search
than for layoff unemployment. Implicitly we are treating an individual as in
one constant in group if search unemployed and in another (empirically
higher) constant              group If layoff unemployed.

Determination of Aggregate Uneploent

        The assumption that an individual's outflow probability              is constant

We    switch to an equality sign to remind us that equation (5) has theoretical

content and is no longer true by the way variables are defined.

       In our (1985) paper we emphasized that predictable changes in the

composition of the unemployed over the business cycle could account for some

of the observed movement in the observed average or aggregate outflow probab—

ility it. Given the current hypothesis,                   movements are explained

entirely by heterogeneity since individual outflow probabilities are constant:

The large theoretical and empirical literature (e.g., Heckman and Borjas              1980,
Topel 1984) on the importance of both observed and unobserved heterogeneity for

explaining individual differences in unemployment durations provides consider-

able guidance for the factors likely to cause variations in             IT1. Worker

characteristics such as age, sex, race, industry, occupation, education, reason

of unemployment have all been shown to he important in microeconomic

contexts. Our innovation is to attempt to explain aggregate movements in

unemployment with such heterogeneity playing a fundamental role. The

difficulty of course is to account for as much of the heterogeneity as possible

  Business Cycles

          In our empirical work we find it useful
                                                                 to distinguish among short—run
 fluctuations in unemployment which we term business cycles, intermediate—run

 movements associated with the pace of structural change in the economy, and

 longer—term trends associated with gradual changes in the demographic makeup

 of the labor force.9 We are interested in
                                                              demonstrating that the simple
 partial adjustment model which equation (5) implicitly imposes on each group

 can in fact explain the type of business cycles which are observed in the

 United States.

      Suppose that there is a constant normal rate                        at which people of
 groups     1.
                 flow into unemployment. This abstracts from growth in the labor

 force, shifts in demographics, and changes in the pace of structural change so

 that we can concentrate on the business cycle per Se. The normal level of

unemployment of group i               is then

     9Structural change is concentrated during recessions since plant closings
which would otherwise occur are accelerated if inventories are high and
poned if inventories are low. However, beyond this                      post-
                                                    bunching phenomenon, we
see protracted periods in which the pace of structural change is particularly
high or low. As discussed below, we associate these

general changes In tastes and technology, wars, and adjustment to changes in

absence of cyclical inflows.

     It is clear that uncorrelated f1 shocks cannot produce the sort of

business cycles with which macroeconomists have traditionally concerned

themselves.'0 With serially correlated        shocks, unemployment falls after

the first month rather than first building up for 6 to 9 months as in the

archetypal hump—shaped business cycle. However, recent Inventory based models

of persistence (e.g., linder and Fischer 1981, Topel 1982 and Haltiwanger and

Maccini 1985) suggest that the buffer stock role of Inventories may help

explain how serially uncorrelated shocks translate into serially correlated

inflows into unemployment. In particular, if firms set prices for longer

periods than our length of observation (a month), then a single period mistake

can lead to growing cyclical inventories over a period of months. Moreover,

firms may spread their adjustment to cyclical inventories over time or indeed

he hit by an aggregate demand shock at different times. Along these lines, it

can be demonstrated that (e.g., Haltiwanger and Maccini 1985) that higher

initial inventories in any given period will lead to a higher probability of

both permanent and temporary layoffs in the period. Hence, persistent and

abnormally high inventories can lead to persistently high probabilities of

permanent and temporary layoffs for several periods. Suppose then that

cyclical Inflows f1 can be described by a first—order autoregressive

 So the innovation
                                       increases unemployment by its full value in the

 current period and by an amount which may be more or less than this value in

 future periods. So long as p and                                 lie strictly between 0 and 1, the
 effect of the Innovation must eventually fall to 0 as can be determined by

 inspection of equation (11). Figure 2 illustrates the effects on                                   of
        = 1   for alternative combinations of                         and   it.   (Convenient units are
chosen so that a standard shock has size 1.) We see that if cyclical inflows

are substantially correlated and the probability of leaving unemployment is not

too high, a single period innovation results in a hump—shaped business cycle.

Our   empirical   work will aim to see whether such values are plausible for the

groups most affected by fluctuations in unemployment over the business cycle.

        The process underlying Figure 2 can be best understood by reference to

equation (8). The change in the number unemployed is the difference between

the cyclical inflow (f) and the outflow probability times lagged cyclical

unemployment (xjsj.1). In Figure 3, these are combined to derive the

adjustment path of unemployment in response to an innovation in                                   at time

surprisingly well at explaining the data as discussed in Section II.

time t,   the extra outflow just offsets the (somewhat attenuated) increased

inflow and unemployment reaches its peak. Thereafter the declining cyclical

inflow is dominated by the outflows and unemployment gradually returns to

normal.

     The geometric decline of f1     reflects the assumed first—order

autoregressive processes. Other processes would modify the diagram in obvious

ways. For example, a persistent increase in plant closings relative to normal

(such as might occur during the shift of resources consequent upon a sustained

appreciation of the dollar) might result in a sustained increase in

such as in Figure 4. Unemployment rises asymptotically to a point where the

increased outflows just balance the increased inflows. Unemployment will

remain at this unusually high level so long as the abnormal inflows continue.

We prefer to differentiate such sustained, intermediate—run changes in

unemployment from the business cycle, however. A business cycle is necessar-

ily transitory and self—limiting while such structural shifts and accompanying

Increased unemployment rates can persist over periods measured in years.'3


     I.C Unemployment Rate Dynamics with Persistent Expectational Errors

     An alternative to the well—informed worker hypothesis is the view that

workers make persistent expectational errors, particularly over the business

cycle. This leads to the characterization of the business cycle found in many

of the leading intermediate macroeconomic texts. That is, when a business

cycle slump hits, workers make persistent expectational errors which causes

the duration and therefore the rate of unemployment to increase. An extreme




     13We shall see below that inflows are abnormally low during wars as few
firms go bankrupt and few Individuals are forced to change jobs. This effect
seems to dwarf the effect of draft—eligible young males being either drafted
or locked into draft—exempt activities.

 view of this persistent expectational error hypothesis is that most of the

 variation in unemployment can be accounted for by variations in individual

        An attractive feature of the unemployment accounting paradigm embodied in

equation (4) is that it allows us to separate out how much of the variation in

unemployment can be attributed to either inflows or outflows. We obtain our

measure of effects of                variations on s by setting                                 in equation

If          were always a constant normal value, equation (13) would yield

Since observed             values are not strictly constant, the                          s implied by
equation (12) generally will deviate from                             according to the history of

     Unfortunately   the decomposition of cyclical unemployment into one

component which can be attributed to movements in group inflows and another

component which can be attributed to movements in group outflow probabilities

is imperfect in several ways. First, it is not exhaustive and a remainder

term reflecting interaction effects of the two sorts of movements might be

substantial. Second, to the extent that available data restrict us to look at

groups which are still heterogeneous with respect to individual       values

(even though more homogeneous than the labor force as a whole), we will

attribute too little explanatory power to movements in inflows and too much to

movements in individual probabilities.'5 This is particularly true if the

marginal n values associated with f1 differ from average ir1 values

associated with f1. (Suppose that group i has a substantial but constant

component of loosely attached churriers" in—and—out of the labor market, but

marginal inflows relate to firmly attached, low—turnover workers.) We view

these limitations as cautions in applying the theory to the exploratory

results reported in the remainder of the paper.

effects implicit in equation (5) and explored at length in our (1985) paper.

                                       It.A Measurement

        To measure unemployment flows, we use the net flow data from the BLS

 Current Population Survey.'6 The measurement of                    and         with the net

 flow data follow the procedures identified in our earlier paper. To briefly

 recount the procedure, we have:

                         it =         (st_s4)/s11
(15)                        =
                                      n
where s1 is the number in group I unemployed in a given month,                              is

the number in group I who have been unemployed "0—4" weeks, and                           is the

number in the labor force. Note that the inflow level for                 group 1, f,
is simply given by s4. Further, the outflow rate,                           is given by
                 where
1Ts1/n                          represents the growth—adjusted probability of exiting

unemployment. Finally, the unemployment rate for group i is simply
                                                                                     s1/n.
        For our analysis in Section I1.B on the aggregate behavior of the inflows

and outflows, we use monthly data on                      and          from 1948:1 to

serious measurement problems. Nevertheless, it would be of considerable
interest to examine the gross flow data In this context which we plan to do in
future research.

                     ILB Aggregate Analysis of ii,    4),   w and u

     We begin our empirical analysis by examining the aggregate data to provide

an initial set of stylized facts on the inflows to and the outflows from

unemployment and their relative importance in explaining overall movements in

unemployment. Our theoretical discussion above indicates that both the level

and the distribution of the flows across heterogeneous groups should be

important in this context. As we will see in Section 1I.C, heterogeneity is

very important. However, for the moment we will focus on the aggregate flows

ignoring heterogeneity issues. This is intended to establish the broad

patterns in the aggregate flows which will be analyzed in detail in the

remainder of the paper.

     Our empirical analysis of the aggregate inflows and the outflows begins

with a simple characterization of the time series properties of these

measures. In Table 1, we report F—tests from bivariate vector autoregressions

of         and      These results indicate that lagged values of each series are

important for explaining the movements in the series itself. More importantly,

we find that lagged values of 4 are important in explaining current move-

ments in         and lagged values of        are important for explaining current

movements in 4, however, the F—statistic in the latter case is the smallest

of those reported. We do not wish to place any causal interpretation on these

results, but they do re—enforce the visual impression from Figure 1 that




     '71n this paper, we use data that has not been seasonally adjusted.
Given that we are measuring inflows and outflows from unemployment, use of
such data makes sense. However the exact role of seasonality needs to be
analyzed carefully at a later date with particular attention played to the
covariance between seasonal and cyclical factors.

increases (decreases) in inflows precede increases (decreases) in outflows.

     In Table 2, univariate representations of         and      are reported. For

both series, we fit a relatively simple multiplicative seasonal model with

ARIMA(l,O,l) for both the seasonal and the non—seasonal specifications. The

purpose of this is not to necessarily produce white noise residuals but rather

to examine how a relatively simple, interpretable process fits the data. From

the results, we observe that all coefficients are highly significant. However,

the reported q—statistics indicate that there is residual unexplained autocor—

relations in both         and . Nevertheless,     the signs of the coefficients

and the reported standard errors indicate that there is significant positive

autocorrelation in both         and       The presence of significant persistence

in      and         is obviously associated with the overall observed persistence

in the unemployment rate. In our earlier paper, we suggested that persistence

in aggregate        and       can be explained without resorting to persistent

expectational errors (at least on the part of workers). Specifically, persist-

ence in aggregate         is at least partially due to heterogeneity and the

resulting sorting that occurs over the cycle. Further, persistence in            is

associated with the buffer stock role of inventories over the cycle. These two

hypotheses will be considered further below.

     Recall that our primary emphasis in this paper is to demonstrate that the

main proximate determinant of changes in the unemployment rate is variations in

the level and distribution of inflows into unemployment. Since we are neglect-

ing measurement of heterogeneity in this section, we cannot directly examine

the role of the distribution of the inflows but rather only the level. We

close this section by examining a variance decomposition of the overall move-

ment of the unemployment rate. Specifically, we are interested in how much of

the variance in overall unemployment can he explained by the constant    iT,

variable        model and how much can be explained by the constant        4),   variable
       model. To accomplish this, we consider the following two different dynamic

simulations. Assuming homogeneous workers, we can derive from (2):

                                 (l.-it)
(16)                  u =    +


where u is the unemployment rate and                is the growth rate of the labor

force.18 We simulate the path of           u under two different assumptions:

first, that        is constant at its mean level with 4)       taking   on its actual

level; second, that         is constant at its mean level with w taking on its

actual level (in both cases,          takes on its actual level). For the vari-

ance decompositions reported in Table 3, we use u in the first month of

1948 to initiate the simulation and then perform dynamic simulations under

these two alternative hypotheses. Two sets of numbers are reported in Table

3. In column (1) of the first row we report the ratio of the variance of the

simulated u with it constant to the variance of the actual u. If we

write u as the sum of the simulated value of Ut plus a residual term,

then the variance of the actual Ut is equal to the sum of the simulated             Ut

variance plus the variance of the residual plus twice the covariance of the

simulated Ut and the residual. These last two terms are reported in columns

(2) and (3) as a fraction of the total variance of u. In the second row, we

repeat the same procedure except we use the simulated Ut with                 constant.

These results indicate that, even without accounting for heterogeneity,




     '81n the empirical analysis that follows, we use the unemployment rate
and the associated inflow and outflow rates rather than the levels which were
used in the theoretical discussion. Since a substantial portion of the
increase in the unemployment level and the inflow level is due to the growth
of the labor force, using levels in our analysis will attribute too much of
the variance to the inflow level. The use of the unemployment rate normalizes
for the size of the labor force.

inflows are at least as important factors as outflows in explaining the

overall variance. That is, 29.4% of the total variance is accounted for by

the constant   it,   variable   inflow model. In contrast, 2(.4% of the variance

can be explained by the constant      4,,   variable    model. We also see that

the residuals and associated covariances are quite important. Given that

these results are based upon aggregate data ignoring heterogeneity and thus

the distribution of the inflows, these results provide preliminary support for

the primary hypothesis stated in the introduction. Namely, that the main

proximate determinant of changes in unemployment is variations in the inflows

into unemployment. We will now explore the role of heterogeneity in this

context. As will become apparent, the results on heterogeneity are of

interest but we are severely constrained in this effort by the limitations

imposed by the available data.


                                 II.C. Heterogeneity

     The preliminary empirical results presented in Section II.B assumed that

workers were homogeneous with respect to the rate of inflow into unemployment,

     and with respect to the probability of leaving unemployment, ii.

However, in our theoretical discussion in Section I we noted that significant

heterogeneity in         would imply that variations in the distribution of the

Inflows are important for explaining movements in the unemployment rate. In

the analysis reported in this section we investigate sources of the heterogen-

eity in it     and    •it• We then use the identified heterogeneity to examine

the hypothesis that both the level and distribution of the inflows are

fundamental for explaining movements in unemployment.

     In Tables 4 through 7 we report values of itt,         and      (these are

computed using equations (14) and (15) and taking sample means) for various

demographic breakdowns of the labor force. The natural rate of

 unemployment, U1,     is   computed as the ratio of                  to it.     It   is difficult

 to summarize all the information contained in these tables, but there are

 several patterns that should be noted. In the age—sex breakdown, reported in

 Table 4, the values of both
                                  it1,    4 and            u decrease with age until

 retirement. There is a particularly large decrease between the early teens

 and the mid—20's as young workers become attached to the labor force and gain

 labor market experience. The decrease in                     reflects the fact that
 decreases in       are generally larger proportionally than those in
The values of both          and          are larger for women than for men, given age.

     Table 5 shows a breakdown of the labor force by reason of unemployment.

The probability of exiting unemployment is highest for those on temporary layoff

(except for females) and lowest for those permanently laid off. Both females

and teens have a high inflow rate into non—layoff unemployment. Prime—aged

males enter into all three unemployment states at approximately equal rates.

     In Tables 6 and 7 we report the values of                       and       for industry and

occupation respectively. The values of
                                                     it1
                                                            tend to be low in manufacturing

and construction, and high in non—industrial sectors of the economy.                      In

construction and agriculture, 4           Is   very high as one would expect given the

usually temporary nature of the employment contract in these industries.

Combined with relatively low values of
                                                 it1,
                                                            the result is a high natural rate
of unemployment. In typically white collar sectors of the economy, such as

finance, Insurance, and real estate               is relatively low. This corresponds
to a low        for professionals and managers. Further,                       is low for

professionals, managers and persons in crafts ——               all   of whom have rather

though each spell tends to be longer.
 specific human capital.

      In these tables we have broken the labor force into various categories to

 see if any broad patterns emerge. Although a wide variety of types of workers

 are evident, typically one sees          decrease with any form of attachment to
 the labor force ——   particularly   with specificity in human capital due to age

 or occupation. Low values of           are usually accompanied by low values of

     except for those workers involved in occupations that have employment

 arrangements with short—term firm—worker relationships.

     Given that these preliminary results do indicate that there is significant

heterogeneity in Wft,      it   remains to be seen whether there is significant

variation in the distribution of the inflows over time and over the cycle. In

Tables 8—10 we present the correlations of the overall unemployment rate with

the unemployment shares for various breakdowns of the labor force.      The

numbers in Table 8 are quite provocative. The groups which tend to increase

their share of unemployment when there is an overall increase in the

unemployment rate are male workers aged 20—34, female workers of the same age,

and females aged 55—64. Popular belief is that teenagers bear the brunt of

unemployment, but this table demonstrates that non—teenage young workers who

are relatively inexperienced but probably beginning to be strongly attached to

the labor force feel the impact most severely, and that experienced workers

seem to be relatively protected. It is important to note that these are

correlations of shares and so all groups may in fact be increasing in numbers

of unemployed and unemployment rates. Those groups with positive correlations

are suffering a disproportionate impact of the business cycle. Table 9

presents similar numbers for a partition of the labor force by age, sex, and

reason of unemployment. This table indicates that increases in the uneruploy—

ment rate come through increases in layoffs. The strongest positive

 correlation is for permanent layoffs of prime—aged men.      Temporary layoffs of

 the same group also play a strong role and another channel for adjustment is

 permanent layoffs of females. Note that the share of temporary layoffs of

 females and layoffs of teens have a weak negative correlation with the

 unemployment rate. Table 10 reports the same correlations for industry and

occupation. The industries that are thought to be cyclically sensitive are

 those which are disportionately affected —    mining,   durable manufacturing,

construction, and transportation. Craft workers and operatives are the

occupation categories that exhibit a positive correlation between unemployment

shares and the overall unemployment rate. The story one is tempted to tell

from these three tables is that the business cycle has a disproportionate

impact on industries whose labor force is comprised primarily of blue collar

workers. Typically the adjustment is made through layoffs, and given the

heavily unionized nature of these industries, the youngest workers are first

laid off. The older a worker is, the more insulated he is from the business

cycle. Thus, we see young workers who are just becoming attached to the labor

force to be the most vulnerable to the business cycle. On an age—sex break-

down alone, this runs counter to the intuition that we expect to see a

preponderance of low—it workers when the overall unemployment rate is high.

However, if we look at the other breakdowns —— by reason, by occupation, and

by industry —   it   is the low—n workers who have a positive correlation of

unemployment share with overall unemployment rate.

     As always, however, correlations do not give us any information about

causality. We would expect to see a larger share of low—it workers if the

recession had a more severe impact on sectors of the economy where those

laborers were employed. That is the story we just told. However, as we

showed in our (1985) paper, if there were heterogeneity in          and if an

 initial perturbation in      resulted in an equiproportionate increase in

 inflow rates       for all groups, as the unemployment rate began to return to

 its natural level, low—w workers would be a larger fraction of the labor force

since they take longer to return to normal levels of unemployment.   Thus,

differential impact of the business cycle is not necessary to cause the

correlations that we saw in the last three tables. Nevertheless, independent

of causality considerations, we have seen that there exists significant

heterogeneity in inflow and outflow rates as well as significant variations in

the shares over time.

     We now attempt to use this disaggregated data to consider the primary

hypothesis of this paper. That is, it is primarily variations In the level

and distribution of the inflows which account for the variation in the

unemployment rate. Unfortunately, we do not have this data for a long time

period, nor do we have cross tabulations simultaneously breaking down the data

by age, sex, reason, Industry, and occupation.

     Our initial analysis using the disaggregated data does not attempt to use

all of the information simultaneously but rather uses each breakdown

independently. These results are reported in Table 11. Following the same

methodology discussed in Section II.'B, we ran simulations of disaggregated

unemployment rates with the disaggregated data holding   iT   and

constant in turn, aggregating by appropriate labor force shares, and then

doing a variance decomposition of the movements in the unemployment rate. In

the leftmost column of Table 11 we note the type of heterogeneity assumed in

each of the separate simulations. These results indicate that the variance

decomposition depends critically on the source of the heterogeneity. We do

find that the variation in the level and distribution of the inflows is the

primary determinant of variations in unemployment for temporary and permanent

 significant heterogeneity which is not taken into account. The reported

 values for the ,'s by reason and the fluctuations of shares by reason over

 the cycle indicate that accounting for variation in the composition of

 unemployment by reason is an important source of heterogeneity.         Since the

 age—sex, industry, and occupation decompositions do not take unemployment by

 reason into account, it is not surprising that the constant
                                                                     1T hypothesis
 does relatively worse under these sources of heterogeneity.2

       The results in Table 11 take heterogeneity into account, but only in a

 limited fashion. To take into account all of the available information on

heterogeneity, we pursue the following strategy. Recall that aggregate i

and aggregate       are determined by:


(17)                      =   E
                      t
                              i   s_1   t



(18)                      =




     20The reason that we separate out these by reason categories is that
aggregation of the simulated values by reason involves labor force shares and
obviously labor force shares by reason are relatively ill defined. For
example, the share of the labor force that are temporarily laid off is ill
defined compared to, say, the share of the labor force who are 16—19 males.

       21Duration dependence may also be a source of deviations of             from
its natural level. A large statistical literature has been developed
regarding the observable distinction between unobserved heterogeneity and
state dependence (Hecknian and Singer, 1984). Our data does not allow such a
distinction.

Equations (17) and (18) indicate that variations in aggregate         it   and   4) will

depend on both variations in unemployment shares and labor force shares,

respectively, as well as factors that induce variations in individual r arid

 4. Following the specification in our (1985) paper, we estimate regressions

for aggregate     it   and    4) along these lines. In particular, as explanatory

variables for     ir we include lagged unemployment shares by age—sex, by reason

of unemployment, by industry, and by occupation and we include a 12 'nonth dis-

tributed lag of innovations En the inventory—sales ratio to capture cyclical

variations in the individual ,r1's. Similarly, as explanatory variables for

4) we include labor force shares by age—sex, industry, and occupation and the

distributed lag of innovations in the inventory/sales ratio. For the sake of

brevity, these results are not reported here. However, note that we find that

the share variables are significant for explaining variations in aggregate           it



and   4),   whereas the distributed lag on Inventory/sales innovations are not.22

      We then used the estimated coefficients from these regressions to produce

estimates of     it and      4) that would vary solely due to variations in the




     22That the coefficients on the distributed lag on inventory/sales
innovations are insignificant as a group is somewhat puzzling since it
contrasts with the results reported in our (1985) paper. However, in that
paper, we did not utilize the detailed breakdowns of unemployment by age, sex,
reason, industry and occupation and as such w were able to use a data set for
a much longer time period (1954:8 to 1983:12). Moreover, we used seasonally
adjusted data in that paper in the equivalent regressions (at least partly
because the inventory/sales data are available only on a seasonally adjusted
basis.) In this paper, we again use seasonally adjusted inventory/sales data
but seasonally unadjusted unemployment and labor force series for the regres-
sion results (as well as all of the other results) reported in the text.
Preliminary regression analysis using seasonally adjusted it's and 's as
dependent variables indicates that this is probably the source of the discrep-
ancy. That is, we find that using the same period but seasonally adjusted
data yields coefficients on the distributed lag on inventory/sales innovations
that are significant at the 0.001 level. A complete analysis of the role of
seasonality in this context is beyond the scope of this paper but is obviously
worth exploring in future research.

 composition of unemployment and of the labor force, but not due to variations

 upon share variations alone, we simulated unemployment in two ways in a manner

 similar to that used above. That is, we first simulated
                                                                         unemployment using
 actual     and the predicted        it   based upon share variations alone and then we

 simulated unemployment using actual          it    and the predicted         based upon the
 share variations alone. tn this manner, we have incorporated all of the

 available information on heterogeneity to predict how unemployment would vary

 for constant        and how unemployment would vary for constant
                                                                                   q1.
      The resulting variance decompositions from these simulations are
                                                                       reported
 in Table 12. We find that most of the variance of the actual unemployment

 rate can be accounted for by the constant              it    model.   That is, approximately
90% of the total variance in unemployment can be explained by variations in

the level and distribution of the inflows. It is of course interesting that

the constant
                     simulated unemployment rate can explain close to 60% of the

total variance in unemployment. However, this is not inconsistent with the

hypothesis that It is primarily the level and the distribution of the inflows

that explains unemployment. We know from the regression results that

variations In aggregate      ii   are influenced significantly by variations in the

unemployment shares. Since the constant                      simulated unemployment rate uses
the actual aggregate    it
                             values, this implies that the distribution of the

inflows and the resulting variation in unemployment shares plays a significant

role in helping explain the total variance with the constant                        simulated

unemployment rate. Overall, these results provide substantial support for the

hypothesis that the main proximate determinant of unemployment is variations

in the level and distribution of inflows into unemployment.

                              IV.   Concluding Remarks
     Much of the emphasis in explaining unemployment in the macroeconomics

literature has focused on the role of expectational errors by workers.    In

this paper, we develop an unemployment accounting paradigm that allows us to

quantify how much of the variance in unemployment can be accounted for by the

expectational error hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the emphasis on

expectational errors by workers has been misplaced. We find that most of the

variation in unemployment can be explained by variations in the level and

distribution of the inflows into unemployment, while assuming that individual

outflow rates are constant. We point out that constant individual outflow

rates is precisely the result one would expect from job search theory with

well informed workers. Further, we use recent inventory based models of

persistence to suggest that even in the face of relatively constant individual

outflow rates one may still expect to observe persistent cyclical variations

in inflow rates.

     Our results are more suggestive than conclusive but they do indicate

fruitful directions for future research. We see four main goals for future

research: (a) Extend our ability to differentiate between unobserved

hetrogeneiry and persistent deviations in individual         values from their

normal levels. (b) Develop models to explain the disaggregated behavior of

     values. These models should in principle provide structural linkages to

changes in tastes and technology, monetary and fiscal policy, exchange rate

movements, and wars. As we showed in our theoretical development, a constant

         variable      model can go a long way towards capturing typical hump—

shaped    cyclical movements in the unemployment rate. Thus, theoretical and

empirical models that explain persistent deviations in inflow rates will be

quite fruitful in understanding unemployment rate dynamics over the cycle.

(c) Develop models to explain the residual movements in       U they prove
significant. (d) Combine these results to produce a structural model which

improves our ability to understand and forecast movements in aggregate and

disaggregated unemployment rates.
