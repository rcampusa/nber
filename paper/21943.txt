                                           ABSTRACT

We study the information aggregation properties of unanimous voting rules in the laboratory. In line
with theoretical predictions, we find that majority rule with veto power dominates unanimity rule.
We also find that the strategic voting model is a fairly good predictor of observed subject behavior.
There are, however, cases where organizing the data seems to require a mix of strategic and sincere
voting. This pattern of behavior would imply that the way majority rule with veto power is framed
may significantly affect the outcome of the vote. Our data strongly supports such an hypothesis.

1       Introduction

In many sensitive situations, group decisions are required to be unanimous. Examples
include a number of international organizations that would not exist without granting
some sort of veto power to their members.1 They also include partnerships and other
unlimited liability companies, and criminal trials by jury in the US. What voting system
is best in such situations?
    When agents have no uncertainty about their preferred alternative, all unanimous
rules are equivalent – a proposal to reform the status quo is only accepted if it is Pareto
improving (Wicksell 1967 [1896] and Buchanan and Tullock 1962). Unanimous rules are,
however, not equivalent when agents are uncertain about the merits of a proposal and
share common objectives. This is because voting then ought to aggregate the information
dispersed among agents. The problem is that unanimous decision making is believed to
aggregate information poorly (Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998, Guarnaschelli, McKelvey,
and Palfrey 2000).2 This raises the question of whether a group necessarily sacri…ces
information aggregation when it grants veto power to its members.
    In this paper, we compare the performance, in the laboratory, of two of the most widely
used unanimous rules: unanimity rule and majority rule with veto power (henceforth
Unanimity and Veto).3 Under Unanimity, agents must consent or dissent. The reform is
then adopted if and only if no one dissents. In contrast, under Veto, agents can consent,
dissent, or veto. The proposal is then accepted provided that no one vetoes and a (simple
or quali…ed) majority consents. The main di¤erence is that under Unanimity agents cannot
convey negative information about the reform without blocking it altogether. The intense
debate during the early years of the United Nations Security Council on the impossibility
of dissenting without vetoing illustrates that this di¤erence is far from innocuous (Sievers
and Daws 2014).
    And indeed, we …nd that, in contrast to Unanimity, Veto consistently aggregates in-

      Coughlan (2001), Persico (2004), and Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe (2015), however, high-
light cases where unanimous decision making features good information aggregation properties.
    3
      Among international organizations, for example, Unanimity is used by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), the European Council (for most sensitive topics, excluding Common Foreign and
Security Policy), and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur). In contrast, Veto (or a close variation) is
used by the European Council (for the Common Foreign and Security Policy), the United Nations Security
Council, the ALADI, the CARICOM, and others.


                                                   2
formation well. Hence, our …ndings provide empirical support to our previous theoretical
result that Veto Pareto dominates Unanimity (Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe
2015). This provides a rationale for the use of Veto in practice and sheds light on the
evolution of decision-making practices in the United Nations Security Council and the
Council of the European Union. It also suggests that it would be bene…cial for voting
bodies that currently use Unanimity to adopt Veto instead.
    Our experiment design follows the typical setup considered in the information aggre-
gation voting literature. There are two possible states of the world (Red or Blue). Agents
observe a binary private signal (red or blue) that is correlated with the realized state.
They have a common objective: they are all rewarded if the group decision (Red or Blue)
matches the state (decision Red represents the status quo).4 To make the group decision,
they hold a simultaneous vote according to a pre-speci…ed voting rule.
    Theoretically, the welfare performance of these voting rules depends on the information
structure. To understand this idea, note that under both rules, any single agent can enforce
the status quo. When the red signal is su¢ ciently informative (relative to the blue signal),
both rules are e¢ cient. This is because enforcing the status quo when observing a red
signal is then a weakly dominant strategy. Information aggregation is therefore trivial.
When the red signal is not very informative, information aggregation is a more subtle
problem. As soon as this is the case, Veto outperforms Unanimity, because it o¤ers the
possibility of revealing a negative signal without pinning down the outcome.
    Accordingly, we consider two treatments that span these two situations. In the …rst
treatment (which corresponds to the latter case), the two signals are equally informative
(as in Feddersen and Pesendorfer, 1998, and Guarnaschelli, McKelvey and Palfrey, 2000).
Hence we expect Veto to perform as well as majority rule (henceforth Majority, which we
include in the comparison given its good information properties) and to strictly dominate
Unanimity. In the second treatment (biased signals), the red signal is much more infor-
mative than the blue one, and thus we expect Veto to perform as well as Unanimity and
expect both to strictly dominate Majority.
    As mentioned above, our main …nding is that Veto dominates Unanimity in the labo-

   4
     Assuming that all agents behave strategically, the potential presence of agents that prefer the status
quo for private reasons neither a¤ects the comparison of unanimous rules nor the behavior of common
value agents (Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe 2015).


                                                    3
ratory. When signals are equally informative, we …nd that groups using Veto do as well
as those using Majority, and that they make about a third the number of mistakes as
those who use Unanimity. This di¤erence is due to a dramatic reduction of type II errors.
That is, using Veto makes it much less likely that agents will reject a good reform (or in
the typical jury interpretation, acquit a guilty defendant). When the signals are strongly
biased, we …nd that performances under Veto and Unanimity do not di¤er signi…cantly
(and both rules largely dominate Majority). Our data therefore provides strong empirical
support for the theoretical predictions.
    We then analyze subject behavior in detail. This is important because, unless we
can convince ourselves that the model is a su¢ ciently good predictor of subject behavior,
we can hardly extrapolate our welfare results to variations in group size and information
structure, for instance, let alone draw policy implications. Overall, we …nd that the model
predicts subject behavior fairly well.
    However, it is important to stress that deviations from model predictions (even by a
very limited proportion of agents) can have a decisive impact on outcomes when unanimous
rules are used. From a welfare point of view, it seems therefore crucial that veto power
be used strategically and not merely because it is “focal”. This implies that the way Veto
is framed can signi…cantly a¤ect the outcome of the vote. We test such an hypothesis by
considering a rule that di¤ers from Veto only in the way actions are labeled. This rule is
unanimity rule under the constructive abstention regime, i.e. abstention is allowed but a
majority of yeses is required for the proposal to be accepted. Our …ndings strongly support
this hypothesis. When the rule is such that some votes have more weight than others, one
must be very careful in choosing which is the focal vote.
    To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the …rst to compare the information ag-
gregation properties of di¤erent unanimous voting rules in the laboratory. In addition,
it contributes to the experimental literature on information aggregation in three ways.
First, in the strand of papers that study unbiased information structures, it adds Veto to
the comparison between Unanimity and Majority (see Guarnaschelli, McKelvey, and Pal-
frey 2000, and subsequent papers such as Goeree and Yariv 2011).5 Second, to the strand
   5
     Overall, the experimental literature on information aggregation in committees has been growing in
recent years. See, for instance, Battaglini, Morton and Palfrey (2010), Morton and Tyran (2011), Bhat-
tacharya, Du¤y and Kim (2013), Grosser and Seebauer (2013), Fehrler and Hughes (2014), Herrera,
Llorente-Saguer and McMurray (2015), Le Quement and Marcin (2015), and Mattozzi and Nakaguma

that studies biased information structures, it adds the case where Unanimity theoretically
dominates Majority. Finally, it is the …rst that considers framing issues in a Condorcet
Jury context.
    Veto power has been studied and compared in private value environments. Papers in
that literature include Wilson and Herzberg (1987), Haney, Herzberg and Wilson (1992),
Kagel, Sung, and Winter (2010), Battaglini, Nunnari, and Palfrey (2012), and Nunnari
(2014). In this literature, veto right constrains the set of implementable policies (by
eliminating policies that are not favored by the voters with veto rights). In common-
value environments such as ours, agents do not use veto for their purely private bene…t.
Instead, vetoing is a way to convey very strong negative information about the reform. The
existence of such strongly negative signals can be very useful to information aggregation.6


2     Theory

2.1   The Model

A group of n     3 agents (with n odd)7 must vote over two possible alternatives, B (Blue)
and R (Red).

Information structure. There are two states of nature, ! 2 f! B ; ! R g, which materialize
with equal probability. The actual state of nature is not observable, but each agent
privately observes an imperfectly informative signal: either sB or sR (the blue or red
signal, respectively). Conditional on the state of nature, the signals are independently
drawn. The probability that an agent will observe signal sB is higher in state ! B than in
state ! R ; and the converse is true for sR . We denote the probability of receiving signal s
in state ! by Pr (sj!) :

Preferences. Agents have common value: they all prefer decision R in state ! R and B in




(2015).
    6
      Note that in our companion paper we consider both private and common value motives (Bouton,
Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe 2015).
    7
      That n is odd only simpli…es the exposition.


                                               5
state ! B . We capture this with the following von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function:
                                                 State of the world
                                                  !R           !B
                          Group         R          1            0
                         Decision       B          0            1


Voting systems. The group makes a decision by taking a simultaneous vote. We consider
three voting systems: Majority with Veto power (V ), Unanimity (U ), and Majority (M ). A
voting system     2 fU; M; V g is de…ned as a set of possible actions A and an aggregation
rule d   that maps agents’actions into a group decision: d : fa 2 A gn ! fB; Rg. We
denote by Xa the total number of agents playing action a. Agents do not communicate
before making their decision.

De…nition 1 Voting system “Veto” is de…ned by: V            fAV ; dV g, where:


                          AV    = fb; r; vg
                                  8
                                  < B if Xv = 0 and X > Xr
                                                      b
                          dV    =
                                  : R       otherwise.

   The group decision is B if and only if no one plays v and there is a majority that plays
b. The decision is R otherwise. Hence, we interpret b as a vote for B (we sometimes refer
to it as a vote “for Blue”), r as a vote for R (or “for Red”), and v as a veto (“against
Blue”). To highlight the di¤erences and similarities between the voting systems, it is
convenient to de…ne Unanimity and Majority using the same aggregation rule as in the
de…nition above (dV ) and to label the di¤erent actions in a similar fashion. (See BLM for
a discussion.)

De…nition 2 Voting system “Unanimity” is de…ned by: U               fAU ; dU g, where:
AU = fb; vg      AV and dU = dV , with Xr necessarily equal to 0.

   Under Unanimity, voters can play b (vote for Blue) or v (veto Blue). The group decision
is Blue if and only if everyone plays b (votes for Blue).

De…nition 3 Voting system “Majority” is de…ned by: M            fAM ; dM g, where
AM = fb; rg      AV and dM = dV , with Xv necessarily equal to 0.

                                             6
    Under Majority, voters can play b (vote for Blue) or play r (vote for Red). The group
decision is Blue if and only if there are strictly more votes for Blue than for Red.

Strategy and equilibrium concept.                  Formally, we de…ne an agent’s strategy as a
function      : fsB ; sR g ! 4 (A ) : In particular,       a (s)   denotes the probability with which
an agent who receives signal s plays a. Following Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1998), we
focus on responsive symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria.8

Right Decision. If agents would observe all signals, they would agree on what the right
(i.e., e¢ cient) decision is.

De…nition 4 The right decision maximizes agents’expected utility given the realized sig-
nal pro…le.


2.2     Equilibrium Analysis and Welfare Properties

In Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe (2015), we characterize the equilibrium un-
der Veto in a more general version of the model.9 A key aspect of the welfare analysis
is that unanimous rules should be compared according to their information aggregation
properties. In this paper, we focus on two representative cases: one in which Unanimity
aggregates information well and one in which it aggregates it poorly. Veto, to the contrary,
does well in both cases.


2.2.1    Unbiased signals

First, we consider a case where blue and red signals are equally informative (i.e. Pr (sB j! B ) =
Pr(sR j! R )). This facilitates comparisons with the literature, since this case corresponds
to that originally studied by Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1998) and then taken to the lab-
oratory by Guarnaschelli, McKelvey, and Palfrey (2000). In this case, the right decision
is simply the one that corresponds to the majority of signals.



    8
      In our context, a responsive pro…le is such that (i) at least some common value agents play action
b with positive probability, and (ii) not all of them play b with probability 1. This ensures that, in
equilibrium, some pivot probabilities are strictly positive –agents a¤ect the outcome of the vote with
positive probability.
    9
      That is, we consider all admissible parameters and we allow for the presence of private value agents.

      and     b (sR )   =   where   =                                                n        !             2 (0; 1);

                                                                     Pr(sB j! R )


      The two equilibria above are the only equilibria under Veto.

Proof. Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1998) establishes the result for Majority (see Appendix B)
and Unanimity (see p. 26). Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe (2015) establishes the result

for Veto (Proposition 2).

   Under Majority, an agent is pivotal only if there is a tie without his vote. Assume
that agents play b when they receive a blue signal and r when they receive a red signal.
An agent is then pivotal when, without counting his own vote, there is a tie between red
and blue signals. Since the signals are equally informative, and agents dislike both types
of errors equally, the best response is to vote according to the color of his signal. Such a
strategy pro…le aggregates information perfectly in the sense that it maximizes expected
utility. The group thus always ends up making the right decision, and there is no incentive
to deviate.
   Under Unanimity, agents are only pivotal if all other agents play b. Assume that agents
who observe the blue signal play b and agents with a red signal play v. Now, consider the
strategic position of an agent with a red signal. Given the assumption, this agent can only
be pivotal if all other agents have received a blue signal. Her posterior beliefs therefore
combine her own red signal with the n         1 blue signals of other agents. That constitutes
a vast majority of blue signals; the agent should conclude that it is much more likely that
we are in the blue state (! B ). The best response is therefore to play b, and such a strategy
pro…le cannot be an equilibrium. In equilibrium, agents with a blue signal always play
b, but agents with a red signal mix between b and v (probability                                  is such that she is
indi¤erent between the two). Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1998), who …rst derived this
result, have shown that such an equilibrium does not always lead to the right decision.
   Under Veto, there are two equilibria. The …rst equilibrium mimics the equilibrium
under Majority. The idea is simply that this equilibrium is still feasible (the actions are

                                                  8
available) and always leads to the right decision. There is therefore no incentive for an
agent to deviate (recall that they have a common objective). The second equilibrium
mimics that under Unanimity. Again, this is feasible because all actions are available.
The reason that there is no incentive to deviate is that a deviation by a single agent
cannot improve the outcome. When no other agent ever plays b (which is the case in this
equilibrium), playing b becomes strategically equivalent to playing r; a single vote for R
(instead of B) cannot change the group decision. Thus the equilibrium under Unanimity
must be an equilibrium under Veto.


2.2.2        Biased signals

Second, we look at a case where Unanimity is e¢ cient, but Majority performs badly. This
happens when the red signal is precise enough that a benevolent dictator would choose R
unless all signals are blue. In this case, the right decision is B if and only if all signals are
blue.

                                                                                               b                  r

Proof. See Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe (2015) for Veto (Proposition 2) and Unanim-
ity (Supplementary Appendix). See Appendix A1 for Majority.


   Here the red signal is so precise (relative to the blue one) that one red signal is su¢ cient
information to conclude that decision R is better than decision B (even if all other signals
are blue). Hence, under both Unanimity and Veto, agents who receive a red signal must
play v. Taking this into account, an agent with a blue signal will optimally choose to vote
blue; as a result, B will be chosen only when all agents have received the blue signal. In this



                                                   9
equilibrium, the group always ends up making the decision that an informed benevolent
dictator would have taken.
    Under Majority, agents who receive a red signal cannot enforce option R (because
playing v is not allowed). They will thus play r. Taking this into account, agents with
blue signals prefer to downweigh them and play r with positive probability. Doing so,
they “compensate”for the relative imprecision of the blue signal. In this equilibrium, the
group does not always make the informed benevolent dictator’s decision.


2.2.3    Welfare

Our welfare criterion is an agent’s ex-ante utility. Given that agents equally dislike both
types of errors, it corresponds to the ex-ante probability of choosing R in state ! R and B
in state ! B :

De…nition 5 A voting system           (strictly) dominates another voting system         0,   if there
exists an equilibrium under        in which the probability of making the right decision is
(strictly) higher than in all equilibria under        0.



    The following proposition captures the dominance of Veto over Unanimity and Major-
ity very well (see Bouton, Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe (2015) for a thorough welfare
analysis).

Proposition 1 For all n, Veto dominates both Unanimity and Majority. It strictly domi-
nates Unanimity when signals are unbiased, and it dominates Majority in the biased signal
case.

Proof. The proof of the …rst part is based on McLennan (1998). First, note that any strategy
pro…le in Majority or Unanimity can be reproduced under Veto. This is because Veto’s action set

includes those of the other systems. Second, recall from McLennan (1998) that, in a pure common

value environment, a strategy pro…le that maximizes ex-ante utility must be an equilibrium. Since

the aggregation rules are the same, it follows that there cannot exist an equilibrium under Majority

or Unanimity that yields a strictly higher utility than the one that produces the highest utility

under Veto. The strict dominance of Veto over Majority in the biased case also follows, because

the unique equilibrium under Majority is not an equilibrium under Veto. The strict dominance


                                                 10
of Veto (and Majority) over Unanimity when signals are unbiased has been proven in Bouton,

Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe (2015) (and Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998).


2.2.4       Sincere voting and framing

Sincere Voting. To analyze departures from strategic behavior, it is worth discussing
the notion of “sincere voting”, which is often used in the literature. In a related paper,
Austen-Smith and Banks (1996) describe sincere voting as “an individual’s optimal voting
decision based solely on her own private information”. That is, agents vote sincerely if
they select “the alternative yielding their highest expected payo¤ conditional on their own
signal ”.
    In our setup, contrarily to theirs, such a de…nition of sincere voting does not nail
down the agents’ choice of action under Veto. If they receive a blue signal, voting b is
the unambiguous sincere action, according to the de…nition. If they receive a red signal,
however, there are two candidates for the sincere action: r or v; which both favor R.
    This ambiguity leaves the door open to di¤erent de…nitions. One of them is what
we call label-sincere voting, whereby label-sincere voters are a¤ected by the focality of an
action’s label –i.e., the focal action for decision R is r.10 Given the way we have de…ned
Veto, this corresponds to a vote for R. But as we show below, we could have equally framed
the voting system in such a way that playing r would amount to vetoing B. Framing issues
are, therefore, potentially relevant.

Framing. We can formalize Unanimity rule under the constructive abstention regime
(henceforth Constructive Abstention) as follows.

De…nition 6 Voting system “Constructive Abstention”(CA) is de…ned by: V                        fACA ; dCA g,
where ACA = fb; c; rg and             8
                                      < B if Xr = 0 and X > Xc
                                                          b
                              dCA   =
                                      : R       otherwise.

    Even though other voting bodies have already used this system, we named it after the
notion of constructive abstention introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam (see Bouton,

  10
     An alternative de…nition would be that sincere voters vote for the strongest action that favors their
most preferred outcome (based on their own information). Here, this would correspond to playing v when
receiving a red signal.


                                                   11
Llorente-Saguer, and Malherbe 2015).
    In the language of this voting system, playing b equals a vote for B, playing c equals
an abstention, and playing r equals a vote for R. The group decision is B if and only if
(i) no one plays r and (ii) more agents play b than c:
    CA is in fact isomorphic to Veto. Action b is the same under both mechanisms, action
c under CA corresponds to action r under V , and action r under CA corresponds to action
v under V . In our wording, playing c is in fact a vote for R, and playing r is a veto (against
Blue). To avoid confusion, we will stick to this terminology (vote for Blue, vote for Red,
veto Blue).
    Given this, V and CA lead to identical outcomes in the context of the strategic voting
model studied above. However, if (some) agents depart from strategic voting, Veto and
Constructive Abstention may lead to di¤erent behavior and outcomes. As implied above,
under the label-sincere voting assumption, the focal action for R (which is still r) now
corresponds to a veto. Since a veto nails down the group decision, framing may dramati-
cally impact the system performance and is worth testing in the laboratory. Throughout
the remainder of the paper, we refer to label-sincere voting simply as sincere voting.


3     The Experiment

3.1   Design and Procedures

To test our theoretical predictions and potential framing e¤ects, we ran controlled labo-
ratory experiments. Experiments were conducted at the BonnEconLab at the University
of Bonn between June and September 2012. We ran a total of 48 sessions, each comprised
of 18 subjects. No subject participated in more than one session. Students were recruited
through the online recruitment system ORSEE (Greiner 2004), and the experiment was
programmed and conducted using the software z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007).
    Subjects were introduced to a game with the same structure as the one presented
in Section 2.1. Following the experimental literature on the Condorcet Jury Theorem
initiated by Guarnaschelli, McKelvey, and Palfrey (2000), we did not refer to states of
the world or signals but to jars and balls respectively. There were two jars, the blue jar
(representing state ! B ) and the red jar (representing state ! R ). Each jar contained a total



                                              12
of 100 red and blue balls. The proportion of red and blue balls in each jar varied across
treatments.
   Each time the game was played, one of the jars was randomly selected with equal
probability by the computer. The subjects were not told which jar had been selected, but
they were privately shown a ball randomly and independently drawn from the selected jar.
Hence, a blue ball corresponds to sB and a red ball corresponds to sR . After seeing their
ball, the subjects had to vote. The possible votes and the aggregation rule varied across
treatments.
   If the group decision matched the color of the jar, the payo¤ for all members of the
group was 100 talers. Otherwise, it was 10 talers.
   We had two treatment variables, which led to a 2     4 design and eight di¤erent treat-
ments. The …rst variable was the voting rule. We experimented using the four voting rules
described above: Unanimity (U), Majority (M), Veto (V), and Constructive Abstention
(CA). Their framing was the following. To vote, subjects had to click a button of their
choice. In U treatments, voters had to choose between “blue” and “red”. The group
decision (that is, the jar that was selected by aggregating the votes) was Blue if and only
if all subjects played blue. In M treatments, subjects also had to choose between blue
and red, but the group decision was the jar whose color had received the most votes. In
V treatments, on top of blue and red, subjects could choose to “veto blue”. If a subject
vetoed, the group decision was the Red jar. If nobody vetoed, the group decision was the
jar whose color had received the most votes. In CA treatments, subjects had to choose
between blue, red, and abstain. If a subject played red, the group decision was the Red
jar. If nobody played red, the group decision was the Blue jar, as long as there were more
votes for Blue than abstentions.
   The second variable that varied across treatments was the information structure –the
likelihood of getting the right signal in either state. In Setting 1 (the unbiased case),
this likelihood was the same in both states: Pr (sB j! B ) = Pr (sR j! R ) = 0:7. In Set-
ting 2 (biased case), signal precision di¤ered. The red signal was much more precise:
Pr (sB j! B ) = 0:99 and Pr (sR j! R ) = 0:3.
   We ran six sessions for each treatment. Each session consisted of 50 rounds played by
the same 18 subjects. In each round, these subjects were randomly split into two groups



                                                13
of 9, and the game was played separately in each group. Table 1 provides an overview of
the di¤erent treatments.

                               Table 1: Treatment overview.



   All experimental sessions were organized along the same procedure: subjects received
detailed written instructions, which an instructor read aloud (see Appendix A4). Before
starting the experiment, students were asked to answer a questionnaire to con…rm their
full understanding of the experimental design. After the questionnaire, subjects began to
play. At the end of each round, each subject received the following information: (i) the
jar that was selected by the computer, (ii) the group decision, (iii) the number of votes
for each alternative, and (iv) their payo¤ for that period.
   To determine payment at the end of the experiment, the computer randomly selected
…ve periods; the total amount of talers earned in these periods was converted to euros
with a conversion rate of 0.025. In total, subjects earned an average of 12.99e, including
a show-up fee of 3e. Each experimental session lasted approximately 45 minutes.


3.2   Equilibrium Predictions and alternative

Equilibrium strategies. Table 2 summarizes the predictions of behavior drawn from
Lemmas 1 and 2. In the unbiased signal case, there are 2 equilibria under V and CA. In
the table below, and henceforth, when we refer to the model predictions, we assume that
agents coordinate on the Pareto dominant equilibrium.

action for each signal (ball) received, voting rule, and setting.


Sincere voting. As explained above, the sincere voting hypothesis assumes that subjects
vote for the action with the name of the color of the signal. Note that this implies identical
predictions in the unbiased and biased signal case. Table 3 summarizes the predictions.

4    Experiment: Results and Analysis

The main purpose of this section is to present an empirical analysis of the dominance
of Veto over Unanimity. First, we compare average payo¤s and information aggrega-
tion scores. Second, we delve into subject behavior to assess whether the results can be
attributed to the di¤erences in behavior predicted by the model and/or alternative hy-
potheses such as sincere voting. Finally, we explore the framing e¤ects by comparing the
results under Constructive Abstention with those under Veto.
    All non-parametric tests presented within the paper are two-sided and use averages



                                             15
at the matching group level as their unit of analysis. To allow for learning in the initial
periods, this section will focus on the second half of the experiment –that is, we present
and analyze the data from rounds 26 through 50. Unless stated explicitly, our statements
about statistical signi…cance are robust to considering the whole sample.


4.1     Does Veto dominate Unanimity –and if so, why?

4.1.1    Unbiased signal structure

Payo¤s. Table 4 displays realized average payo¤s under the two rules and compares
them to the model predictions and those under the sincere voting hypothesis. The results
and predictions under Majority are also displayed as a point of comparison. To facilitate
interpretation, we present payo¤s in terms of the probability of making a mistake (and
hence receiving the lower payo¤).

                               Experiment     Model predictions      Sincere voting
             Veto                    12:7                   9.9                 9.9
             Unanimity               38:3                  34.0                48.0
             Majority                 12.3                  9.9                 9.9

           Table 4: Proportion of Mistakes in unbiased treatments V1, U1, and M1.

   We …nd that the proportion of mistakes is roughly 3 times larger under Unanimity
than under Veto. This di¤erence is statistically signi…cant (Mann-Whitney, z = 2:898, p =
0:004),11 which provides strong support for the hypothesis that Veto strictly Dominates
Unanimity in this case. In contrast, payo¤s under Veto and Majority are very close (and
not statistically di¤erent: Mann-Whitney, z = 0:081, p = 0:935).


Information aggregation. Ultimately, we are interested in whether agents are making
the right decision. A simple way to assess this is to look at all the cases where the realized
signal pro…le includes a given number of balls of each color (say, for instance, 6 blue
and 3 red) and compute the proportion of times that the group made the right decision
(Blue in this example) in these cases. There is, however, a caveat; there are very few
observations for some signal pro…le realizations (for instance, 9 blue, 0 red), which can
give us a noisy picture. To circumvent this issue, we simulated 10,000 group decisions for
  11
     See the Mann-Whitney tests for all pairwise comparisons in Appendix A2. From here on, we claim

each possible number of blue balls received in a group based on actual individual behavior
(see Appendix A3 for details). With these, we computed an information aggregation score,
that corresponds to the proportion of decisions that were right.
    Figure 1 plots these scores for Veto, Unanimity, and Majority for each possible num-
ber of blue balls in the draw (0 to 9). In addition, the …gure includes the information
aggregation score predicted by our two benchmarks: the model prediction and the sincere
voting hypothesis.
    First, consider Veto (see V1, on the left panel) and Majority (M1, right panel). In these
cases, both benchmarks predict perfect scores. We …nd that groups make essentially no
mistakes when there are 3 blue balls or less in the draw. In both cases, approximately 20%
of decisions made are mistakes when there are 4 or 5 blue balls. The natural interpretation
is that in such a case, if others play according to the equilibrium, it only takes a single
individual deviation for the group decision to be wrong. When there are 6 blue balls or
more, Veto scores slightly lower than Majority.12
    Under Unanimity: (i) the model predicts poor information aggregation, and (ii) the
sincere voting hypothesis predicts even worse information aggregation on average, but no
mistake when there is a majority of red balls (i.e., there is no type I error –or in the
jury interpretation, an innocent is not convicted). First, we …nd that when there is a
majority of red balls, there is almost never a mistake. This is very close to the sincere
voting outcome, but it stands in sharp contrast to the model prediction (about a 10 to

     We performed non-parametric tests separately for each number of balls based on the simulations. The
tests show no signi…cant di¤erences in the information aggregation score between Majority and Veto when
the number of blue balls is equal to 5 or lower. Majority does signi…cantly better when the number of blue
balls in the group is 6 or higher.

20% mistake rate depending on the ball draw). However, when there is a majority of blue
balls, there are many more mistakes than what the model predicts (for example, only 4% of
decisions are right with 5 blue balls, compared to more than 30% according to the model).
In fact, the realized information aggregation score lies between the model prediction and
sincere voting (except for 9 blue balls), closer to sincere voting.
    In line with the theoretical prediction, we …nd that Veto does aggregate information
better than Unanimity. When there are 5 blue balls or more, the di¤erence is economically
large, and statistically signi…cant. When there is a majority of red balls, both systems
have close-to-perfect scores.13 The implication of this …nding is that the gains from using
Veto instead of Unanimity essentially materialize through a drastic reduction of errors of
type II (i.e. false negatives such as not adopting a good reform, or acquitting a guilty
defendant).


Behavior. Can the dominance of Veto over Unanimity be attributed to the predicted
di¤erences in behavior? To answer this question, it is helpful …rst to compare subjects’
behavior under Veto to that under Majority. Table 5 presents the average frequency at
which agents who received a given signal played a given action.

indicates the percentage of voting blue, red, or veto given the color of the received ball. Model
predictions are indicated between brackets.


    Under both Veto and Majority, the model predicts that agents play the color of their
ball –blue if they receive a blue signal and red if they receive a red signal. We …nd that
subject behavior is fairly close to this (they play accordingly 96% and 94% of the time,
respectively). These average frequencies are remarkably close to what we observe under
Majority. They are not signi…cantly di¤erent (Mann-Whitney, z = 1:121, p = 0:262 both

for red and blue signals). However, while the proportion of deviations is almost identical
under the two systems, the deviations themselves are di¤erent. Even though they do not
generate signi…cant di¤erences in overall average payo¤, it provides an explanation for
why Veto gets a slightly lower information aggregation score than Majority when there is
a majority of blue balls. A veto in such cases is very likely to overturn the right decision
that would have otherwise been made by the majority of non-vetoing players.
   Figure 2 provides a useful representation of individual behavior. Start with Majority
on the right panel. The horizontal axis gives the frequency at which agents with a blue
signal voted for Blue. The vertical axis gives the frequency at which agents with a red
signal voted for Red. Hence, the equilibrium strategy (represented by an orange triangle)
and sincere voting behavior (represented by a green diamond) are on the top right corner.
Each hollow circle in the graph corresponds to the number of subjects who played at those
frequencies: the larger this number, the bigger the circle. We can see that the vast majority
of subjects always play as predicted (84%). And indeed, average behavior (represented by
the red circle) is very close to the top right corner.
   Now, turn to Veto, on the left panel. Unlike in the case of Majority, there are now
three possible actions. To facilitate comparison, we abstract from cases where subjects



                                                                         19
vetoed (which corresponds to less than 2% of total votes). That is, we report frequencies
conditional on playing red or blue.14 Overall, the picture is remarkably similar to that of
Majority: a vast majority of subjects always vote as predicted (79% of total votes).
    To sum up, both at the aggregate and the individual level, behavior under Veto is
remarkably in line with that under Majority, and arguably reasonably close to the model
predictions. We interpret these as a reasonable validation of our equilibrium selection
assumption, and as being consistent with the hypothesis that predicted behavior is driving
the good information aggregation performance. Note, however, that these are consistent
with sincere voting too (more on this later).
    Now consider what happens under Unanimity. As we can see in Table 5, subjects
massively vote for Blue when they receive a blue signal (92%), which is the action predicted
by the model (and by the sincere voting hypothesis). However, when they receive a
red signal, they veto (i.e., they play red under Unanimity) 47% percent of the times,
which is substantially higher than the model prediction (33%). This qualitative feature
is in line with the previous …ndings of Guarnaschelli et al. (2000) and Goeree and Yariv
(2011). Overall, there is a larger proportion of votes that are not in line with the model
prediction. Since these deviations lean toward a higher proportion of veto, this o¤ers a
natural interpretation for why Unanimity generates almost no errors of type I and many
more errors of type II than predicted.
    Figure 3 depicts individual behavior under Unanimity. Here subjects cannot vote for
Red. Accordingly, the vertical axis gives the frequency at which agents with a red signal
veto. We …nd that most agents with a blue signal vote for Blue a majority of the time.
However, there are a number of subjects that sometimes veto when they receive a blue
ball. This is not easy to rationalize, but given that the group decision is most often Red
anyway, these “mistakes” are not necessarily costly (in the sense that the subject was
not pivotal).15 We observe two opposite subject clusters for red signals. Some (31%)
always veto in that case. Others (41%) always vote for Blue. A possible interpretation
is that agents specialize instead of mixing (we will further discuss asymmetric equilibria

   14
      91% of the subjects in treatment V1 never vetoed in the second half. Out of the 10 subjects that did
veto at least once, 5 did so less than 10% of the time.
   15
      Based on the idea that agents are more likely to make mistakes if payo¤s are not too di¤erent,
Guarnaschelli, McKelvey, and Palfrey (2000) show that quantal response equilibrium can indeed account
for some of the departures from the symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium.

later). Another is that some agents vote sincerely (i.e., veto) and the others “compensate”.
One possible conclusion we can draw from this latter interpretation is that there are too
many subjects playing sincerely (and the others cannot fully compensate), which drives
the redistribution of errors towards type II and an overall performance that is poorer than
that predicted by the model.16


4.1.2    Biased signal structure

Payo¤s. In the biased case, equilibrium strategies are identical under Veto and Una-
nimity. Table 6 displays realized and predicted average payo¤s in this case. We …nd that
average payo¤ is higher under Unanimity than under Veto (13% of mistakes compared
to 10%), but this di¤erence is not statistically signi…cant (Mann-Whitney, z = 1:046,
p = 0:295). Also as predicted, Veto clearly and signi…cantly dominates Majority (Mann-
Whitney, z = 2:822, p = 0:005).


Information aggregation scores.                                               Figure 4 displays information aggregation scores
for the biased case. Here, a benevolent dictator would only choose Blue if all balls were
blue. The model predicts such a group decision under both Veto and Unanimity. Hence,

the model predicts perfect information aggregation. This, however, is not the case un-
der Majority because agents cannot single-handedly enforce Red (by construction, they
cannot veto). As a result, the model predicts poor information aggregation. The sincere
voting predictions are that Unanimity aggregates information perfectly but both Veto and
Majority score equally poorly.
   We …nd that both Veto and Unanimity aggregate information well and that Majority
scores poorly. In all cases, scores are arguably fairly close to the model prediction. Inter-
estingly, Veto does much better than what sincere voting predicts. Under both Veto and
Unanimity, most (of the overall few) mistakes happen when there are many blue balls.
Even though Veto does not do as well as Unanimity in these cases, this does not a¤ect av-
erage payo¤s signi…cantly (though statistically, Unanimity gets a signi…cantly higher score
when there are 5, 6, 7, or 8 blue balls). Under majority, most mistakes also happen when
there are between 5 and 8 blue balls. Within this window, the score is also (economically
and statistically) signi…cantly lower than under Veto.


Behavior. Table 7 displays the voting frequencies in the biased signals case.

the other two, however, we observe a higher proportion of departures from the model

prediction than in the unbiased case. Under Veto, the striking departure is that approx-
imately 12% of votes are for Red (the model predicts 0%) for agents with blue or red
signals. Under Unanimity, the notable departure is that subjects who received a red sig-
nal play blue 10% of the time. A tentative interpretation could be that some subjects are
reluctant to nail down the group decision. Under Unanimity, this could account for the
asymmetry in deviations (most deviations are subjects with a red ball voting for Blue).
Under Veto, this could help to explain the substantial proportion of agents voting for Red
with a red ball. Of course, this latter behavior is also consistent with sincere voting. In-
terestingly, however, we also have a substantial proportion of subjects with blue balls that
vote for Red. This cannot be accounted for by sincere voting, but could re‡ect strategic
compensation for those with a red ball who play red.
   Let us now compare individual behavior under Veto and Unanimity (see Figure 5). To
facilitate such a comparisons we abstract, for V2, from the action that is further away from
the model prediction (i.e., playing b with a red signal and playing v with a blue signal) and
is indeed played at a very low frequency. On the vertical axis, we display the frequency
at which v is played conditional on r or v being played, and on the horizontal axis we
display the frequency of b conditional on b or r.17 Under Unanimity, model predictions and
sincere voting coincide. We …nd that a very large fraction of agents always act accordingly
(i.e., their behavior corresponds to the top right corner). Still, a non-negligible fraction of
agents vote for Blue with a red ball, which is not consistent with equilibrium behavior or
sincere voting. This is the main reason for the type II errors one observes when there are
7 or 8 blue balls (see Figure 4).

       The vertical axis is therefore di¤erent than that of V1 in Figure 2.

observed, the orange triangle represents the symmetric equilibrium prediction and the green dia-

   Under Veto, we …nd more heterogeneity in behavior than in the previous cases. The
behavior of only a very few subjects is consistent with sincere voting (they are on the
bottom right corner): only 4% of subjects consistently vote sincerely. Still, a substantial
proportion of agents do not veto when they receive a red signal (even though this is a
weakly dominant strategy). We also observe a number of subjects that always veto with
a red ball but that mix with a blue ball. This behavior is consistent with the tentative
interpretation of compensating behavior mentioned above.
   Finally, under Majority, agents overwhelmingly vote red when they receive a red ball.
With a blue ball, behavior seems consistent with at least two interpretations: some degree
of specialization (instead of randomization according to the model symmetric equilib-
rium) and/or some sincere voting with countervailing compensation. On average, voting
frequencies are almost spot on the equilibrium prediction.
   To sum up, we …nd more departures from the model prediction than in the unbiased
case. Some are consistent with sincere voting (12% vote for Red with a red signal under
Veto, for instance) and some are not (10 % vote for Blue with a red signal under Unanim-
ity). However, the performances are arguably barely a¤ected in terms of average payo¤ or
information aggregation. The key reason for this is that most departures consist of voting

for Blue or Red (as opposed to veto). These deviations impair information aggregation
but do not preclude it: since these actions do not nail down the group decision, it is still
possible that the right decision will be made by the group. Hence, they can be interpreted
as noise that slightly a¤ects average payo¤. Now an interesting question arises: what
would happen if sincere voting implied exerting one’s veto power?


4.2    Framing e¤ects

As explained above, Constructive Abstention is strategically equivalent to Veto. That
is, both systems have three possible actions and, aside from their relabeling, they have
identical aggregation rules. The model predictions are therefore identical under these
two systems. Under sincere voting, however, labels play a role: whereas playing red
corresponds to voting for Red under Veto, it corresponds to vetoing under Constructive
Abstention. In this subsection, we compare payo¤s, information aggregation, and behavior
under these two systems.

4.2.1     Payo¤s.

The model prediction is that performance is identical under Veto and Constructive Ab-
stention for both the unbiased and biased cases. However, if agents vote sincerely, Veto
dominates in the unbiased case and Constructive Abstention dominates in the biased one.
We …nd that Veto strongly and signi…cantly dominates Constructive Abstention in the
unbiased case (Mann-Whitney, z = 2:892, p = 0:004). In fact, Constructive Abstention
does not even signi…cantly over-perform against Unanimity (Mann-Whitney, z = 0:493,
p = 0:622). In the biased signal case, average payo¤s are slightly larger under Veto than
under Constructive Abstention, but the di¤erence is not statistically signi…cant (Mann-
Whitney, z = 0:243, p = 0:808).18


4.2.2     Information aggregation.

Figure 7 compares information aggregation scores for Constructive Abstention to those
(already displayed earlier) under Veto and Unanimity.
    When signals are unbiased (V1, U1, and CA1), Veto outperforms Constructive Ab-
stention. The dominance is economically strong and statistically signi…cant for 5 blue
balls or more.19
    We have already established that when signals are biased (V2, U2, and CA2), Veto
performs very well. What we …nd here is that Constructive Abstention performs very well
too. Given that this is the prediction according both to the model and the sincere voting
hypothesis, this is not surprising. The direct comparison between Veto and Constructive
Abstention does not deliver any signi…cant di¤erences. Economically, the only notable
…nding is that Veto does slightly better with 9 blue balls.
    Overall, such an analysis strongly suggests that in contrast with Veto, Constructive

      In the biased case, we do not …nd a signi…cant di¤erence between CA and U (Mann-Whitney, z =
1:376, p = 0:169). However, if we consider the whole sample, we do …nd that U statistically outperforms
CA (Mann-Whitney, z = 1:684, p = 0:092).

Abstention inherits the information aggregation properties of Unanimity rather than Ma-
jority. We can see this intuitively through information aggregation scores for CA1 and
CA2, which show similar patterns to those of U1 and U2 (see Figure 7) respectively; ; in
contrast, as already established, those of V1 and V2 are very close to those of M1 and
M2.20 Since this is not consistent overall with either the model prediction or the sin-
cere voting hypothesis, the next logical step toward explaining these results is to compare
behavior.


4.2.3                                   Behavior.

Unbiased signals. Voting frequencies under V1 and CA1 are very di¤erent (see Ta-
ble 9). In CA1, subjects that receive a red ball veto (by playing red) almost 28% of the
times. Since vetoing pins down the group decision, doing so is potentially much more
costly than other deviations from the model prediction (voting for Blue when receiving a
red ball, or conversely). Interestingly, the frequency of veto with a blue ball is also rela-
tively large (5%). These results are di¢ cult to interpret. Assuming that other subjects
play according to the model predictions, such a deviation is indeed extremely costly in ex-
   20
      Formal tests provide some support to the claim that information aggregation is no di¤erent under
CA than under U. In the biased case, they are signi…cantly di¤erent only when there are 9 blue balls (U
does better). In the unbiased case, the results are mixed. They are in favour of CA when there are 0, 1,
5, 6, 7, or 8 blue balls and in favour of U when there are 4. When there are 2, 3, or 9, the di¤erence is not
signi…cant.


                                                                                                            27
pectation. However, given the observed voting frequencies, the unconditional probability
that another agent vetoes is fairly high. Hence, the likelihood of being pivotal is very low,
and thus the di¤erence in expected payo¤ of one’s own action is low.

Table 9: Aggregate behavior under Veto and Constructive Abstention (treatments V1, CA1, V2,
and CA2). Each cell indicates the percentage of voting blue, red, or veto given the color of the
received ball.



   The sincere voting hypothesis helps organize the data in some way, then, but not
completely. Figure 8 displays individual behavior. First, consider CA1, located on the
right panel. There is some clustering around the top right corner, which is where sincere
voters would appear. Only 6% of the subjects always played accordingly (though this
number grows to 10% if we look at agents that vote accordingly at least 80% of the times
with both signals). Overall, we observe very dispersed behavior.



Biased signals. Behavior under V2 and CA2 looks more similar (see Figure 8). We
see two relevant discrepancies. First, the proportion of subjects with red balls that al-
ways veto (the action predicted by the model) is a bit lower in V2 than in CA2. Since
playing red is the focal action under Veto, this could be result of sincere voting by some
subjects. However, even if 4 subjects always vote sincerely, one can hardly argue in favor
of a clustering in the corresponding low-right corner. Second, as illustrated in Table 9,
Constructive Abstention exhibits a higher frequency of veto with blue balls (2%, versus
1% under Veto). These are small percentages, but the actions associated with them are
potentially very costly. They account for the poorer information aggregation score of
Constructive Abstention when there are 9 blue balls.

Interpretation.         Overall, we cannot explain these …ndings by pointing to a constant
proportion of sincere voting across treatments. Given our notion of sincere voting, an
interpretation of our …ndings is that the proportion of agents playing sincerely can vary
based on the way the problem is framed.
     It has been established in other contexts that framing can a¤ect choices between op-
tions. For instance, the insight that people are more likely to select a default option has
revolutionized retirement savings in the US (many companies now o¤er their employee the
option to opt out instead of having to opt in). In the Decision Theory literature, such bias
has been related to the concept of decision avoidance, which is relevant to our …ndings if
one interprets the focal action in our experiment as the default option.
     Decision avoidance means that “[the default option] may be chosen in order to avoid
a di¢ cult decision” (Dean, Kibris, and Masatlioglu 2014; see also Tversky and Sha…r
1992).21 For instance, Dean (2009) …nds that subjects facing larger choice sets are more
likely to select the default option. Applied to our context, this leads to the hypothesis that
agents are more likely to choose the focal action (i.e., vote sincerely) if they face a more
complex situation. Our …ndings are consistent with such an hypothesis, assuming that
subjects …nd the biased-signal game less complex than the unbiased one. This perceived
complexity level could be due to the fact that the former presents a weakly dominant
strategy and an obvious best response (even though computing the posterior involves non-
trivial calculations), whereas the latter does not (here, no calculation is really needed if
one understands the logic behind the Condorcet Jury Theorem).


5        Conclusion

In this paper, we have explored empirically the performance of di¤erent unanimous rules.
Our main …nding is that Veto dominates Unanimity in the laboratory. We therefore
provide empirical support for our previous theoretical results (Bouton, Llorente-Saguer,
and Malherbe, 2015). Furthermore, we …nd that, when it is framed as majority rule with
veto power, subject behavior falls in line with the model predictions and deviations are not
too costly. This provides support for external validity and suggests that it would, indeed,
    21
     This result is often referred to as “status quo”bias (See for instance Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler
1991). Note that, in our context, status quo refers to something completely di¤erent. This is why we
perfer to use the phrase “default option”.


                                                   30
be bene…cial for voting bodies that currently use Unanimity to adopt Veto instead.
   However, when Veto is framed as unanimity rule under the constructive abstention
regime, we observe more deviations from equilibrium predictions and weaker results. This
shows that the way in which a voting rule is presented can have a dramatic impact on
the outcome of the vote. A tentative but potentially important takeaway is that when the
rule is such that some votes have more weight than others, one must be very careful in
choosing which is the focal vote. This is an interesting avenue for future research.

Appendix A1. Proof of Lemma 2

Proof. Under Majority, given that Pr (sB j! B ) 6= Pr(sR j! R ); we know from Austen-Smith and
Banks (1996) that                b   (sB ) = 1 =           r   (sR ) need not be an equilibrium. It is easy to check that
indeed sincere voting is not an equilibrium since voters receiving a blue signal would want to
deviate and vote red. The same reason explains why there is no equilibrium such that                                                              b   (sB ) = 1;
and    r   (sR ) 2 (0; 1) : Therefore, any responsive equilibrium must take the following form:                                                        b   (sB ) 2
(0; 1) ; and        r   (sR ) = 1.
      To characterize the equilibrium, we need to de…ne the expected payo¤ of the two possible
actions for an agent with signal s. The probability of being pivotal (changing the outcome from R
to B) in state ! when playing b is:

Appendix A3. Methodology for the simulations

A simple way to do this would be to compute the proportion of right decisions that
would make a group if all 9 subjects would adopt strategies that match voting frequencies.
However, this would miss the point that heterogenous behaviour can a¤ect outcomes. This
is why we base our measure of information aggregation on individual voting frequencies.
      Here is how we do. We …rst compute individual votings frequencies for each subject
based on the last 25 periods.22 Then, for each possible realized signal pro…le (i.e. for
     22
     In setting 2, three subjects never received a red ball in the second half of the experiment. For these
subjects, instead of having the average in the last half of the experiment we use the average for the whole
experiment.

each number of blue balls going from 0 to 9), we run 10,000 simulations where members
of a matching group (i.e. subjects in a session) are divided into two random groups and
randomly assigned the di¤erent signals. For each of these simulations we aggregate votes
and compute the outcomes.23 Finally, we pool the results by treatment and compute the
proportion of group decisions that coincide with that of the fully informed dictator.


Appendix A4. Instructions

Thank you for taking part in this experiment. Please read these instructions very carefully. It is
important that you do not talk to other participants during the entire experiment. In case you do
not understand some parts of the experiment, please read through these instructions again. If you
have further questions after hearing the instructions, please give us a sign by raising your hand out
of your cubicle. We will then approach you in order to answer your questions personally. Please
do not ask anything aloud.
     During this experiment you will earn money. How much you earn depends partly on your
own decisions, partly on the decisions of other participants, and partly on chance. Your personal
earnings will be paid to you in cash as soon as the experiment is over. Your payo¤s during the
experiment will be indicated in Talers. At the end of the instructions we are going to explain you
how we are going to transform them into euros.
     After the experiment, we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire, which we need for
the statistical analysis of the experimental data. The data of the questionnaire, as well as all your
decisions during the experiments will be anonymous.
     The experiment you are participating in is a group decision making experiment. The exper-
iment consists of 50 rounds. The rules are the same for all rounds and for all participants. At
the beginning of each round you will be randomly assigned to a group of 9 participants (including
yourself). You will not know the identity of the other participants. In each round you will only
interact with the participants in your group. Your group will make a decision based on the vote of
all group members. (important to say this here, because we say “before voting”later) The decision
is simply a choice between two jars, the blue jar and the red jar. In what follows we will explain
to you the procedure in each round.

     The Jar. There are two jars: the blue jar and the red jar. The blue jar contains 7 blue balls
and 3 red balls. The red jar contains 7 red balls and 3 blue balls. At the beginning of each round,
one of the two jars will be randomly selected. We will call this the selected jar. Each jar is equally
likely to be selected, i.e., each jar is selected with a 50% chance. You will not be told which jar
has been chosen when making your decision.

     The Sample Ball. Before voting, each of you receives a piece of information that may or may
not help you decide which is the correct jar. After a jar is selected for your group, the computer
will show each of the participants in your group (including yourself) the color of one ball randomly
drawn from that jar. We will call this ball your sample ball. Since you are 9 in your group, the
computer separately performs this random draw 9 times. Each ball will be equally likely to be
drawn for every member of the group. That is, if the color of the selected jar for your group were
red, then all members of your group would draw their sample balls from a jar containing 7 red
and 3 blue balls. If the color of your group’s jar were blue, then all members of your group would
draw their sample balls from a jar containing 3 red and 7 blue balls. Therefore, if the selected jar

realization.

is blue, each member of your group has a 70% chance of receiving a blue ball. And if the selected
jar is red, each member of your group has a 70% chance of receiving a red ball.
     You will only see the color of your own sample ball. This will be the only information you will
have when you vote.

    Your Vote. Once you have seen the color of your sample ball, you can vote.
    [Treatment M & U] You must vote for one of the two jars. That is, you must vote for Blue or
vote for Red.
    [Treatment A] You must either vote for one of the two jars or abstain. That is, you must vote
for Blue, vote for Red or Abstain.
    [Treatment V] You must either vote for one of the two jars or veto the blue jar. That is, you
must vote for Blue, vote for Red or Veto Blue.
    You can vote for either option by clicking below the corresponding button. After making your
decision, please press the ‘OK’key.

    Group Decision. The group decision will be set according to. . .
    [Treatment M] . . . majority. The group decision depends on the number of blue and red votes:
          If a majority of the group votes blue, the group decision is blue.
          Otherwise, if a majority of the group votes red, the group decision is red.
    [Treatment U] . . . unanimity. If you or anyone in your group votes red, the group decision is
red. Otherwise, the group decision is blue. That is, the group decision is blue if and only if you
and everybody in your group vote blue.
    [Treatment A] . . . unanimity with possibility of abstention and majority quorum. If you or
anyone in your group votes red, the group decision is red. In case there is no vote for red, the
group decision depends on the number of blue votes and abstentions:
          If less than a majority of the group abstains, the group decision is blue.
          Otherwise, if a majority of the group abstains, the group decision is red.
    [Treatment V] . . . majority rule with veto. If you or anyone in your group vetoes blue, the
group decision is red. In case there is no one who vetoes blue the group decision depends on the
number of blue and red votes:
          If a majority of the group votes blue, the group decision is blue.
          Otherwise, if a majority of the group votes red, the group decision is red.

    Payo¤ in Each Round. If your group decision is equal to the correct jar, each member of
your group earns 100 Talers. If your group decision is incorrect, each member of your group earns
10 Talers.

    Information at the end of each Round. Once you and all the other participants have
made your choices, the round will be over. At the end of each round, you will receive the following
information about the round:
         Total number of votes for Blue
         Total number of votes for Red
         [Treatment A] Total number of abstentions
         [Treatment V] Total number of vetoes on blue
         Group decision
         Selected jar
         Your payo¤

    Final Earnings. At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select 5 rounds
and you will earn the payo¤s you obtained in these rounds. Each of the 50 rounds has the same
chance of being selected. The total number of talers accumulated in these 5 selected rounds will
be transformed into euros by multiplying your earnings in talers by a conversion rate. For this
experiment the conversion rate is 0.025, meaning that 100 talers equal 2.5 Euros. Additionally,


                                                38
you will earn a show-up fee of 3.00 Euros. Everyone will be paid in private and you are under no
obligation to tell others how much you earned.
