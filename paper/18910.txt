                                               ABSTRACT

We use a unique dataset that combines information on advertising by subprime lenders and mortgages
originated by them from 2002 to 2007 to study the relationship between advertising and the nature
of mortgages obtained by consumers. We exploit the richness of our data and measure the relative
expensiveness of a given mortgage as the excess rate of a mortgage after accounting for a broad set
of borrower, contract, and regional characteristics associated with a given mortgage--less expensive
mortgages, all else equal, are better products from the perspective of the consumer. We find a strong
positive relationship between the intensity of local advertising and the expensiveness of mortgages
extended by lenders within a given region, with the relationship strongest for advertising through newspapers,
the most heavily used channel for local advertising of mortgages. This pattern survives even after conditioning
for a rich set of borrower, loan and region characteristics and exploiting differences in advertising
within a given lender. Advertisers lend to consumers who, all else equal, default less, making it unlikely
that our results are driven by unobservable borrower quality. We also exploit variation in mortgage
advertising induced by the entry of Craigslist across different regions to demonstrate that the relation
between advertising and expensiveness of mortgages is not likely to be spurious. We corroborate that
advertising is most effective when targeted at groups that might be less informed about mortgages,
such as the poor, the less educated and minorities. These findings are inconsistent with the “informative
view” under which advertising allows consumers to find cheaper products, and instead support the
“persuasive view” that advertising in the subprime mortgage market was used to steer consumers into
expensive choices.

I. Introduction

The aftermath of the housing crisis has led to extensive new regulation in the mortgage market,
such as the genesis of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the sections of the Dodd-
Frank Act concerning lending practices. The perception guiding several of these policy changes
centers around the claim that naïve consumers were duped by advertising to enter expensive
mortgages. This sentiment is directly reflected in the actions of regulators. The Federal Reserve
(Fed), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) each argued that advertising confused potential borrowers by steering them into expensive
adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). In response they have penalized lenders for deceptive
practices 1 and implemented explicit regulation of mortgage advertising. 2 The New York Times
summarized this prevailing view: “One of the most important lessons of the mortgage collapse is
that potential borrowers need clear explanations of exactly what kind of commitment they are
making” (October 1, 2010). While several anecdotes have been used to justify claims of
deceptive advertising—which have driven these regulatory changes—there is no empirical study
that has investigated these claims systematically. In this paper we hope to provide such evidence.

Our unique dataset combines local advertising by subprime lenders with the contract, region, and
borrower characteristics of mortgages originated by them over the period from 2002 to 2007.
Using this data we provide facts relating advertising to the nature of mortgages obtained by
consumers. We find a strong positive relationship between the intensity of local advertising and
the expensiveness of mortgages extended by lenders within a given region. This pattern survives
even after conditioning for a rich set of borrower and loan characteristics and exploiting
differences in advertising within a given lender. The relationship is strongest for mortgages
issued to less educated, minority and poor consumers whom the previous literature has identified
as less informed about mortgages. Advertising is most effective through newspapers, the most
heavily used channel for local advertising of mortgages. Advertisers lend to consumers who, all
else equal, default less, making it unlikely that our results are driven by unobservable borrower
quality. We exploit variation in mortgage advertising induced by the entry of Craigslist across
different regions to further demonstrate that the relationship between advertising and
expensiveness of mortgages is not likely to be spurious.

The starting point of our analysis is the recent literature that shows the importance of search in
the mortgage market (Hall and Woodward 2012). Consumers do not frequently transact in this

  The Fed fined Wells Fargo $85 million for steering consumers into expensive mortgages. Ten thousand borrowers
could potentially receive compensation ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. Furthermore, on July 12, 2012, the
Department of Justice reached a $175 million settlement with Wells Fargo to resolve fair lending claims
(http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-dag-869.html) [accessed on Feb 29, 2013].

  The FDIC implemented Regulation Z in 2008 and the FTC passed the Mortgage Acts and Practices Advertising
rule in 2011, both of which directly regulate advertising of mortgages.

market. They do not observe all prices, but instead have to find the best-priced mortgage through
search. Moreover, some important characteristics of mortgages, such as the reset rates in ARMs,
are not very salient and thus require consumers to have specific knowledge. Even though
mortgages are relatively homogenous products, these search frictions create a demand for
information about mortgages that lenders can cater to. There are two broad views on how lenders
use advertising to supply this information to consumers. On the one hand, the “informative view”
says that advertising decreases search costs and allows consumers to find better products (Nelson
1974). On the other hand, the “persuasive view” suggests that advertising is used to steer
consumers into bad choices (Braithwaite 1928; Thaler and Sunstein 2008).

The obvious difficulty in separating these views is that one needs to identify “better” and
“worse” mortgages, and then relate the choices of consumers, who may not be otherwise
identical, to lender advertising. We measure whether mortgages are relatively better or worse for
the consumer by computing the extent to which identical consumers pay different prices for
otherwise similar mortgages: we contend that cheaper mortgages, all else equal, are better
products from the perspective of the consumer.

We focus on ARM reset rates, which are less salient and have been at the center of lawsuits and
regulatory scrutiny that contend that advertising focused consumers’ attention on the
introductory interest rate giving them the impression that the rate would be permanent, rather
than reset after the first few years. 3 We exploit the richness of our data and measure the relative
“expensiveness” of a given mortgage as the excess reset rate of a mortgage after accounting for a
broad set of borrower, contract, and regional characteristics associated with a given mortgage,
including the initial interest rate. The essence of the relative expensiveness measure is that if
identical consumers obtain the same mortgage with different reset rates, then the difference in
the reset rates measures how much worse the choice of the consumer with the higher reset rate
was.

Our results show large dispersion in mortgage expensiveness within geographic regions
(designated market areas or DMAs). On average, the difference in reset rates between the 95th
and 5th percentile mortgages in a given region after conditioning on the initial interest rate and
borrower, loan, and regional characteristics is 3.1 percentage points. This represents substantial
dispersion in ARM reset rates obtained by borrowers with the same observable characteristics. In
the raw data, without adjusting for characteristics, this difference is 5.8 percentage points. Such

3
  In Appendix B we present several examples of ARM advertising showing that they all prominently state the
introductory interest rate making it the focal, salient part of the advertisement. None mentioned the reset rate or the
index that will be used at the time of reset. The new regulation following the crisis tries to address this issue. For
example, Regulation Z implemented by the FDIC creates new restrictions on mortgage advertising and prohibits the
unqualified use of the word “fixed” in ads for variable rate mortgages or mortgages with increasing payments,
unless the mortgagee prominently displays the duration under which the rate is invariable.
                                                          2
high price dispersion is not unusual for financial products: Hortacsu and Syverson (2004), for
example, find substantial dispersion among S&P 500 index funds with the 90-10 percentile price
(fee) ratio of 8.2.

Next, we assess whether loan prices differ because there is dispersion in the loan prices charged
by a given lender, or because lenders charge on average different prices. We find large
differences in average reset rates charged by lenders after conditioning on borrower, loan, and
regional characteristics: the difference between the 95th and 5th percentile lender in a given
region is 2.8 percentage points. Thus, in the first part of our analysis we find substantial
difference in reset rates—some customers obtain more expensive mortgages than others, all else
equal. A large part of that variation is driven by differences in mortgage pricing between
lenders—loans originated by some lenders are, on average, more expensive than others.

The second part of our analysis focuses on examining the relationship between the expensiveness
of a lender and the degree of advertising by that lender. This allows us to evaluate which of the
two views, “informative” or “persuasive,” can best explain the patterns in the data. Under the
informative view, lenders use costly advertising to signal low prices to consumers who search
(Robert and Stahl 1993). Consequently, cheaper lenders should use it to attract customers to their
mortgages. Alternatively, under the persuasive view, advertising causes consumers to enter
worse mortgages. As a result, under this view, we should observe that advertising draws
consumers to relatively more expensive mortgages—those which contain higher reset rates, all
else equal. Given that mortgages are nonbranded goods, 4 using advertising to mislead consumers
requires some limited rationality on the part of consumers. 5 If advertising lures consumers to
high-reset-rate mortgages, it has to be that consumers have a difficult time understanding resets,
possibly because reset rates are less salient or shrouded attributes of a mortgage (Gabaix and
Laibson 2006, Brown, Hossain and Morgan 2007, Stango and Zinman 2011, Bordalo, Gennaioli
and Shleifer, 2012).

In estimating the correlation between lender expensiveness and advertising we exploit variation
in relative advertising of lenders within a given location using lender fixed effects. Thus, our
finding is not driven by the simple notion that lenders advertise more in regions with higher
mortgage prices. In addition, exploiting variation within lenders also allows us to avoid concerns
that it is lender characteristics, such as the lender’s brand, other lenders’ activities aimed at

4
  For instance, customers are unlikely to differentiate mortgages based on servicer quality. In many instances the
bank offering the mortgage itself is the servicer. However, in many other instances the bank originating the
mortgage could outsource the servicing to a third party. Customers, at least at the time they get the mortgage, are
unlikely to know who their mortgage servicer is.
5
  To see this, consider a scenario in which lenders who advertise are systematically more expensive. Thus, if
consumers are rational and understand the equilibrium one would expect them to avoid such lenders. Consequently,
advertising, which is costly, would not be used.
                                                        3
attracting customers, propensity to renegotiate or securitize, or marginal costs, which may be
correlated with advertising, that are driving the results.

Our results show that, keeping observable borrower characteristics fixed, lenders charge higher
mortgage prices relative to other lenders in regions in which they advertise relatively more. We
find that the effect of advertising on expensiveness of ARMs is driven by advertising in
newspapers, the most heavily used channel for local advertising of mortgages. In particular, the
effect of spending an additional dollar on newspaper advertising on mortgage reset rates is
approximately 16% larger than spending a dollar on advertising in general.

Our final analysis assesses whether our findings are consistent with the alternative explanation
that advertising attracts a pool of borrowers who are less likely to repay a loan and are charged
higher reset rates due to their lower ability to repay. This alternative could explain our findings if
true borrower “quality” is not captured by our rich set of conditioning variables. We conduct two
tests to explore this alternative. First, if advertising lenders lend to borrowers who are less likely
to repay a loan, leading to higher reset rates for such borrowers, then we should find that such
borrowers are indeed less likely to repay a loan in the future. We find that advertisers lend to
consumers who, all else equal, default less, making it unlikely that our results are driven by
unobservable borrower quality.

Second, we exploit variation in mortgage advertising induced by staggered entry of Craigslist
across different regions and times. Craigslist has become an important information source for
consumers in the housing and real estate market (Pew Research Center, 2011). We collect
information on mortgage classifieds during our sample period and show that they represent over
8% of all financial services posts on Craigslist. Thus, Craigslist entry in a market serves as a
potentially viable source of variation in mortgage advertising in a market. We show that the
Craigslist introduction is unrelated to borrowers’ characteristics in that region. However, it had a
significant impact on mortgage advertising, with the highest impact on newspaper advertising,
which Craigslist online classifieds substitute most directly for. Next, we exploit this Craigslist-
induced variation in advertising and continue to find a positive relationship between the intensity
of local advertising and the expensiveness of mortgages extended by lenders. This evidence
corroborates our earlier inferences and suggests that our findings are unlikely to be driven by
unobservable borrower riskiness or even by other lender activities aimed at attracting customers.

Our evidence is consistent with advertisers using mortgage advertising for persuasive purposes—
to steer consumers into expensive mortgages. The magnitudes are large and suggest that a
consumer who obtains the mortgage from a lender who advertises on average pays
approximately $7,440 more in present-value terms. Our estimates are on the same order of

                                                  4
magnitude as the estimates of losses faced by mortgage borrowers because they do not properly
account for broker service fees estimated in Hall and Woodward (2012).

We end our analysis with more evidence supporting the persuasive view of advertising. We first
examine whether advertising is more effective at inducing more expensive mortgage choices
when aimed at groups of borrowers who are more susceptible to manipulation because they are
potentially less informed. We find that our results are driven by mortgage advertisers who tilt
their portfolio toward less-educated borrowers, minority borrowers, and the poor. These are
groups of borrowers that have been identified in the literature as potentially less informed (Hall
and Woodward 2012). Next, we examine which regions are targeted by advertising. Since
advertising is most effective when targeted at minorities, the poor and the less educated, we want
to explore whether advertisers target their advertising at regions with these demographic
characteristics. We find that lenders do tend to advertise in regions that have a higher share of
minorities and fewer college-educated households. By construction, subprime lenders—the
lenders in our data—tend to do their lending in low-income regions (i.e., subprime regions).
Strikingly, even within such regions, there exists a relation between advertising conducted by
these lenders and characteristics of the population that might be more susceptible to persuasion.

Our analysis focuses on the role that advertising plays in helping consumers choose the cheapest
mortgage from a set of mortgages. We do not explore whether advertising improves consumers’
choice of whether to take on a mortgage or select a more suitable mortgage product. A naïve
correlation in the data suggests that lenders who advertise more are also more likely to originate
“nontraditional” mortgages. In order for mortgage advertising to also play an informational role
in this market one would have to believe that consumers’ would have otherwise taken up sub
optimally few non-traditional mortgages. A more rigorous analysis exploring the informational
role of advertising in helping consumers choose among different types of mortgages is a fruitful
area of future research.

Our paper is connected to several strands of literature. It is related most directly to the recent
literature on the causes and consequences of the financial crisis (e.g., Agarwal et al. 2011;
Barlevy and Fisher 2010; Ben-David 2011; Keys et al. 2009, 2010; Loutskina and Strahan 2011;
Mayer and Pence 2009; Mayer et al. 2011; Mian and Sufi 2009), and in particular to studies that
examine the role of predatory lending in fueling the crisis (see Agarwal et al. 2011; Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission 2011). Our findings are consistent with those of Agarwal and
Evanoff (2013) whose data overlaps with our sample period. They conclude that real estate
professional steer higher-quality borrowers to lenders who offer unattractive terms. To the best
of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to identify an economically meaningful relation between



                                                5
advertising and lending activity of subprime lenders. In doing so, it contributes to the recent
discussions on the regulation of mortgage markets. 6

Our paper is also related to the literature on firms’ responses to consumers’ limited ability to
process information and their biases (e.g. Malmendier and DellaVigna 2006). For example,
Gabaix and Laibson (2006) and Bordalo et al. (2012), study how consumers may focus on salient
product features. Stango and Zinman (2012) find that consumers are less likely to incur overdraft
fees after these are made salient, especially if consumers are financially less literate. Also related
is the work by Carlin and Manso (2011) who point out that educating customers might be
ineffective, because firms respond with further obfuscation. Our findings are consistent with
their view since we find the larger effect of advertising on mortgage prices for less educated
consumers.

Our paper also relates to the relatively nascent literature on the effects of limited attention on
financial outcomes. This literature argues that uninformed investors tend to ignore information
that is critical to firm value if it is not salient, and tend to respond more quickly to information
that catches their attention (Hirshleifer and Teoh, 2003). Several papers have used advertising as
a measure of "attention-grabbing" events, which attract uninformed investors. Grullon, Kanastas,
and Weston (2004) show that advertising increases demand of uninformed investors and Lou
(2013) shows that firms opportunistically use advertising to increase prices in order to maximize
the proceeds from insiders’ equity sales. Similar to this work, we present evidence that
advertising decreases the wellbeing of agents who respond to it.

More broadly, our paper is related to literature on how persuasion affects consumer choices (see
Bagwell 2007, DellaVigna 2009, DellaVigna and Gentzkow 2010 for detailed recent reviews of
this literature). Closest to our paper are studies, which relate the use of advertising and pricing of
homogenous products. Hastings, Hortacsu, and Syverson (2011) show that the use of advertising
activity of private social security funds in Mexico is related to their pricing. Our work is closely
related to Agarwal and Ambrose (2011) who assess the effect of advertising on choice of home
equity debt contracts by examining a direct mail advertising experiment done by a large
bank. They find that relative pricing variables have less explanatory power for choices of
solicited customers. Their evidence, conducted on a sample of substantially higher quality
borrowers than ours, also support the persuasive view of advertising in the mortgage market. 7
Bertrand et al (2010) use a field experiment to show that advertising increases demand for
consumer loans and study the effect of different advertising features. Gurun and Butler (2012)

   Third-party interventions may improve quality disclosure to change firm behavior. Along these lines, see Sauer
and Leffler 1990; Beales, Craswell, and Salop 1981; Jolls and Sunstein 2006.

  The sample in Agarwal and Ambrose (2011) consists of borrowers whose average FICO score is around 720. This
is about 100 points higher than the average borrower in our sample (FICO score around 630).

present evidence that local newspapers slant their news in favor of firms with higher local
advertisement expenditures, which in turn increases investors’ demand for local stocks. Reuters
and Zitzewitz (2006) show that favorable advertisements in personal finance publications are
positively correlated with mutual fund recommendations and receive higher subsequent fund
flows. Zinman and Zitzewitz (2012) demonstrate that ski resorts engage in deceptive
advertisement, which persists despite competition. In general, DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2010)
point out that it is difficult to draw causal interpretations because advertising is endogenous to
several firm characteristics. Our paper attempts to draw such a link by exploiting both the
richness of our data and the analysis that uses introduction of Craigslist.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II we discuss the institutional
background, including the anecdotal evidence on the deceptive and persuasive use of advertising
in mortgage markets. In Section III we present our data sources. Section IV outlines the
empirical results. Section V discusses the findings and reports some auxiliary tests. Section VI
concludes.

II. Institutional Background

II.A. Anecdotal evidence of persuasive and deceptive advertising in the mortgage market

As we discuss in detail in Section III, lenders target potential consumers through advertisements
in local newspapers and in television, radio, and outdoor spots. Several discussions in the
popular press as well as policy discussions suggest that mortgage lenders have employed
advertising to confuse consumers into making “bad” decisions. A Wall Street Journal article on
February 15, 2005, describes a then-popular practice of advertising low teaser (initial) rates on
ARM mortgages as a way to attract consumers who do not realize that these rates will be
substantially higher after the reset date.

Consider four typical ARM advertisements, which we present in Appendix B. The first two
examples have been the subject of fraudulent advertising lawsuits. The last example presents
two additional advertisements, which have not been subject to litigation. Irrespective of litigation
status, these advertisements have a common feature, which is at the heart of our mechanism.
They all prominently state the introductory interest rate making it the focal, salient part of the
advertisement. None of the advertisements mention the reset rate or the index that will be used at
the time of reset. Rather, they typically state the APR which is an amalgamation of several
factors including the potential reset rate. The most informative advertisement is by the Pentagon
Credit Union in Washington Post on August 5, 2006 (Appendix B.3). It states the APR of



                                                 7
7.045% in addition to the introductory rate of 5.625% for five years. Note that there is no
mention of how the APR is computed. 8

The advertisements, which were considered deceitful, go even further, neglecting to even
mention that the mortgage is adjustable. Consider, for example, the advertisement placed by
DCG Mortgage in the New York Post on January 18, 2007 (Appendix B.1). The advertisement
offered “low introductory teaser interest rate” of 1% on mortgage loans and low monthly
payment amounts at that rate of $529.69 per month on a $200,000 loan. According to the
settlement agreement between New York Banking Department and Sage Credit Company
(formerly named DCG Mortgage), this particular advertisement failed to “clearly and
conspicuously disclose the actual terms of repayment of the loans, including that the advertised
low interest rate and low monthly payments are subject to increase and do not last over the life of
the loan.” 9

Not surprisingly, such discussions in the popular press have not gone unnoticed. Several high-
profile lawsuits have been directed at lenders for using false advertising to attract potential
consumers and steer them into “bad” mortgages. The Office of the Attorney General’s Consumer
Protection Section in Colorado has sued or settled with sixteen mortgage lenders regarding
“deceptive advertising” by “unscrupulous brokers who were taking advantage of borrowers …
Consumers often were surprised to learn that the fixed payment schedule they believed they had
signed up for actually resulted in … owing more than the original loan.” 10 One of the lenders
was Green River, who placed an advertisement in the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver
Post, advertising an option ARM, whose rate reset in the future, as a “10 Year Fixed Payment
Plan” or “10 Year Fixed” at 3.95% and 4.05% APR in March and April of 2006 (Appendix



8
  In general, the APR is supposed to help consumers compare loans on equal terms. However, every lender's APR
policy differs. Some include their application fees in the APR, some don't. Moreover, APRs may also vary
depending on the size of the loan, whether it is adjustable or fixed, and on the lenders' requirements for mortgage
and title insurance (see http://loan.yahoo.com/m/primer11.html; accessed on March 4, 2013). Notably, if the APR
for adjustable loans is computed according to regulation, then the Official Staff Commentary to Regulation Z,
Section 226.17 (c) (10) determines how the index and the reset rate are used to compute it.
9
  There were other misleading pieces of information in the advertising by this mortgage lender as well. Statements
in the advertisement implied that “no income verification” and “no asset verification” loans are products that are
particularly suited to those with bad credit. Other advertised terms were not only misleading but also factually
incorrect: the advertising offered mortgage loans with “40–50 year” terms. According to General Regulations of the
Banking Board, Part 82.2(d), the term of any mortgage loan given on a one- to four-family owner-occupied
residence cannot exceed forty years. Finally, the advertisement suggested that mortgage broker would fund all
mortgage loans itself, despite the rule of General Regulations of the Banking Board Part 38.2(d) that says, “No
advertisement by a mortgage broker shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will
fund a mortgage loan. Any advertisement by a mortgage broker must contain a statement to the effect that the
mortgage broker arranges mortgage loans with third-party providers.”

B.2). 11 These advertisements were deemed deceptive and misleading because they suggested that
the initial teaser rate was a fixed interest rate for an extended period of time. Similar lawsuits
were filed by the Arizona Office of Attorney General against Home Loan Center for mortgages
originated from 2004 to 2007 and against Wells Fargo Bank relating to similar practices and
advertising by Wachovia Corporation and Golden West Corporation (both acquired by Wells
Fargo).

The lawsuits against mortgage lenders frequently allege that these ads were targeted at
minorities, who are potentially more vulnerable to misinformation. For instance, in the lawsuit
against Countrywide Financial Corporation/Bank of America by the State of Illinois, the attorney
general found that Countrywide steered “prime-eligible” minority community borrowers into
high-fee subprime ARM loans relative to similarly situated white borrowers from 2005 to 2007.
Aggressive marketing and advertising on radio, in newspapers and on television were alleged to
have played a major role in “pitching such products to minorities.” For example, to target
advertising at Latinos, Countrywide used advertising on the TV reality show Lo dejo en tus
manos. Similarly, it also targeted Latinos by partnering with a Spanish newspaper, La Raza. In
another high-profile example, class action documents filed in October 2012 by the ACLU against
Morgan Stanley state that the lender discriminated against “African Americans in the Detroit,
Michigan metropolitan area,” steering them into exceedingly high-cost and high-risk residential
mortgage loans. 12

Resulting Regulation

In response to concerns about unfair and deceptive mortgage lending and servicing practices, the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued significant new mortgage lending
rules, Regulation Z, which took effect on October 1, 2009. The purpose of this regulation is to
promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost.
Since one of the primary concerns was that advertising lured consumers into ARMs with high
reset rates, Regulation Z included several rules to govern mortgage advertisement, especially
relating to ARMs.

Under the new rules, advertisements for home-secured loans may include only the simple annual
interest rate, or the rate at which interest will accrue. If an advertisement includes an annual
interest rate such as a teaser rate, and more than one rate may apply during the loan’s term, the
advertisement must disclose all interest rates, the time period for which they apply, and the
loan’s APR. In addition to outlining what mortgage lenders need to disclose in advertising,

11
   Mortgage Toolbox was even more brazen in advertising with ARMs advertised below a heading of “30 year
fixed.”

                                                     9
Regulation Z also prohibits some advertising practices. Two prohibitions which try to prevent
misinformation about ARM reset rates are : (1) using the term “fixed” when advertising a
variable-rate loan or ARM, and (2) comparing the advertised rate to an actual (or hypothetical)
rate without disclosing costs that make the comparison misleading, thus hiding important
information. 13

The Federal Trade Commission proposed its own Mortgage Acts and Practices Advertising rule
relating to “unfair or deceptive acts and practices that may occur with regard to mortgage
advertising.” In seeking public comments on this rule, the FTC highlighted that deceptive claims
were frequently aimed at borrowers in the subprime market. These contained “claims of low
‘teaser’ rates and payment amounts, without disclosing that the rates and payments would
increase substantially after a limited period of time and misrepresentations that rates were fixed
for the full term of the loan.” 14 In response, “Section 321.3(g) prohibits misrepresentations
pertaining to the variability of interest, payments, or other terms of mortgage credit products,
including, but not limited to, misrepresentations using the word ‘fixed’ when terms are, in fact,
variable or limited in duration.”

The other major change in the regulatory landscape following the financial crisis was the
establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 15 This federal agency holds
primary responsibility for regulating consumer protection in the area of financial products and
services. The bureau has authority to write and enforce rules for banks and other firms, aiming to
protect consumers from deceptive and abusive loans and other financial products and services.
In response to Dodd-Frank Act directives, the CFPB proposed Integrated Mortgage Disclosures,
aiming to reduce inconsistencies in mortgage disclosure forms. The CFPB proposal suggests
forms that use clear language and design to make it easier for consumers to locate key
information, such as the interest rate, monthly payments, and costs to close the loan. The forms
also provide more information to help consumers decide whether they can afford the loan and
compare the costs of different loan offers, including the cost of the loans over time.

The CFPB also has authority to consider complaints regarding misleading financial

13
   Regulation Z creates new restrictions on all mortgage advertising and prohibits the following: (a) the unqualified
use of the word “fixed” in advertisements for variable-rate mortgages or mortgages with increasing payments, unless
the mortgagee prominently displays the duration under which the rate is invariable; (b) comparing rates where the
advertised rate will not be available for the full duration of the loan; (c) falsely advertising a loan or mortgage as
“government-endorsed”; (d) false claims of debt elimination; (e) using the word “counselor” in the context of for-
profit sale of mortgages; and (f) in foreign language advertisement, providing only trigger terms in the foreign
language while providing other terms in English.

   More specifically, this agency was founded as a result of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. The Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed in 2011, during the 111th United States
Congress. The bureau was set up as an independent unit located inside, and funded by, the Federal Reserve.

advertisements. The Dodd-Frank Act dictates that it is unlawful for any provider of consumer
financial products or services to engage in any unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice
(UDAAP). The act also provides the CFPB with rule-making authority to prosecute such acts or
practices. According to this mandate, the CFPB collects and documents advertisements that
contain ambiguous language to create deception. 16

III. Data

Our data come from two main sources. The first source provides information on advertising,
while the other source provides information on the mortgages. The data on advertising are from
the TNS Media Intelligence (TNSMI) database. TNSMI monitors eleven media channels and
collects information about advertisements at the national and designated market area (DMA)
levels. DMA regions are geographic areas in the United States in which the population receives
similar television, radio, and newspaper offerings. DMAs define boundaries of targeted local
advertising and direct marketing campaigns across multiple media. A DMA typically refers to a
certain geographic area rather than a city or county, and may contain zip codes from neighboring
states. For example, New York DMA includes Pike County, Pennsylvania, although no part of
Pennsylvania is part of the New York metropolitan area. In addition, a state may be divided into
multiple DMAs (e.g., New York, New York, and Rochester, New York). Furthermore, if an area
contains a few large cities apart from each other, these cities may be grouped together under the
same DMA (e.g., Wichita-Hutchinson, Kansas; Chico-Redding, California).

A record in our advertising database is the amount a firm spent over a month in a given media
channel in a DMA. The media channels include TV (network, cable, syndication, and spot),
radio (network and local), newspapers (local and national), magazines, and outdoor advertising,
which we describe in detail in Appendix A. 17 In our analysis we focus on local DMA-level
advertising. Compared with national advertising, local advertising is particularly useful in
allowing us to exploit cross-sectional variation across DMAs.

The data on mortgages come from LoanPerformance, a loan-level database that provides a
detailed perspective on the nonagency securities market. The data include, as of December 2006,
more than 7,000 active home equity and nonprime loan pools that contain more than 7 million
active loans with over $1.6 trillion in outstanding balances. LoanPerformance estimates that, as
of 2006, the data cover over 90% of the universe of securitized nonprime loans. The dataset
includes all standard loan application variables, such as the loan amount, loan-to-value (LTV)

29, 2013)
17
   Although the data allow us to observe how much firms spend in these channels, we cannot identify which specific
outlet in that specific channel was used.
                                                       11
ratio, FICO credit score, interest rate information about the property being financed by the
borrower, and purpose of the loan. We have information on the type of mortgage loan (fixed rate,
adjustable rate, balloon, or hybrid) and the zip code where the dwelling is located. The data also
provide information on monthly loan-level performance for approved loans (delinquency), which
we use in some of our analysis.

In general, borrower creditworthiness can be assessed along two dimensions. First, one can use
borrower credit scores, known as FICO scores, as a measure of credit risk. These scores provide
a ranking of potential borrowers by the probability of having a negative credit event in the next
two years, with nearly all scores between 500 and 800 (see Avery et al. 2000). Second, one can
use the level of documentation of income and assets collected by the lender as a proxy of
borrower quality. Documentation in the market (and reported in the database) is categorized as
full, limited, or no documentation. Borrowers with full documentation verify both income and
assets. Borrowers with limited documentation usually provide no information about their income
but do provide some about their assets. “No-documentation” borrowers provide no information
about income or assets, which is a very rare degree of screening lenience on the part of lenders.
In our analysis, we combine limited and no-documentation borrowers and call them low-
documentation borrowers.

Typically loans are classified as either for purchase or for refinance. In this paper we focus
exclusively on loans for home purchases. We restrict our sample to cover owner-occupied single-
family residences, townhouses, or condominiums (single-unit loans account for more than 90%
of the loans in our sample). We drop nonconventional properties, such as those that are FHA- or
VA-insured or pledged properties, and also exclude buy-down mortgages. Only those loans with
valid FICO scores are used in our sample.

Since the advertising and mortgage datasets do not have unique identifiers that allow us to match
them directly, we need to rely on matching the datasets using lender names. We proceed in two
steps. First, we clean the names of lenders in the two datasets, accounting for spelling errors
(e.g., Bank of America, Bnk of America) or abbreviations (e.g., New Century, NC, NC
corporation). In the next step we hand-match company names reported by TNSMI to the
corresponding mortgage providers using a conservative approach: names for which we cannot
identify a unique match are excluded from the sample.

In our data, we are able to match unique mortgage provider names from the TNSMI database
with 571 out of nearly a thousand company names that exist in the mortgage database. Our
matched sample covers 105 of the 210 DMAs, which corresponds to 92% of the population in
the United States. Our data reliably cover advertising information between 2002 and 2006, and

                                               12
as a result we will be conducting analysis over this period whenever using information about
advertising.

IV. Empirical Analysis

IV.A. Descriptive Statistics

The matched mortgage providers in our sample advertised in all of the DMAs over our sample
period (January 2002 to December 2006). Los Angeles DMA has the highest number of
mortgage advertisers (49 unique mortgage advertisers). New York DMA had 38 and
Philadelphia DMA had 27 unique mortgage advertisers throughout the sample period. In terms of
total expenditures, the top five DMAs include Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco,
Philadelphia, and Chicago. Panel A of Table 1 reports the total advertising expenditures in the
top five DMAs.

More than 96% of DMA-level mortgage advertising goes through three main channels: local
newspapers, spot TV, and outdoor advertising (i.e., billboards). 18 The average quarterly spending
for mortgage lenders in local newspapers, spot TV, and outdoor advertising is $3.255 million,
$619,000, and $609,000 respectively. In Figure 1(a), we plot the total advertising expenditures in
these three outlets over the sample period by our matched sample of lenders. As can be observed
from this figure, there is significant variation in advertising expenditures both over time and
within a year: mortgage advertising expenditures are typically 25% lower in the first quarter of
the year compared to the average for the rest of the year. Year 2002 advertising expenditures are
considerably lower than the rest of the sample ($7 million). The yearly total-advertising
expenditure increases from $15 million to $23.5 million from 2003 to 2006.

Mortgage lenders use newspapers as the dominant channel of local advertising, accounting for
70% of total advertising expenditures, relative to 14% spent on spot TV and 14% on outdoor
advertising. Figure 1(b) shows that there is considerable variation in these expenditure shares
over time. For instance, the newspaper expenditure share is lowest in the first quarter of 2003
(53%). By the end of 2006 this amount increases to 80%. Similarly, spot TV (outdoor)
expenditures range between 2% (1%) and 31% (25%).

In Figure 2 we display the geographic distribution of regional advertising expenditure by
mortgage lenders in the 206 DMAs across the U.S. This includes DMAs in which our vendor did
collect data (represented in yellow; e.g. Mobile, Al - Pensacola, FL DMA). Red DMAs signify
regions where lenders spent between 10 and 50 million USD on local mortgage advertising over

18
     The remaining 4% is spent in cable TV and magazine categories.
                                                         13
the sample period (e.g. Orlando-Daytona Beach-Melbourne, FL DMA), while orange DMAS are
regions where lenders spent less than 10 million USD in local mortgage advertising (e.g.
Charleston, SC). Finally, DMAs in Brown represents regions where lenders spent more than 50
million USD for local advertising (e.g., San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose DMA).

It is worth noting that there is substantial variation in the use of local advertising channels
discussed earlier. For instance, in Orlando the two dominant channels were newspapers (48%)
and outdoor advertising (36%). In contrast, in Charleston, SC, the two main channels were spot
TV (56%) and outdoor advertising (30%). Similarly, in San Francisco, the two lead channels of
local advertising used by mortgage lenders were newspapers (56%) and spot TV (27%) with the
remainder spent on outdoor advertising.

The map clearly shows that there is wide heterogeneity in the intensity and channels of
advertising used by lenders across regions. Importantly, there is variation within regions with
booming real estate markets leading up to the crisis, which includes coastal markets such as
Florida and California. It is this regional variation that will be useful for us to identify the effects
of advertising on lending decisions.

Finally, Panels B and C of Table 1 present summary statistics of ARM and FRM loans originated
by banks over the sample period. The characteristics of loans originated by these banks are
comparable to those in other studies of LoanPerformance data (Keys et al. 2010): the average
loan-to-value ratio is 82%, the average FICO score is 654, and the average interest rate at
origination is around 8–9%.

IV.B. Main Results

In this section we present the main analysis of the paper. We start by computing the degree of
relative “expensiveness” of a given mortgage. This is defined as the price of a mortgage relative
to other mortgages after accounting for a rich set of borrower, contract, and regional
characteristics associated with a given mortgage. Next, we relate the expensiveness of the
mortgage sold by a lender to the degree of advertising by that lender, to study the role of
advertising in this market. Finally, we relate the expensiveness of the mortgage sold to
subsequent delinquencies on the mortgage. This helps us evaluate whether “expensiveness”—
even though constructed after conditioning on a rich set of controls—could reflect borrower risk.

IV.B.1. Measuring Mortgage Expensiveness

We first measure whether some mortgages are relatively more expensive than others. We start by
computing this measure for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and focus on reset rates, which
                                                  14
are anecdotally less salient (see Appendix B for examples) and have been discussed by policy
makers as a source of consumers’ confusion. We compute expensiveness based on the idea that if
two identical consumers obtain two ARMs of equal size and characteristics and with the same
initial interest rate, but the reset rate for one consumer is higher, then the consumer with the
higher reset rate is worse off, since she obtains a relatively more “expensive” loan. In this simple
example, given that consumers are identical, the difference in the reset rates would give the
degree of mortgage expensiveness. We apply this intuition in a regression framework: we
compute mortgage expensiveness as the residual of the following specification:

                             𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + Γ𝑖𝑙𝑡 𝑋𝑖𝑙𝑡 + ε𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 .

In this specification, i indexes the loan, j indexes the lender, t indexes the quarter, and l indexes
the market (DMA). Our dependent variable is the reset rate on the ARM mortgage, 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 .


The vector 𝑋𝑖𝑙𝑡 contains loan and borrower characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, FICO
score, whether the loan has a prepayment penalty, income characteristics and information on
income, racial and educational composition of the census tract in which the loan was issued.

We also condition on the initial interest rate of the loan, 𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 , in order to hold mortgage
characteristics as comparable as possible. The initial interest rate was set using all the
information at the lender’s disposal. It may therefore incorporate information on borrower
quality that is potentially relevant for loan repayment and which we may not possess. The
specification also includes quarter fixed effect, 𝛼𝑡 , to absorb aggregate shocks to mortgage
pricing, which can be driven by aggregate housing demand, interest rate policy, or credit supply
expansion. Finally, the specification also includes location fixed effect, 𝛼𝑙 , to proxy for local real
estate and mortgage market conditions that could affect loan repayment, such as the elasticity of
housing supply or competition in the mortgage market.

The results are presented in Table 2. As can be seen from column 1, the observable loan
characteristics have the expected coefficients. More creditworthy borrowers, as measured by
higher FICO scores, are charged lower interest rates. Mortgages backed by less collateral, with
higher loan-to-value ratios, have higher reset rates. The presence of a prepayment penalty
reduces the reset rate, and if the loan is low-documentation, it increases the reset rates. The
coefficient on the initial interest rate (β) is positive and statistically significant. Thus,
conditional on observed borrower characteristics, a high initial interest rate is positively
correlated with the reset rate, indicating that it reflects additional information on the borrower
not reflected in other observable characteristics.


                                                  15
Not all the mortgages in our data are ARMs. Approximately 27% are fixed-rate mortgages
(FRMs). One downside of using FRMs is that they have only one interest rate. As a result, these
regressions cannot condition on as much information as ARMs: we cannot use the initial interest
rate to control for lenders’ information that is not contained in observable borrower
characteristics. As a robustness check we also compute expensiveness by including FRMs and
present the results in column 2 of Table 2. To compute expensiveness for these mortgages we
use the initial interest as the dependent variable. As can be observed, the results are similar to
those obtained for ARMs. For instance, as before, the coefficient on credit score is negative,
while the loan-to-value ratio coefficient is positive.

Overall, our model does well in explaining the substantial variation in reset rates in our sample
with an adjusted R2 of 56%. The residual from the regression measures the ARM reset rate the
borrower was charged relative to the average borrower with the same set of observable
characteristics, the same initial interest rate, in the same region and the same quarter:


                          ε�𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 − �𝛽̂ 𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼�𝑡 + 𝛼�𝑙 + Γ
                                                                   �𝑖𝑙𝑡 𝑋𝑖𝑙𝑡 �.


Since the measure is computed from residuals it can take negative and positive values: mortgages
with negative (positive) expensiveness are cheaper (more expensive) than the mean mortgage
with the same characteristics. In interpreting the results using this measure it is important to
reemphasize that the essence of this metric is that if identical consumers obtain the same
mortgage with different reset rates, then the difference in the reset rates measures how much
worse was the choice of the consumer with the higher reset rate. In Figure 3(a) we plot these
residuals for ARMs. As can be observed, we find large differences in reset rates charged to
borrowers with the same characteristics in a given location. For completeness, in Figure 3(b) we
repeat this analysis for all mortgages and find similar patterns. Note that when we compute
expensiveness for all mortgages, we take the residuals for ARM loans using the regression
specification in column (1) of Table 2 and for FRM loans using the specification in column (2)
of Table 2.

A simple way of assessing the patterns in expensiveness is to plot the difference in mortgage
expensiveness between the 95th and 5th percentiles in a given DMA in a given quarter. We do
this in Figure 4(a). The mean difference in reset rates after conditioning on borrower, loan, and
regional characteristics is 3.1 percentage points. This is a large difference—in the raw data,
without adjusting for any lender, mortgage, or geographic characteristics this difference is 5.8
percentage points. Such high dispersion in interest rates is not unusual for financial products:
Hortacsu and Syverson (2004), for example, find substantial dispersion among S&P 500 index
funds with the 90-10 percentile price (fee) ratio of 8.2.

                                                   16
Borrowers with the same characteristics obtain substantially different ARM reset rates during the
sample period. These rates can differ because there is dispersion in the rates charged by a given
lender while all lenders charge on average the same rate; alternatively, lenders may charge on
average different mortgage rates, with some lenders being more expensive than others. To
compute whether a lender charges on average higher prices than other lenders in the same market
in a given quarter we average the expensiveness of individual loans for this lender in that
location and quarter. Formally, let 𝑛𝑗𝑙𝑡 be the number of loans of lender j in location l in quarter
t. Lender expensiveness is computed as:

                                                  1
                                        𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 =        � ε�𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡
                                                 𝑛𝑗𝑙𝑡
                                                       𝑖


Computing average lender expensiveness is also useful because we want to use this variable as
an input in regressions with advertising, which we observe at the lender level.

Figure 4(b) shows the distribution of differences between the 95th and 5th percentiles of lender
expensiveness in a given location and quarter. There are substantial differences in average
residual reset rates charged by different lenders. This distribution is somewhat less spread out
when compared with the difference across individual mortgages presented in Figure 3(a). This is
expected, since some of the dispersion at the loan level may be due to noise, and aggregating
decreases the amount of noise in our variable. The mean difference in reset rates charged by
lenders between the 95th and 5th percentiles is 2.8 percentage points. Thus, there is a substantial
variation among the average prices lenders charge for mortgages in a given market in the same
quarter.

In unreported tests we also recompute the distribution estimating the regressions at a much finer
level of geography (zip codes rather than DMAs). This alleviates concerns that differences in
regional factors vary significantly within the level of location that is defined in our regressions.
Our inferences are unchanged.

IV.B.2. Advertising and Expensiveness

In this section we explore the central question in the paper: does advertising persuade consumers
to enter expensive mortgages or does it provide information allowing the consumers to make
better mortgage choices? If mortgage advertising provides information to consumers, then the
cheaper lenders should be advertising. If, on the other hand, advertising misleads consumers,
then it is expensive lenders who do the advertising, using it to steer consumers to borrow from

                                                  17
them rather than from cheaper lenders. We test these hypotheses by examining whether
advertisers are relatively more “expensive.”

We first examine this hypothesis by plotting the distribution of residual reset rates for advertisers
and nonadvertisers in Figure 5. 19 As can be observed, the distribution of reset rates of advertisers
is shifted to the right of nonadvertisers. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the equality of the
two distributions at the 1% level. Thus, consistent with the persuasive view, lenders who
advertise sell more expensive mortgages.

While this simple cut of the data is suggestive of the persuasive view of advertising, we now
explore whether advertisers sell more expensive mortgages more systematically in a regression
framework by estimating the following specification:

                             𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙𝑡 ,


where 𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 is the independent variable of interest and measures the total dollar value
of local advertising of lender j in market l in quarter t. In subsequent specifications we also use
𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 to denote dollar value of local advertising through different media.

When we construct our measure of lender expensiveness, we already condition on borrower
characteristics and mortgage characteristics, including the initial interest, and compute the
expensiveness of a mortgage relative to other loans in the same location. In effect, we measure
how expensive a lender is in a given location relative to other lenders in the same location. This
is our dependent variable 𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 .


The specification includes lender fixed effect, 𝛼𝑗 , since we are interested in exploiting within
lender variation in advertising. For example, if predatory lenders are likely to advertise, our
lender fixed effect will absorb that variation. Similarly, lender fixed effects will control for
differences in lenders’ propensity to securitize mortgages (see Keys et al. 2010) or provide
renegotiations in the case of borrower distress (see Piskorski et al. 2010), or if some lenders are
more “consumer friendly,” have a better brand or cheaper access to capital.

The specification we estimate also includes location fixed effects, 𝛼𝑙 . Consequently, the results
we find are not driven by the notion that lenders advertise more in more attractive locations in
which they can charge more for mortgages because of local real estate and mortgage market
conditions. The specification also includes quarter fixed effect, 𝛼𝑡 , to absorb aggregate shocks to

19
   In this plot we purge the initial interest rate, borrower characteristics, location, and year fixed effects when
plotting the residuals as in Table 2.
                                                        18
mortgage pricing that may be correlated with advertising due to trends in advertising in the data.
Intuitively, in the specification above we compare whether a lender is more expensive relative to
nonadvertisers in regions in which it advertises more.

The results are presented in Table 3. The coefficient on the advertising in column 1 is positive
and statistically significant at 5 percent. This implies that, keeping observable borrower
characteristics fixed, lenders charge higher mortgage prices relative to other lenders in regions in
which they advertise relatively more. This result is inconsistent with the view that advertising
provided more information on mortgage pricing to consumers. Instead, it suggests that
advertising steered consumers to expensive mortgages, leading them to worse mortgage choices
than they would have otherwise made. This is the baseline result of this paper.

We examine whether the relationship between local advertising and mortgage pricing varies
across different types of media. Newspapers are the largest medium of local mortgage
advertising (see Table 1, Panel A and Figure 1(b)). Since other mediums of advertising are
significantly smaller, we aggregate them into a category called “other” advertising. The results
from this analysis are presented in columns 2 and 3. The effect of advertising on expensiveness
of ARM mortgages is driven by advertising in newspapers—the coefficient on newspaper
advertising is 17% larger than the coefficient on total advertising. This is an economically large
effect. The coefficient implies that a one-standard-deviation increase in advertising increases the
average reset rate a lender charges in that location by roughly 80 basis points, or approximately
one-half of a standard deviation in reset rates. Other advertising has a positive coefficient that is
slightly smaller than the coefficient on total advertising and is statistically insignificant.

We also replicate our results by adding data on FRMs. As mentioned above, we compute
expensiveness for all mortgages by taking the residuals for ARM loans using the regression
specification in column (1) of Table 2 and for FRM loans using the specification in column (2)
of Table 2. Together, the results presented above are consistent with the persuasive view of
advertising -- lenders use advertising to steer borrowers into more expensive mortgages. In the
remainder of the paper we dig deeper into the sources of this correlation and show that it is
unlikely to be driven by spurious factors.

IV.B.3. Delinquency

In the previous section we show that lenders sell relatively more expensive mortgages in
geographies in which they advertise relatively more and claim that this is evidence of lenders
using advertising to steer consumers into expensive mortgages. A potential alternative
explanation is that even after we condition on extensive observable borrower and loan
characteristics as well as the region and time period, these variables only partially capture
                                                 19
borrowers’ true ability to repay a loan. Advertisers charging higher mortgage rates might reflect
the fact that they lend to a pool of borrowers who are less likely to repay a loan.
We confront this alternative head-on and test whether advertising is positively correlated with
borrowers falling behind on their loan payments using the following regression:

                    𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙𝑡 .


Here, 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗𝑙𝑡 measurers the percent of loans made by lender j in location l in quarter t
that turned out to be delinquent. We follow the convention in the literature (e.g., Keys et al.
2010) and use an indicator variable of loan performance that takes a value of 1 if the borrower
becomes late by 90 days or more (90+ delinquent) in making payments within two years of
origination, and 0 otherwise. To make the specification comparable to the earlier one, we include
location, time, and lender fixed effects, 𝛼𝑙 , 𝛼𝑡 , and 𝛼𝑗 respectively. Thus, in this specification,
similar to those used in Table 3, we will exploit the variation within a lender in a given location
and in a given quarter.

The results of this exercise are presented in Table 4. If the alternative explanation holds and
advertisers attract borrowers who are less likely to repay a loan, we should find that these
borrowers are more likely to fall behind on their payments, and the coefficient on advertising in
the regression would be positive. In fact, the correlation of advertising and delinquency is
negative, whether we measure delinquency on the main sample of ARM loans or if we include
FRM loans. These findings are at odds with the alternative explanation outlined earlier.

Moreover, if advertising does not change the pool of borrowers, then it raises the interest rate for
a borrower of a given type. For a given borrower, higher interest rates should directly lead to
more delinquency and default, an effect that is independent of advertising since a borrower with
a given income stream has a more difficult time repaying a loan with higher interest payments.
This indirect effect of advertising through higher interest rates generates a positive correlation
between advertisers, who on average charge higher interest rates, and delinquency.

The fact that we find a negative, albeit statistically insignificant, relationship between advertising
and delinquency would suggest that advertising attracts borrowers who are more likely to repay a
loan. This effect is strong enough to overcome the indirect effect that advertising has on
delinquency because of increased interest rates. These delinquency results suggest that
advertisers should charge lower reset rates than nonadvertisers to borrowers who look the same
on observable characteristics, if pricing only reflected borrower characteristics. Our estimates of
the effect of advertising on loan prices are probably an underestimate of the true effect. Using


                                                 20
instrumental variables in the next section will allow us to obtain a better estimate of the true
effect of advertising.

IV.C. Evidence from Craigslist

In this section we explicitly address the concern that lenders advertise in regions with borrowers
who are worse on unobservables, by exploiting variation in advertising that is uncorrelated with
borrowers’ ability to repay. We use the introduction of Craigslist into different markets over time
to obtain variation in mortgage advertising. Craigslist is one of the largest online forums for
classified advertisement. While its main business is to provide a forum for free advertising of
goods, jobs, apartments for rent, and personal ads, it also provides a forum for free mortgage
advertising in its financial services section. Appendixes C.4-C.6 provide historical examples of
mortgage classifieds on Craigslist during our sample period for Jacksonville, FL, Washington
D.C. and Indianapolis, IN, respectively, highlighting mortgage related classifieds, such as
“Mortgage rates as low as 1.25%.” Moreover, in a 2011 survey, 21 percent of consumers
reported that they obtain most information about "Local Housing and Real Estate" from “other
websites”, defined as a “NOT print or TV news org. site or gov’t site, includes nat’l sites that
offer local info, such as weather.com, craigslist [emphasis added], or patch.com" (Pew Research
Center, 2011, p. 57). Craigslist’s appeal is large enough that it has had a significant impact on
job advertising in newspapers (Kroft and Pope 2012).

To ensure that Craigslist is indeed a viable venue for mortgage classifieds, providing a plausible
source of variation in mortgage advertising, we collect data on the extent of mortgage related
classified on Craigslist financial services page during the period of our sample. We provide the
detail on data collection in Appendix C and present the results in Table C1. Across all 23
markets, mortgage related classified represent a substantial share of Craigslist financial services
classifieds, from 4.8% in Dallas, TX, to 12.3% in Pittsburg, PA. Therefore, Craigslist
introduction could plausibly decrease the amount of local mortgage advertising, especially in
newspapers. Following this reasoning, we first show that Craigslist’s introduction, while
unrelated to the mortgage market conditions, indeed decreased mortgage advertising, especially
in newspapers. Next, we exploit the entry of Craigslist into different markets to estimate the
impact that the Craigslist induced drop in advertising had on mortgage prices.

The advantage of Craigslist is that it is segregated across markets. The Website for San Francisco
classifieds is separate from the Chicago Website. Further, as Figure 6 shows, the introduction of
Craigslist has been staggered across the United States. The service was first introduced in San
Francisco in 1999, and the geographic expansion continued through the duration of our sample,
in the United States and abroad. These features allow us to exploit the introduction of Craigslist
across different regions during our sample period.
                                                21
IV.C.1 Descriptive analysis

Before we formally exploit the variation in advertising induced by Craigslist, and the resulting
impact on mortgage pricing, we first study whether the introduction of Craigslist has the
hypothesized effect on mortgage pricing graphically. We expect that mortgage advertising
decreases upon Craigslist entry, also decreasing mortgage pricing of advertisers.

In Figure 7 we plot the distribution of residual reset rates for advertisers and nonadvertisers
across our sample, separated based on whether the observation had a Craigslist presence or not. 20
Nonadvertisers should not be affected by Craigslist entry and are the control group. Indeed,
Craigslist has little effect on pricing of mortgages by nonadvertisers. The modes of the
distribution are the same, as is the left tail—the only difference is that reset rates are slightly
higher for Craigslist observations in the right tail. Craigslist entry has a different effect on
advertisers, which are our treatment group. The distribution of interest rates for advertisers is
shifted to the left after Craigslist entry, including shifting the mode of the distribution left. The
right tail shifts up in the same way as in the control group. This left shift in the distribution
suggests that Craigslist induces advertisers to decrease reset rates relative to non-advertisers.

IV.C.2 Regression analysis

We now more formally examine whether Craigslist entry leads to a decrease in advertising, and
whether this shift in advertising leads to a change in mortgage pricing. We first estimate the
effect that the introduction of Craigslist has on mortgage advertising:

                    𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐶𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑔𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ν𝑗𝑙𝑡 ,


where 𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐶𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑔𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝑙𝑡 is a dummy variable indicating the presence of Craigslist in a
given location l in period t. These specifications include market, time, and lender fixed effects,
𝛼𝑙 , 𝛼𝑡 , and 𝛼𝑗 respectively. Market fixed effects account for the fact that Craigslist enters
markets where advertising happens to be high. Time fixed effects control for the fact that
advertising and Craigslist reach expanded during our sample. Lender fixed effects control for the
possibility that lenders that advertise happen to do so in markets that Craigslist enters. Therefore,
by using this specification, we are exploiting variation in advertising of a given lender in a given
market.




20
     We purge the initial interest rate, borrower characteristics, location, and year fixed effects.
                                                              22
A simple example helps illustrate the empirical strategy. Suppose there are two markets A and B
with Craigslist entering market A at some point during our sample. Market A forms the treatment
group while Market B forms the control group. Our specification compares the amount of
advertising that lender j did in Market A before Craigslist entry to the amount of advertising the
same lender did after Craigslist entry. We compare this change to the change in advertising of
lender j in Market B, which did not experience Craigslist entry.

We present the results from the first stage in Table 5, Panel A. We find that Craigslist entry in a
market decreases the amount of advertising. The economic impact is large and suggests a
reduction in amount of advertising by $2,465 per quarter for a given lender. This result is highly
statistically significant and exceeds the Stock and Yogo (2005) statistical tests for weak
instruments. We next examine if the effect is larger for newspaper classifieds, which are close
substitutes to free classifieds provided by Craigslist. As is shown in columns 2 and 3, the
Craigslist introduction decreases newspaper advertising by $1553, twice as much as other
advertising, $652. These results resonate well with findings in Kroft and Pope (2012), who show
that Craigslist had a large effect on job advertising in newspapers.

Now that we have established that the entry of Craigslist had a large and significant impact on
mortgage advertising, we want to exploit this variation in an instrumental variable setting to
assess the effect of advertising on the overpricing of ARM mortgages. Recall that our calculation
of overpricing 𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 already conditions on consumers’ observable characteristics and location
fixed effects. The endogeneity concern we had in the baseline specification was that
unobservable consumer characteristics, which are not reflected in the delinquency rate but affect
lenders’ profitability, are correlated with advertising. When we use the Craigslist instrument, our
identifying assumption is that Craigslist does not enter regions in which mortgage advertising
has already decreased, and that during the same time lenders who advertise in this area also
experience an increase in unobservable borrower quality relative to other nonadvertising lenders
in this region.

While we do not believe that this alternative to our exclusion restriction is very plausible,
especially since mortgage advertising is a relatively small part of Craigslist advertising, we
nevertheless explore this argument further. First, to explore whether Craigslist enters areas in
which mortgage advertising is in decline, we examine the timing of the advertising decline
relative to Craigslist entry and present the results in Table 6. Advertising starts declining only
one quarter before Craigslist entry, but the magnitude of the decline significantly increases upon
entry and already doubles a quarter after entry. The one-quarter lead suggests that Craigslist




                                                23
entry in a market is not a complete surprise to the market participants, who decrease their
advertising a bit expecting the entry that is soon to follow. 21

Second, in Table 6 we show that Craigslist entry does not predict changes in the borrower pool
relative to regions that did not experience the introduction of Craigslist. This is the case for
borrower quality as measured by credit scores, loan-to-value ratios, prepayment penalty, or the
share of low-documentation loans. The coefficients around the Craigslist effect are economically
small, statistically weak, and unstable. For example, for the loan-to-value ratio the largest
coefficient is 0.231, where the mean ratio is 87 and the effect disappears a quarter after Craigslist
entry. The case for low-documentation loans is similar, with magnitudes being small and
coefficients unstable. The most stable change in observables correlated with Craigslist entry is
the prepayment pool, but the magnitudes are also economically small.

So far we have demonstrated that Craigslist entry decreases mortgage advertising and it plausibly
satisfies the necessary exclusion restriction. We conclude our analysis by exploiting variation in
Craigslist entry to estimate the effect of advertising on the pricing of ARM mortgages with the
following equation:

                                          � 𝚥𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙𝑡 ,
                              𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝚤𝑠𝚤𝑛𝑔

          � 𝚥𝑙𝑡 is the fitted value from the first stage. The standard errors reported in our
where 𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝚤𝑠𝚤𝑛𝑔
analysis account for the generated regressor from the first stage. The analysis from the second
stage is presented in Table 5, Panel B. Column 1 shows that the coefficient on advertising is
positive and highly statistically significant. This confirms our hypothesis that advertising is used
in mortgage markets to steer consumers to more expensive mortgages, rather than providing
information, which would lead consumers to obtain better, cheaper mortgages.

In columns 2 and 3, we separately estimate the effect of advertising across various types of
media and find that advertising in newspapers has the largest effect on mortgage prices. The
coefficient on advertising in other media is highly statistically significant, but economically
smaller. The effects are similar, both quantitatively and qualitatively, if we include FRMs as a
robustness check (Panel C). Jointly, results up to this point confirm that mortgage advertising
was used to steer consumers into ARM mortgages with higher reset rates, leading consumers into
suboptimal choices. This stands in stark contrast to the view that advertising in mortgage markets
provides an informational role, helping consumers choose cheaper products.


21
  This notion is reasonable since the entry is discussed in several online forums in the few periods before Craigslist
enters a given market. In particular, individuals can request that Craigslist add a city in a forum, where user votes
can potentially influence such a decision. http://www.ehow.com/how_10065823_city-added-craigslist.html
                                                         24
V. Discussion of Results

V.A. Magnitude of the effect

We now provide a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation to interpret the magnitude of our
estimates. We use the instrumental variable estimate, because it is identified by the cleanest
source of variation. The coefficient of 0.0711 implies that a $1,000 increase in quarterly
advertising expenses increases the average reset rate of loans made by that lender by 7.1 basis
points. The average lender that advertises spends $25,460 per quarter, which translates into a
reset rate 181 basis points higher.

For ease of comparison we provide alternative ways of interpreting these magnitudes. The
average mortgage amount in our data is approximately $200,000. To obtain the upper bound of
this effect, assume that the mortgages are not prepaid or renegotiated, nor do they default. This
calculation would be appropriate for borrowers who continue to obtain mortgages from
advertisers and continuously pay the higher rate even upon refinancing a mortgage. For the
average ARM mortgage in the data, the reset rate comes into effect after two years and lasts for
fifteen years. Further, assume a 10% discount rate on the mortgage payments to bring them to
present value. This implies that the consumer who obtains a mortgage from an average
advertising lender pays approximately $21,250 more in present-value terms.

As stated, this estimate is an upper bound on the possible overpayment amount through higher
interest payments. In reality, mortgages default, are prepaid, or are renegotiated. Therefore, the
borrower’s effective time of overpayment is shorter than the duration of the mortgage. For
instance, if the average borrower pays the reset on an ARM for three years and the overpayment
of the current mortgage does not spill into the next mortgage, then the present value of
overpayment is approximately $7,440. While this is a substantial amount, it is in the same order
of magnitude as the estimates of losses faced by mortgage borrowers because they do not
properly account for broker service fees given in Hall and Woodward (2012).

It is worth noting that this back-of-the-envelope calculation relies on several simplifying
assumptions. For example, if ARMs have prepayment penalties, and higher reset rates ex post
lead to larger penalties, this will increase borrowers’ mortgage cost. Therefore, our calculations
should be interpreted with appropriate caution. Moreover, the IV estimate that we use represents
a local treatment effect, so the usual caution about its broader applicability is in order when
interpreting these magnitudes. Nevertheless, we find that the back-of-the-envelope serves as a
useful benchmark when asserting that consumers choose economically significantly worse
mortgages as a consequence of mortgage advertising.
                                               25
Further, our calculation only considers the direct cost that borrowers incur from being steered to
a more expensive mortgage through advertising. Mortgages with higher interest rates also have
the indirect effect of increasing consumers’ probability of default. For instance, Rajan et al.
(2010) find that increasing the interest rate by a percentage point significantly increases the
probability of default. 22 The cost of this indirect effect is difficult to quantify in dollar terms but
can represent a significant welfare loss to the consumer.

V.B. Mortgage Advertising and Target Groups

If advertising exploits uninformed consumers and steers them into expensive mortgages, then we
would expect mortgage advertising to be most effective with consumers who are potentially less
informed about mortgages and therefore more vulnerable to manipulation. Woodward and Hall
(2012) show that groups that are likely less informed, such as minorities and the less educated,
are charged higher brokerage fees in the mortgage market.

We examine whether the effect of advertising on mortgage pricing differs across these groups.
We first compute the share of loans to minorities by weighing each loan by the share of
minorities in the zip code in which the loan was issued for each lender/year/quarter. We define
observations with a share of minorities below the median as low minority share and those with
an above the median share of minorities as high minority share. We use the same approach to
find lenders with a high and low share of educated (households with a BA degree) and poor
borrowers (as defined by the Census).

We reestimate our baseline specification,

                              𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙𝑡 ,

on the subsamples of loans with high and low minority share, high and low education share, and
high and low poverty share. The results are presented in Panel A of Table 7. As predicted, the
effect of advertising on mortgage pricing is concentrated in lenders with high-minority portfolio
areas. This suggests that within lenders, advertising is effective at drawing borrowers into more
expensive mortgages only for lenders who lend heavily to minorities. We find no such effect for
lenders with a low minority share. Similarly, the effect of advertising is concentrated in lenders
who lend to less-educated areas and areas with a higher share of poor borrowers. Together these

22
  In our data advertising has a negative correlation with borrower defaults, conditioning on borrowers’ observable
characteristics. From that we infer that the unobservable quality of borrowers who are attracted to advertising is
better than suggested by their observable characteristics. Conditioning on borrowers’ true underlying quality, higher
ARM reset rates would lead to more defaults.
                                                         26
results strongly suggest that mortgage advertising was used to steer consumers with little
information into ARM mortgages with higher reset rates, leading this subset of consumers into
suboptimal choices.

Last we examine whether advertising in the mortgage market is targeted at groups that are less
informed and more susceptible to deceptive advertising, consistent with our earlier hypothesis
that advertising in the mortgage market was used to persuade consumers and steer them into
expensive mortgages. Anecdotal evidence, such as the recent ACLU lawsuit of Morgan Stanley,
suggests that lenders systematically targeted African-American borrowers, using advertising to
steer them into ARM mortgages with high interest rates (see footnote 12).

We examine the demographic characteristics of markets and correlate them to advertising
activities. Our information on characteristics of regions—such as the demographics—comes
from census tract information collected in 2000. Because we have no variation in demographic
characteristics of a market, we collapse the data to the market/lender level. We estimate the
following regression:

                                      𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑗𝑙 = 𝛼𝑗 + Γ𝑗𝑙 𝑋𝑗𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙 .

In this specification j indexes the lender and l indexes the market. The dependent variable
𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑗𝑙 is the average advertising for lender j in market l over the quarters in which j was
active in market l. The vector 𝑋𝑗𝑙 contains information on income and racial composition of the
DMA in which the lender was active. 23 As before, the specification includes lender fixed effect,
𝛼𝑗 , to absorb differences across lenders. We present the results in Table 7, Panel B.

We find that lenders advertise more in regions with higher shares of minority households
regardless of the means of advertising. Moreover, they dedicate more total advertising dollars in
areas with a lower percentage of educated households. They do not seem to target poor
households. The coefficient on the share of poor households is small, negative and very noisy.24
It is likely that, while poor borrowers are more susceptible to advertising, they are less likely to
be issued a loan, which makes advertising less profitable in those areas. It is worth noting that,
by construction, subprime lenders tend to originate mortgages in low-income regions (i.e.,
subprime regions). These results demonstrate that, even within such regions, they target
advertising at certain populations.


23
   To compute the demographic characteristics of a DMA we weigh the demographic characteristics of zip codes by
the number of households.
24
   An alternative specification that does not include lender fixed effects, which examines the unconditional use of
advertising, yields quantitatively similar results with similar levels of statistical precision.
                                                        27
Finally, we provide some more descriptive statistics that are also suggestive of the broader role
that advertising plays in the mortgage market. Reset rates in ARMs, which we examine, are one
feature of mortgage products that has been anecdotally described as difficult to understand or
observe by consumers. The other has been “nontraditional” mortgages. These “nontraditional”
mortgages include ARM mortgages as well as others whose payments change in the future, such
as interest-only (IO) mortgages and those with balloon payments. In unreported tests we find that
lenders who advertise more are more likely to originate “nontraditional” mortgages.

Overall, the findings in this section suggest that the mortgage lenders advertised in regions that
are low-income and dominated by minorities. Moreover, the products originated by lenders who
are heavy advertisers tend to be nontraditional. These results are consistent with our previous
analysis, which suggests that lenders exploit the lack of information consumers have about the
nature and price of mortgage products and use advertising to steer consumers toward expensive
mortgages.

VI. Conclusion

We use a unique dataset that combines information on advertising by subprime lenders and the
mortgages originated by them over the period 2002 to 2007 to study the relationship between
advertising and the nature of mortgages obtained by consumers. The collage of evidence in the
paper is inconsistent with the “informative view” that says that advertising decreases search costs
and allows consumers to find better products, and instead supports the “persuasive view” that
suggests that lenders used advertising to steer consumers who lack the knowledge and
experience into expensive choices.

Our analysis focuses on the role that advertising plays in helping consumers choose the cheapest
mortgage from a set of mortgages. We do not explore whether advertising improves consumers’
choice of whether to take on a mortgage or select a more suitable mortgage product. A more
rigorous analysis would require a benchmark specifying optimal mortgage choices for a given
consumer. Establishing such a benchmark to assess the informational role of advertising in
helping consumers choose among different types of mortgages is a fruitful area of future
research.

The large number of delinquencies in the mortgage market in the recent financial crisis—the
highest since the Great Depression—has provoked an immediate response from policy makers. A
large thrust of this regulation was predicated upon the idea that lenders used advertising to steer
naïve consumers toward expensive mortgages. The political imperative to act quickly prevented
any empirical analysis to substantiate this premise. Our paper is the first systematic empirical
study that investigates and provides support for the claim that mortgage advertising was harmful
                                                28
to consumers, thereby demonstrating a potential role for regulation of advertising in this market.
It is important to note that while the new financial regulation--new rules that ask lenders to
provide clearer information on ARM reset rates as well as the new regulatory structure--attempts
to address the issues discussed in the paper, our work provides no guidance on whether or by
how much they will result in advertising playing an informational role and helping consumers
choose better mortgages. Understanding these issues remains a fruitful area of research (see
Agarwal et al. 2012).

This table presents summary statistics of different datasets used in our analysis. Panel A reports the total
advertising expenditures in the top five DMAs between 2002 and 2006. Panels B and C present summary
statistics of ARM and FRM loans originated by banks over the sample period. Loan-specific attributes
include Reset Rate, Initial Interest Rate, Reset Time, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), Loan Amount, credit
score (FICO), Prepay Penalty Indicator, and Low Documentation Indicator. Panels B and C also
summarize demographic information of the areas where these loans were given (% Minority, Median
Household Income, % Poor, % Educated (college degree), % Female, and Average House Value).

This table reports the estimation of the following specification: 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + Γ𝑖𝑙𝑡 𝑋𝑖𝑙𝑡 +
ε𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑡 , where i indexes the loan, j indexes the lender, t indexes the quarter, and l indexes the market. The
dependent variable is the reset rate on the ARM mortgage (first column) or the initial interest rate on the
FRM loan (second column). Low Doc is an indicator for loans that require low documentation at loan
application. Other controls include the demographic information for the zip codes in which the loans are
made (% nonwhite, median and mean household income, % poor, % female, % with BA degree, median
and mean house value). Standard errors are clustered by quarter and reported in parentheses under
coefficient estimates. (***), (**), and (*) denote statistical significance for 1%, 5%, and 10% levels.

In this table, we estimate the following specification: 𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑗𝑡 ,
where the dependent variable measures how expensive mortgages are in a region from a lender. Lender
“expensiveness” is computed by aggregating individual loan level residuals obtained from specification
reported in Table 2. Advertising is the total dollar value of local advertising of lender j in market l in
quarter t. Panel A reports the coefficients using the ARM loan sample. Panel B reports the coefficients
using all mortgages. We compute expensiveness for all mortgages using residuals from the specification
estimated in column (1) of Table 2 for ARM loans and in column (2) of Table 2 for FRM loans. Standard
errors are reported in parentheses under coefficient estimates. (***), (**), and (*) denote statistical
significance for 1%, 5%, and 10% levels.

𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑖𝑗𝑡 , where the dependent variable measures how expensive mortgages are in a region from a
lender. Lender “expensiveness” is computed by aggregating individual loan level residuals obtained from
specification reported in Table 2. Advertising is the total dollar value of local advertising of lender j in
market l in quarter t. We use Craigslist entry to a region as an instrument in the first stage. Panel A reports
the results of the first stage estimation for different measures of advertising (Total, Other, and

In Panel A we estimate the following specification: 𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑗𝑙𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙𝑡 , where the dependent variable measures how
expensive mortgages are in a region from a lender. Lender “expensiveness” is computed by aggregating individual loan level residuals obtained
from the specification reported in Table 2 using the ARM loan sample. Advertising is the total dollar value of local advertising of lender j in
market l in quarter t. We split the sample of lender/quarter/DMA observations by the share of loans weighted by the demographic characteristics of
the area the loan was made in. High/Low represent observations above/below the median of the characteristic. Educated is the percentage of
households with a BA degree. Standard errors are clustered by quarter and reported in parentheses under coefficient estimates. Panel B estimates
the following specification: 𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑗𝑙 = 𝛼𝑗 + Γ𝑗𝑙 𝑋𝑗𝑙 + ε𝑗𝑙 , where the dependent variable measures the average advertising for lender j in market
l over the quarters in which j was active in market l. The vector 𝑋𝑗𝑙 contains information on income and racial composition of the DMA in which
the lender was active. (***), (**), and (*) denote statistical significance for 1%, 5%, and 10% levels.

Figure 4(a) plots the kernel density of difference in mortgage expensiveness between the 95th and 5th percentiles in a given DMA in a given
quarter. Expensiveness of a loan is defined as the residual ARM reset rate that a borrower was charged relative to the reset rate paid by an average
borrower with the same set of observable characteristics, the same initial interest rate, in the same region and the same quarter (the residual from
Column 1, Table 2, averaged within lender quarter DMA). Figure 4(b) shows the kernel density of differences between the 95th and 5th
percentiles of lender expensiveness in a given location and quarter. Lender expensiveness is computed as the average the expensiveness of
individual loans for this lender in that location and quarter (combined residuals from Columns 1 and 2, Table 2, averaged within lender quarter
DMA).

                    Appendix B. Examples of Mortgage Advertisements

 In this section we present several ARM advertisements in newspapers, the most popular
channel of local mortgage advertising. Here we present examples in three different
newspapers: Washington Post, New York Post, and Denver Post. As we discuss in the
body of the paper, our focus is on establishing the relationship between advertising and
the ARM reset rate, with the underlying notion that reset rate is the less salient (shrouded)
characteristic of a mortgage. Below, we present four ARM advertisements, which support
this view. The first two examples present mortgage advertisements, which have been the
subject of lawsuits related to fraudulent advertising. The last example presents two
additional advertisements, which have not been subject to litigation.

Regardless of the litigation status, these advertisements have a common feature, which is
the backbone behind our mechanism. They all prominently state the introductory interest
rate making it the focal, salient part of the advertisement. None of the advertisements
mention the reset rate or the index that will be used at the time of reset. The most
informative advertisement is by the Pentagon Credit Union in Washington Post on
August 5, 2006 (Appendix B.3). It states the APR of 7.045% in addition to the
introductory rate of 5.625% for five years. Note that there is no mention of how the APR
is computed. 25

In the first example (Appendix B.1), the lender DCG Mortgage from New York is
advertising a 1% interest rate loan (New York Post, January 18, 2007). This ad vas the
subject of the legal settlement agreement between the New York Banking Department
and Sage Credit Company (formerly named DCG Mortgage), because it failed to “clearly
and conspicuously disclose the actual terms of repayment of the loans, including that the
advertised low interest rate and low monthly payments are subject to increase and do not
last over the life of the loan.” The advertising is not clear on when the mortgage is going
to reset from “1% low rate” to a higher rate nor the index used. Statements in the
advertisement implied that “no income verification” and “no asset verification” loans are
products that are particularly suited to those with bad credit. Other advertised terms were
not only misleading but also factually incorrect: the advertising offered mortgage loans
with “40–50 year” terms. This violates the General Regulations of the Banking Board
Part 82.2(d) that term of any mortgage loan given on a one- to four-family owner-
occupied residence cannot exceed forty years.

25
  If the APR is computed according to regulation then the Official Staff Commentary to Regulation Z,
Section 226.17 (c) (10) determines how the index and the reset rate are used to compute it.
                                                   52
In the second example (Appendix B.2), Green River Mortgage Company from Denver,
CO, is advertising a loan in the Denver Post (Match 2, 2006). The advertised mortgage
which resets in the future, is advertised as a “10 Year Fixed Payment Plan” or “10 Year
Fixed” at 3.95%. It does not mention that this mortgage is an ARM. The Office of the
Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Section in Colorado deemed this advertisement
deceptive and misleading, because it suggested that the initial teaser rate was a fixed
interest rate for an extended period of time.

In the third example (Appendix B.3) we present two advertisements from the Washington
Post on August 5 2006. These two advertisements were not subject to litigation, and are
examples which were not deemed legally deceptive during the period of our sample. Both
advertisements disclose that the mortgages are adjustable (mention ARM) and the period
after which the adjustment will occur. On the other hand, while they both prominently
display an interest rate, neither explicitly states the index which will be used to adjust the
interest rate to the reset rate. Rather, they both state the APR, which is an amalgamation
of several factors including the potential reset rate.

stores more than 2500 snapshots of Craigslist going back to 1998.

We collect data on mortgage related Craigslist posts using the following steps. First, we
obtain a list of all Craigslist pages maintained on the Wayback Machine for each market
in each year. For example, Appendix C.1 shows a graphical representation of the
Wayback Machine coverage for the Dallas Craigslist in 2005. 28 If multiple pages exist in
a given market in a given month, we choose the earliest dated page. Then, we access the
list of all posts kept under “financial services.” Appendix C.2 shows the snapshot of
Craigslist in the Dallas market on Oct 18, 2005 29 and snapshot of financial services posts
in Appendix C.3.30, 31 Last, we count the number of all post on a given page, and any
posts which carry in the title terms “mortgage,” or, in the same post “home” and “loan.”
In Table C1, we report the number of snapshots stored by Wayback, average number of
postings listed in a given snapshot, and the percentage of mortgage related posts to total
number of posts listed under “financial services” tag for selected markets. 32

In addition to collecting data on mortgage classified in a systematic manner, we also
report full list of financial services related posts and highlight mortgage classifieds on
randomly selected dates in three other markets as examples: Washington DC,
Jacksonville, FL and Indianapolis, IN. Appendix C.4 contains postings under “financial
services” section between May 27, 2004 and June 5, 2004 in Washington DC. Appendix

   Almost all the links provided in the page reported in Panel are non-functional, e.g. Wayback Machine
doesn't have the details of the posts archived.

   In generating these statistics, we eliminated duplicate posts as a snapshot can be a duplicate of the last
one. Wayback reports that this happens about 25% of the time across 420,000,000 websites it stores (see
http://faq.web.archive.org/)

C.5 contains postings between July 16, 2005 and August 13, 2005 in Jacksonville, FL.
Appendix C.6 contains postings under “financial services” section between April 13,
2006 and April 29, 2006 in Indianapolis, IN.

As can be observed, there is ample evidence of mortgage classifieds on Craigslist of the
kind we had described in the paper. For instance, between May 27, 2004 and June 5,
2004 in Washington DC, there are 6 mortgage related posts out of 40 posts that are
related to financial services. Similarly, Jacksonville had 15 mortgage related posts out of
approximately 90 posts that were related to financial services. Finally, Indianapolis had
17 mortgage related posts out of 93 posts under financial services.
