                                               ABSTRACT

This paper explores new estimates of the number of veterans and the value of veterans' benefits --
both cash benefits and land grants -- from the Revolution to 1900. Benefits, it turns out, varied substantially
from war to war. The veterans of the War of 1812, in particular, received a smaller amount of benefits
than did the veterans of the other nineteenth century wars. A number of factors appear to account for
the differences across wars. Some are familiar from studies of other government programs: the previous
history of veterans' benefits, the wealth of the United States, the number of veterans relative to the
population, and the lobbying efforts of lawyers and other agents employed by veterans. Some are less
familiar. There were several occasions, for example, when public attitudes toward the war appeared
to influence the amount of benefits. Perhaps the most important factor, however, was the state of the
federal treasury. When the federal government ran a surplus, veterans were likely to receive additional
benefits; when it ran a deficit, veterans' hopes for additional benefits went unfilled. Veterans' benefits
were, to use the terms a bit freely, more like a luxury than a necessity.

                                       1. Veterans' Benefits by War2
           This paper compares veterans' benefits across America's nineteenth-century wars and

explores the determinants of the level of benefits. These comparisons are based on new estimates of

the number of pensions, the value of cash pensions, and the amount and value of land grants. The

amount of benefits, it turns out, varied substantially from war to war and depended on several factors

– the wealth of the United States, the previous history of veterans' benefits, the number of veterans

relative to the general population, lobbying by agents for the veterans, and so on. Perhaps the most

important factor, however, was the state of the federal treasury. Veterans’ benefits were, to use the

term somewhat freely, a luxury: When the federal treasury was in the black demands for additional

benefits were approved; when it was in the red demands for additional benefits were denied.

           By veterans’ benefits we mean simply money or other assets paid to former members of the

armed forces. In many cases benefits were simply cash paid to a veteran, often in the veteran's old

age, or to the veteran's widow or children. In-kind benefits, however, were important in some cases.

Land grants were important before the Civil War. Old soldier's homes, as they were termed, have

been important since the Civil War, although facilities for retired army and naval personnel were

established earlier. Health care provided through the veterans system has been important since the

First World War, although military hospitals were sometimes pressed into service even earlier.

    From Lincoln's second inaugural, this statement became the motto of the Veterans Department.

 The idea for this paper emerged from a conversation that one of us had many years ago with Lawrence Fisher of
Rutgers University, Newark.


                                                          3
Educational benefits were first provided, as far as we are aware, for veterans of World War I and

became famous with the GI bill for veterans of World War II. Veterans have also been the

beneficiaries of veterans' preference laws that give veterans a leg up in the pursuit of civil service

jobs. Private firms could also introduce a preference for veterans. Here we will focus on the

amounts spent by the federal government for cash payments and the amount and value of the land

grants. Although it is hard to be certain, we believe that our totals include the great bulk of benefits

paid to America's veterans in the nineteenth century.

       Since benefits were paid after, sometimes long after, a war ended and the veteran returned to

civilian life, we will use present values to compare veterans' benefits of different wars. In effect, we

are asking what the value would be of a bond given to each veteran at the end of the war that would

have produced income equal to the benefits the veteran later received. As soon as one begins to

calculate present values, of course, various questions arise: what discount rate should be used, how

money paid to widows and children should be counted, and so on. We address these questions by

computing variants, for example by using alternative discount rates. As it turns out, the broad

differences to which we draw attention do not depend on the way present values are calculated.



                           2. What Explains the Level of Benefits?

In many cases veterans' benefits were simply deferred pay. When soldiers volunteered or were

drafted they were promised a reward after the war. The contract might have been explicit or implicit:

Retirement benefits might have been part of the recruitment package; but even when there was no

explicit promise soldiers might have assumed that they would be rewarded after the war simply

because legislation rewarding veterans was passed after previous wars.




                                                  4
           Sometimes there is more to veterans' benefits, however, than deferred pay. We also reward

veterans to express our gratitude for the risks they have taken and the hardships they have suffered.

The analogy with gratuities paid for more mundane services, although it may be unpleasant to think

about it in these terms, is apt. We often give a gratuity because it is part of the pay for the services

rendered, but sometimes we give a larger gratuity to reward extraordinary service. Sometimes we

use military language to describe a civilian gratuity: we reward someone generously because they

“went beyond the call of duty.” In the nineteenth century civilian language was used, on occasion,

to describe veterans' benefits: Veterans' benefits were referred to as the “veterans' gratuity.” George

Washington referred to the distinction between deferred pay and gratuities in a circular letter to the

governors defending the pension awarded his officers. The pension was part of their hire, "…it was

the price of their blood, and of your independency; it is therefore more than a common debt, it is a

debt of honor; it can never be considered as a pension or gratuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly

discharged."3

           The decision to reward veterans was always a contentious political decision that was

influenced by a number of factors. We will discuss these factors in this section in general terms and

then apply them to the cases that follow. Most of these forces can be grouped under six headings:

           (1) The previous history of veterans' benefits. Veterans' benefits are a good example of a

path-dependent process. The amount veterans received after the last war produces a strong

gravitational force. If veterans of the last war received $100 per month starting at age 62, a strong

presumption is established that veterans of the next war should get same pension. If they receive less,

they have a strong basis for claiming that they have been treated unfairly. If they receive more, they

can be criticized for being greedy, and the way is opened for veterans of previous wars who can

demand more benefits based on equity.

    Quoted in Glasson (1918, 43).


                                                    5
        This does not mean that benefits inevitably ratchet upward. At times benefit systems have

come under heavy criticism. Perhaps after the last war benefits were extended to individuals with

dubious claims to service. Or perhaps benefits were extended through "pension marriages" – aged

veterans marrying young women so the women and their children could receive a pension after the

veterans died. If so, there may be a reaction in the form of stricter eligibility requirements when the

next set of veterans ask for benefits. As with other path-dependent processes, the accidents of history

may shape the course of events. The occupant of the White House might be important: A former

military officer, for example, might be more sympathetic to veterans.

        (2) Secular changes in national wealth. As the United States has grown richer it has been

able to reward its veterans more generously. Indeed, for some purposes it makes more sense to

measure benefits relative to national wealth when comparing benefits across wars. In other words,

the right question might be whether veterans of one war received more or less relative to wealth in

their era compared with veterans of another war.

        (3) The number of veterans. The number of veterans is an important determinant of their

political influence. As usual, numbers cut two ways. A larger number of veterans means that

veterans (and their families) have more votes to offer politicians who support higher benefits. On the

other hand, a larger number of veterans means that taxes have to be raised in order to pay for higher

benefits, or that the benefits provided other citizens have to be cut. Either decision involves heavy

political costs. It may be possible to provide a small number of veterans with higher benefits without

raising taxes to the point that the increase is visible to tax payers.

        (4) The effectiveness of individuals and organizations working on behalf of veterans. After

every war veterans have joined new or existing veterans' organizations that have lobbied on their

behalf. The effectiveness of those organizations and their leaders has played a role in determining




                                                   6
the level of benefits. At times lawyers, or other paid agents of veterans have carried out important

lobbying efforts, hoping to profit if they win additional benefits for veterans.

           (5) Public attitudes towards the war. How much did the veterans actually suffer during the

war? How much did they accomplish? How just was the war? Our first reaction is that the answers to

these questions should not matter: all veterans should be well treated. But as we will show below,

the answers to these questions did influence the level and timing of benefits.

           (6) The state of the federal treasury. If the treasury is running a surplus, and more surpluses

are in the offing, the demands of veterans can be met easily; if the treasury is running a deficit, and

more deficits are in the offing, veterans will find the road to higher pensions difficult. The crucial

thing, of course, is how the public and the politicians view the state of the treasury. The same budget

will look very different to politicians who hold a balanced budget sacrosanct than to politicians who

believe a deficit is a good way of assuring full employment.

           The state of the treasury will be more important when benefits are paid from general

revenues. In the early part of the nineteenth century some naval benefits were paid from a fund

derived from the sale of captured foreign merchant ships and their cargoes. This method of finance

changes the role of the taxpayer. Naval pensions and the role of the Naval Prize Fund are discussed

in detail in Clark, Craig, and Wilson (2003). Most nineteenth century veterans, however, were army

veterans, so the state of the treasury was the key factor. In the antebellum period the federal

government's and the states’s "land budgets" were often as important as fiscal budgets.4 There were

times when generous grants of land could be made to veterans even when cash grants seemed

difficult; in other words times when governments were land rich and cash poor.

           Veterans’ benefits, we will argue, can be characterized like consumer spending. Benefits to

compensate veterans who were injured in the course of the war are analogous to necessities: The
4
    Grubb (2005) stresses the importance of land to the "net asset" position of the United States.


                                                             7
government will pay without regard to the current state of the budget. Old-age pensions, however,

were like luxuries: The government would “buy” them provided its income was high enough relative

to its expenditures.

        These six factors have often been cited in previous studies of veterans benefits in the

nineteenth century such as Bodenger (1971), Oberly (1990), Skocpol (1992), Resch (1999), Teipe

(2002), Clark, Craig, and Wilson (2003), and the classic with which all other studies of nineteenth-

century pensions begin, Glasson (1918). We cannot claim, therefore, that our analysis, including our

emphasis the state of the federal treasury, is unprecedented. Indeed, any explanation of something as

important as veterans' benefits that was based on an entirely new set of explanatory factors would be

highly suspect. Rather, our claim is that we have sharpened the existing portrait of the political

economy veterans' benefits and established more rigorously some of the empirical generalizations

already in the literature by developing and exploring data on the number and value of cash pensions

and land grants. We will begin by comparing cash pensions awarded to veterans of the antebellum

wars.



                  3. Service Pensions for Veterans of the Antebellum Wars

Figure 1 compares the present discounted value of the cash benefits received by veterans for service

in the Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Mexican War. In each case we deflated the annual

amount spent on a pension by a cost of living index (Historical Statistics 2006, series Cc2),

discounted the resulting series back to the end of the war at three percent or six percent, 5 and

divided by the number of soldiers and sailors who served in the war (Table 1). Evidently, the



5
 Over the years 1798 to 1860 the yield on U.S. long-term bonds averaged (in years when it is available) 5.71
percent; the yield on New England municipals averaged 5.11 (Historical Statistics 2006, series Cj1192, Cj1194).



                                                        8
veterans of the War of 1812 received substantially less than did the veterans of the Revolution or the

Mexican War. The difference between the benefits when discounted at three percent and when

discounted at six percent points to the important role of timing: The veterans of the War of 1812 do

relatively better when a low rate of discount is used.

       A natural if somewhat cynical conclusion that follows from Figure 1 is that it is the

difference in the success of American arms that explains the difference in benefits. America won the

Revolutionary War and the Mexican War – indeed America won great empires in these wars – but

lost, or at least accomplished very little, in the War of 1812. This interpretation, we argue below in

more detail, may have an element of truth to it, although another, perhaps more important factor, the

state of the federal treasury, was also at work: Veterans of the Revolution benefited from periods of

treasury surpluses, while veterans of the War of 1812 came due for their pension when the budget

was in deficit.

       In terms of nominal amounts, the idea that veterans of a given war should be given what

veterans of the proceeding war were given worked to an unusual extent in the nineteenth century.

The standard rate of $8 per month did not change from 1818 to 1903. Some variation in the real

value of pensions was introduced, as shown in Figure 2, by movements in prices and wages. It is

evident, however, that price movements were not a major source of the differences revealed by

Figure 1. Thus, the main factor behind the differences in Figure 1 was the time that veterans had

to wait for their service pensions.

       One way to highlight the role of timing is to calculate the pensions of a hypothetical

standardized veteran. Consider a private or noncommissioned officer, who (1) survived a war

without a disability entitling him to a pension, who (2) was eligible for a service pension when it

became available, who (3) lived for 70 years after the war, and who (4) left no dependents. Although




                                                 9
hypothetical, these calculations provide a picture of the relative size of the pensions; both in terms of

what the legislators had in mind, and in terms of what the veterans ultimately received. When we do

this we find that our hypothetical long-lived veteran of the Revolution would have received a service

pension worth $64 in 1860$s, our hypothetical veteran of the War of 1812 would have received $27,

and our hypothetical veteran of the Mexican War would have received $143. These figures are

higher than the estimates in Figure 1 that reflect the actual experience of the veterans, but the

ordering is similar. Evidently, the Veterans of the War of 1812 received less in large part because

they had to wait so long for their service pensions. We therefore need to look at the history of how

and when these benefit programs were established to explain why the veterans of the War of 1812

did less well than the veterans of the other antebellum wars.



                            4. Service Pensions: The Revolutionary War

The Revolutionary War was no exception to the rule that debate over veterans' benefits starts

with what was awarded to veterans of the last war. English and colonial practice was to pay

compensation to all soldiers who were injured and unable to work, but to pay service pensions

only to officers. Legislation promising compensation for Revolutionary soldiers was passed soon

after the Revolution began. The rate for privates and noncommissioned officers was $5.00 per

month.6 Pensions for widows and orphans of officers were also well accepted. One of the first

awards, in April 1777, was to the youngest son of General Mercer who died in the Battle of

Princeton. All told, General Mercer’s youngest son would receive $3,876, perhaps $1.6 million

6
  A crude estimate of daily wages of unskilled labor during the Revolution varies between $.40 and $.56. So $5.00
represents what an unskilled laborer could earn in 9 to 13 days: a small sum to live on, but an important supplement
for veterans who had other sources of income. Wages during the Revolution were estimated by using an index
money wages for unskilled labor available during the Revolution (Historical Statistics 2006, series Ba4218) to
backdate daily wages for unskilled labor in Philadelphia (Historical Statistics 2006, series Ba4219), a series that first
becomes available in 1785.

in today’s money (2004) using the wages of unskilled labor as an inflator (U.S. Senate 1877;

Williamson 2004).

        But the officers' demand for half-pay for life, although based on current British practice,

proved highly controversial. At first Washington opposed the idea of half pay on the grounds that it

would be too expensive; but when conditions in the army deteriorated in 1777-78, and officers began

returning home, Washington changed his mind and supported half-pay for life. In May 1778

Congress promised half pay, although only for seven years, for officers who served until the end of

the war, and $80 mustering out pay (one year's pay) for common soldiers, about $33,000 in today's

money (2004) using the wages of unskilled labor as an inflator (Williamson 2004). In October 1780

Congress, under pressure from the officers and from Washington, increased the offer to officers to

half pay for life for those who served until the end of the war.

        The story, however, was not to end so happily for the officers. Early in March 1783 the

officers with the American army at Newburgh, New York became increasingly anxious about

whether arrears of pay and the commitment to half-pay for life would be fulfilled once a treaty of

peace was signed. On March 10, 1783 an anonymous letter appeared urging the officers not to lay

down their arms and disband until their demands for back pay and pensions were met: the famous

"Newburgh Conspiracy." Washington met this challenge by calling a general meeting of the officers

on March 15. At that meeting Washington addressed his men and assured them that Congress would

fulfill its promises. The story goes that during the speech Washington began to read a letter from

Congress and said "you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but

almost blind in the service of my country."7 Supposedly his officers, some of whom did not know


7
 Flexner (1984 [1974], 168-178) provides a clear and moving account of the conspiracy. Historians are not agreed
on how far the plotters were really prepared to go. In an interesting exchange in the William and Mary Quarterly,
Richard H. Kohn (1970) argued that it was a full blown conspiracy; a position strongly disputed by Edward C.
Skeen (1974).


                                                        11
that he wore glasses, were so overcome with emotion that they began to cry. On March 22, with the

threat quashed, and the budget once more on the front burner, Congress passed the "Commutation

Act," which promised former officers cash or interest bearing securities amounting at face value to

full pay for five years in lieu of half-pay for life.8 About 2,500 officers received securities under the

Act (Bodenger 1971, 21).

           The events in Newburgh made up the most extreme case of a conflict between the claims of

the veterans and the state of the federal treasury. Indeed, Flexner (1984 [1974], 177) claims that the

meeting on March 15 "was probably the most important single gathering ever held in the United

States." But the conflict was to be repeated in some form after every war in the nineteenth century.

           The fear of the officers that Congress would fail to pay them once their services were no

longer needed proved well-founded. Under the Confederation the government failed to pay interest

on the commutation bonds. Eventually, these debts were assumed by the federal government under

Hamilton's plan for reorganizing the debt. Indeed, they were the largest part of the debt assumed by

the federal government. In the meantime, however, many officers and enlisted men had sold their

securities to investors at heavy discounts. E. James Ferguson (1954) studied what happened in

Maryland, the state with the best-preserved records, and found that about 52 percent of the securities

issued to Maryland's soldiers had been acquired by the State of Maryland because they could be used

to satisfy state debts. Of the 48 percent that remained in private hands about 82 percent had been

transferred to private investors at a price that might have been, according to Ferguson (1954, 41), 20

to 40 cents on the dollar. The officers continually petitioned Congress for additional compensation.

And in 1818 officers in "reduced circumstances" received a pension of $20 per month, about $4,200

per month in today's money (2004) using the wages of unskilled labor as the inflator (Williamson


8
    The par value of the commutation bonds equaled half pay for 16 years discounted at 6 percent.

2004). This was, as we will explain below, a period of extraordinary federal budget surpluses.

Finally, in 1828, the surviving officers were granted full pay for the remainder of their lives.

           There was no precedent, as far as we are aware, in the American experience for a service

pension for privates or noncommissioned officers. It was natural, however, in a new nation that took

democracy seriously that privates and noncommissioned officers would feel they deserved a pension,

and would be viewed as deserving by the public. In their case the pension received by the officers

was the precedent. The enlisted men, moreover, could point to the same failures on the part of

Congress to live up to its promises, as could the officers. Congress had paid in Continental dollars

that had depreciated rapidly, and sometimes had failed to pay altogether. True, Congress had given

the enlisted men interest-bearing securities for the arrears in pay and for the $80 bonus, but Congress

had failed to pay interest on these securities, as it had on the securities given to the officers.

           In the years following the War of 1812, moreover, the state of the federal treasury was

promising for the passage of a service pension for veterans of the Revolution.9 The United

States ran large deficits during the War of 1812; in 1816 and 1817, however, the treasury ran

large surpluses, as can be seen in Figure 3. The surplus was 56 percent (measured as a

percentage of expenditures) in 1816, and 52 percent in 1817 (Historical Statistics 2006, series

Ea584, Ea585). The surpluses were temporary, the result of a postwar surge in imports that

produced increased tariff revenues. One result, nevertheless, was an important piece of veterans'

legislation. The law of 1818, mentioned above in connection with the officers, also provided a

pension of $8 per month for privates and noncommissioned officers who had served nine months

during the Revolution and were now in "reduced circumstances." As can be seen in Figure 3,

spending on pensions ratcheted upward as a result. Spending on pensions under the law of 1818

    The following two paragraphs are based on John Resch (1999).

significantly exceeded compensation for wounded veterans including those wounded in the War

of 1812 and for the dependents of soldiers and sailors who died while in service (the lowest line

in Figure 3).

         The new law was soon in trouble. The War Department was overwhelmed with

applications and it was clear that many veterans were misrepresenting their resources. The

widely discussed case of Ebenezer Huntington, a wealthy former officer from Connecticut who

had managed to get a pension, personified the corruption. The problem even reached into the

War Department where bureaucrats enrolled veterans whose assets exceeded the Department's

standards. The treasury surpluses, moreover, disappeared soon after the law of 1818 took effect:

In 1820 the deficit was two percent of expenditures, and in 1821, eight percent of expenditures

(Historical Statistics 2006, series Ea584, Ea585). Congress responded to the public's outrage

over corruption in the pension system and the deterioration in the budget by striking all of the

veterans from the rolls and requiring that they reapply. In the summer of 1820 Americans

watched in fascination as veterans of the Revolution mustered prior to presenting their

applications. Old soldiers shouldered their crutches as they had once shouldered their muskets.

The effect of the re-enrollment amendment shows up clearly in Figure 3 as a sharp contraction in

net expenditures in 1821.10

         The 1820 amendment, and its vigorous enforcement by Secretary of War John C.

Calhoun and the head of the pension bureau James L. Edwards, put an end to the scandals and

saved the program. Now public attention shifted from men who had been unfairly added to the

rolls to men who had been unfairly excluded. There were many possible inequities. A veteran

who had gone into debt to buy property on the expectation of a pension might now be denied a

  Our estimates of net expenditure are the differences between warrants issued and repayments. Since repayments
could be based on warrants issued in previous years, our estimate of zero net expenditure in fiscal 1821 is consistent
with some veterans receiving payments from the government.


                                                         14
pension on the grounds that his gross assets (one of the criteria used by the War Department)

were too high. A veteran who deeded his property to his children in exchange for long-term care,

a common practice, would qualify for a pension; a veteran in similar circumstances who kept

title to his assets would not. The budget, moreover, having recovered from the effects of the

Panic of 1819, was now solidly in the black: the surplus was about 30 percent of expenditures in

1822 and 1823 (Historical Statistics 2006, series Ea584, Ea585). In 1823, therefore, Congress

allowed veterans to submit amended applications. Veterans were now free to restate their assets

in a way that met War Department standards. The 1823 amendment does not seem to have left a

strong imprint on the pension rolls (Table A1 column 4), but it does illustrate the willingness of

Congress to address inequities provided the budget was favorable.

        Pressure now began to build for a non-means-tested pension and a reduction in the required

term of service. The legislation of 1828, mentioned above, that awarded officers who served until the

end of the war full pay for life, made a similar award to privates and noncommissioned officers who

had enlisted in the Continental Army and served until the end of the war. This law, however,

pensioned few soldiers.

        With this precedent on the books, however, it is easy to see why pressure then built to expand

benefits further. Veterans who had served, but not until the end of the war, or who had served in

state or local militias rather than the Continental Army, now had a basis for claiming a pension. In

his first State of the Union Message in 1829 Andrew Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812 and the

Indian Wars, advocated extending benefits to the militia who served in the Revolution, although only

when a veteran "… is unable to maintain himself in comfort."11 Legislation passed in the House, but

stalled in the Senate. Among those opposed to increased benefits was Senator Robert Y. Hayne of

South Carolina. Hayne pointed out, among other things, that there was a connection between the

protective tariff – the famous "Tariff of Abominations" had been passed in 1828 – and veterans'

pensions. To increase the pension rolls was to delay the day when tariffs could be reduced (Glasson

1918, 77-78). In 1832, however, despite opposition from men like Hayne, legislation was passed that

provided full pay for life to all veterans without regard to their economic or physical status who had

served for two years in the regular army, the navy, or (significantly) the militias. Those who had

served for shorter periods received proportionately less.

        As can be seen in Figure 4, the Act of 1832 was passed during a run of years when the

federal budget was in surplus, and following two years of record surpluses. Indeed, the surplus had

been larger, measured as a percentage of expenditures, in only two proceeding years (Historical

Statistics 2006, series Ea584, Ea585). Spending on Revolutionary pensions increased as a result of

the legislation. The amounts of additional spending, however, were relatively small, although the

effect on the surplus was not negligible. Fifty years had passed since the end of the war, and the

number of eligible veterans had been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, an important precedent had been

established. From this time onward veterans could claim that equity with veterans of the Revolution

required that they be given a pension based on service alone when they reached an advanced age.

Shortly after passing this bill, which increased the need for long-term taxes, Jackson signed the tariff

legislation that led to the Nullification Crisis.

        The Revolutionary War also set the precedent for pensioning widows. During the war the

widows of soldiers or sailors killed in battle were pensioned, a colonial tradition. But under the Act

of July 4, 1836 widows who were married before 1794 to revolutionary officers, soldiers, seamen,

and marines were made eligible for a pension. Thus, to put it somewhat differently, women who had

married a non-commissioned officer or soldier who had survived the war became eligible for a




                                                    16
pension. The effect of the pensioning of widows, orphans, and other dependents can be seen in

Figure 4 as the opening of the gap after 1836 between total expenditures and Act of 1832

expenditures. This law was a remarkable break with colonial tradition. At the peak over 9,000

widows and other dependents would be on the rolls (Table A1 column 5). Pensioning the widows of

ordinary soldiers and seamen who had survived the war set a dominant precedent: The widows of

veterans of all future wars would be pensioned.

       An attempt was made at about this time to pension the veterans of various engagements with

Native Americans that had taken place in the years immediately following the Revolution (U.S.

House 1836). This effort ran into opposition based on the political morality of the war. It was

contended that the Indian Wars were different from the Revolution – they were carried on by private

individuals with the goal of private gain. The veterans of the Indian Wars, as they were known,

would have to wait for their pensions.

       Legislation in March 1837 directed the Navy Pension Fund to pay the widows and orphans

who were now eligible for a pension from the time of the veteran's death. This legislation, according

to Clark, Craig, and Wilson, although passed when the Navy Pension Fund appeared to be in good

financial shape, doomed it. In a few years the fund was gone (2003, 58-60). Clark, Craig, and

Wilson are probably right that the increase in benefits for veterans was partly due to the attempt to

build up the navy because of the tensions with Britain over the U.S. boundary with Canada. And

Theda Skocpol is probably right that the expansion of the franchise made it more important

politically to pension the widows of ordinary soldiers and sailors (1993, 92). However, the

pensioning of the widows and orphans is also consistent with a simple fiscal theory of the pensions:

Fiscal 1836 saw the last and largest in a series of surpluses. The federal budget would go into deficit

after the Panic of 1837.




                                                  17
       Time soon took its toll. By 1848 little more than 3,000 widows remained on the rolls (Table

A1, column 5). An act of July 29, 1848 pensioned widows who were married before January 1800.

In other words it pensioned women who had married veterans between 1794 (the cutoff under the

law of 1836) and 1800. This amendment, a subsequent amendments along the same lines, produced

small increases in the number of widows on the rolls.

       As we have seen, Revolutionary War Veterans had to wait 35 years (1783 to 1818) for a

means-tested service pension, and 45 years (1783 to 1828) for a non-means-tested service pension.

Given that the precedent of an old-age pension had been established and that the United States had

grown richer one might have expected that the veterans of the War of 1812 would have received

their old-age pension in fewer years. In 1845, 30 years after the end of the War of 1812, for example,

real per capita income was 30 percent higher than it was in 1818 when the Revolutionary War

Pension was created (Historical Statistics 2006, series Ca11). However, this was not to be. Veterans

of the War of 1812 would have to wait longer for their service pensions even though the country had

grown richer.

       Before exploring the cash pensions received by the veterans of the War of 1812 and

subsequent wars, however, we need to look at the land grants made to veterans of the Revolution and

subsequent wars. As Farley Grubb (2005) has recently argued, it is a mistake to look solely at cash

expenditures, because land was an important part of the government's "net asset position." It is

possible that including land grants would alter our conclusion that the veterans of the War of 1812

did badly compared with the veterans of other nineteenth-century wars. The land grant story,

however, reinforces the cash pension story.

                                               5. Land Grants

Land grants for military service were a long-standing colonial tradition.12 Land was awarded, for

example, to soldiers who had participated in the Pequot War in 1637. Maryland awarded land in

1645 for help in suppressing the rebellion led by the pirate Richard Ingle. Land was also awarded to

the veterans of King Philip's War in 1675-76. The French and Indian War of 1754-1763 provided the

immediate precedent for the Revolutionary land grants. The war began in the west with the

campaigns in which George Washington took part. A proclamation by Governor Dinwiddie of

Virginia issued in 1754 authorized land grants to soldiers who participated. At the conclusion of the

War, George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 rewarded veterans with 50 to 5,000 acres depending

on their rank.13

        The reliance of colonial authorities on land grants is easily understood. As Paul Wallace

Gates put it in his magisterial History of Public Land Law Development, America in that era was

“long on land and short on money” (Gates 1968, 249). It was natural, therefore, that America would

reward veterans of the Revolution with land grants. The earliest offer came in 1776, but ironically it

was an offer of 50 acres to British soldiers who deserted (Gates 1968, 251). To make sure that the

offer reached the Hessians, it was printed in German on the backs of tobacco wrappers (Hibbard

1965 [1924], 118).

        Both the Continental Congress and the states made grants. The grants made by the

Continental Congress went to veterans of the Continental Army; the grants made by the states went

to veterans of their militias and as supplemental grants to their citizens who served in the Continental

Army. The southern states were especially generous. Virginia, the most populist state and the one

with the most western land, steadily increased its bounties during the course of the war as it became

harder and harder to enlist men. Toward the end of the war ordinary soldiers and sailors were

promised 300 acres and a slave to work the land. North Carolina made the largest grants. Under a

law of 1780 the North Carolina scale started with 640 acres for privates and 1000 acres for

noncommissioned officers.

        The rewards to officers, in many cases, were far more generous than the rewards for enlisted

men. The Continental Congress gave brigadier generals 850 acres and major generals 1,100 acres.

North Carolina added 12,000 for both brigadier and major generals, but rewarded Major General

Nathaniel Greene, the hero of the Revolution in the South, with a “little dukedom,” as one Tennessee

legislator put it, of 25,000 acres (Gates 1968, 252-53). Virginia added an additional 10,000 acres for

brigadier generals and 15,000 for major generals. Virginia granted Major General Charles Lee,

16,875 acres, Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, 23,328 acres, and Major General Horatio Gates, 31,

000 acres (Bockstruck 1996, 196, 308, 376).14 Washington undoubtedly could have had an enormous

amount of land. He refused, however, to accept any land for his service during the Revolution, even

though his personal economy depended on the extensive lands awarded to him for his service in the

French and Indian War (Flexner 1984 [1974], 53-54, 194). The Northern states made smaller

distinctions among ranks. Whereas Virginia gave privates 300 acres and major generals 15,000, a

ratio of 50 to one; New York gave privates 500 acres and major generals 5,500, a ratio of 11 to one

14
   The area of the island of Manhattan is about 13,000 acres; the borough, which includes some water and adjacent
islands, is about 22,000 acres.

(Gates 1968, 252). The states with large claims on western lands were, of course, in a position to

reward their veterans generously. The expectation that those claims might have to be surrendered to

the central government simply added another incentive to reward their own citizens generously.

        Although the veterans of the Revolution were promised a great deal of land, its monetary

value is difficult to estimate, and may not have been very great. Some preliminary efforts to

distribute federal land were made in the mid-1780s, but it was not until 1796 that a military track

in Ohio was made available where small holders could exercise their warrants (Gates 1968, 259).

In the meantime most veterans had sold their warrants to speculators. The largest of the

speculators in federal warrants was the New Jersey politician Jonathan Dayton who acquired

90,936 acres by buying warrants (Gates 1968, 260). The story of how land was distributed by the

states varied from state to state, but the tendency for veterans to experience long delays and to

sell their warrants to speculators and developers was the norm.

        The policy of rewarding soldiers with land grants continued after the Revolution. Texas,

as might be expected based on its vast acreages, made generous grants. The Texas constitution of

1836 promised families who were loyal to the state "a League and Labor" of land, 4606 acres;

single men over the age of 17 were promised a third of a league, 1,476 acres. An act of

December 21, 1837, awarded 640 acres to veterans who had participated in various engagements

during the Texas War of Independence such as the Goliad campaigns of 1835 and 1836, and the

battle of the Alamo.15

        Initially, veterans of the War of 1812 who served in the regular army received bounties of

160 acres; an amount that was raised to 320 acres toward the end of the war (Hickey 1989, 243-44).

About 29,000 of the 60,000 regulars took them up. There were, however, several problems with the

                                                      21
grants from the point of view of the veterans. First, the grants were located in a few restricted

western areas, in part because it was hoped that the veterans would be a buffer against Native

Americans. This was also true of the Revolutionary warrants, but many of the Revolutionary grants

were in highly productive farmland, such as those in South Central Ohio. One area in Michigan

reserved for veterans of the War of 1812 was replaced when it was found to be too swampy,

although some of the other areas reserved for the veterans of 1812 did contain good farmland. The

warrants, moreover, could not be sold to a broker, at least not without some legal maneuvering; they

were not "assignable" in the language of the time. Although veterans and their agents found various

ways around this limitation, it undoubtedly raised the cost of selling the warrants. An even more

important factor, however, was simply that the veterans who had served in state militias were not

entitled to grants. State governments rewarded many veterans who had served in militias during the

Revolution. However, this was no longer possible because the states had ceded their western lands to

the federal government.

       It was undoubtedly the officers of the War of 1812 who felt most aggrieved. As we noted, the

officers of the Revolutionary War received handsome land grants. In 1811, however, when bounties

were first offered to soldiers for the War of 1812, there was nothing extra for the officers. Further

attempts to reward the officers were made during the war and in 1817, but nothing came of them

(Gates 1968, 262 ftn. 37). As Gates suggests, Congress was probably reacting to the perception that

great estates had arisen as a result of the huge grants made at the close of the Revolution. Congress

also may have been reacting to the related perception that the land grants had produced excessive

speculation in western lands, always a political liability.

       There was also the perception that the fighting was not very intense. In a memorial to

Congress in 1831 a group of War of 1812 officers pointed out the Revolutionary War precedents and




                                                  22
asked for similar treatment. They also pointed out that U.S. citizens living in Canada in 1812 and

who had volunteered to serve with the American forces had received land bounties, and in that case

the officers had been given larger bounties than the enlisted men – up to 960 acres for a colonel. The

officers conceded that they may not have suffered as much as the officers of the Revolutionary

armies, but they insisted that they had accomplished as much. "The [officers in the War of 1812] …

exhibited the same valor and love of liberty [as the officers in the Revolution], and, although they

may not as a body have suffered as much, yet their zeal was not less, nor their exertions less

meritorious or successful" (U.S. House 1831). One wonders, of course, whether Congress found the

last part of their claim persuasive. Unlike their brethren in the Revolution and the Mexican War, the

veterans of the War of 1812 had conquered little land for the United States.

       No legislation responding to these complaints was forthcoming, however, until the land

grants given to the veterans of the Mexican-American war (1847-48) ignited a campaign to secure

additional land for the veterans of 1812. The "Ten Regiments Act" of 1847 designed to fill the ranks

for the Mexican War provided more valuable benefits than had the 1812 grants: a warrant for 160

acres of land anywhere in the public domain for every regular and volunteer who joined the war

against Mexico and served for 12 months or until the end of the war. The warrants, moreover, could

be sold to a broker for cash if the veteran did not want to settle the land; they were assignable.

According to Oberly "After the act's passage and the president's signature, army recruiters busily

signed up men on the basis of the new bounty (1990, 11)."

       The passage of the Ten Regiments Act reminded the surviving veterans of the War of 1812

of their old grievances. They demanded parity with the veterans of the Mexican War, and Congress

obliged soon after the war with Mexico ended. This is not surprising. The veterans of 1812 had a

strong claim based on equity, and granting it was easy given the immense booty, including




                                                 23
California, taken from Mexico. The Bounty Land Act of 1850 provided veterans of the War of 1812,

of various Indian Wars, and of various other fights with up to 160 acres depending on length of

service. The warrants, however, could not be sold to brokers, a nod to the opponents of

"speculators." It was implausible, however, that the veterans of the War of 1812, many now in their

sixties, would move West to take up farming or even that they would go through the laborious

process of taking possession of and selling their land. The veterans wanted assignable bounties.

       The brokers were also an important voice for liberalization of the Bounty Land Act because

they were running out of warrants issued under the Ten Regiments Act. Congress responded with

what was popularly known as the Assignment Bill of 1852, which allowed veterans of the War of

1812 to sell their land warrants through brokers. The 1850 and 1852 Acts required one month of

service for 40 acres and nine months for the full 160 acres.

       The fight to secure bounties for the veterans of the War of 1812 was led by the United

Brethren of the War of 1812. It was headed by Joel B. Sutherland, a physician in the War of 1812, a

successful politician in the postwar era, and as it proved, a skillful champion of the veterans. In 1855

the veterans held a march on the White House holding aloft a banner bearing the slogan under which

they had gone to war in 1812: "Free Trade and Sailor's Rights." President Pierce met with a

delegation, but did not commit himself to their demands (Oberly 1990, 35-36). Further pressure,

however, produced the Old Soldiers Act of 1855, which gave 160 acres to any soldier, whether in the

regular army or the militia, who had served at least two weeks in the War of 1812. This was the high

point for the United Brethren, which never held another national convention.

       We have made some preliminary estimates, shown in Figure 5, of the amount of land given

to the veterans of the Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Mexican War. These estimates are

subject to a wide margin of error. Nevertheless, we believe that the impression created by the chart is




                                                 24
probably broadly correct. The details of how we made the estimates are in the appendix. The bar for

the War of 1812 is divided into two parts. The lower part shows the amount awarded during the war.

The upper part shows the amount awarded to the veterans of the War of 1812 after the Mexican War.

The veterans of the War of 1812, evidently, received less initially, but caught up many years later.

Without the latter grants the veterans of the War of 1812 would have done less well in terms of total

land received, than the veterans of the Revolution.16

         We have also made some back-of-the envelope estimates of the real value to the veterans of

the land grants. These estimates are subject to larger margins of error than the estimates of the total

amount of land received because we lack data on exactly when veterans disposed of their land, how

much they were paid for it, and what they were charged in transaction costs. Nevertheless, we made

some estimates by assuming various schedules according to which veterans disposed of their land,

and by using some available information on prices. The details of our calculation are in the appendix.

These estimates show that on average the veterans of the Revolution received the equivalent $28 in

1860 dollars in land warrants, veterans of the War of 1812 received $14, and veterans of the

Mexican War received $137. These estimates again suggest that the veterans of the War of 1812 did

less well than either the veterans of the Revolution or the Mexican War.



                6. Service Pensions: The War of 1812 and the Mexican War

         Sutherland, after his success with the land grants, began to lobby for a non-means-tested cash

pension. He did not live, however, to see it finally awarded in 1871, 56 years after the end of the


16
  Veterans of subsequent wars also received help in buying land, but it appears that the Mexican War was the last in
which land grants were a prominent component of benefits. Under the Homestead Act (1862) land could be acquired
by paying $1.25 per acre or by farming the land for 5 years. Veterans could substitute military service for residence
down to one year. Veterans of the Civil War also received the right to buy supplemental amounts of land. Many
veterans probably made use of their military service in this way. However, the lack of transferability of the benefit
limited its value to most soldiers.


                                                         25
war. By this time the ranks of the veterans had been greatly thinned, and hence the potential cost of

the program was relatively low. Nevertheless, there was some strong opposition to a non-means-

tested pension based on the budget. Senator John Sherman, the Chair of the Committee on Finance,

warned that a bill that pensioned all veterans of the War of 1812 would be too expensive; he wanted

it restricted to indigent veterans. Sherman mentioned the precedent set by the law of 1832 but

dismissed it on the grounds that the veterans of the Revolution had been paid initially with worthless

paper.17 Sherman complained, moreover, that the Revolutionary War pension had produced pension

marriages, and wanted the War of 1812 pensions limited to widows who had been married to

soldiers at the time of the war. To add all of the widows would add $5 million to annual

expenditures.18 When the law was finally enacted a pension was granted to all soldiers and sailors

who had served 60 days – with no requirement that the veterans be in reduced circumstances – but it

did limit benefits to widows who had been married to a veteran before the treaty of peace was signed

and who had not remarried.

        In 1878 the service pension for the War of 1812 was liberalized: only two weeks of service in

the war were required. This change produced a small increase of about 1,200 in the number of

survivors on the rolls (Table A1 continued, column 6). There was at the time, we should no longer

be surprised, a surplus in the federal budget. Indeed, the federal budget had been in surplus in every

year after the Civil War. This was consistent with the policy of deflating prices and returning to the

gold standard at the prewar par. Running a surplus was a way of retiring the greenbacks and the

federal debt. By the late 1870s the dollar was close to the prewar par, and return to the gold standard

17
  There was considerable inflation during the War of 1812, but it was of a lower order of magnitude than the
Revolutionary War inflation. The cost of living seems to have risen about 30 percent between 1812 and 1814, before
subsiding to its prewar level in 1815-1817 (Historical Statistics 2006, series Cc2).

was in sight. The monetary case for maintaining a surplus was less compelling, and therefore the

case for spending more on the veterans was more attractive.

       Why did the veterans of the War of 1812 and their heirs do less well than did the veterans of

the Revolution? One factor, clearly, was the state of the treasury when the veterans of the War of

1812 came due for their pensions. The veterans of the Revolution in "reduced circumstances” won

lifetime pensions, as we noted above, 35 years after the end of the Revolution, and a non-means-

tested 10 years after that. With the same lags, the veterans of the War of 1812 would have been

“due” for their means-tested pension in 1850 and due for their non-means-tested pension in 1860.

The timing was unfortunate. In 1850 the veterans of the War of 1812 were in the midst of their fight

for land bounties on a par with the veterans of the Mexican War. Indeed, the land bounties that they

won, since they were easily convertible into cash, were a substitute for a cash pension. The amounts

they actually received from the land grants were small compared with a cash pension at the

Revolutionary rate. However, this might not have been obvious at the time: The rapid distribution of

the public lands soon depressed the value of federal lands. The second date, 1860, falls just before

the Civil War. Congress did not put all other projects aside simply because the nation was at war.

Nevertheless, pensioning the veterans of the War of 1812 during the Civil War probably appeared

injudicious in light of the rapid increase in the number of wounded veterans, widows and orphans on

the pension rolls and the inflation and large deficits that marked the Civil War years. The number of

pensions compensating for death and disability rose from 7,991 in 1860 to 154,477 in 1867 (Table

A1 columns 2, 3); the deficit rose from $7 million in 1860 to close to a billion in 1865 (Historical

Statistics 2006, series Ea586); and the price level doubled. So part of the explanation for why the

veterans of the War of 1812 received less than the veterans of the Revolution was simply bad timing:

Their pension obligations fell due when the federal treasury was stretched to the limit by the Civil

War.

       There may have been something more at work: the perception that American arms had done

badly in the War of 1812. Perhaps, as mentioned in our discussion of the land grants, this group of

veterans did not deserve as large a "gratuity" as the veterans of more successful wars. It is hard to

prove that the lack of success of American arms contributed to the delay in the awarding of the

service pension. Few politicians would have admitted to this concern even if it had consciously or

unconsciously influenced their thinking. However, it was from the start one of the most controversial

wars in American history. The Federalists, the dominant party in New England, and with sizable

groups of supporters in the South and West, opposed the war at every turn. Donald Hickey writes

that in Congress the Federalists "unanimously opposed the declaration of war in June of 1812, and

thereafter they voted against almost every proposal to raise men or money, to foster privateering, or

to restrict trade with the enemy" (Hickey 1989, 255). To be sure, once the war was over, many

Americans adopted the view that the war had been a great moral victory, even if the treaty had

restored the status quo antebellum. The Federalists party disappeared as a result of its opposition to

the war. Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison parlayed wartime victories into the

Presidency. Nevertheless, it is possible that some remaining bitterness may have influenced the

treatment of the veterans.

       One piece of suggestive evidence is that the successful fight for land bounties in the 1850s

was accompanied by an effort to burnish the image of the war. In 1847, just as the Mexican War

began, Congressman Charles J. Ingersoll, who proved to be a strong ally of the veterans, published a

two-volume revisionist history of the War of 1812. The Ingersoll volumes, soon followed by others

along the same lines, argued that the army and navy had fought praiseworthy campaigns and




                                                28
accomplished a great deal for the country (Oberly 1990, 30). In the end we probably will never know

for certain that the controversial nature of the war and its ambiguous conclusion slowed the

awarding of service pensions to the veterans of the War of 1812. But we cannot rule out the

conclusion reached by the U.S. President’s Commission on Veterans’ Benefits (1956, 66) that one

factor was that “There was little land fighting during the war, not many men were engaged in any

one battle, and it was felt that the army did not accomplish much.”

           The veterans of the Mexican War turned to the National Association of Mexican War

Veterans to lobby for their pensions.19 Its founder and leader was Alexander Kenaday, an eccentric

and sometimes radical populist labor leader from California. The principal demand was for the same

pension, $8.00 per month, that veterans of the Revolution and the War of 1812 had gotten. After

continual lobbying, this pension was granted in 1887 for veterans aged 62 or more. From a fiscal

point of view it was a favorable period for awarding a pension. The budget had been in surplus for

several years; in 1886 the surplus was close to 30 percent of revenues. Thus, veterans of the Mexican

War had to wait a shorter period (39 years) for their pension than did the veterans of the War of 1812

(56 years). The wait for veterans of the Mexican War, however, was comparable to that experienced

by the veterans of the Revolution: 35 years for a means-tested pension and 45 years for a non-

means-tested pension.

           The awarding of the pension created a period of confusion for Kenaday, who was also the

editor of the organization’s newspaper and, not incidentally, a prominent pension agent. He soon

turned, however, to the next logical step: an increase in the pension. An increase to $12 per

month was finally achieved in 1903. The pensioners got their raise, it should not surprise us,

during a period of surplus. From 1894 through 1899 the budget was always in a deficit averaging

     The next two paragraphs are based on Davies (1948).


                                                           29
-10.25 percent per year; from 1900 through 1903 the budget was in a surplus averaging +10.74

percent per year (Historical Statistics 2006, series Ea584, Ea585).

         Thus it appears that the major determinants of the old-age pension for the veterans of the

Mexican War were what the veterans of earlier wars had received and the state of the federal budget.

Public attitudes toward the war, however, did play a role in the timing. The Mexican War, although

highly successful from a military point of view and highly profitable in terms of the wealth added to

the United States, had aroused opposition from the start. Many Northerners saw it as an imperialist

war undertaken by a southern president (James K. Polk) designed to add new slave territories to the

United States. Ulysses Grant in a famous passage from his Memoirs recalled his opposition to the

annexation of Texas and to the Mexican War which he regarded as "one of the most unjust ever

waged by a stronger against a weaker nation" (Grant 1885, vol. 1, 53). Many of the soldiers who had

taken part, moreover, were southerners who then fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.

Robert E. Lee was the most prominent example. According to Wallace E. Davies (1948, 226-228),

early efforts to secure a pension for the Mexican War veterans failed during Republican

administrations “because of apprehensions that such a measure might benefit many ex-

Confederates.” It was not until 1887 when the South-friendly Democrats were in power that the

Mexican War veterans secured their service pension, and even then some ex-Confederates were

disqualified.




                                 7. Service Pensions: The Civil War20



20
  We discuss only the pensions for Union veterans. Confederate veterans did not receive federal pensions. The
Confederates, however, did receive pensions from southern states. These are described in Ratchford and Heise
(1938). Short (2001) explores the (small) effect of these pensions on the retirement behavior of Confederate veterans.



                                                         30
The Civil War pension proved highly contentious. The reason was not that the individual pension

was significantly larger than the earlier pensions. Controversy on that issue, as we have seen, was

minimized by keeping the nominal pension constant. Economists looking for sticky nominal prices

would have to look hard to find a better example. As can be seen in Figure 2, the post-Civil War

deflation raised the purchasing power of the standard $8 per month pension, measured with the

consumer price index, until at the end of the century it was on a par with the level in the late

antebellum period.

           In terms of wage units the standard pension, as shown by the lower line in Figure 2, was

worth less in the postbellum era. In 1818, to put it somewhat differently, the standard annual pension

could hire a farm laborer for 10 months; but by 1899 it could hire a farm laborer for only 7 months.21

Deflating the pension by the wage of unskilled labor is relevant to the actual pattern of consumption

of many veterans. As the veteran aged he spent more of his income, in many cases, on services such

as nursing care and less on goods. The Civil War pension system was often criticized because it led

to corrupt "pension marriages." An elderly veteran would marry a young woman simply so that she

would be eligible for a pension. One defense offered for the pension marriages was that they were

really part of an exchange that benefited the veteran. The veteran received nursing care from a young

woman for which the veteran was unable to pay out of his current income (because it was fixed in

nominal terms and wages had risen), and in return the young woman entered into a pension marriage

and received the pension after the veteran died.

           Rather than the amount per veteran, the real sources of contention were the large number of

veterans who received pensions, which meant that transfers to veterans materially affected taxes, and

the disparity between the North and the South. As shown in Table 1 Union forces amounted to 6.84

percent of the 1861 population. This percentage meant that the cost of the pensions was visible to the

average taxpayer. The federal government, moreover, was financed to a substantial extent by tariffs.

Southerners, therefore, saw themselves as twice abused.22 First they paid high tariffs on imported

goods, a tariff that protected northern industries from competition, but made it harder for southerners

to export cotton and other cash crops. Then the proceeds of the tariff were distributed to union

veterans and their families. In 1895, for example, tariffs accounted for 47 percent of total revenues;

and pensions (mainly Civil War pensions) accounted for 40 percent of total federal expenditures

(U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, series Y353, Y352, Y457, and Y463).

        The legislation providing pensions for the Civil War veterans evolved along much the same

lines as the legislation providing pensions of the veterans of earlier wars. A general law of 1862

provided a pension at the rate of $8 to $30 per month (depending on rank) for totally disabled

soldiers, or to the widows, orphans, or mothers of soldiers killed in battle. Subsequent legislation

refined the table of benefits, creating specific benefits for a long list of disabilities.

        Two pieces of legislation were crucial to the postwar expansion of the Civil War pension: the

Arrears Act of 1879, and the Dependent Pensions Act of 1890. The Arrears Act became law in

January 1879. Many soldiers had been placed on the rolls and started receiving benefits from dates

well after the end of the war. There was, as many veterans and their advocates pointed out, a

potential inequity here. A soldier who had shown great courage in battle might be receiving less than

another soldier with an inferior military record simply because the first soldier had been slow to

apply for a pension out of pride or lack of understanding. The Arrears Act would make good this

inequity by paying any soldier who had qualified for a pension an additional amount to cover what

they were due from the time of their discharge to the beginning of their pension. The Arrears Act,

22
 Only Union veterans, with one exception, received federal pensions. The exception was the last surviving
Confederate veteran who was pardoned and given a lifetime Federal pension – at age 105.



                                                       32
moreover, applied not only to those currently on the rolls but also to those who would be added in

the future.

           There was some uncertainty about the cost of the Arrears Act, and the plausibility of a

relatively low estimate may have aided passage of the act. At a cabinet meeting at which the bill,

having already passed both houses, was discussed, the Secretary of the Treasury, John Sherman,

offered a figure of $150 million, while Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior, offered a figure of

$50 million based on an estimate by the Pension Office. President Hayes expressed some concern

about the cost of the additional pensions, but signed the bill.23 The cost of the Arrears Act eventually

reached $200 million (U.S. President’s Commission 1956, 81).

           Skocpol (1993, 98-99) has argued that the Arrears Act was not as closely associated with a

bulging surplus in the federal treasury as was the law of 1890 (discussed below). Nevertheless, some

account should be taken of the budget. The budget was in surplus, had been for a number of years.

The surplus, moreover, was needed no longer to deflate the price level because the United States had

returned to gold at the prewar par. Although we shouldn't make too much of the coincidence in

timing, the return to the gold standard was accomplished on January 1, 1879 and the Arrears Act was

passed by Congress on January 25.

           The Dependent Pensions Act of 1890 clearly owed its existence to large budget surpluses.

The law pensioned all veterans who had been honorably discharged and who now suffered from a

disability that prevented them from performing manual labor.24 There was no requirement, as there

had been under previous laws, that the disability be the result of wounds suffered during the war.

The law was not technically a service pension. It would not be until 1907 that a pure service pension


23
     New York Times, "Yesterday's Cabinet Session," January 22, 1879, p. 1
24
     The infirmity could not be the result of the veteran's “own vicious habits.”



                                                             33
became law. The Pension Office, however, was instructed to grant a pension to all veterans who

were 65 or older unless they were unusually vigorous, so in effect the law of 1890 was close to a

service pension. The notion that the law of 1890 amounted to a service pension has been widely

accepted (Costa 1995, 300-301). Figure 6 shows that the spending that resulted from this law (and

from previous liberalizations) was sufficient to erase the surpluses that had persisted in the second

half of the 1880s.

        The close connection between the bulging surpluses in the federal treasury, which were

produced by the tariff, and the liberalization of the pension in the early 1890s was no secret.

Republican politicians made their support for generous pensions and high tariffs clear. As the

Republican Party platform put it in 1888:

        The legislation of Congress should conform to the pledges made by a loyal people and be so
        enlarged and extended as to provide against the possibility that any man who honorably wore
        the Federal uniform shall become the inmate of an almshouse, or dependent upon private
        charity. In the presence of an overflowing treasury it would be a public scandal to do less for
        those whose valorous service preserved the government.


The next, and last, plank in the platform invited “…all workingmen, whose prosperity is seriously

threatened by the free-trade policy of the present Administration,” to vote for the Republican

candidate.25

        After the election President Harrison followed through on Republican promises. His first

appointment to head the Pension Bureau was James Tanner a legless Union veteran who soon got

into trouble. In one of his bombastic speeches, Tanner promised that as Pension Commissioner he

would raise the pensions of veterans receiving only a pittance – often less than a dollar a week for

small disabilities – even if his decisions raised from some lips the prayer: “God help the surplus”

25
  Republican Platform 1888, American Presidency Project, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php. The
Democratic platform noted that the Cleveland Administration had paid out more in pensions than any previous
administration, but made it clear that the Democrats intended to cut the tariff and other Civil War taxes.

(McMurry 1926, 345-347). Green B. Raum, a staunch but more discreet friend of the veteran, soon

replaced Tanner.

       The erosion of the surplus may have affected the next major piece of legislation. When

legislation was passed in 1892 to provide pensions for veterans of the Indian Wars the youngest

veterans who became eligible were veterans of the Seminole wars between 1832 and 1842. In other

words, the minimum time that veterans of the Indian Wars had to wait was 50 years (1842 – 1892):

Veterans of later engagements with Native Americans were not yet old enough for a pension.

       The association between budget surpluses and veterans' pensions that we have identified for

the 19th century is less surprising than it would be in the twentieth century because surpluses were

common. Indeed, between 1800 and 1899 the federal budget was in surplus in 69 out of 100 years,

and in most of those years the surplus was fairly large. Nevertheless, one can show that there was a

strong association between surpluses and pension legislation. Perhaps the simplest calculation that

illustrates the association between budgets and pension legislation is the following. If the chance of a

surplus was .69 the probability that all nine major pieces of pension legislation that we have

identified (Table 2) would have fallen by chance in surplus years was only about 3.5 percent (.699).

If we confine our attention to periods in which there was a run of years with surpluses an even

clearer association between surpluses and pension laws emerges. The probability that by chance all 9

pieces of legislation would have fallen into a year in which the budget was in surplus and had been

in surplus in the two previous years was only .20 percent (.509).

       A more formal method of making the same point is to estimate a regression in which the

dependent variable is a binary variable that takes the value one in years when legislation expanding

benefits for veterans was passed and the independent variables are current and lagged values of the

surplus in the federal budget measured as a percentage of revenues. We ran several regressions of




                                                35
this sort. We started with both the surplus and the first lagged value of the surplus. We dropped the

former because it was not significant, although it was signed correctly. The result was the following.



Legislation = -2.21 + .038*Surplus(-1)       (McFadden R2 = .20)
                      (2.36)



This was a probit regression. The number in parentheses is the z-statistic, which indicates that

Surplus(-1) was significant at the .02 level. Adding additional lags of the surplus did not yield

significant variables or improve the fit. The results were similar when logit or extreme value

methods were used to estimate the equation. Evidently, as both the narratives and the equations

suggests there was a strong association between the condition of the federal treasury and pension

legislation for veterans.



                              8. Some Tentative Generalizations

       Veterans' benefits varied substantially from war to war in the nineteenth century and were

usually the subject of bitter controversy. Veterans of the War of 1812 received less than veterans of

either the Revolution or the Mexican War. Union veterans of the Civil War did well compared with

veterans of earlier wars, but only after a contentious political debate.

       Several factors account for the differences across wars. Veterans’ benefits evolved, first of all,

along a path-dependent process. The precedent set by past policies shaped what was considered a

fair reward for service. Veterans of a given war would point to how veterans of previous wars were

treated and demand equity. Veterans who served in the militia would point to veterans who had

served in the regular army and demand equity. Privates and noncommissioned officers would point




                                                 36
to the awards made to commissioned officers and demand equity. Opponents of generous benefits

pointed to what they regarded as abuses of previous systems and demanded greater economy.

       We would like to believe that feelings toward veterans were independent of the war they

fought. There are some suggestions in the historical record, however, that the politics of a war

influenced how and when its veterans were rewarded. This is an inherently difficult proposition to

prove because the it is not the sort of thing that people involved in the political process are likely to

talk about. Nevertheless, we can point to several possible examples: (1) In the years immediately

following the Revolutionary War, veterans of the militia were considered the real heroes, and

veterans of the Continental Army were sometimes perceived as lesser soldiers, as mere mercenaries.

With the rise of the image of the suffering soldier, associated especially with Valley Forge, however,

pressure built for cash benefits for veterans of the Continental Army. (2) Attempts were made to add

veterans of campaigns carried out against Native Americans in the wake of the Revolution to the

service pension rolls, but these efforts ran into opposition based partly on the contention that these

were wars carried out for private gain. (3) The veterans of the War of 1812 received less in cash and

land than either the veterans of the Revolution or the veterans of the Mexican War. There were a

number of reasons, but one may have been that the war itself was politically divisive, and went badly

for the United States. (4) The Mexican War was much more successful from a military point of view

than the War of 1812. Nevertheless, in the 1880s the veterans of the Mexican War were frustrated on

some occasions in their campaign for a service pension for political reasons. Republican Congresses

were unsympathetic to what they regarded as a southern war undertaken by a southern president to

expand slavery, and fought by men who later served in the Confederate military. (5) Confederate

veterans, of course, received nothing from the federal government. Even pensioners from antebellum




                                                  37
wars who lived in the South during the Civil War had to prove their loyalty during the Civil War to

remain on the rolls (U.S. Senate 1867).

       We would also like to believe that veterans’ benefits are independent of fiscal politics. After

all, since it's founding the United States has been a wealthy nation compared to most other nations,

and has always been in a position to reward veterans generously whatever the current balance of

taxes and spending. Nevertheless, in case after case, the state of the treasury was an important

determinant of the level of benefits: When federal coffers were full, additional benefits were

provided; when coffers were empty, claims for additional benefits were rejected.

       Here are some examples. (1) The officers of the Revolutionary Army asked for half-pay for

life, the practice in the British army. The American officers, however, were forced to settle for bonds

worth five year's pay at face value. Under the Confederation, moreover, Congress failed to pay the

interest on the bonds, and many former officers parted with their bonds at a fraction of their face

value. (2) In 1818, however, after a two-year run of treasury surpluses, The Continental Army’s

officers and common soldiers in "reduced circumstances" received a lifetime pension. In 1828 and in

1832, after another run of surpluses that began in 1825, benefits were awarded to veterans without

regard to their economic status, and in 1836, after the last and largest of these surpluses; widows of

ordinary soldiers were pensioned, even when the marriage took place after the war. (3) The veterans

of the War of 1812 were not successful in winning postwar rewards until the Mexican War created

the precedent for a generous land bounty and, not incidentally, the means – the vast lands won from

Mexico – for awarding it. The veterans of the War of 1812 eventually qualified for a cash service

pension in 1871 in the middle of a run of double-digit surpluses. Even in 1871, moreover, 56 years

after the end of the war, there was some sentiment for means-testing the pension to save expenses. (4)

The Arrears Act of 1879, which increased the incentives for Civil War veterans to apply for pensions,




                                                38
also was passed during a period of surpluses, and when the surpluses could no longer be defended on

the grounds that they were needed to deflate prices and restore the gold standard. (5) The Dependent

Pensions Act of 1890 was passed during a period of large treasury surpluses, and the connection

with the budget was explicit. The Republicans promised to support a high tariff and to expand

pension benefits.

       One might hope that decisions on veterans' benefits would be above politics. In the

nineteenth-century, at least, the opposite was true. Affection for the veterans as individuals often

took second place to the politics of war and to current budget realities.

Appendix: Nineteenth-Century Veterans' Statistics.

For the 1956 edition of Historical Statistics the Veterans Administration made estimates of

the number of veterans receiving pensions by period of service (in the case of deceased

veterans their descendants received the benefits) and the amount of expenditures. These

estimates were carried over in the Bicentennial and Millennial editions. The estimates for the

nineteenth century, however, were incomplete: There was no information on the number or

dollar amount of pensions before 1866. More information was given for the postbellum, but

no distinction was made between pensions for military personnel and pensions for their heirs.

Some additional data was available in Glasson (1918) who presented separate estimates on

number of pensions and their dollar value for veterans and heirs for the War of 1812, the

Mexican War, the Indian Wars, and the Civil War. Glasson also did not present figures for

the period prior to the Civil War. He also did not present figures for the period after 1866 for

compensation, except at 5-year intervals, or for Revolutionary war pensions. No estimates

were presented, moreover, in these sources of the amount of land given to veterans, an

important source of benefits in the antebellum era. To fill these gaps we made annual

estimates by period of service for the whole of the nineteenth century of the annual number

and dollar value of pensions and of the total amount and total dollar value of land. Tables

A1-A4 contain our estimates.

       The Number of Pensions. Table A1, which is divided into A1 and A1 continued,

shows the number of pensions annually from 1791 until 1900. These estimates were

compiled mainly from the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Pensions. Column (1)

shows the total number of pensions on the rolls. Columns (2) and (3) show the number of

pensions awarded as compensation to soldiers or sailors for disabilities incurred while in




                                             52
service – these were known as "invalid pensions" in the nineteenth century – and to widows

or other dependents as compensation for the death of a soldier or sailor in service. Columns

(4) and (5) of Table A1 show pensions awarded for service in the Revolution. Table A1

continued shows the number of pensions awarded for service during the War of 1812, the

Mexican War, the Civil War, and the Indian Wars. These pensions were awarded after the

Civil War, so Table A1 continued begins in 1870.

       There are certain limitations to these series. (1) Each pension was awarded because an

individual served in the armed forces. In some cases, however, the pensions were divided

among several descendants. This is the reason the tables refer to the number of “pensions”

rather than the number of "pensioners." (2) The tables exclude some awards paid as lump

sums, perhaps because the number on the rolls was meant to serve as a predictor of future

expenses. The Commissioner of Pensions, moreover, may have missed some pensions paid

by other federal offices. (3) The rolls listed some pensioners who had died and whose heirs

were not entitled to a pension. The decrease in the number of pensions in 1841 and 1842 was

the result of a purging of the names of pensioners assumed to be dead. Despite these

limitations, we believe the number of pensions provides a good picture of the growth of the

pension system in the nineteenth century.

       The series in Table A1 may be of interest for issues aside from those explored in this

paper. The series showing the number of pensions compensating for death and disability, for

example, is new, and puts into perspective the amount of fighting in the War of 1812, the

Seminole War, the Mexican War, and the Civil War.

       Cash payments. For the years up to 1865, we relied on The Statement of Annual

Appropriations and Expenditures for Army and Navy Pensions, March 4, 1789, to June 30,

1876 (U.S. Senate 1877). We checked these figures against the figures in the Annual Reports

of the Commissioner of Pensions. In broad terms the figures in the two sources agree,

although there are many small discrepancies that may be the result of accounting differences.

There are also a number of differences between Historical Statistics (2006 series Ea643) and

column 1 of Table A2. The former seems to have been carried over from the 1876 Finance

Report. The Senate document (1876, 30-31) explains the differences between its estimates

and those in the Finance Report. The main differences are that the Senate document includes

expenditures made by the Naval and Privateer Pension Funds, excludes certain transfers

made to Virginia to settle claims for previous payments to veterans, and includes a number of

miscellaneous expenditures. On the whole, the Senate series would appear to give a more

accurate account of current spending. There are still probably omissions.

       Beginning in 1866 we relied on the estimates of total spending in Historical Statistics

(2006, series Ed297) and Glasson (1918). Glasson compiled the data from the Annual

Reports of the Commissioner of Pensions for the War of 1812 (p. 113), the Indian Wars (p.

115), the Mexican War (p. 119), and the law of 1890 (p.271). We also included annual

estimates from the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Pensions for expenditures for

general compensation since Glasson (1918, 144) only included estimates at 5-year intervals,

and for the Revolutionary War pensions which Glasson omitted.

        Land Grants. Table A3 shows a preliminary estimate of the amount of land awarded

to veterans of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Mexican War. We started

with 2,666,080 acres awarded by the Continental Congress and the federal government

(Gates 1968, 276; Weber and Schmeckebier 1934, 451). We then added the amounts awarded

by the states cited in Gates (1968): New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia (and Indiana), and

Georgia. Gates did not include figures for four other states that granted land: Massachusetts

(and Maine after it became a separate state), Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina.26

For these states we included a rough estimate equal to .497 times the amount awarded by the

states for which we had estimates. The ratio .497 was based on bounties listed on 10 pages

randomly selected from Bockstruck (1996). Although small, the sample contains 469 records,

and the ratio quickly settled in the neighborhood of one half. The total awarded to veterans of

the Revolution, according to the last line of Table A3, was 16,599,283 acres, of which only

16 percent came from the Continental Congress and federal government, while 37 percent

came from the extraordinary grants made by Virginia to its veterans.

        Our estimate for the veterans of the War of 1812, based on the legislation passed

during and immediately after the war, is 4,891,000 acres (Gates 1968, 276; Weber and

Schmeckebier 1934, 451). To estimate the amount of the land awarded to veterans of the War

of 1812 after the Mexican War we relied on James W. Oberly (1990). Oberly's Table 4 (1990,

18) shows a distribution of land warrants by period of service under the Act of 1850 based on

a sample of warrants, Table 5 (Oberly 1990, 20) shows a distribution for the Act of 1852, and

Table 6 (Oberly 1990, 22) shows a distribution for the Act of 1855. We blew up the sample

26
  New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut, apparently, did not grant land to veterans.
Connecticut, however, did award land to citizens as compensation for property damaged during the
Revolution.

estimates by 200 (Oberly's sampling ratio) to produce estimates of the total amount of acres

transferred to veterans by period of service (War of 1812, Mexican War, and other 19th

century conflicts) under each law.

       To estimate the amount of land awarded to veterans of the Mexican War we also

included the amount of land awarded under the Law of 1847 (Oberly 1990, 3) in addition to

the estimates for the Mexican War derived from Tables 4, 5, 6. The total amount issued to

veterans of the Mexican War, 16,885,640 acres, is less than the total amount issued to

veterans of War of 1812 after the Mexican War, 34,304,000 acres, because more soldiers

served in the War of 1812 (Table 1). The estimate of land per veteran for the Mexican War in

Figure 5 was computed by dividing the total amount of land awarded to veterans of the

Mexican War by the standard estimates of the number who served (Table 1). This results in a

rather large acreage per veteran. We do not have a definitive explanation for this anomaly. It

is possible that some men who received bounties did not actually join the expeditionary force

and proceed to Mexico.

The Value of the Land Grants. The estimates cited in the text of the value of land grants

in the antebellum era are back-of-the-envelope calculations intended only to provide a

sense of relative magnitudes. For the Revolution we started with our estimate of total

land grants to revolutionary officers and soldiers from Table A3. We assumed that 30

percent of these grants were sold in the first year after the war, 25 percent in the second

year, and so on. We priced land at $.50 per acre. Stanley Lebergott (1985, 186) used

$1.00 per acre for federal land circa 1800. Farley Grubb (2005, 25-26) zeros in on the

same figure. Discussions of the revolutionary land grants, however, stress that most of the

land was sold to speculators at relatively low prices before 1800, hence the lower

estimate. We then deflated by a cost of living index (Historical Statistics 2006, series Cc2)

to put the resulting value in 1860 dollars and computed the present value at the end of the

war at 6 percent. The final figure was $6,179,593. A slower schedule of sales, in which

only 25 percent of the land was disposed of in the first year after the war, yielded a figure

of $4,654,508.

       To estimate the value of the land bounties awarded to veterans of the War of 1812,

we started with the estimates in Table A3. We assumed that the warrants issued during

the war were generally disposed of quickly after the war was over, 40 percent in the first

year, 30 percent in the second year, 20 percent in the third year, and 10 percent in the

fifth year. The assumption of rapid disposal is consistent with most descriptions of the

process. We then multiplied the amount disposed of in each year by a rough estimate of

$.72 per acre (Oberly 1990, 9-10). This is very likely an upper bound estimate. The

nominal amounts received in each year were then deflated by the consumer price index

and the present value was taken in 1815 at 6 percent.




                                             70
       The estimates of the value of the warrants issued to veterans of the War of 1812

after the Mexican War and the warrants issued to the veterans of the Mexican War were

computed analogously. We assumed that 40 percent of the warrants were disposed of in

the first year, 30 percent in the following year, 20 percent in the year after that, and 10

percent in the fifth year after the war. We then multiplied the acreage figures disposed of

in each year by Oberly's estimate of the value of land warrants (1990, Table 28, 170). We

then deflated these figures by the cost of living index (Historical Statistics 2006, series

Cc2) and discounted them at 6 percent to the end of the War of 1812 or the end of the

Mexican War as appropriate.
