                                              ABSTRACT

We study rollover risk and collateral value in a dynamic asset pricing model with endogenous debt
financing by extending the framework of Geanakoplos (2009) with a generic binomial tree and time-varying
heterogeneous beliefs. Optimistic borrowers face rollover risk if the belief dispersion between the
borrowers and the pessimistic lenders widens after interim bad news. We demonstrate the optimality
of the maximum riskless short-term debt financing for optimistic borrowers even in the presence of
the rollover risk. We also highlight the role of interim trading which, by allowing creditors to sell
seized collateral to other optimists with saved cashes, boosts the asset’s collateral value and equilibrium
price.

    Short-term debt such as overnight repos and commercial paper was heavily used by nancial

institutions to fund their investment positions during the asset market boom preceding the nancial

crisis of 2007-2008, and later played a major role in leading to the distress of these institutions

during the crisis. What explains the popularity of short-term debt in nancing asset market invest-

ments? Geanakoplos (2010) presents a dynamic model of the joint equilibrium of asset markets

and credit markets, in which optimistic buyers of a risky asset use the asset as collateral to raise

debt nancing from less optimistic creditors. The asset's collateral value depends on the marginal

creditor's asset valuation, and determines the buyers' purchasing capacity to bid up the asset price.

Geanakoplos posits that short-term debt allows the asset buyers to maximize riskless leverage.1

However, short-term debt exposes the asset buyers to rollover risk (e.g., Acharya, Gale, and Yorul-

maker (2011), and He and Xiong (2011, 2012)), which is re ected in the fact that the asset buyers

in Geanakoplos' model may not be able to obtain re nancing after a negative fundamental shock.

As a result, they are forced to transfer their asset holdings to the creditors, causing a leverage cy-

cle to emerge. The presence of such rollover risk prompts a fundamental question regarding the

optimality of short-term debt nancing.

      The existing literature also offers several other advantages of short-term debt. First, short-term debt can act as
a disciplinary device by giving the creditors the option to pull out if they discover that rm managers are pursuing
value-destroying projects (e.g., Calomiris and Kahn (1991)). Second, the short maturity also makes short-term debt
less information sensitive and thus less exposed to adverse-selection problems (e.g., Gorton and Pennacchi (1990)).

   Moreover, one might argue that as creditors are less optimistic and undervalue risky debt issued

by optimistic asset buyers, it is not desirable for the buyers to use risky nancing. Following

Geanakoplos' framework, Simsek (2011) examines a setting in which asset buyers have to hold

their positions until the asset matures. He shows that optimistic asset buyers may use risky debt

 nancing despite their debt being undervalued by the creditors. The contrast between Simsek's

and Geanakoplos' analysis suggests that the asset's tradability in the interim periods may affect

the debt nancing of asset buyers.

   This paper examines the optimal use of debt nancing by extending the dynamic framework

of Geanakoplos along two dimensions. First, we allow the asset's fundamental value to follow a

generic binomial tree, which takes multiple values after multiple periods, as opposed to the two

values in Geanakoplos' model. Second, we allow two groups of agents to have time-varying beliefs

about the asset's fundamental, and, in particular, to have more dispersed beliefs after a negative

fundamental shock. The more dispersed beliefs make debt re nancing more expensive to the

optimistic asset buyers and thus expose them to greater rollover risk. The rollover risk motivates

long-term debt nancing. To uncover the role played by the asset's tradability, we also contrast two

settings: the main setting whereby agents can freely trade the asset on any date, and a benchmark

setting whereby agents cannot trade after the initial date. The non-tradability is due to the presence

of informational and trading frictions that prevent agents from promptly responding to fundamental

 uctuations, and makes the benchmark setting essentially static and analogous to that of Simsek.

   Our analysis delivers several results. First, to our surprise, the maximum riskless short-term

leverage is optimal despite the presence of rollover risk. While long-term debt nancing can dom-

inate short-term debt nancing when the rollover risk is suf ciently high (i.e., belief dispersion

becomes suf ciently high after a negative shock), the improved investment opportunity after in-

terim negative fundamental shocks makes saving cash for that state more desirable than acquiring

the position. Thus, long-term debt nancing is dominated either by short-term debt nancing or


                                                  2
by saving cash. This result explains the pervasive use of short-term debt in practice. It also veri es

the statement put forward by Geanakoplos, albeit due to optimists' cash saving incentives rather

than his argument that short-term debt allows optimists to maximize riskless leverage.

     Second, we highlight the role played by the asset's tradability. By making it possible to buy

the liquidated collateral on an interim date, the asset's tradability motivates some optimists to save

cash, which, in turn, boosts the creditors' valuation of the collateral on the initial date, as well as

the optimists' purchasing capacity to bid up the asset price.

     Finally, despite the market incompleteness due to the borrowing constraints faced by the op-

timists, we derive a risk-neutral representation of the equilibrium prices of the asset and debt

contracts collateralized by the asset. This is because the payoff of a collateralized debt contract is

monotonic with respect to the asset's value and thus shares the same marginal investor as the asset.

This representation facilitates our analysis and could prove useful in analyzing issues related to

collateralized debt nancing in more complex settings.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the model. We derive the static bench-

mark setting in Section 2, and analyze the dynamic setting in Section 3. We provide an online

appendix to cover more details and all the technical derivations. The online Appendix also extends

the two-period model described in the paper to N periods.


1      The Model

Consider a model with three dates t = 0; 1; 2 and a long-term risky asset. The asset's nal payoff

on date 2 is determined by a publicly observable binomial tree (Figure 1). The asset's nal payoff
e at the end of the path uu is 1; at the end of ud and du is ; and at the end of dd is        2
                                                                                                  ; where

    2 (0; 1) : The probability of the tree going up in each period is unobservable. Two groups of

risk-neutral agents differ in their beliefs about these probabilities. We collect an agent's beliefs on

the three intermediate states, one on date 0 and two on date 1 (u and d), by f i0 ;      i
                                                                                         u;
                                                                                              i
                                                                                              dg   where

i 2 fh; lg indicates the agent's type. We assume that the h-type agents are always more optimistic

than the l-type agents (the superscript “h” and “l” stand for high and low):               h
                                                                                           n
                                                                                                   l
                                                                                                   n   for any

n 2 f0; u; dg : We emphasize that each agent's belief changes over time, driven by either his

learning process or sentimental uctuation. As a result, the belief dispersion between the optimists

and pessimists varies over time. Our analysis highlights the case where the optimists face rollover

risk in the intermediate state d when the belief dispersion between the optimists and pessimists

diverges (i.e.,    h
                   d
                        l
                        d
                              h
                              0
                                    l
                                    0    0).2

        The pessimists (l-type agents) who have in nite amount of cash (deep pockets) are initially

endowed with all of the asset, normalized to be one unit. On date 0; each optimist (an h-type

agent) is endowed with c dollars of cash. We assume that both the risk-free interest rate and the

agents' discount rate are zero and short sales of the asset are not allowed. We focus on non-

contingent debt contracts, which specify constant debt payments at maturity unless the borrowers

default.


2        The Static Setting

We rst consider a benchmark setting in which agents cannot trade the asset on date 1 and are

restricted from using debt contracts that mature on date 1: This setting is effectively static with
    2
   We simplify the continuum of constant beliefs considered by Geanakoplos (2009) to two types. By focusing on
homogeneous optimists, we can isolate an optimist's incentive to save cash from a pure belief effect.


                                                      4
three possible nal states on date 2. Like Geanakoplos (2010), we allow the optimists to use their

asset holdings as collateral to obtain debt nancing.

      Suppose that an optimist uses a debt contract, collateralized by one unit of the asset with a

promised payment F due on date 2. The debt's eventual payment is e ^ F                  min F; e : A
                                                      h       i
pessimistic creditor will grant a credit of D0 = El0 e ^ F , where El0 is the expectation operator
                                                                                             h      i
under the pessimist's belief. To establish the asset position, the optimist has to use p0 El0 e ^ F

of his own cash. This amount is the so-called haircut. With a cash endowment of c, the optimist
                         h       i
can purchase c= p0 El0 e ^ F        units of the asset. Each unit gives an expected payoff of
   h          i
Eh0 e e ^ F : Maximizing the expected pro t leads to the optimist's optimal choice of leverage

F .

      In the joint equilibrium of the asset and credit markets, each optimist maximizes his expected

pro t. As an optimist could also choose to acquire the debt issued by other optimists instead of

the asset, another equilibrium condition requires that the marginal value of investing one dollar in

the asset is as good as investing in debt issued by other optimists. Furthermore, if the optimists

are the marginal investors of the asset, the market clearing condition requires that the asset price is

determined by the optimists' aggregate purchasing power (the sum of their cash endowment c and
                       h       i
the borrowed credit El0 e ^ F ). In the online Appendix, we describe these conditions in detail

and derive the equilibrium. Here, we highlight the key characteristics of the equilibrium.

      The equilibrium crucially depends on whether the belief dispersion between the optimists and

pessimists is concentrated in the highest state uu (i.e., the belief dispersion about uu being higher

than about the three upper states fuu; ud; dug):

                                         h   h       h       h   h   h
                                         0   u       0   +       0

                                                             d
                                                             l   l
                                                                     d
                                                                     l
                                                                       :                                  (1)
                                         0   u       0   +   d   0   d


This condition is consistent with the monotonic belief ordering imposed by Simsek (2011). To

facilitate our interpretation, suppose   h
                                         u   =   l
                                                 u   (i.e., there is no belief divergence at state u after the


                                                         5
interim good news). Then, (1) can be rewritten as

                                            h             l   h
                                            d     1       0   0
                                            l             h   l
                                                                :
                                            d     1       0   0


As the optimists with short-term debt nancing have to roll over their debt after the interim bad

news in state d of date 1 and as the belief divergence in this state (   d = d)
                                                                         h   l
                                                                                  captures their re nancing

cost, (1) requires the rollover risk faced by the optimists be modest relative to their initial specu-

lative incentives on date 0. As we are mainly interested in scenarios with signi cant rollover risk,

our later analysis will focus on the case whereby (1) fails.

    Under the monotone belief dispersion speci ed in (1), the optimists will use risky debt with a

promised payment       to nance their asset acquisition when their cash endowment is suf ciently

low (Proposition 2 of the online Appendix). Despite their debt being undervalued by the creditors,

the optimists believe that the asset price is suf ciently attractive to offset the high nancing cost.

This result is consistent with that of Simsek (2011), and builds on the three-point distribution of

the asset's fundamental on the nal date, as opposed to the two-point distribution in Geanakoplos

(2010). On the other hand, if (1) is not satis ed, the optimists use only riskless debt with a promised
           2
payment        to nance their asset acquisition (Proposition 3 of the online Appendix). This is the

case that we focus on.


3    The Dynamic Setting

We now allow agents to trade the risky asset on the interim date—date 1—after the two possible

states, u and d, are revealed to the public. As a result, each optimist can also make endogenous

investment and leverage decisions in these two interim states. Moreover, each optimist has the

choice to use either short-term debt maturing on date 1 or long-term debt maturing on date 2 to

 nance his asset position on date 0.




                                                      6
3.1     Risk-Neutral Representation of Prices

Despite the nancing constraints faced by the optimists, we can still establish a risk-neutral rep-

resentation of the prices of the asset and debt contracts collateralized by the asset. It is realistic

to allow the collateralized debt contracts to be tradable on dates 0 and 1: The payoff of a collater-

alized debt contract is monotonic with respect to the asset's value, and thus must share the same

marginal investor, whose identity can be either optimist or pessimist and can be different across

states. We can represent the price Ps of the asset or any debt contract collateralized by the asset in

any intermediate state s 2 fu; d; 0g by a risk-neutral form:


      Pu =         u Puu   + (1        u ) Pud ;   Pd =      d Pud   + (1        d ) Pdd ;    P0 =        0 Pu   + (1           0 ) Pd ;



where     s   is the marginal investor's effective belief in state s.

   These effective beliefs are directly linked with the optimists' marginal value of cash. Consider

the intermediate state d. The asset price pd must be between the optimists' and pessimists' asset
                  h                i
valuations: pd 2 Eld e ; Ehd e and d 2 ld ; hd . One dollar of cash allows an optimist to

acquire the asset at a discount to his valuation. Each dollar, levered up by using a debt contract
                                                                                       2
collateralized by one unit of the asset and with a promise of                                (the maximum riskless promise),
                                                               2
allows him to acquire a position of 1= pd                            units of the asset and thus gives a marginal value
                           2              2
of vd =       h
              d                 = pd          =     h
                                                    d= d    2 1;         h  l
                                                                         d= d   : Similarly, his marginal value of cash in

state u is vu =            h
                           u   (1   ) = (pu        )=       h
                                                            u= u:    On date 0, the optimists can either use the cash,

levered up by collateralized debt, to acquire the asset or save it for date 1. Thus, his marginal value

of cash at date 0 is the maximum of the two choices:

3.2       An Optimist's Problem

An individual optimist faces three alternatives on date 0: He can establish an asset position by

using short-term debt nancing; he can use long-term debt nancing; or he can simply save cash

for establishing a position later on date 1.

   Suppose that he uses a debt contract Fe (either long-term or short-term) collateralized by each

unit of asset to nance a position. By selling the debt to the marginal investor in the market he

obtains a credit of D0 Fe =           0 Du   Fe + (1             0 ) Dd    Fe ; where we denote Ds the debt value

in state s. Thus, each dollar of cash allows him to establish a position of x = 1= (p0                          D0 ) units

of the asset. This position gives an expected pro t of
                         h
                         0 vu pu   + 1       h
                                             0   vd pd               h
                                                                     0 vu Du   Fe + 1        h
                                                                                             0       vd Dd Fe
           V0     Fe =                                                                                           :     (2)
                                                            p0       D0 Fe

This equation re ects two effects. One is a leverage effect: a more aggressive debt contract allows

the optimist to establish a greater position, as shown by the denominator of (2). The other is a

debt-cost effect: a more aggressive debt contract also implies a higher expected debt payment in

the future, as shown by the term         h
                                         0 vu Du   + 1           h
                                                                 0    vd Dd in the numerator of (2).


Debt Maturity Choice         In light of (2), when the optimist compares a pair of long-term and short-

term debt contracts with the same initial credit, he prefers the one with a lower expected debt cost.

For these two contracts to give the same initial credit, we must have

                                  S                     S            L                 L
                               0 Du   + (1         0 ) Dd   =     0 Du    + (1    0 ) Dd ;


where, with potential abuse of notation, DsS (DsL ) denotes the value of the long-term (short-

term) debt in state s 2 fu; dg : We de ne the optimist's cash-value-adjusted probability as bh0
 h
 0 vu =
           h
           0 vu   + 1    h
                         0   vd : The short-term contract gives the lower expected debt cost to the

optimist, and thus preferable to the long-term debt, if and only if bh0                          0   (Proposition 7 of the

online Appendix).

                                                            8
   This result establishes that the optimist's debt maturity choice depends on his cash-value-

adjusted belief relative to the creditor's belief. The basic intuition works as follows: re nancing

the short-term debt allows the borrower to trade a higher payment in state d for a lower payment

in state u. Whether this trade is preferable depends on whether the borrower's belief about the

probability of the up state, after adjusting for his marginal value of cash in the future states, is

higher than the creditor's belief.

   We can further show in the online Appendix that bh0              0   holds when (1) holds. Thus, when

rollover risk is relatively high, long-term debt could dominate short-term debt in nancing the

optimists' asset positions. This result contrasts the standard intuition that optimists always prefer

short-term debt nancing if they have to borrow from pessimistic creditors.


Cash Saving The optimist can also choose to save cash for the next date. Interestingly, saving

cash dominates over using long-term debt to nance an asset position if bh0 <               0   (Proposition

8 of the online Appendix). This is because the asset appears to be overvalued to the optimist

after adjusting for his marginal value of cash on the following date. This result shows that when

long-term debt dominates short-term debt for nancing the optimist's asset position, saving cash

dominates for establishing the position. Thus, the optimist will never strictly prefer long-term

debt in the equilibrium. He could be indifferent between using long-term and short-term debt in

 nancing his position only if bh0 =     0:




Optimal Debt Financing In summary, if bh0 >             0,   the optimist will establish an asset position

by using short-term debt with the maximum riskless promise to pay pd on date 1; if bh0 <                 0;

he will save cash; if bh0 =   0,   he is indifferent between saving cash and establishing the position

(using either long-term or short-term debt).

3.3    The Equilibrium

The pessimists are initially endowed with all of the asset. Due to their risk neutrality and deep

pockets, their asset valuations put lower bounds on the prices of the asset and any collateralized

debt contract. On date 0; the pessimists are the marginal investor if and only if          0   =   l
                                                                                                   0:   They are

indifferent between selling and retaining the asset in this case, and prefer selling if        0   >    0.
                                                                                                        l


   The joint equilibrium of the asset and credit markets can be characterized by the prices of

the asset on date 0 and in states u and d of date 1: fp0 ; pu ; pd g; the fraction of optimists who

establish asset positions on date 0:     2 [0; 1]; and the fraction of pessimists who sell their asset

endowments on date 0:      2 [0; 1] : In this equilibrium, each optimist and each pessimist solve his

optimal decisions based on our earlier discussion, and the markets for the asset and the debt used

by optimists must clear. In particular, if the optimists are the marginal investor in the markets,

their aggregate purchasing power needs to be suf cient to support the asset price. We present the

speci c equilibrium conditions for each intermediate state s 2 f0; u; dg in the online Appendix,

which also characterizes various cases that arise in the equilibrium.

   Now we provide a numerical illustration to contrast the dynamic setting with the static bench-

mark setting. We set     = 0:4;   h
                                  0   = 0:6;   l
                                               0   = 0:55;   h
                                                             u   =   l
                                                                     u   = 0:5;   h
                                                                                  d   = 0:75; and       l
                                                                                                        d   = 0:4:

The speci ed belief structure does not satisfy the monotone belief dispersion given in (1), and thus

captures the rollover risk discussed after (1) in Section 2.

   Figure 2 illustrates the effects of varying optimists' cash endowment c from 0:42 to 0:07: Panel

A depicts the date-0 asset price p0 . The two horizontal lines at the levels of 0:5 and 0:556 represent

the pessimists' and the optimists' expectation of the asset's fundamental value, i.e., El0 (e) and

Eh0 (e): The equilibrium price has to fall between these two benchmark levels. The dotted-and-

dashed line is the asset price under the static setting discussed in Section 2. When c is above 0:4;

the equilibrium price is equal to the optimists' valuation. Once c falls below 0:4; the asset price

starts to fall with c and is determined by the optimists' purchasing power rather than their valuation.

As c falls below 0:336, the marginal investor shifts to the pessimists and the asset price is equal to

the pessimists' valuation.

     The solid line in Panel A gives the asset price in the dynamic setting discussed in this section.

Like the dotted-and-dashed line, when c is above 0:4; the equilibrium price is equal to the opti-

mists' valuation; and the asset price starts to fall with c once c falls below 0:4. Interestingly, as c

drops below 0:357 but above 0:14; the price levels off at the level 0:523. In this range, the asset

price is substantially higher than that in the static setting. Panel C reveals the key source of this

difference—as c falls, a greater fraction of the optimists (1                                                               ) choose to save cash on date 0 and

more pessimists hold their asset endowments ( ). As further shown by Panels B and D, in this

range the optimists' cash saving sustains the asset price pd and the implied belief of the marginal

investor         d   in state d of date 1 at constant levels, and, in particular, ensures the optimists as the

marginal investor in this state (i.e.,                                           d   >         d ).
                                                                                               l
                                                                                                      Panel D also shows that the marginal investor on

date 0 is the pessimists (                            0   =       l
                                                                  0     = 0:55). Despite this, the date-0 asset price p0 is higher than that


                                                                                                      11
in the static setting because the pessimists anticipate that pd will be determined by the optimists.

   As c gets lower than 0:14 but higher than 0:09, all optimists save cash on date 0 ( = 0) and

all pessimists hold their asset endowments ( = 0). In this case, the optimists remain the marginal

investor of the asset in state d. As the optimists have saved all of their cash endowments to state

d, the asset price in this state now falls with c, which in turn causes the asset price on date 0 to fall

with c as well. Nevertheless, the date-0 price p0 is higher than that in the static setting because the

pessimists, the marginal investor on date 0, anticipate selling their asset holdings to optimists in

state d. Only when c falls below 0:09 do the pessimists become the marginal investor of the asset

both on date 0 and in state d of date 1. As a result, the prices in the dynamic and static settings

coincide.

   Taken together, Figure 2 demonstrates a signi cant impact of the asset's tradability when the

optimists' cash endowment c is in the intermediate range between 0:09 and 0:357. In this range,

the tradability induces at least some optimists to preserve cash from date 0 to state d, where the

marginal value of cash is highest. These optimists' cash saving supports the asset price in state d,

which in turn motivates the pessimists to assign a higher collateral value to the asset on date 0:

    This online appendix provides a more detailed description of the model discussed in the
main paper, and lists all of the propositions and proofs. The appendix also extends the
model to N periods. We describe the static setting in Section 1 and the dynamic setting in
Section 2. Section 3 extends the model. Section 4 gives the proofs of all propositions and
lemmas.


1     The Static Setting
                                                     h         h i     h i
In equilibrium, the date-0 price of the asset p0 2       El0    e ; Eh e . Suppose that an optimist
                                                                     0

                                                                   h     i
creditor will grant the following credit for the contract: D0 = El0 e ^ F : To establish the

asset position, the optimist has to use p0 E0 ^ F of his own cash. This amount is the
so-called haircut. With a cash endowment of c, the optimist can purchase p Elc e^F units

of the asset. Since each unit gives an expected payo¤ of Eh0 e e ^ F , he can maximize
his expected value by choosing the debt promise F :
                                           h         i
                                          h e   e
                                        E0        ^F
                                  maxc         h     i:                                         (1)

                                        p0 E0 ^ F

    In formulating this objective, we implicitly assume that the credit o¤ered by the pes-
simistic creditor is the same as the market value of the debt contract. As other optimists
may …nd the debt contract attractive and o¤er a higher price than pessimists, we need to
verify that this is not the case in equilibrium. In fact, this condition does bind in certain
situations. Formally, suppose that in equilibrium the optimal debt promise is F ; which

                                               1
maximizes the optimist’s objective in (1). This implies that the marginal value of one dollar,
                                                                 Eh [e e^F ]
v0 , to an optimist from acquiring the levered asset position is p 0 El e^F :We need to verify
                                                                  0   0[     ]
that this is not lower than his expected value from using an optimal leverage to acquire the
debt contract (which has a payo¤ of e ^ F ):
                      h          i              h                          i
                   Eh0 e e ^ F               Eh0 e ^ F      e^F ^F
                         h       i max h             i      h                  i:          (2)

                                          El0 e ^ F      El0 e ^ F ^ F

   Thus, we call a pair of (p0 ; F ) the joint equilibrium of the asset and credit markets if
the following two conditions hold:

  1. Given the asset price p0 , F maximizes an individual optimist’s investment objective
      in (1) and satis…es the constraint in (2).

  2. The asset market clears:

                    : Eh0 e            if c + El0 e ^ F > Eh0 e

     The market clearing condition requires that if the optimists’aggregate purchasing power,
                                                                                      h        i
which is determined by the sum of their cash endowment c and the borrowed credit El0 e ^ F ;
                                                h i
is lower than the pessimists’asset valuation El0 e , the pessimists will determine the price at
their valuation; if the optimists’purchasing power is between the pessimists’and optimists’
asset valuations, the asset price p0 is exactly equal to the optimists’purchasing power; and
                                                                                    h i
                                                                                  h e
if the optimists’purchasing power is higher than the optimists’asset valuation E        , they
                                                                                         0

   The following lemma shows that the optimal debt promise must be between                   and .

1.1    Monotonic Belief Dispersion
We …rst consider the situation that the belief dispersion between optimists and pessimists
about the highest state uu is higher than their belief dispersion about the three upper states

                                     h   h   h       h   h   h
                                     0   u   0   +   d   0   d

                                                 2
This condition implies that the belief dispersion is concentrated in the highest state and
is consistent with the monotonic belief ordering imposed by Simsek (2011). As we will
discuss later in the dynamic setting, this condition also implies that the rollover risk faced
by optimists with short-term debt …nancing in state d of date 1 is modest relative to their
initial speculative incentives on date 0.
   We can prove that in this case, the constraint in (2) always holds in equilibrium. There-
fore, the equilibrium can be derived from solving an individual optimist’s problem in (1)
joint with the market clearing condition (3).

Then, an optimist’s optimal debt promise depends                               on the asset price:
                         8                                                                      h i

               F (p0 ) =     any value in 2 ; ;                                 if p0 = PM ; h i i

                         : ;                                                    if p0 2 El e ; PM :     0


By using this debt contract, the optimist obtains a credit of

                                                l             l        2          l           l                 l l

Finally, by imposing the market clearing condition (3), we obtain the equilibrium described
in the following proposition.

Proposition 2 Under the belief condition (4), the asset and credit market equilibrium is
characterized by the following four cases:

                                            2                          pM c      (1       l

                                                                                 0  d          0 d

  3. if c 2 El0 e           C ( ) ; PM          C ( ) ; then F =                      and p0 = C ( ) + c;
               h i                                                  h i
  4. if c   El0 e          C ( ) ; then F =             and p0 = El0 e :

                                                                  3
   This proposition shows that when the optimists’ initial cash endowment is low (e.g.,
cases 2, 3, and 4), they will use risky debt to borrow from pessimists to …nance their asset
positions, despite their debt being undervalued. This is because their speculative incentives
are su¢ ciently strong. In other words, they believe that the asset is more undervalued
relative to the debt they use to …nance their asset acquisition. This result is consistent with
that of Simsek (2011). It is important to note that this result builds on the three-point
distribution of the asset’s fundamental on date 2, which contrasts the two-point distribution

1.2    Non-monotonic Belief Dispersion
We now consider the situation that the belief dispersion between the optimists and pessimists
about the highest state uu is lower than their belief dispersion about the three upper states
fuu; ud; dug:
                                       h   h        h       h       h    h
                                       0   u        0   +   d       0    d
                                       l   l
                                                <   l       l       l    l
                                                                           :                 (5)
                                       0   u        0   +   d       0    d
Interestingly, under this condition, we can show that there does not exist any equilibrium in
which the optimists use risky debt to borrow from the pessimists. This is because the belief
condition in (5) implies that the belief dispersion between the optimists and pessimists about
the two middle paths (ud and du), which lead to e = , is higher than the belief dispersion
about the highest state uu, which gives e = 1: As a result, if any risky debt, say a debt
contract with face value      is o¤ered in the equilibrium at the pessimists’valuation, then this
risky debt o¤ers a strictly better investment opportunity to any optimist than the risky asset
itself. Then, some optimists will choose to withdraw from the risky asset to acquire the risky
debt, which, in turn, causes optimists’aggregate leverage and the equilibrium asset price to
fall. Due to this logic, the constraint in (2) is violated, and the only equilibrium that can
satisfy this constraint is the one with only riskless borrowing by optimists from pessimists.
We describe the equilibrium in the following proposition

Proposition 3 Under the belief condition (5), optimists only borrow riskless debt from pes-
simists and the equilibrium is characterized by three cases:
               h i               h ii             h i                                 h i
  1. if c 2 Eh0 e       2
                            ; Eh0 e ; then F = Eh0 e                    c and p0 = Eh0 e ;
               h i               h i       i
  2. if c 2 El0 e       2
                            ; Eh0 e    2
                                               ; then F =       2
                                                                    and p0 =    2
                                                                                    + c;


                                                        4
                 h i                                    h i
    3. if c   El0 e    2
                           ; then F =   2
                                            and p0 = El0 e :

    Taken together, propositions 2 and 3 demonstrate that in the static setting, the debt
…nancing used by the optimists crucially depends on the distribution of the optimists’and
pessimists’beliefs across di¤erent states. In particular, proposition 2 shows that the optimists
may choose to use risky debt …nancing despite their debt being undervalued by the creditors.


2      Dynamic Setting
In the dynamic setting, agents can trade the risky asset on the interim date— date 1— after
the two possible states, u and d, are revealed to the public. As a result, each optimist can also
make endogenous investment and leverage decisions in these two interim states. Moreover,
each optimist has the choice to use either short-term debt maturing on date 1; or long-term
debt maturing on date 2; to …nance his asset position on date 0.
    We denote the asset price on date 0 and in states u and d of date 1 by fp0 ; pu ; pd g :
We allow all debt contracts (either long-term or short-term) to be tradable on dates 0 and
1: For a long-term debt contract collateralized by one unit of asset with a promise to pay
F on date 2; we denote its market valuation on date 0 and in states u and d of date 0
by D0L (F ) ; DuL (F ) ; DsL (F ) ; where the superscript L refers to long-term debt and the
subscript refers to the relevant state. For a short-term debt contract with a promise to pay
F on the following date, we denote its market value on date 0 and in states u and d of date
0 by D0S (F ) ; DuS (F ) ; DsS (F ) . Note that a long-term debt contract that matures on date
2 becomes identical to a short-term debt contract on date 1: Thus, DsL (F ) = DsS (F ) for
s 2 fu; dg : Because of the presence of heterogeneous agents in the market, it is important
to bear in mind that the marginal investor of these debt contracts in each of the states is
determined by the equilibrium— his identity can be either optimist or pessimist and can be
di¤erent across the states.

2.1      Risk-Neutral Representation of Prices
Before deriving each agent’s optimization problem, we …rst establish a risk-neutral represen-
tation of the prices of the risky asset and debt contracts collateralized by the asset. This
representation is reminiscent of the standard no-arbitrage risk-neutral price representation in
complete markets. Due to the borrowing constraints faced by optimists, the markets in our


                                                  5
setting are incomplete even though the asset fundamental follows a binomial tree. Instead,
this representation builds on the idea that the payo¤ of a debt contract collateralized by
the asset is monotonic with respect to the asset’s value and, as a result, it shares the same
marginal investor as the asset.

2.1.1        Optimists’Marginal Value of Cash

Given the scarcity of cash to the optimists, cash allows them to earn extra rents. To illustrate
the idea, consider state d of date 1, one period before the risky asset’s liquidation value is
revealed. Suppose that the asset price is pd , which lies between the optimists’and pessimists’
                      h                 i
asset valuations: pd 2 El e ; Eh e ; where Ei denotes agent-i’s conditional expectation
                                    d    d                  d

in the state. One dollar of cash allows an optimist to acquire the asset at a discount to his
valuation. Thus, its marginal value is higher than 1: More speci…cally, he can use the cash,
levered up by using a debt contract collateralized by one unit of asset and with a promise
         2
of    (the maximum riskless promise), to acquire a position of p 1 2 units of the asset.
                                                                d
                                               d(   )
                                               h  2
This position gives an expected gross pro…t of p 2 . This expected pro…t represents his
                                                            d

marginal value of cash in state d, as formally derived in the following proposition.1
                                                                        h              i
Proposition 4 Suppose that in state d the market price of the asset pd 2 Eld e ; Ehd e .
                                                                                                           1
Then, the optimal strategy of an optimist with one dollar of cash is to acquire                       pd       2   units of
                                                                            2
the asset by using a debt contract with a promise of                            : As a result, his marginal value of
cash is                                                             2
                                                    h
                                                    d
                                             vd =               2       :                                              (6)
                                                     pd

         As the asset price pd is bounded from below by pessimists’ asset valuation Eld e                                =
 l                l   2
 d       + 1      d       ; it is direct to see that the optimist’s marginal value of cash is bounded
                           h   l
from above: vd             d = d.

    We can also establish a similar result for state u: Suppose that in state u the market price
                    h                  i
                        l e      h e
of the asset is pu 2 Eu       ; Eu       and that the marginal investor of the debt contracts
     1
    This proposition con…rms the basic intuition of Geanakoplos (2009) that in a static binomial tree model,
an optimist always prefers using the maximum riskless leverage to …nance his asset position. It is also
useful to note that if the prices of the asset and the collateralized debt contract are determined by the same
marginal investor, the optimist is indi¤erent to any promise between 2 and : This is because in this case
the cost of the risky part of the debt exactly o¤sets the expected pro…t from the asset.

in the markets is pessimists. Then, his marginal value of cash is
                                                                 h
                                                                 u (1           )
                                                   vu =                             :                                       (7)
                                                                  pu
If the beliefs of optimists and pessimists converge in this state, then the asset price has to
be equal to their asset valuations and thus the optimist’s marginal value of cash is 1, i.e.,
vu = 1.
   Determining the optimist’s marginal value of cash on date 0 is more elaborate. On one
hand, he can use the cash, levered up by collateralized debt, to acquire the asset. The
marginal value of cash depends on the optimal debt …nancing. As we will show later, the
optimal …nancing is to use the maximum riskless short-term debt, which gives the optimist
a marginal value of
                                                          h
                                                          0 vu       (pu        pd )
                                                 u0 =                                     :                                 (8)
                                                                 p0        pd
One the other hand, he can save the cash for the next date, which gives him an expected
            h                 h
value of    0 vu   + 1        0   vd . Optimizing over these two possible choices gives the optimist’s
marginal value of cash on date 0:

                                                                 h                            h
                                        v0 = max u0 ;            0 vu   + 1                   0       vd :                  (9)

2.1.2      Asset Price

Equipped with the optimists’ marginal value of cash, the following proposition uses it to
establish a risk-neutral representation of the price of the risky asset.

Proposition 5 De…ne
                                   h                                                     h
                                   s                                                     0 vu             l
                          s             2 (0; 1) , and       0        max                             ;   0   2 (0; 1) :   (10)
                                  vs                                                     v0
Then, we have

                                              pu =       u   + (1               u)        ;                                (11)
                                                                                              2
                                              pd =       d       + (1               d)            ;                        (12)
                                              p0 =       0 pu     + (1                  0 ) pd :                           (13)

   Intuitively,      0,   u,      and     d   re‡ect the equivalent belief the marginal investor uses to
value the asset. Note that the marginal investor can be either an optimist or pessimist. In

                                                                  7

2.1.3    Debt Values

Note that collateralized debt contracts are contingent claims whose value monotonically
increase with the value of the asset. Given the binomial uncertainty across each period, the
return of a debt contract re‡ects the same risk as the asset. Thus, its valuation has to be in
line with the asset, i.e., to share the same marginal investor.

Proposition 6 In state s 2 fu; dg of date 1; the market price of a collateralized debt contract
with a promise to pay F on date 2 is
                                                           h     i
                                            DsS (F ) = Es s F ^ e ;                                               (14)

where Es s denotes the expectation of an agent who believes that the tree will go up with a
probability of        s   in the following period. On date 0; the price of a short-term debt contract
with a promise to pay F on date 1 is given by

                                  D0S (F ) =    0   (F ^ pu ) + (1         0 ) (F   ^ pd ) ;

and the price of a long-term debt with a promise to pay F on date 2 is given by

                                   D0L (F ) =          S
                                                    0 Du   (F ) + (1        S
                                                                       0 ) Dd       (F ) ;

where DuS (F ) and DdS (F ) are given in (14).

     To understand this proposition, consider a risky debt contract in state d with a promise
                                                                       2
to pay F on date 2: Its payo¤ is either F ^                   or F ^       on date 2: If DdS (F ) <       d   (F ^ ) +
                      2

2.2       An Optimist’s Problem
An individual optimist faces three alternatives on date 0: He can establish an asset position
by using his initial cash endowment and short-term debt collateralized by the asset position
(we call this strategy S); or by using his initial cash endowment and collateralized long-term
debt (we call this strategy L); or he can simply save cash for establishing a position later on
date 1 (we call this strategy C). Because the optimist is risk neutral, it is without loss of
generality to focus on cornered policies for the optimist’s optimization problem.

2.2.1      Optimal Debt Financing

We …rst study the optimal …nancing decision for an optimistic buyer to establish an initial
asset position on date 0. For each dollar of cash he has, suppose that he establishes a position
of x units of the asset by using a debt contract Fe collateralized by each unit of asset (the
debt can be either long-term or short-term). Proposition 6 gives the amount of credit the
optimist can obtain by selling the debt to the marginal investor in the market:

                                D0 Fe =           0 Du      Fe + (1                0 ) Dd   Fe ;

where we omit the maturity indicator S or L on debt function D. His budget constraint
implies that
                                                                     1

      With this position, his expected value from per unit of cash is
                          h                                                                                 i

This equation re‡ects two e¤ects. One is a leverage e¤ect: by using a more aggressive debt
contract, the optimist can obtain more credit and thus establish a greater position, as shown
by the denominator of the formula. The other is a debt-cost e¤ect: a more aggressive debt
contract also implies a higher expected debt payment in the future, as shown by the term
   h       e           h         e    in the numerator.2

      Irrespective of the debt maturity, we can conveniently write the optimist’s per-asset pro…t in state s of



                                                                 9
2.2.2     Debt Maturity Choice

Given the optimist’s expected value from establishing an asset position in (16), we now
compare a pair of long-term and short-term debt contracts, which have di¤erent promises
(FL and FS ) but give the same initial credit. From the optimist’s perspective, he prefers the
one with a lower expected debt cost. For these two contracts to give the same initial credit,
we must have
                           S                    S            L                                L
                        0 Du   + (1        0 ) Dd   =     0 Du     (FL ) + (1            0 ) Dd   (FL ) ;   (17)
where, with a bit of abuse of notation, DsS (with s = u or d) denotes the value of the
short-term debt contract in state s of date 1:
    To simplify notation, we de…ne the optimist’s cash-value-adjusted probability as
                                                                   h
                                                                   0 vu

                                                                                     :                      (18)

Then, 1     bh0 =          0
                              : With these cash-value-adjusted probabilities, it is straightfor-

ward to show that the short-term debt is preferable if and only if

                           bh0 DuS + 1           bh0 DdS           bh0 DuL + 1           bh0 DdL ;          (19)

which, by taking the di¤erence with (17), is equivalent to

                               bh0     0         DuL      DdL             DuS    DdS          0:            (20)

We can directly show that the term in the second bracket is positive (i.e., the market value
of the long-term debt is more sensitive to the date-1 state than the short-term debt), and
thus establish the following proposition.

Proposition 7 Consider two debt contracts, one short-term and the other long-term, which
generate the same date-0 credit. Then, the short-term contract gives the lower expected debt
cost to an optimistic borrower if and only if

                                                        bh0         0:                                      (21)
date 1 by ps Ds Fe : Then, his date-0 expected pro…t can be computed based on his belief about the
probability of the next-period states adjusted by his marginal values of cash in these states. This argument
holds not only for short-term debt, but also for long-term debt. For illustration, consider state u with
F0L 2 2 ; . The optimist can lever up further by raising            FL from his one unit of existing asset to
purchase pu FL additional units of assets, and his total position becomes 1 + pu FL = ppuu FL . As a result, the
total value at state u is
                                  pu FL h
                                             u (1    ) = vu pu Du Fe ;
                                   pu

where we use the de…nition of vu in (7) and Du Fe = FL .


                                                              10
   This proposition shows that the optimist’s debt maturity choice depends on his cash-
value-adjusted belief relative to the creditor’s belief. The basic intuition works as follows:
re…nancing of short-term debt allows the borrower to trade a higher payment in the future
down state for a lower payment in the up state. This trade explains the insensitiveness of
short-term debt to realization of the future state, as paying more in the down state makes
the value of the short-term debt less sensitive to the state. Therefore, whether the tradeo¤
between a higher payment in the down state and a lower payment in the up state is preferable
depends on whether the borrower’s belief about the probability of the up state is higher than
the creditor’s belief. As the borrower also needs to consider his marginal value of cash in the
future states, his cash-value-adjusted probability is the relevant belief for comparison with
that of the creditor.
   Proposition 7 shows that long-term debt could dominate short-term debt in …nancing
optimists’asset positions. This result thus contradicts the standard intuition that optimists
always prefer short-term debt …nancing if they have to borrow from pessimistic creditors.

2.2.3   Cash Saving

The optimist can also choose to save cash for the next date. Interestingly, the following
proposition shows that saving capital dominates using long-term debt to …nance an asset
position if (21) is violated.

Proposition 8 Suppose that bh0 <        0.   Then, on date 0 the optimist prefers saving cash to
establishing an asset position by using long-term debt.

   When bh0 <     0,   we have
                                                     h                               h
                                                     0 vu pu                   1     0   vd pd
            p0 > bh0 pu + 1      bh0 pd =    h                 h
                                                                        +   h              h
                                                                                                      :
                                             0 vu   + 1        0   vd       0 vu   + 1     0     vd

We can interpret bh0 pu + 1        bh0 pd as the optimist’s asset holding value, after taking
into account his marginal value of cash in di¤erent states of date 1. Then, it is clear that he
should not acquire the asset given that the asset price is above his valuation. This proposition
provides an interesting result in that when long-term debt dominates short-term debt for
…nancing the optimist’s asset position, saving cash dominates over establishing the position.
This result together with Proposition 7 implies that the optimist will never strictly prefer
long-term debt in the equilibrium. He would be indi¤erent between using long-term and
short-term debt in …nancing his position only if bh0 =             0:


                                                    11
2.2.4      Leverage Choice

If bh0 >    0,   we have p0 < bh0 pu + 1     bh0 pd , i.e., the asset price is below the optimist’s asset
valuation. Then, the optimist will …nd it optimal to establish an asset position by using
short-term debt …nancing. The following proposition shows that the optimist will always
use a riskless debt contract with the maximum promise to pay pd on date 1. The proposition
also shows that he is indi¤erent between saving cash and establishing the position if bh0 =                  0.


Proposition 9 When bh0 >            0,   it is optimal for the optimist to establish an asset position
by using a short-term debt contract with a promise to pay pd on date 1. When bh0 =                     0,   the
optimist is indi¤erent between saving cash and establishing the position.

       Taken together, Propositions 7, 8, and 9 demonstrate that an individual optimist chooses
either to save cash for the next period or to acquire an asset position …nanced by using the
maximum riskless short-term debt. The only exception to this result is that when bh0 =                       0,

he can be indi¤erent between using long-term or short-term debt and between using risky
or riskless debt. This is because in this situation, the asset and any debt contract are fairly
priced from his perspective.3
       The result that short-term debt is the only form of debt …nancing in the equilibrium
is useful for several reasons. First, it explains the dominance of short-term debt usage by
…nancial institutions to …nance their asset positions. Second, it justi…es a common practice
in dynamic asset pricing models in which agents’ debt maturity choice in …nancing their
investment positions is ignored. Our model demonstrates that in a general binomial setting
it is without loss of generality to focus on short-term debt rather than long-term debt, which
can substantially complicate the equilibrium analysis.
       It is important to note that the driving force for optimists’ preference for using short-
term debt in our model is di¤erent from the argument put forth by Geanakoplos (2009). He
argues that short-term debt allows an optimist to maximize riskless leverage. In contrast, our
analysis shows that the key di¤erence between short-term and long-term debt is re…nancing,
which allows the borrower to swap debt payment from the interim down state to the interim
up state. As a result, the borrower prefers long-term debt exactly when he highly values
payo¤ in the interim down state. But, in this situation, he should just save cash to take
   3
     As he is indi¤erent between di¤erent debt contracts in this situation, we will assume that he chooses
riskless short-term debt in our later analysis of the equilibrium. We can verify that allowing the optimist to
use other contracts in this situation does not a¤ect the asset price in the equilibrium.

                                                     12
advantage of the improved investment opportunity in this state. Our result thus builds on
optimists’ability to trade the risky asset on the interim date and the resulting incentive to
save cash. In this regard, our model highlights the importance of the asset’s tradability on
the interim date in a¤ecting the optimists’…nancing decision.

2.3     A Pessimist’s Problem
As the pessimists are initially endowed with all of the asset, they are able to …nance any
asset purchase of the optimists. Due to their risk neutrality and deep pockets, their asset
valuations put lower bounds on the prices of the asset and any collateralized debt contract.
As we discussed earlier, the optimists always use riskless short-term debt to …nance their
positions. The market price of the debt contract is always the same as the pessimists’
valuation. However, the market price of the risky asset may not always re‡ect the pessimists’
valuation. On date 0; a pessimist is indi¤erent between selling or holding his asset endowment

                                    0 ; b0        , where bh0 is an optimist’s cash-value-adjusted belief on date
0 given by equation (18). Proposition 9 implies that each optimist prefers to establish an
asset position …nanced by a one-period debt contract with a promise of pd if                                                  0   < bh0 ; and is
indi¤erent between establishing a position or saving cash if                                   0   = bh0 : Thus, each optimist’s
optimization leads to the following condition:

                                                          =1       if       0    < bh0
                                                                                       :                                                    (25)
                                                          2 (0; 1) if       0    = bh0

                                                                      14
As we discussed before, each pessimist will choose to hold his asset endowment only if
         l
 0   =   0;   and thus leading to the following condition:
                                                                           l
                                            =1        if          0   >    0
                                                                          l        :                (26)
                                            2 [0; 1] if           0   =   0

Finally, the market clearing condition requires that the optimists who choose to acquire asset
positions are able to …nance their asset purchases:

                                                    p0 = c + pd ;                                   (27)

where p0 is the total market value of the               units of asset sold by the pessimists and c + pd
is the total purchasing power of the            fraction of the optimists who have an aggregate cash
of   c and are able to obtain an aggregate credit of pd by using one-period debt contract
with a promise of pd :
     Taken together, equations (23), (24), (25), (26), and (27) allow us to determine the …ve
unknowns: p0 ; pd ; pu ; ; and .

2.4.2     The Case with Non-monotonic Belief Dispersion

To illustrate the role of the secondary market trading on the equilibrium, we focus on an-
alyzing the case in which the optimists’ and pessimists’ beliefs diverge from each other in
state d of date 1: More speci…cally, we suppose that
                                                    h        h                 h       h
                                   h       l        0        0   + 1           0       d
                                   u   =   u,       l
                                                        <    l                 l       l
                                                                                         :          (28)
                                                    0        0   + 1           0       d

These conditions imply the non-monotonic belief structure we analyzed in the static setting.
The inequality condition also implies that
                                                h                h     h
                                                0       1        0     d
                                                l
                                                    <            l     l
                                                                         ;                          (29)
                                                0       1        0     d

i.e., the optimists and pessimists disagree more about the second-period asset fundamental
conditional on a negative shock in the …rst period than about the …rst-period fundamental.
The greater belief dispersion in state d implies that it is more costly for an optimist to re…-
nance his risky debt from pessimists in this state, as well as a better investment opportunity
if the asset price is determined by the pessimists.
     In the benchmark static setting, where the asset is not tradable on the interim date,
                                                                                                       2
Proposition 3 shows that the optimists will only use debt contracts with a promise of

                                                            15
to …nance their asset positions and that the equilibrium asset price p0 , if between the pes-
simists’and optimists’expected asset payo¤, is determined by the optimists’aggregate cash
                     2                       2
endowment c plus         ; i.e., p0 = c +        :
   When the optimists have the choice to trade the asset on the interim date, this option
creates incentives to save cash on date 0 to take advantage of the better investment oppor-
tunity in state d. Cash saving by some optimists boosts the asset price in state d, which,
in turn, makes it easier for other optimists to …nance their initial asset positions by collat-
eralizing their positions. This feedback mechanism further boosts the asset price on date 0:
In particular, we will show that this feedback mechanism can make the price and collateral
value of the asset in the dynamic setting higher than those in the benchmark static setting.
   We now derive the equilibrium. Given the convergence of the optimists’and pessimists’
beliefs in state u, the equilibrium in this state is simple:
                                h i      h i
                       pu = Ehu e = Elu e ; vu = 1, and                                u   =           h
                                                                                                       u   =    l
                                                                                                                u:


Furthermore, the following lemma establishes that there are always some optimists saving
cash on date 0 in the equilibrium.

Lemma 10 Under the conditions in (28), there is always a fraction of the optimists saving
cash on date 0, i.e.,      < 1:

   In analyzing the equilibrium, we focus on two key variables,                                            0   and   d.   They summarize
the asset prices on date 0 and in state d of date 0; and determine both the optimists’and
pessimists’ investment decisions. Note that since it is always optimal for the optimists to
                                  h              h
save cash on date 0, v0 =         0   + 1        0   vd , and thus
                                                                                               !
                                                                      h
                                                                      0                    l
                                      0   = max          h                h
                                                                                   ;       0       :
                                                         0   + 1          0   vd
   We describe the equilibrium in the following proposition.

Proposition 11 Under the conditions in (28), the equilibrium is characterized by the fol-
lowing …ve cases classi…ed by the level of the optimists’ aggregate cash endowment c going

                        . In this case, the optimists have su¢ cient cash to bid up the asset price
      to their expected asset payo¤ in state d of date 1:
                                                                             h i

   Cases 3 and 4 in Proposition 11 highlight the key di¤erence between the dynamic and
static settings (Proposition 3)— by saving their limited cash from date 0 to state d where the
marginal value of cash is highest, optimists can e¤ectively support the asset price in state
d, which in turn induces higher asset collateral value on date 0 and motivates pessimists to
value the asset higher.

3      Generalizing the Model to N Periods
This section extends the model to a setting with T periods. The asset’s fundamental follows a
binomial tree, i.e., given the current state it can either go up or down in the following period.
The liquidation value of the asset on the …nal date (date T ) can take T + 1 possible values,
denoted by j = 1; :::; T + 1 from low to high. On a prior date N , there are N + 1 possible
states. Like before, there are two groups of agents, with one group holding more optimistic
beliefs about the tree while the other group holds more pessimistic beliefs. Denote the group-
                                                        i            h     l
i’s (i 2 fh; lg) belief in state j of date n by         n;j   with   n;j   n;j   for 8n 2 f0; 1; :::; T     1g
and 8j 2 f1; :::; n + 1g : In addition, suppose that the optimists have limited capital while
the pessimists always have su¢ cient capital.
    We can establish the following proposition.

Proposition 12 Consider a binomial-tree setting with T periods.

    1. There exists a set of implied beliefs      n;j   2 [0; 1] of the marginal investor, which per-
       mits a risk-neutral representation of the risky asset and any debt contract collateralized
       by the asset on each node of the tree.

    2. Consider the j-th node of date n < T: Suppose that bhn;j is an optimist’s cash-value-
       adjusted belief on the node. If bhn;j >     n;j ,   then he …nds it optimal to acquire an asset
       position by …nancing the position by using the maximum riskless one-period debt; if
       bhn;j <   n;j ;   then he prefers saving cash for the next period; and if bhn;j =           n;j ,   then
       he is indi¤erent between saving cash and acquiring an asset position with any debt
       …nancing.


4      Proofs for Propositions
We formally provide proofs for all of the propositions and lemmas described above.

4.1     Proof of Lemma 1
                                            2
We …rst rule out the case of F <           : Suppose that this case holds true. Then, the debt
                                                                   e = F: As a result, the optimist
contract is risk free across all of the four possible paths, i.e., D
can obtain a credit of F and his expected debt cost is also F : Then, his expected value in


                                                   19
(1) becomes
                                           c       h                     i
                                                       Eh0 e
                                                        :        F
                                 p0 F
Now, consider increasing the debt promise by a tiny amount : The debt contract is still risk
free, and the optimist’s expected value becomes
                                    c     h                                        i
                                            Eh0 e                F                     :
                               p0 F

Since p0 < Eh0 e ; this expression is increasing with : In other words, the optimist is better-
o¤ by borrowing more. This contradicts with F being the optimal debt promise. Thus, the
                                                        2
optimal debt promise cannot be lower than                   :
     Next, suppose that F > : Since the debt promise is higher than ; the optimist always
defaults on the debt contract except at the end of the path uu. Thus, the optimist’s pro…t

Suppose that in equilibrium some optimists use a risky debt contract with a F 2                                                                                  ;

Because p0        El0 e , v0 reaches its maximum when
                                                               h i

Then, it is direct to see that v00 in (32) dominates v0 in (33). Therefore, the constraint in
(2) is always violated if there is any risky debt in equilibrium. In the absence of risky debt,
it is direct to derive the market equilibrium described in the proposition.

i.e., p0 has to be above the optimists’asset valuation derived from their marginal value of
cash in states u and d of date 1. On the other hand, the pessimists’deep pockets imply their
asset valuation as another lower bound for p0 :

                                                          l                         l

Combining these two inequalities leads to

                                                                                                         h               h
(1     0 ) pd :    Then, it must be that (34) holds strictly, i.e., v0 =                                 0 vu +    1     0   vd > u0 ; which
in turn implies that optimists prefer saving cash on date 0: Then, the marginal investor of
                                                                                                                l              l
the asset has to be pessimist. However, p0 >                           0 pu    + (1                0 ) pd       0 pu   + 1     0     pd , which
is a contradiction. Thus, (13) has to hold.

4.6      Proof of Proposition 6
Follow up with the example considered in the main text regarding the debt contract in state
                                                                                                                                            2
d with a promise to pay F on date 2: Suppose that DdS (F ) <                                             d   (F ^ ) + (1        d)    F^        .
             2
If F <           ; then the debt is riskless, and the debt price constitutes arbitrage to the marginal
                                                                   2
investor of the asset. Suppose that F 2                                ;       ; i.e., the debt is risky. If the marginal
                                                                   l
investor of the asset is pessimist (i.e.,                 d   =    d ),        then any pessimist will be able to bid up
the debt price. Thus, this cannot hold in equilibrium. If the marginal investor is optimists,
                            2
by borrowing F ^                   to purchase the debt contract, an optimist can reach a value that is
strictly above the marginal value of cash vd in state d:
                                               h                           2                h
                                               d F^           F^                            d
                                                                       2        >               = vd :
                                               DdS (F )       F^                            d

                                                                                                                         2
This is again a contradiction. Thus, DdS (F ) <                            d   (F ^ ) + (1                    d)   F^        cannot occur.
                                                                                        2
     Neither can DdS (F ) >              d   (F ^ ) + (1          d)       F^                   occur, because this valuation is too
high for anyone to pay.

4.7      Proof of Proposition 7
It is clear that for either long-term or short-term debt contracts, the credit the optimist can
obtain on date 0 monotonically increases with the promise. As the promise, increases from

                                                                  24
0 to 1; the credit increases from 0 to                        0 pu   + (1            0 ) pd ,   which is the market valuation of the
collateral. Thus, the optimist can …nd the necessary promise to obtain any credit level in
this range by using either a long-term contract or a short-term contract.
     We now prove that the market value of the long-term contract is more sensitive to the
date-1 state than the short-term contract. Suppose the long-term debt gives a promise of
F0L and short-term debt gives a promise of F0S : Then, equation (17) implies that

                                    0    DuS         DdS              DuL         DdL           = DdL     DdS :

Thus, we only need to show that DdL                             DdS         0: This inequality is equivalent to DdS F0L
F0S ^ pd     0. Suppose that it does not hold. Then, DdS F0L > F0S ^ pd . Since DdS F0L
pd , we must have pd > F0S and DdS F0L                                    > F0S . Since pu > pd > F0S ,                             0    F0S ^ pu +
(1     0)   F0S ^ pd = F0S , but the market value of long-term debt is DdS F0L +                                                            S
                                                                                                                                        0 (Du   F0L
DdS F0L ) > F0S : This contradicts the initial assumption that the long-term and short-term
contracts have the same value.

4.8     Proof of Proposition 8
The optimist’s expected value of saving one dollar is

                                                          h                          h
                                                          0 vu       + 1             0   vd :

If the optimist uses a long-term debt contract with a promise of FL to establish an asset
position, his expected value from applying (16) is

                                                                 bh0 pu           DuL + 1                bh0      pd     DdL
                             h                       h
                             0 vu   + 1              0    vd                                L                       L
                                                                            p0           0 Du       (1         0 ) Dd

                                                                 bh0 pu           DuL + 1                bh0      pd     DdL
                             h                       h
                    =        0 vu   + 1              0    vd                                                                    ;
                                                                      0   (pu        DuL ) + (1           0 ) (pd       DdL )
One can directly verify that
                                                         pu      pd         DuL          DdL ;

i.e., the di¤erence of the optimist’s equity value across the up and down state is higher than
that of the market value of the long-term debt contract. Then, we can show that

             bh0 pu         DuL + 1            bh0        pd         DdL                 0   pu    DuL + (1              0)     pd       DdL

        =     bh0       0     pu        pd      DuL             DdL             0;

                                                                          25
as bh0 <      0.    Therefore,

                                              bh0 pu      DuL + 1                    bh0       pd       DdL
             h                  h                                                                                        h              h
             0 vu   + 1         0    vd                                                                            <     0 vu   + 1     0   vd :
                                                0 (pu         DuL ) + (1              0 ) (pd       DdL )
Thus, saving capital is dominant.

4.9        Proof of Proposition 9
Suppose that bh0 >              0.   Since p0 =           0 pu    + (1              0 ) pd ,   we have

                                                       p0 < bh0 pu + 1                     bh0 pd :

Then the optimist’s expected value from using short-term debt to establish a position, e.g.
(16), is
                                     2                                                                                                      3
                                         bh0 pu + 1            bh0 pd               bh0 F0S ^ pu                   1      bh0    F0S ^ pd
      h
      0 vu   + 1            h
                            0   vd 4                                      S                                           S
                                                                                                                                            5:     (35)
                                                         p0           0 (F0 ^ pu )             (1               0 ) (F0 ^ pd )


As in the proof of Proposition 4, we can easily show that it is optimal to use F0S = pd , and
the second bracket becomes
                                     bh0 (pu pd )
                                                  > 1:
                                        p0 pd
As a result, by using a short-term debt contract with a promise of pd to purchase the asset,
the optimist obtains a value strictly higher than that from saving cash.
     The equivalence of cash saving and establishing position is trivial when bh0 =                                                         0,   as (35)
                     h                    h
collapses to         0 vu   + 1           0    vd ; which is the value from saving cash.

4.10         Proof of Lemma 10
Suppose that every optimist takes a position on date 0 by using one-period debt contract
with a promise of pd : Then, all optimists will be wiped out in state d of date 1, and thus
        h i
pd = Eld e . This price in turn implies that optimists’marginal value of cash in the state
                                                h   l
reaches its maximum: vd =                       d = d:   Then, an optimist’s cash-value-adjusted belief on date 0
is
                                                          h                                             h
                                     bh0 =      h

                                                                  h
                                                                               =      h
                                                                                                        0
                                                                                                            h      h  l
                                                                                                                          :                        (36)
                                                0   + 1           0       vd          0    + 1              0      d= d
By the inequality in (28), we can show that

which in turn is equivalent to a direct implication of the inequality in (28):

Then, equation (36) implies that bh0 <                               l
                                                                     0                0;   which in turn motivates the optimist to save
cash according to Proposition 8. This is a contradiction. Thus, at least some optimists have
to save cash on date 0 so that the asset’s price in state d won’t fall too low.

4.11     Proof of Proposition 11
We focus on cases 2 and 3.

Case 2 In this case,           d               d   and       0               0:   Thus,              = 1; and equations (25) and (27) imply
that
                                                                                      2

                                              p0 = c + pd
To determine       d,   note that

Proposition 5 implies pd =                     +       d                      ; and Proposition 4 implies that
                                                                         h                     2              h

By substituting these equations back to (37), we obtain

                        h                      h       h              h                                       h       h       2                       2

higher, which motivates optimists to save cash. Thus, in order for optimists to purchase the
asset sold by pessimists, we need
                                                                                                     h

   As c falls, the adjustment in the equilibrium is through ; the fraction of pessimists who
sell their asset endowments. The market clearing condition in state d (equation (24)) implies
that

Thus,     drops as c falls, i.e., more optimists choose to save cash on date 0. The market
clearing condition in state d (equation (27)) implies that

Thus,    also drops as c falls, i.e., more pessimists choose to hold their asset endowments.
   c needs to be above a lower bound in order for                              0:

4.12      Proof of Proposition 12
The proof follows. Suppose that the equilibrium price of the asset exists and is denoted by
pn;j . As suggested by our analysis of the two-period setting, the asset price determines the
optimists’ investment opportunities and thus marginal value of cash. The asset price also
o¤ers a benchmark to set the market value of debt issued by the optimists. First, note that
since the pessimists always have su¢ cient capital, the asset price on any state pn;j must be
bounded from below by the pessimists’expected next-period price:

                                                   l
                            pn;j        pn+1;j +   n;j     (pn+1;j+1            pn+1;j ) ;                                        (40)

with the equality binding when pessimists take asset positions and thus are the marginal
investor of the asset.
   The scarcity of optimist capital implies that the optimists can earn rent on their capital.
Let’s denote their marginal value of cash by vn;j in state j of date n: Suppose that an optimist
has one dollar in this state. He can invest it in the asset and lever up the position using
the maximum riskless one-period debt (with a promise of pn+1;j ), which gives him a position
of 1= (pn;j   pn+1;j ) shares and a per-share pro…t of pn+1;j+1                                      pn+1;j in the up state of the
                                                                                                          h
next period and 0 in the down state. Given the optimist’s belief                                          n;j   about the up state and
the marginal value of capital in the state as vn+1;j+1 , the expected value from having the
position is
                                         h
                                         n;j vn+1;j+1 (pn+1;j+1                 pn+1;;j )
                            un;j =                                                                   :                            (41)
                                                   pn;j pn+1;j
Given the price lower bound in (40),
                                                       h
                                                       n;j vn+1;j+1
                                          un;j              l
                                                                    :
                                                            n;j


                                                       29
In other words, the expected value from establishing the position is bounded by the pes-
simists’contemporaneous belief.
   Alternatively, the optimist can also choose to save his cash for the next period, which
                                                h                               h
gives him an expected value of                  n;j vn+1;j+1   + 1              n;j   vn+1;j . Thus, his marginal value of
cash in the state is

                                                         h                                  h
                         vn;j = max un;j ;               n;j vn+1;j+1       + 1             n;j     vn+1;j :

This equation implies that the optimists’marginal value of cash is a supermartingale: vn;j
E [vn+1; ] ; as they have the option to save, and that vn;j                                  un;j . The latter, together with
(41), implies that
                                                       h
                                                       n;j vn+1;j+1
                             pn;j       pn+1;j +                         (pn+1;j+1              pn+1;j ) ;                             (42)
                                                             vn;j
with the equality binding when the optimists take positions in the asset and are the marginal
investors. One of the equalities in (40) and (42) should bind in any given state. Thus, we
have
                                      pn;j = pn+1;j +         n;j   (pn+1;j+1         pn+1;j ) ;                                       (43)

where                                                    (                                  )
                                                               h
                                                               n;j vn+1;j+1           l
                                          n;j   = max                             ;   n;j       :                                      (44)
                                                                     vn;j

Note that      n;j   2 (0; 1) : This process                  n;j   , which accounts for the alternation of the
marginal investor between the optimists and pessimists, acts as a risk-neutral probability for
representing the equilibrium asset price.
   This representation of the equilibrium asset price also applies to any contingent claim
whose price is fully determined by the state of the binomial tree, such as any debt contract
collateralized by the asset. Denote its market price in state j of date n by qn;j . Then, this
price has to satisfy
                                      qn;j = qn+1;j +         n;j   (qn+1;j+1         qn+1;j ) :                                       (45)

To verify this, suppose that qn;j < qn+1;j +                 n;j   (qn+1;j+1          qn+1;j ). Then, the marginal investor
                                                   h v                                                         h v
                                                   n;j n+1;j+1          l                                      n;j n+1;j+1          l
of the asset, either an optimist (if                  vn;j
                                                                    >   n;j )   or a pessimist (if                  vn;j
                                                                                                                               <    n;j )   or
           h v
           n;j n+1;j+1       l
both (if      vn;j
                         =   n;j ),   would …nd buying this debt contract more attractive than buying
the asset. This is a contradiction. Now suppose that qn;j > qn+1;j +                                         n;j   (qn+1;j+1       qn+1;j ).
The expected return across the following period implied by this price is lower than the asset


                                                                   30
to any market participant. As a result, no one would be willing to buy this debt contract.
Again, this is a contradiction. Thus, (45) has to hold.
   Based on the representation in (43) and (45), we provide a lemma to show that monotonic-
ity of asset prices is preserved across di¤erent dates on the tree.

Lemma 13 Consider any contingent claim on the asset: If its …nal payo¤ monotonically
increases with respect to the state of the …nal date, then its price on any prior date also
monotonically increases with the state.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we consider two states j and j + 1 on date n; which is
prior to its maturity date. Then, the price of the claim in these states are

                         qn;j = qn+1;j +               n;j   (qn+1;j+1        qn+1;j ) ;
                       qn;j+1 = qn+1;j+1 +                 n;j+1    (qn+1;j+2         qn+1;j+1 ) :

Then,

         qn;j+1     qn;j = 1           n;j    (qn+1;j+1       qn+1;j ) +      n;j+1   (qn+1;j+2      qn+1;j+1 ) .

Thus, if qn+1;j+2      qn+1;j+1              qn+1;j , then qn;j+1           qn;j . Using this property, backward
induction on the tree implies that the monotonicity is preserved across any date.

   This lemma directly implies the price of the asset pn;j and the market value of any long-
term debt contract Dn;j collateralized by one share of the asset monotonically increase with
the state on the tree. Furthermore, note that on the maturity date of the debt contract, the
di¤erence before the asset price and the debt payo¤ also monotonically increases with the
state. Thus, this lemma implies that across any two adjacent states j and j + 1 on any date
n prior to the debt maturity, pn;j+1              Dn;j+1          pn;j   Dn;j , which, in turn, implies that

                                       pn;j+1       pn;j       Dn;j+1        Dn;j :                                 (46)

This inequality suggests that the asset price is more sensitive to the state than price of any
debt contract collateralized by the asset.
   We are ready to show that in any state on the tree, an individual optimist …nds it
optimal to either acquire an asset position by using the maximum riskless one-period debt
or to simply save cash for a future period. Consider state j of date n: De…ne the optimist’s
cash-value-adjusted belief by

                                               n;j vn+1;j+1   + 1           n;j   vn+1;j

   Suppose that bhn;j             l
                                  n;j .   Then, optimists are the marginal investors of the asset. We can
verify that for an optimist, …nancing an asset position by using the maximum riskless short-
term debt dominates over using any long-term debt contract. Let’s compare the …nancing of
a one-period debt contract with a promise of F S on date n + 1 and another long-term debt
contract with a promise of F L on date N > n+1: Denote the price of the short-term contract
    S                                               L
by Dn;j and the price of the long-term contract by Dn;j . As both contracts, if issued, have
to be purchased by the pessimists, to generate the same credit requires

                      S                                   S                   L                            L

The short-term debt being less costly to the optimist is equivalent to

            bhn;j Dn+1;j+1

By taking the di¤erence between (48) and (47), (48) is equivalent to

   Note that the short-term debt contract matures on n + 1 and its payo¤s are

                              S
                             Dn+1;j+1 = F S , and Dn+1;j

which contradicts (47). Thus, (49) holds and the short-term contract dominates the long-
term contract.
   Now suppose that bhn;j <                    n;j .   We can show that saving cash dominates over using any
long-term debt to …nance an asset position. Saving cash gives an expected value of
