                                         ABSTRACT

Investments in energy efficiency entail uncertainty, and when faced with uncertainty consumers
have been shown to behave according to prospect theory: preferences are reference-dependent
and exhibit loss aversion, and probabilities are subjectively weighted. Using data from a choice
experiment eliciting prospect theory parameters, I provide evidence that loss-averse people are
less likely to invest in energy efficiency. Then, I consider policy design under prospect theory
when there are also externalities from energy use. A higher degree of loss aversion implies a
higher subsidy to energy efficiency. Numerical simulations suggest that the impact of prospect
theory on policy may be substantial.

I. Introduction
        Evidence suggests that when making choices involving risk or uncertainty, people deviate from
the predictions of expected utility theory. In particular, their preferences may be reference-dependent:
outcomes are evaluated based on gains or losses relative to a reference point rather than on absolute
consumption levels. Gains and losses may be treated asymmetrically, with losses counting relatively
more than equivalent gains. The subjective probabilities assigned to outcomes may be systematically
biased from the objective probabilities, and low-probability events may be over-weighted. Prospect
theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) explains these observed behaviors.
        The choice over energy efficiency investments, like buying an energy-efficient car or appliance,
involves risk. There is a fixed upfront cost and the promise of energy savings, though the amount of
those savings is unknown. Greene (2011) argues that loss aversion can explain the "energy paradox" or
"energy efficiency gap," where individuals appear to neglect ostensibly cost-effective efficiency
investments (Allcott and Greenstone 2012, Gillingham and Palmer 2014).1 While prospect theory has
been shown to predict behavior across various domains,2 it has never explicitly been shown to predict
behavior related to energy efficiency. Little is known about whether consumers' choices over energy
efficiency are explained by prospect theory, nor about how policy can be designed if this is the case.
        The purpose of this paper is to test whether prospect theory explains consumers' investments in
energy efficiency and to see what the implications are for optimal policy design. I conduct a survey that
uses a choice experiment to elicit individual-level prospect theory preference parameters, including the
extent of loss aversion and probability weighting. I test whether those parameters are correlated with
energy-efficiency investments, like owning an alternative-fuel vehicle or Energy Star appliance. Then, I
provide a model of optimal policy, in which there are externalities associated with energy use (e.g.,
greenhouse gas emissions) and behavioral market failures associated with prospect theory. The model
demonstrates how optimal policy depends on the degree of deviation from expected utility theory.
        This paper contributes to two literatures. First, there is an empirical literature documenting,
often using randomized control trials, that consumers’ energy consumption decisions appear to be
motivated by social norms. Allcott and Rogers (2012) find that information provision affects energy
usage: consumers who learn that their consumption levels are higher than average reduce their use, but
this effect decays over time. A similar effect is found in Ayres et al. (2013), who find that both electricity

decisions by individuals.

and natural gas consumption are reduced after information provision, and the reduction lasts at least 7
to 12 months. Costa and Kahn (2013) observe significantly different treatment responses based on the
individual’s political ideology: the effect is two to four times larger for liberals than it is for
conservatives. In the context of water consumption, Ferraro and Price (2013) find that information on
social comparisons are more effective than technical information or savings-encouragement messages.3
These papers do not explicitly reference prospect theory in making their empirical findings, but the
finding are consistent with prospect theory if the information provision changes consumers’ reference
points, and consumers are averse to losses (higher energy bills) relative to those new reference points.
Furthermore, most such studies do not find evidence of a “boomerang effect” from social norm-based
information provision, where those who are at below-average consumption levels increase consumption
after the treatment. 4 This asymmetry is consistent with loss aversion as predicted by prospect theory.
To date no study has explicitly tested whether or not prospect theory can explain energy efficiency
investments. The empirical evidence provided in this paper tests for such a link.
         The second literature that this paper contributes to is a theoretical literature that conducts
welfare analysis and studies optimal policy in an economy where consumers behave according to
prospect theory. Prospect theory is a positive theory describing how individuals make choices under
uncertainty. However, it raises normative questions, given that welfare analysis is not well-defined if
consumers deviate from neo-classical expected-utility-maximizing behavior. More broadly, other
aspects of behavioral economics raise the same set of questions.5 More specifically, in the domain of
energy and environmental policy, Heutel (2015) considers optimal policy for durable goods with
externalities when consumers have quasi-hyperbolic preferences, Allcott et al. (2014) considers policy
when consumers undervalue future energy costs, and Tsvetanov and Segerson (2013) consider
environmental policy when consumers exhibit temptation and self-control issues.
         Under prospect theory, the following general welfare question arises: what should a social
planner maximize, given that consumers' preferences are characterized by loss aversion and reference-
dependence? A follow-up question is: how does this maximization criterion affect optimal policy?
Surprisingly, very few papers have attempted to answer these important normative questions. Kanbur
et al. (2006) survey the literature on "non-welfarist" taxation, defined as the government having an

reduce towel use than are appeals based on the environment.

  Bernheim and Rangel (2009) design a theoretical framework for using revealed preferences to conduct welfare
analysis under non-neoclassical models (but they do not consider the application to prospect theory).

objective function different than individuals'. Kanbur et al. (2008) consider optimal income taxation
when consumers exhibit prospect theory, and they consider non-welfarist, or “paternalistic”, social
welfare functions. They find that an optimal tax schedule can be discontinuous, owing to the kink in the
prospect theory value function at the reference point. Jantti et al. (2014) consider optimal policy with a
social welfare function that exhibits loss aversion. They examine how inequality measures may differ
depending on whether preferences are reference-dependent. Dhami and Al-Nowaihi (2010) consider
various social welfare functions when individuals exhibit prospect theory; all of their social welfare
functions are based on maximizing expected utility, in contrast to individuals’ preferences. All of these
approaches can be seen as controversial, since the planner departs from using revealed preference to
guide policy. As Madrian (2014) ends her review on behavioral economics and policy: “This [assessing
the social optimality of behaviorally-informed interventions] of course requires taking a stand on what is
socially optimal, a task that admittedly is easier said than done.”6
         The theory section in this paper considers optimal policy specifically in the context of energy
consumption decisions when consumers behave according to prospect theory. In these markets, there
already exists a market failure from the externalities associated with energy use. Under prospect
theory, there is potentially a second market failure – a “behavioral” failure – if prospect theory implies
that consumers are acting sub-optimally in a welfare-relevant sense.7 This is the first paper that
considers optimal policy in such an economy.8
         This paper presents two sets of results: one empirical and one theoretical. Empirically, I find
evidence that prospect theory explains people's investments (or lack thereof) in energy efficiency. I find
a negative correlation between an individual's level of loss aversion and several energy efficiency
investments, including owning or leasing an alternative fuel vehicle and having a high fraction of energy-
efficient light bulbs. Though almost all of the relationships are of the predicted sign, the statistical

  Additionally, Guthrie (2002) considers how prospect theory has been used in the law literature and in legal cases.
Jolls et al. (1998) more broadly considers behavioral economics and the law. Farhi and Gabaix (2015) consider
optimal tax policy in the presence of general forms of behavioral failures, though they do not explicitly model loss
aversion. Apesteguia and Ballester (2015) consider the welfare implications of deviations from preference
maximization.

  This is analogous to the dual market failures from both externalities and “internalities” modeled in Allcott et al.
(2014) and Heutel (2015).

  Bhattacharjee et al. (1993) considers how prospect theory may affect consumer energy purchases, and Costanzo
et al. (1986) offers recommendations for energy conservation based on psychology and prospect theory, but
neither provides a theoretical basis by which to conduct welfare analysis. Asgary and Levy (2009) discuss how
prospect theory affects policy over natural hazards and disaster planning. Knetsch (1990) considers the
implications of the WTP/WTA disparity on environmental policy. See also Botzen and van den Bergh (2014) for a
review of several alternatives to expected utility, including prospect theory, and their implications for climate
policy.

significance is modest; out of ten estimated coefficients in the main specification, three are significantly
negative at the 10% level and three more are significantly negative at the 20% level. The results are not
driven by time preferences, and they are robust to an alternate, non-parametric measure of loss
aversion. A one-standard-deviation increase in loss aversion is associated with a 1.5-percentage-point
increase in the probability of owning an alternative fuel vehicle.
         Theoretically, I show that the standard Pigouvian prescription to price the externality at
expected external costs (or benefits) is modified in the presence of prospect theory in two ways: first,
based on the ratio of the true probability of achieving a cost savings and its misperceived subjective
probability; and second, based on the ratio of marginal (true) utility to the derivative of the value
function. Both the analytical results and numerical simulations show that a higher degree of loss
aversion implies a higher subsidy to energy efficiency. Simulation results suggest that the behavioral
market failure from prospect theory can be quite large, relative to the market failure from the
externality.
         The next section provides a model of energy efficiency demand under prospect theory that
generates testable hypotheses; those hypotheses are tested in section III. Section IV provides the
theoretical model of optimal policy; and section V concludes.


II. A Model of Prospect Theory and Energy Efficiency Demand
         The following simple model explores how loss aversion affects investment in energy efficiency
and generates testable hypotheses. The consumer decides how much energy-efficiency 𝑒 to purchase
(e.g., 𝑒 can measure the level of energy-efficiency of an air-conditioner or the fuel economy of a car).9 A
level of 𝑒 comes with a certain cost 𝑐(𝑒) and an uncertain benefit in fuel savings 𝑏(𝑒; 𝜃), where 𝜃 is a
random variable that is realized only after 𝑒 is purchased. The risk or uncertainty in energy efficiency
investments has been documented and can be substantial. Mills et al. (2006) identify 10 "zones" of risk
associated with energy efficiency investments, including economic factors like fuel costs and
technological factors like equipment performance (see their Table 1). They also describe various
methods of quantifying these risks. Jackson (2010) describes how energy efficiency investments can be
managed using risk management decision tools from the financial industry.




9
 Though the focus is energy efficiency, this or a similar model could be applied to other types of decisions, for
example investments in health or health behaviors (Winter and Parker 2007).
                                                                6


           To simplify the risk and relate it to a choice over a binary lottery (as is common in prospect
theory), suppose there is a probability 𝑝 that the fuel savings 𝑏(𝑒) will be realized and 1 − 𝑝 that fuel
savings will be zero.
           Expected utility theory predicts that the consumer will choose 𝑒 to maximize
                                  (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)),
where 𝑤 is an endowment of consumer wealth and 𝑈 is a utility function. However, prospect theory
predicts that the consumer will consider the gains and the losses from the risky investment
asymmetrically, and choose 𝑒 to maximize:
                                   (𝜋(1 − 𝑝))𝑣(−𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)).
The value function 𝑣 is characterized by loss aversion. The probability weighting function is 𝜋, and here
is assumed to be symmetric over gains and losses.
           To conduct comparative statics, I assume functional forms (though later in the paper when
solving for optimal policy these assumptions will not be used).10 Assume that 𝑣(𝑥) = 𝑥 𝜎 for gains 𝑥 > 0
and 𝑣(𝑥) = −𝜆(−𝑥)𝜎 for losses 𝑥 < 0. A 𝜆 > 1 represents loss aversion (a steeper slope of the value
function for losses than for gains). Also assume that the probability weighting function takes the form
                                                     1      𝛼
specified in Prelec (1998): 𝜋(𝑝) = 1/ exp [ln (𝑝)] . The parameter 𝛼 represents how the probability

weighting function differs from the actual probabilities. When 𝛼 = 1, it is linear, but prospect theory
predicts that 𝛼 < 1, so that individuals overweight small probabilities.
           The first-order condition for the choice of 𝑒 is
                                     𝜎−1                                                  𝜎−1
             (𝜋(1 − 𝑝)) (𝜆𝜎(𝑐(𝑒))          ) (−𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝜎(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))                    (𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) = 0.

Comparative statics can be performed on this first-order condition to determine how the parameters of
                                                                                             𝜕𝑒
prospect theory affect behavior; details are in Appendix A. In particular, 𝜕𝜆 < 0; that is, a higher degree

of loss aversion leads to a lower level of energy efficiency investment. The intuition is that energy

     In fact, some initial comparative statics can be conducted without relying on functional form assumptions. The
                                                                                                       ′

first-order condition of the consumer's problem can be rearranged as:                    −1=           ′      , where 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 is the
                                                                               𝑐 ′ (𝑒)            𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛
                                                                         ′
derivative of the value function under the loss state, and likewise for 𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 . The left-hand side of this equation is
independent of any subjective characteristics of the consumer. The right-hand side demonstrates the relationship
                                                                                                                ′

between probability weighting, given by the ratio           , and loss aversion, given by the ratio             ′      . For example,

                                                                                      ′

consider two individuals. One has a higher degree of loss aversion (higher           ′      ) while the other has a higher
                                                                                    𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛

degree of underweighting the gain probability (lower                ); in this case the two individuals may choose the same

amount of 𝑒 if these two differences perfectly offset each other.

efficiency is a risky investment with a certain loss (𝑐(𝑒)) and a risky gain (𝑏(𝑒)). The more loss-averse
                                                                                             𝜕𝑒
one is, the less she is willing to invest in that risky prospect. However, the sign of 𝜕𝛼 is ambiguous and

depends on the probability 𝑝 of achieving the energy savings. The appendix shows that if 𝑝 is small
                     1         𝑑𝑒
(specifically, if 𝑝 < 𝑒), then 𝑑𝛼 < 0. That is, suppose there is a small probability of achieving the gain. As

𝛼 gets smaller than one, the consumer overweights this small probability of the good outcome. The
smaller that 𝛼 is, the more that the consumer overweights the probability of achieving the gain, and
                                                                    𝑑𝑒
therefore the more that she invests in energy efficiency (so 𝑑𝛼 < 0). By contrast, if the probability of
                                                  𝑑𝑒
not achieving the gain, 1 − 𝑝, is small, then 𝑑𝛼 > 0: the higher that 𝛼 is, the more the consumer

overweights the (small) probability of losing on the investment, and therefore the more the consumer
invests in energy efficiency. Thus, the effect depends on whether or not the energy efficiency
investment is likely or unlikely to pay off.11


III. Empirical Evidence
         This simple theory yields testable predictions that are examined using data from a choice
experiment collected in an online survey. Consumers with higher levels of loss aversion should invest
less in energy efficiency. For instance, they will be less likely to install energy-efficient light bulbs like
compact fluorescents or LEDs, or to replace an air-conditioning unit with an Energy-Star model. To my
knowledge, no study has theoretically derived the implications of prospect theory for these classes of
behaviors, and no study has empirically tested for correlations between loss aversion and these
behaviors.12


III.A. Strategy
         The three parameters 𝜎, 𝜆 and 𝛼 can be identified by observing a respondent's decisions over a
series of lotteries. Following Tanaka et al. (2010), respondents are asked for preferences over pairwise
lotteries, in which the expected payoff difference between the pairs of lotteries changes.13 Table 1 lists


11
   This result is consistent with a result from the theoretical model in Greene (2011), where it is shown that loss-
averse consumers have a lower valuation of energy efficiency or of fuel economy than do non-loss-averse
consumers. That model, however, focuses on the decision by manufacturers over the technological content of
goods, rather than the decision by consumers over those goods.

   "Research demonstrating or contradicting the existence of loss aversion in consumers' decisions about the
energy efficiency of energy-using durables is generally lacking." Greene, 2011, p. 616.
13
   An alternative strategy for eliciting prospect theory parameters is in Abdellaoui et al. (2008). See their
discussion (p. 246) of various elicitation strategies. Also see Callen et al. (2014).

the lotteries over which subjects are asked to decide. In one series of lottery pairs, one lottery offers a
small probability of a large payout (Series 1). In another series, one lottery offers a high probability of a
medium-sized payout (Series 2). In the final series, lottery payouts can be either positive or negative
(Series 3). Comparing the switching points between series 1 and series 2 provides a range of values for 𝜎
and 𝛼.14 For instance, a respondent who switches in series 1 at question 9 and who switches at series 2
at question 5 makes decisions that are incompatible with expected utility theory and a power utility
function (𝑢(𝑥) = 𝑥 𝜎 ). Each pair of switching points in series 1 and 2 pins down a range of values for 𝜎
and 𝛼. Comparing these estimated values with the switching point for series 3 provides a range of
values for 𝜆.
         Tanaka et. al. (2010), in their sample of Vietnamese, find a mean value for (𝜎, 𝛼, 𝜆) of (0.59,
0.74, 2.63), supporting prospect theory (loss aversion and inverted-S shaped probability weighting).
Rieger et. al. (2011) survey respondents from 45 different countries and find support for prospect theory
around the globe (their parameterization differs slightly from that of Prelec (1998)). While these studies
identify prospect theory among participants, they do not attempt to estimate to what extent prospect
theory can explain consumer behaviors.
         In this survey, I test for correlations between the prospect theory parameters (𝜎, 𝛼, 𝜆) and the
energy consumption variables. Controlling for demographic characteristics, I examine whether
consumers who exhibit more loss aversion (higher 𝜆) are more or less likely to make energy-efficiency
investments. Similarly, I examine whether consumers with a probability weighting that is farther from
linear (lower 𝛼) are more or less likely to make energy-efficiency investments. In particular I examine
energy outcomes that have been predicted to be caused by prospect theory, including purchases of
energy-efficient appliances (Mayer 1995).


III.B. Survey and Data Description
         I conduct an online survey of 2,045 individuals, representative of the adult US population.15 The
sample was provided by the firm Qualtrics Panels, which uses quota sampling to arrive at a
representative sample based on characteristics of the population. The lottery questions described in
Table 1 were asked of all participants to measure loss aversion. Respondents are paid a flat fee from


14
   As in Tanaka et al. (2010), respondents are forced to choose a single switching point for each of the three series,
rather than choosing independently for each of the 35 lottery pairs.

   A representative sample may not be most preferable. Alternatively, a survey could focus solely on individuals
who are considering buying a new appliance or car, for example (Andersen et al. 2010). Later in this paper, I
discuss results that restrict the sample to homeowners.

Qualtrics Panels for participating. Additionally, some respondents are paid based on their responses to
the lottery questions in Table 1. Just 50% of respondents are chosen at random to be paid out, and of
those paid out, just one of the lottery questions is randomly selected to be the payout question.16 This
method is used in previous papers that elicit prospect theory parameters using lotteries (Abdellaoui et
al. 2006, Tanaka et al. 2010). Some evidence suggests that paying out based on just a random subset of
lottery questions gives similar results as paying out on all of them (Starmer and Sugden 1991, Cubitt et
al. 1999), though there is also theoretical (Holt 1986) and empirical (Harrison and Swarthout 2014, Cox
et al. 2015) reason for being cautious.
         Respondents were also questioned about their energy consumption. A series of questions were
asked, predominantly drawn from the US Energy Information Administration's 2015 Residential Energy
Consumption Survey.17 Table 2 presents summary statistics of the energy-related questions. 54% of
respondents are homeowners rather than renters. 54% of respondents have a high fraction (greater
than 50%) of lights in their home that are energy-efficient (compact fluorescent or LED), and 73% of
respondents have installed energy-efficient lightbulbs themselves. About one-fifth of respondents
report having had a home energy audit performed in their home,18 and of those about 78% have made
some of the changes suggested by the audit. 82% have air-conditioning in their house, and of those,
48% have an AC unit that is certified energy-efficient by the Energy Star program, and 31% have
replaced the central AC in their home since they moved in. Just about 13% of respondents report
owning or leasing an alternative fuel vehicle.19 Last, a series of questions are asked about the Energy
Star certification of various appliances, and the percentage of respondents who report owning an
Energy Star certified appliance range from 29% for freezers to 67% for lightbulbs.
         I also ask respondents several demographic questions, which are summarized in Appendix Table
A1. Each demographic variable is an indicator except for age and income. I control for all of these
variables (plus the square of income) in the regressions below.




16
   The payout question is only chosen among the first two series of lotteries shown in Table 1, since the third series
involves losses and was infeasible to administer. The last lottery series is thus hypothetical. The mean payout
conditional on being chosen to receive a payout was $9.28 (median = $6.00).
17
   That survey is available here: http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/. Some of these questions were also
used in the survey in Bradford et al. (2014).
18
   This is higher than other reported values of the percentage of Americans each year that have energy audits on
their homes (see, for example, Palmer et al., p. 272-273). The question in this survey asks "Has your home had an
energy audit?", not specifically in the current year.

   Defined in the survey as either a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), a gas-electric hybrid, or an E85 or "flex-fuel"
vehicle.

         Two additional sets of questions are asked for robustness checks. First, I elicit time preferences
to test whether controlling for time preferences affects the results. Bradford et al. (2014) provide some
evidence that time preferences, including discount factors from a 𝛽𝛿 specification of preferences, are
correlated with some energy consumption outcomes. I measure time preferences using the multiple
price list strategy as in Meier and Sprenger (2010) and Bradford et al. (2014). Individuals are asked to
make a series of choices over smaller, sooner payments and larger, later payments (e.g., choosing
between $29 today and $30 in one month). From these choices, I calculate each individual's long-run
discount factor 𝛿 and present bias 𝛽.20
         Second, I ask each respondent a set of hypothetical choices about purchasing home water
heaters with varying degrees of energy efficiency. Choices over water heaters were used based on
Newell and Siikamäki (2015), who ask similar hypothetical questions over water heaters to elicit time
preferences. The questions are designed so as to identify individuals who exhibit evidence of loss
aversion. Respondents are asked to hypothetically consider buying a new water heater for their home.
One question asks them to decide between keeping their current water heater, which has a 30 gallon
tank and annual energy costs of $250 per year, and replacing it at no cost with a new water heater,
which has a 60 gallon tank and annual energy costs of $300. Another question asks the same choice
about keeping versus replacing, but the both of the characteristics of the current and new heater
switched around.21 Respondents who choose to keep the current heater for both questions
demonstrate loss aversion; 19% of respondents do so.


III.C. Results
         Table 3 presents summary statistics for the calculated values of the prospect theory parameters.
The calculated mean value of 𝜎 is close to though slightly higher than the mean value found in Tanaka et
al. (2010) among Vietnamese villagers, and the mean value of 𝛼 is in fact identical to their mean value.
They find 𝜎 = .59 and 𝛼 = .74 for those in the North and 𝜎 = .63 and 𝛼 = .74 for those in the South; I
find 𝜎 = 0.81 and 𝛼 = 0.74. Liu (2008) for Chinese farmers found slightly lower mean values of (𝜎, 𝛼) =
(. 48, .69). My mean 𝜆 of 3.51 is nearly identical to that found in Liu (2008) (3.47) but somewhat higher


20
   I ask the same three blocks of questions as in Bradford et al. (2014), Table 1. 𝛿 is calculated from the response to
the "blue" block (5 months vs. 6 months), and 𝛽 is calculated by comparing responses to the "red" (today vs. 1
month) and "blue" blocks. As with the lottery responses, consumers are restricted to choosing a single switching
point from each block of questions. Each switching point yields a range of possible discount factor values, and I
assign the median value within the range.
21
   In between these two questions, there are two additional distractor questions that change the tank capacity and
energy costs.

than that found in Tanaka et al. (2010) (2.63) or Tversky and Kahneman (1992) (2.25), though my
median value (1.61) is closer.22
        I regress selected energy outcome variables, taken from the energy consumption variables in
Table 2 described earlier, on these prospect theory parameters, controlling for the demographic
characteristics presented in Appendix Table A1. Table 4 shows the results. Each of the ten columns in
Table 4 presents the results from one regression, where the outcome variable is an indicator for one of
the energy efficiency questions described in Table 2. The exception is column 10 in Table 4, which
combines all of the questions about Energy Star appliances into a single outcome that equals 1 if the
respondent answered yes to having any of the listed Energy Star appliances. In all regressions, the three
loss aversion parameters 𝜎, 𝛼, and 𝜆 are included on the right-hand side, and their coefficients and
standard errors are reported.23 All of the demographic variables listed in Appendix Table A1 (plus
income squared) are also controlled for though not reported.
        The results support the prediction from the model about how loss aversion affects investments
in energy efficiency, although for many outcomes the results are not statistically significant. The
coefficients on the loss aversion parameter 𝜆 are negative as predicted in seven of the ten regressions.
In two others they are zero to the third decimal point, and in just one it is positive but insignificant. Of
the seven negative coefficients on 𝜆, three are statistically significant at the 10% level, and three others
are statistically significant at the 20% level. A higher level of loss aversion (higher value of 𝜆) is
significantly (at the 10% level) negatively correlated with having a high fraction of efficient light bulbs,
replacing one's air-conditioner, and owning an alternative fuel vehicle. The magnitudes of the
coefficients indicate that the relationship is modest. The standard deviation of 𝜆 is 3.867, so a one-
standard-deviation increase in 𝜆 is associated with a 2.3 percentage-point increase in the probability of
having a high fraction of efficient lights and a same 2.3 percentage-point increase in the probability of
having replaced air conditioning. Compare those percentage correlations with the sample mean of


22
   These values are directly calculated for each individual based on his or her switching points among the three
series of lotteries as described in Tanaka et al. (2010). They are not estimated using maximum likelihood methods,
for example as in Harbaugh et al. (2002). See Harrison and Rutström (2008, Section 2) for a discussion of alternate
estimation methods, and in particular p. 59-61 on the method used in Tanaka et al. (2010). For respondents who
do not switch (which is about 50% of respondents for each series of lotteries), the values at the boundaries are
used, as in Tanaka et al. (2010).
23
   The purpose of this study is to estimate the relationship between prospect theory parameters and energy
efficiency investments, though several other studies examine other determinants of energy efficiency investments.
For example, Nair et al. (2010) find that personal attributes affect home energy investments, Carlsson-Kanyama et
al. (2005) find that home age affects home energy investments, Darby (2006) finds that "energy-conscious" people
are more likely to make efficiency investments, and Diamond (2009) and Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011) study
the effect of government incentives on hybrid-electric vehicle purchases.

those indicator outcomes of 54% and 31%, respectively. A one-standard-deviation increase in 𝜆 is
associated with a 1.5 percentage-point increase in the probability of owning an alternative fuel vehicle,
compared to the sample mean of that outcome variable of just 12.6%. The coefficients on 𝜆 thus
                                            𝑑𝑒
conform to the model's prediction that           < 0.24
                                            𝑑𝜆

         A caveat of this analysis is that some of these significant results may arise due to chance, since I
am examining ten different outcome variables. It is unlikely that all of the results are merely due to
chance, since three out of ten are significant at the 10% level and an additional three at the 20% level. I
have not adjusted the standard errors or p-values using any of the conventional methods for multiple
hypothesis testing, since with a large number of hypotheses these methods are very conservative,
controlling the Type I error rate at the cost of substantially increasing the Type II error rate (Romano et
al. 2008).25 Alternative adjustment methods are less conservative, and some of the significant
coefficients remain significant after adjusting p-values using these techniques.26
         There is no consistent relationship across columns between the probability weighting parameter
                                                                                   𝑑𝑒
𝛼 and the energy outcomes. The theory was ambiguous about the sign of 𝑑𝛼. For an energy investment

with a high probability of paying off, this sign is predicted to be positive. It is conceivable that this
pattern of coefficients is consistent with the fact that some of these energy efficiency investments (e.g.
replacing air conditioning, having efficient light bulbs) are more likely to pay off and some (e.g. a home
energy audit) are less likely to, though this is speculative.
         The results in Table 4 are from regressions that include all respondents with non-missing values.
Alternatively, I run the regressions with just those respondents who are homeowners (Appendix Table
A2), motivated by the differing incentives for renters vs. owners (Davis 2011, Gillingham et al. 2012).
Also, I consider just the homeowners who have lived in their current homes for at least three years
(Appendix Table A3), to account for the fact that for people who have lived in their current homes for


24
   The outcome variable from the regression reported in column 5 is having ever conducted a home energy audit.
This outcome is somewhat different than the other outcomes, since it is not directly an energy efficiency
investment, but rather it is an expense undertaken to get information about the types of energy efficiency
investments that could be made and their expected returns. There is very limited prior research investigating the
determinants of choosing to conduct a home energy audits. Two early studies, Tonn and Berry (1986) and
Laquatra and Chi (1989), find that attitudes towards energy conservation affect take-up.
25
   For example, applying the Bonferroni correction means multiplying each p-value by 10, in which case none of the
coefficients on 𝜆 are significant at the 10% level. The Holm-Bonferroni method adjustment is similarly
conservative.
26
   Using the generalized Bonferroni method described in Lehmann and Romano (2005, Theorem 2.1) to control the
k-FWE (familywise error rate), the coefficient on 𝜆 is significant at the 10% level in the regression for alternative
fuel vehicle when 𝑘 = 5.
                                                       13


less time, many of these durable good purchases were likely made by the previous resident. These
alternative specifications yield qualitatively similar results but with slightly higher standard errors due to
the smaller sample size.
        One potential confounding factor is time preference. Previous studies (Bradford et al. 2014,
Newell and Siikamäki 2015) have linked discount factors to energy efficiency investments. Therefore, I
re-run the regressions when also controlling for the two individual-level discount factors 𝛽 and 𝛿,
calculated based on the methodology described earlier. These results, shown in Table 5, reinforce the
findings from Table 4. The coefficients on 𝜆 are nearly identical to the coefficients in Table 4, where
discount factors are not controlled for. Surprisingly, the coefficients on the discount factors are
generally insignificant and the signs are not consistent.27
        An alternative test avoids imposing parameterization or functional forms to calculate an
individual's loss aversion parameter or other prospect theory parameters. Instead, the outcomes are
regressed on a variable that represents the "switching point" among the loss aversion questions, that is,
the point at which the respondent switches from option A to option B in series 3 of the lottery questions
(see Table 1). These questions are constructed so that a later switching point indicates a more loss-
averse individual (though the value of 𝜆 depends also on the switching points in series 1 and 2).
        Table 6 presents these non-parametric regression results, where the dependent variable of
interest is the switching point from series 3. This takes a value between 1 (for an individual who always
chooses lottery A, the least loss-averse) and 8 (for an individual who always chooses lottery B, the most
loss-averse). Regressions also control for the same demographic variables as the regressions in Table 4.
These results support the parametric regressions in Table 4: the negative coefficients indicate that more
loss-averse individuals are more likely to make energy efficiency investments. This relationship is
statistically significant at the 5% level for owning an alternative fuel vehicle and for making
recommended changes after a home energy audit. Two of the coefficients that were statistically
significant in the parametric regressions in Table 4, on having a high fraction of efficient lights and
replacing one's air conditioner, are still negative here but no longer significant at the 10% level (p-values
are .20 and .11, respectively).
        One concern is that the evidence of loss aversion is actually evidence of "noisiness" or
inattention. There is an attention filter question in the survey, asking respondents to select "C" to make


27
  The distribution of and variation in my estimates of time preference parameters 𝛽 and 𝛿 are consistent with
those reported in previous papers that have estimated them. For example, the mean value of 𝛿 here is 0.791,
compared to 0.864 in Bradford et al. (2014) and 0.75 in Courtemanche et al. (2015).
                                                       14


sure they are paying attention, and any respondent that fails to do so is dropped entirely from all of the
reported analysis. In addition to this attention filter, I can also test for the effect of inattention by
exploiting the responses to the set of time preference questions described earlier. Some people's
responses show evidence of a contradiction that could reflect inattention to the survey.28 Controlling
for inattention in this way, either by including an indicator variable for those respondents who
demonstrate this contradiction (Appendix Table A4) or by excluding them altogether from the
regressions (Appendix Table A5), yields results that are qualitatively similar to the main specification.
        Finally, I consider the alternate measure of loss aversion that is based on responses to the
hypothetical questions about replacing home water heaters. These responses provide a binary
classification of respondents as either loss-averse (if they chose to keep their current water heater in
both cases) or not loss-averse (any other combination of choices). This binary outcome shows no
relationship with the parametric calculation of 𝜆 based on the lottery questions; in a regression where
the outcome is the binary water loss aversion indicator from the water heater questions, controlling for
the three parametric prospect theory parameters and demographics, the p-value on the coefficient on 𝜆
is .854. Furthermore, when regressing the various energy efficiency outcomes on this binary loss
aversion indicator (Appendix Table A6), there is no consistent relationship between it and the outcomes.
The coefficient is significantly negative at the 1% level when the outcome is making changes
recommended by an energy audit, reinforcing the result from Table 6. However, the coefficient is
significantly positive when the outcome is conducting an energy audit or replacing one's air conditioner,
in contrast to the result in Table 4. Perhaps because this loss aversion measure is too coarse, or perhaps
because it was based on questions that are purely hypothetical, it fails to provide additional evidence
relating loss aversion to energy efficiency investments.
        Overall, though the empirical results are often not statistically significant, they nevertheless
provide some consistent evidence that the energy consumption behaviors of individuals are motivated
in part by a choice model based on prospect theory, and in particular that those individuals who are
more loss-averse are less likely to invest in energy efficiency. Given this result, I next consider the policy
implications.


IV. Policy


28
  The contradiction arises from the three blocks of time preference questions. The "red" block (today vs. 1 month)
and "black" block (today vs. 6 months) pin down a range for 𝛿, which may contradict the 𝛿 range provided by the
"black" block (5 months vs. 6 months).

         In this section, I consider a model of optimal policy in the context of an energy-efficiency
decision made by consumers exhibiting prospect theory. The social planner seeks to maximize social
welfare, and there are two potential distortions. The first is a standard market failure: externalities from
the use of energy. This is modeled as a positive externality from the adoption of the energy-efficient
technology, only realized in the case of cost savings. The second distortion is a "behavioral" failure
caused by the consumer exhibiting prospect theory.
         The first-best solution is given by the following:
                       max(1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                         𝑒

The externality from the energy efficiency investment is given by 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒), and it appears in the social
welfare function, though not in the agent's utility function.29 The first-best solution includes the
consumer's utility function and is not characterized by prospect theory. This social welfare framework
thus takes the form of there being a distinction between "decision" utility – that is, the subjectively
perceived utility, or the utility that guides the consumer's decisions – and "experienced" utility – that is,
the "true" utility, or the utility that is relevant for welfare calculations. This specification of welfare
analysis is commonly used in behavioral welfare economics,30 though there are alternatives.31 Some
empirical support for this method of welfare analysis can be found in the psychology literature in
Charpentier et al. (2016), who conduct an experiment over risky gambles eliciting subjects' choices and
their feelings or emotions over outcomes. They find that while choices are best modeled using a value
function that exhibits loss aversion, loss aversion is not present in the function that describes feelings,
which may suggest that decision utility contains loss aversion but experienced utility does not.32
         The policy that the planner selects is a per-unit subsidy 𝑠 to energy efficiency 𝑒. Assume that
the subsidy rate 𝑠 is constant so that the total subsidy payment is 𝑠𝑒 (later, in subsection IV.E., I will


29
   The external benefit is separable from utility over wealth 𝑈. This avoids creating an income effect that arises in
the optimal policy solutions. Results from modeling the external benefit non-separably contain this extra income
effect and are available upon request from the author.
30
   For example, see O'Donoghue and Rabin (2006), Duflo et al. (2011), Heutel (2015), or Farhi and Gabaix (2015).
Thaler (2016, p. 1591) summarizes: "Expected utility theory remains the gold standard for how decisions should be
made in the face of risk. Prospect theory is meant to be a complement to expected utility theory, which tells us
how people actually make such choices" (italics added). Farhi and Gabaix also consider an alternative to the
decision vs. experienced utility welfare specification, based on misspecification of prices or taxes. Treating
deviations from expected utility theory as "inadvisable" or "mistakes" goes back at least to Jacob Marschak, who in
a 1950 letter to Paul Samuelson, referred to those who deviate from expected utility theory as displaying "non-
Euclidean habits." (Moscati 2016, p. 229).
31
   For example, Bernheim and Rangel (2009) and Bernheim (2016).
32
   They claim their results suggest "that the asymmetric influence of gains and losses on decision making, as
suggested by prospect theory, is not necessarily reflected in expected or experienced feelings." (Charpentier et al.
2016, p. 10).
                                                        16


consider the case where the subsidy rate can vary based on which state is realized). The subsidy is paid
for by a lump-sum tax 𝑇, which is fixed to equal the subsidy revenues but which the consumer treats as
lump sum.
        The consumer acts according to prospect theory and solves:
                   max(𝜋(1 − 𝑝))𝑣(−𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠𝑒 − 𝑇) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠𝑒 − 𝑇)
                     𝑒

The consumer does not consider the externality from energy efficiency, and the consumer exhibits loss
aversion. Both of these deviate from the solution to the first-best problem, and so there is a potential
for the social planner to intervene to increase social welfare.33 34
        I analyze the implication of prospect theory on policy by considering several cases. First
(subsection IV.A.), I assume that the only market failure is the externality, and the consumer does not
exhibit prospect theory. Then, I separately add in two aspects of prospect theory individually to isolate
their effects on policy. In subsection IV.B. I assume that the consumer uses probability weighting but
not loss aversion (reference-dependent preferences). In subsection IV.C., the consumer exhibits loss
aversion, but not probability weighting. Then, subsection IV.D. presents the case where the consumer
exhibits prospect theory, including both probability weighting and loss aversion. The remaining
subsections present alternative specifications, comparative statics, and numerical simulations.


IV.A. Externality Only
        To begin, consider the case where the only market distortion is caused by the externality from
energy efficiency; assume that the consumer decides based on expected utility rather than on prospect
theory.35 In this case the optimal policy is to provide a Pigouvian subsidy for the positive externality.
        The (unique) solution for the subsidy is:
                                                   1         ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
                                            𝑠=           ∙ 𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
                                                 𝐸[𝑈 ′ ]
                                                                                ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ))
The subsidy is equal to the expected value of the marginal external benefits (𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡         divided by the
expected value of marginal utility 𝐸[𝑈 ′ ] ≡ (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ))


33
   A related behavioral economic effect is from framing, where the framing of a decision can affect choices (Tversky
and Kahneman 1981). Here, framing choice is not a policy option, though perhaps if possible it would affect
behavior (Fryer er al. 2012).
34
   A money pump (or "Dutch book") argument is often used against the plausibility of intransitive preferences like
those implied under prospect theory (e.g. Azevedo and Gottleib 2012), though Rabin and Thaler (2001) and Cubitt
and Sugden (2001) provide counterarguments. Here, though, the planner is benevolent, seeking to maximize the
consumer's "true" utility rather than money-pump her.
35
   That is, the consumer's problem is: max(1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠𝑒 − 𝑇) + 𝑝𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠𝑒 − 𝑇)
                                       𝑒
                                                         17


(since marginal utility is different across the two states). Derivations of this subsidy and all subsequent
results are in Appendix B.
           This is the standard Pigouvian result, and it achieves the first-best. It ignores the consumer
exhibiting prospect theory.


IV. B. Externality and Probability Weighting
           Next, assume that the consumer exhibits probability weighting.36 The first-best is achieved with
the following policy:
                                                                                       ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )

                                                                                  𝜋(𝑝)𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
              𝑠=           ∙ [        −     ] 𝑈 (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒                        +
                   𝐸[𝑈 ′ ]      𝜋(𝑝)     𝑝                                            𝐸[𝑈 ′ ]
Here, expected marginal utility is evaluated based on the weighted, not true, probabilities: 𝐸[𝑈 ′ ] ≡
𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )). The second term is identical to the
optimal policy in the case without probability weighting, except that marginal benefit is multiplied by
the weighted probability 𝜋(𝑝) rather than the true probability. 37 The first term is an additional
                                                                  𝜋(1−𝑝)  1−𝑝
correction for probability weighting. The term in brackets [       𝜋(𝑝)
                                                                         − 𝑝 ]    is positive whenever the low

state is overweighted relatively more than the high state is overweighted (or when the high state is
underweighted relatively more than the low state is underweighted). For instance, it is positive if you
overweight the probability of the low state (𝜋(1 − 𝑝) > 1 − 𝑝) and underweight the probability of the
high state (𝜋(𝑝) < 𝑝); this weighting can be called "pessimistic." Under a symmetric (gain vs. loss)
inverse-S shaped weighting function (e.g. from Prelec (1998)) where small probabilities are
overweighted, a pessimistic weighting will occur when the probability of the low state occurring is small.
           Assuming pessimistic weighting, the first term in the expression for 𝑠 is positive. Because the
consumer underweights the true probability of achieving a benefit from the energy efficiency
investment, optimal policy subsidizes energy efficiency (at a higher rate than just marginal external
benefits). With optimistic weighting, where the consumer relatively overweights the probability of the
benefit being realized, this first term is negative. Probability weighting creates a term in the optimal
subsidy of the opposite sign as the part addressing the externality.
           In the case where there is just an externality and probability weighting, it is easy to see that the
optimal set of policies is used to eliminate the distortion from both of these effects. The policy

  This result is analogous to Proposition 2.2 in Fahri and Gabaix (2015), which shows that the Pigouvian tax is
"modified" when consumers misperceive taxes.
                                                            18


prescriptions are analogous to those from other models of misoptimization, for instance from
undervaluation of future costs (Allcott et al. 2014) or tax salience (Chetty et al. 2009).


IV.C. Externality and Loss Aversion
        Here, suppose that the consumer's beliefs over the probabilities are true, but that the consumer
optimizes according to a value function rather than a utility function. The value function is a function of
the gains and losses relative to a reference point, and thus it excludes the initial wealth level 𝑤. The
value function can be asymmetric about the reference point, leading to loss aversion.
        The consumer's problem in this case is:
                     max(1 − 𝑝)𝑣(−𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇) + 𝑝𝑣(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇)
                       𝑒

In the first half of this maximand, with probability 1 − 𝑝 the cost savings are not realized, and the
consumer treats the expenditure on energy efficiency 𝑐(𝑒) as a loss. Although there is also a subsidy
that the consumer receives and a lump-sum tax, the net payment is zero and so will not move this from
a loss to a gain. In the second half, with probability 𝑝 the cost savings are realized and the consumer
treats this is a gain (that is, 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇 > 0).
        While the consumer uses a reference-dependent value function that can exhibit loss aversion,
the first-best outcome is defined based on the utility function, which is not reference-dependent and
does not feature loss aversion. Define the marginal utility and the marginal value function at the
optimum, for either a loss or a gain, in the following way:
                                          ′
                                         𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 ≡ 𝑣′(−𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 − 𝑇)
                                     ′
                                    𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 ≡ 𝑣 ′ (𝑏(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 − 𝑇)
                                                ′
                                               𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 ≡ 𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ))
                                          ′
                                         𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 ≡ 𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) − 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ))
Given these definitions, the unique policy that yields the first-best outcome is:
                     ′          ′        ′                                          ′
                    𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛      𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠   𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠                 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
                                                                            1      𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛   ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
               𝑠=          ∙ [  ′    −  ′    ] ∙ (1 − 𝑝) ∙ 𝑐            +        ∙  ′    𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
                    𝐸[𝑣 ′ ] 𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛      𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛                              𝐸[𝑣 ′ ] 𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛
Here the denominator is the expected value of the marginal value function, not marginal utility: 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ] ≡
        ′        ′
(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 + 𝑝𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 . The second term, again, directly addresses the positive externality. It is
                            ′
                           𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛
modified by the factor 𝑈′          . If this ratio is greater than one, then the consumer's perceived marginal
                            𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛

value is greater than the social planner's marginal utility, and so the part of the subsidy addressing the
externality is greater than it otherwise would be. The first term is an additional component addressing
                                                            19

                                                 ′           ′
                                               𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠       𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠
loss aversion. The expression in brackets [     ′      −    ′    ]   will tend to be positive under loss aversion.38 A
                                               𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛       𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛

loss-averse consumer is less likely to invest in energy efficiency given the possibility of experiencing a
loss, and this positive term in 𝑠 compensates for that.
         In this expression, both market failures – from the externality and from loss aversion – affect the
optimal policy design, and the subsidy can mitigate both market failures. Next, I turn to the most
complete case, in which there is a positive externality and the consumer is both probability weighting
and exhibiting loss aversion.


IV.D. Externality and Prospect Theory
         Finally, assume that all of the features of prospect theory are present, as well as the externality.
The consumer's problem is
                   max 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣(−𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇)
                    𝑒

The subsidy that induces the first-best outcome is
                           ′               ′                                            ′
          1       𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠   (1 − 𝑝)𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠    ′               ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
                                                                                 1     𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛   ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
     𝑠=         ∙[       ′      −       ′      ] 𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∙ 𝜋(𝑝) ∙ 𝑐            +        ∙ ′ 𝜋(𝑝)𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
        𝐸[𝑣 ′ ]    𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛         𝑝𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛                                    𝐸[𝑣 ′ ] 𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛
Here the expected value of the marginal value function is taken using the weighted probabilities:
                   ′           ′
𝐸[𝑣 ′ ] ≡ 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 . This expression combines the insights from the previous two
expressions for optimal subsidies, in which just one feature of prospect theory was present. For
instance, when there is no probability weighting (i.e. when 𝜋(𝑝) = 𝑝), then this expressions reduces to
the expression from the previous section with just reference-dependent preferences.
         The sign and magnitude of 𝑠 depend both on the degree of probability weighting (the relative
magnitudes of 1 − 𝑝 and 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)) and the distortion from reference-dependent preferences (the
                    ′         ′
difference between 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 and 𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 ). It is possible that the two distortions created by prospect theory
                                                         ′              ′             ′
just cancel each other out. This would occur if 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = (1 − 𝑝)𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 and if 𝑝𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 =
     ′
𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 . Whether or not this holds, or whether in fact the two distortions operate in the same
direction, depends on the parameterization of the functions.
         The results in this most general model show that the distortions created by prospect theory
require that the standard Pigouvian response to externalities be altered. In addition to a term in the
optimal subsidy that remedies the market failure from the externality, there is a term to accommodate


38
  For example, under a simple specification of loss aversion where 𝑈 and 𝑣 are identical for gains but 𝑣 exhibits
                                                          ′       ′         ′       ′
loss aversion under losses, then this is positive (since 𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 = 𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 and 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 > 𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 ).
                                                           20


the behavioral failures created by prospect theory. In general, the sign of these additional terms are
unknown and depend on parameter values.


IV.E. State-Dependent Subsidies
         Next, assume that the subsidy rate can depend on the realization of the state. The planner sets
two subsidy rates, 𝑠𝐿𝑂 and 𝑠𝐻𝐼 , corresponding to the state where the energy efficiency benefit is not
realized (the "𝐿𝑂" state, with probability 1 − 𝑝) and to the state where it is realized (the "𝐻𝐼" state, with
probability 𝑝). The lump-sum tax is required to just offset the subsidy payments so is also state-
dependent: 𝑇𝐿𝑂 and 𝑇𝐻𝐼 . The consumer's problem is
               max 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣(−𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠𝐿𝑂 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇𝐿𝑂 ) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒) + 𝑠𝐻𝐼 ∙ 𝑒 − 𝑇𝐻𝐼 )
                𝑒

The planner chooses the subsidies to maximize expected utility conditional on the consumer's response.
In this case, though, there is not a unique solution for the optimal policies 𝑠𝐿𝑂 and 𝑠𝐻𝐼 . There are two
policy instruments, but the planner needs to induce only one scalar (𝑒) to its optimal level, so the
planner has one extra degree of freedom.
         Instead, there are a continuum of solutions. One can consider, though, a constrained policy. In
particular, suppose that the subsidy is constrained to be zero in the low (no energy savings) state; a
subsidy can only be made if the energy savings are actually realized. In this case, the optimal policy is:
                                                        𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 0
                                      ′                   ′
                                                 (1 − 𝑝)𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠
                             𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠                                        1
                    𝑠𝐻𝐼 =   [                −                ] ∙ 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) + ′   ∙ 𝑏 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
                                    ′
                              𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛                ′
                                                    𝑝𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛                      𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝑒𝑥𝑡
The second term in the expression for 𝑠𝐻𝐼 is the standard Pigouvian solution of pricing at marginal
external damages.39 The first term remedies the distortion caused by prospect theory. Consider the
term in brackets (which also appears in the optimal state-independent subsidy in the previous section).
With no probability weighting, this term is positive when the consumer is loss-averse. With no loss-
aversion, this term is positive whenever the low state is overweighted relatively more than the high
state is overweighted (e.g. under a pessimistic weighting). If both of these conditions hold, then this
term is positive, increasing the optimal high-state subsidy relative to the Pigouvian case. If one but not
both hold, then these two features of prospect theory are working in opposite directions in terms of
their effect on the optimal subsidy.


39
  In the case where there are state-dependent subsidies but the only market failure is the externality (equivalent
                                                                                                         1
to section IV.A. but with state-dependent subsidies), then an optimal policy solution is 𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 0; 𝑠𝐻𝐼 = ′ ∙
                                                                                                      𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛

                                                           21


        Another constrained state-dependent subsidy fixes the low-state subsidy to exactly equal the
marginal cost of energy efficiency at the optimum (𝑐 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )). The optimal set of subsidies under this
constraint is:
                                                    𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
                                                                         ′
                                         1         ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )
                                                                  1 − 𝑝 𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠
                                𝑠𝐻𝐼 =    ′      ∙ 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡        −          ′    𝑐 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )

The high-state subsidy contains the same term to correct the positive externality, plus a modified term
to correct for prospect theory. There are two reasons for considering this particular constrained state-
dependent policy. First, it happens to be independent of the probability weighting function 𝜋. Second, I
show in Appendix C that this policy corresponds to the optimal policy in the case of heterogeneity.


IV.F. Comparative Statics
        I consider how parameter values affect the optimal subsidies. To conduct this comparative
static analysis, I impose the functional form on the value function described earlier in Section II: 𝑣(𝑥) =
𝑥 𝜎 for gains 𝑥 > 0 and 𝑣(𝑥) = −𝜆(−𝑥)𝜎 for losses 𝑥 < 0. The parameter 𝜆 represents the degree of
loss aversion; a higher 𝜆 means more loss aversion. I examine how the optimal subsidy 𝑠 is affected by
the value of 𝜆.
        First, consider the case of state-dependent subsidies from the previous subsection (IV.E.), and
consider the first solution presented, where 𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 0. The relationship between that 𝑠𝐻𝐼 and 𝜆 is given
by:
                 𝜕𝑠𝐻𝐼   𝜋(1 − 𝑝) ′ 𝑜𝑝𝑡 𝜕 ′         𝜋(1 − 𝑝) ′ 𝑜𝑝𝑡            𝛾 𝜎−1
                      =      ′    𝑐 (𝑒 ) ∙ 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =      ′    𝑐 (𝑒 ) ∙ 𝜎(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )    >0
                  𝜕𝜆    𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛         𝜕𝜆       𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛
In the expression for 𝑠𝐻𝐼 from subsection IV.E., the second term is independent of 𝜆. In the first term,
                                    ′
the only part that depends on 𝜆 is 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 , which is positively related to 𝜆. Thus, for a more loss-averse
individual, the optimal high-state subsidy must be higher. This is because in this constrained solution
where 𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 0, the high-state subsidy must address the behavioral failure caused by loss aversion as
well as that caused by the externality.
        Next, consider the optimal state-independent subsidy from subsection IV.D. The derivative with
respect to 𝜆 is complicated by the fact that 𝜆 affects the denominator 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ].
                                 ′               ′                                     ′

                                                                                      𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛      ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )}
     =[           ] ∙ {[       ′      −       ′      ] 𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∙ 𝜋(𝑝) ∙ 𝑐            +∙  ′    𝜋(𝑝)𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
  𝜕𝜆    𝜕𝜆 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ]       𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛         𝑝𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛                                     𝑈𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛
                           1                       𝜕 ′
                     +       ′
                               𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑐 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ) 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠

The second part of the above expression represents the direct effect of 𝜆 on the optimal subsidy 𝑠,
                        ′
which is the effect on 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 in the expression for 𝑠. This term is positive; a more loss-averse person
requires a higher subsidy to get her to invest in energy-efficiency. The first part of the above expression
                𝜕   1
(multiplied by 𝜕𝜆 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ]) comes from the fact that the entire expression for 𝑠 is divided by 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ], which
          ′
contains 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 and is therefore a function of 𝜆. The term in the curly brackets is just the optimal subsidy
                                                                                 −1                      𝛾 𝜎−1
multiplied by 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ]. This entire first part of the expression simplifies to           𝑠𝜋(1 −   𝑝)𝜎(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )     <
                                                                                𝐸[𝑣 ′ ]

0. In other words, this indirect effect of 𝜆 on the optimal subsidy works in the opposite direction as the
more intuitive direct effect. Whether it dominates and yields a net counterintuitive effect depends on
the parameterization, which will be explored in the numerical simulations below.


IV.G. Additional Specifications
        Appendix C presents two additional specifications. First, I allow for heterogeneity across
individuals. Second, I allow for more than two possible outcomes and use cumulative prospect theory
to model consumer choice.


IV.H. Simulations
        Finally, I provide numerical simulations of optimal policy. I impose assumptions on functional
forms and parameter values, described in Appendix D, and numerically solve for policy. In the literature,
there are two types of numerical policy simulations that serve two different purposes. First and most
obviously, numerical simulations can be used to quantify theoretical results. For instance, while a
theory provides an expression for an optimal tax, the simulation is used to provide a value in dollars for
the tax rate. In these simulations, it is important that the model is as realistic as possible and well-
calibrated to the market in question.40
        Another type of numerical simulation serves a different purpose. Rather than providing realistic
quantitative numbers, these simulations are meant to explore how the policy outcomes relate to certain
parameter values. That is, the simulations provide a form of comparative statics of the theory,
numerically rather than theoretically. In these simulations, it is not important to calibrate the model to


40
  In the context of environmental policy under behavioral anomalies, two papers that provide simulations of this
sort are Allcott et al. (2014) and Heutel (2015). Both provide simulations of the automobile market when
consumers are irrational (inattentive to energy costs or present-biased), and both provide careful calibrations of
the US automobile market and consumer preferences, including behavioral biases. Both simulations provide
numerical calculations of optimal policy variables, like fuel taxes or fuel economy standards.
                                                         23


a particular market or to use real-world calibrated preference parameters. Instead the value is in seeing
how policy variables change along with these arbitrary parameter values. For example, O'Donoghue and
Rabin (2006) provide numerical simulations of a model of optimal "sin taxes," when consumers are
present-biased. Their simulations consider different values for parameters describing the demand
elasticity and the degree of present bias among consumers, and they present optimal taxes under each
set of parameter values. This type of simulation can even be described as a "back-of-the-envelope"
calculation.
         The simulations presented here are of the second type of simulation, as in O'Donoghue and
Rabin (2006). That is, the simulations are not meant to reflect any particular real-world market, nor are
they calibrated to previously-estimated parameters. Therefore, their interpretation should still be seen
as qualitative rather than as quantitative.
         The appendix describes the functional form assumptions and most parameter values. Here, I
describe the most important parameter values and results. In the base case, I set the loss aversion
parameter 𝜆 = 2, which is roughly equal to the median value found in the empirical results here and to
the mean value found in Tversky and Kahneman (1992). Since 𝜆 > 1, this indicates loss aversion. A
larger value for 𝜆 means more loss aversion. The probability weighting parameter 𝛼 = 0.75, roughly
equal to the mean value found in this paper and in Tanaka et al. (2010) and Liu (2008). Since this is less
than one, it indicates that people overweight small probability events. A lower value of 𝛼 means more
overweighting of small probability events. The probability 𝑝 of achieving energy efficiency benefits is set
to 0.75, so that consumers overweight the probability of not achieving these benefits.
         Given these parameter values and the parameter values and functional forms described in the
appendix, I solve for optimal subsidies to energy efficiency under different specifications of consumer
behavior, corresponding to the previous subsections in this section of the paper. The results are
summarized in Table 7. The first row presents the results under the base-case parameter values. In the
second panel, I vary the degree of loss aversion 𝜆, and in the bottom panel I vary the degree of
probability weighting 𝛼. The energy efficiency values 𝑒 ∗ are expressed as a percentage of the first-best
level. Subsidy values 𝑠 ∗ are expressed as a percentage of the cost of energy efficiency at the first-best
level 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ).
         Under the base case, the energy efficiency level 𝑒 ∗ chosen by the consumer who exhibits
expected utility theory is 89.87% of the first-best level.41 The difference is solely due to the externality


41
  The quantitative values of these outcomes are arbitrary; the first-best energy efficiency level is 0.195, and the
consumer's choice under EUT is 0.176.
                                                               24


from energy efficiency. When a consumer exhibits prospect theory, the energy efficiency level chosen is
lower: just 28.00% of the first-best level. Under this base-case parameterization, the scale of the market
failure due to prospect theory (in terms of the consumer deviating from the first best) is larger than the
market failure due to the externality.
           The last four columns present optimal subsidy values under different assumptions about
consumer behavior. When the consumer exhibits expected utility theory, so that the only market failure
is from the externality, the optimal subsidy is 25.73% of the cost of energy-efficiency at the first-best
level 𝑐(𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 ).42 That is, the policymaker subsidizes about one-fourth of the cost of the energy efficiency
investment to counteract the market failure from the externality. In the next column, I assume that the
consumer exhibits probability weighting but not loss aversion, as in subsection IV.B. Here the subsidy is
about twice as high as in the previous column, 59.08% of the cost of the investment. In the second-to-
last column, the consumer exhibits reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion but no
probability weighting. Here, the optimal subsidy is larger than the cost of energy-efficiency itself. That
is, the consumer is paid to invest in energy efficiency. Loss aversion is so strong that an enormous
subsidy is required to overcome it. Lastly, the final column shows the optimal subsidy when consumers
exhibit prospect theory, including both probability weighting and loss aversion. Again, the subsidy rate
is higher than 100% to ensure the first-best level of energy-efficiency.
           The rest of Table 7 explores comparative statics over the degree of loss aversion and the degree
of probability weighting. When loss aversion 𝜆 is varied, a higher value of loss aversion (higher 𝜆) results
in a lower level of energy efficiency 𝑒 ∗. When 𝜆 < 1 so that consumers are gain-averse rather than loss-
averse, then the energy efficiency level chosen is slightly higher than it is in the case under EUT. As
consumers are more loss-averse, the optimal subsidy gets higher. When consumers are gain-averse, the
optimal subsidy is negative (a tax on energy efficiency) under loss aversion only, though it becomes
slightly positive when probability weighting is also included. When probability weighting 𝛼 is varied, a
larger overweighting of small probabilities (smaller 𝛼) results in a smaller value of energy efficiency
chosen 𝑒 ∗ and a larger subsidy necessary to correct the market failure. When 𝛼 > 1 so that the
consumer actually underweights the small probability of not achieving energy savings, then the optimal
subsidy is slightly negative to overcome the market failure operating in the opposite direction.
           As mentioned earlier, the simulation results in Table 7 are not meant to be taken as serious
quantitative policy recommendations since the parameterization is (intentionally) arbitrary.



42
     This value is 0.141, and the optimal subsidy is 0.0363.
                                                        25


Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the results suggest that the market failure arising from prospect theory
may be quite large and in particular may be larger than the market failure arising from the externality.


V. Conclusion
        I examine how prospect theory affects people's choices to invest in energy efficiency, and to
what extent this affects optimal energy policy. Using data gathered from an online survey featuring a
choice experiment to elicit evidence of prospect theory, I find that people who are more loss averse are
less likely to undertake energy efficiency investments like buying a fuel-efficient car or energy-efficient
light bulbs. I develop a theoretical model to conduct welfare analysis under the assumption that
people's choices over energy efficiency are explained by prospect theory. The standard Pigouvian policy
of pricing externalities is modified under prospect theory to account for consumers' deviations from
maximizing their true utility. Optimal policy addresses both the market failure generated by
externalities and the “behavioral" market failure generated by loss aversion.
        Both the empirical and theoretical results point to the importance of incorporating prospect
theory into energy policy evaluation and design, but both sets of results could be extended. Further
research could address the importance of various assumptions. Empirically, the current set of results is
from a very small sample from an online survey, so replicating the survey with additional respondents
would be beneficial. The current results are based solely on hypothetical questions; running a survey in
which questions are tied to actual payments may mitigate hypothetical bias. Lastly, the current survey
design uses choice experiments over money lotteries to elicit preference parameters and survey
questions to gather energy consumption decisions; an alternative approach is to use choice experiments
over energy consumption options to elicit preference parameters, and use those results to explore how
prospect theory affects energy consumption.43
        The theoretical policy results use a number of assumptions that could be relaxed. First, the
main specification is a representative agent model, consumer heterogeneity is only addressed through a
simple extension modeling two types. Given that loss aversion or other prospect-theory based
parameters may be different across the population, targeted policies that account for heterogeneity
may improve on the policy responses.44 Second, the model considers only a limited set of policy
options; other policies could be modeled. For instance, the policymaker may be restricted as to how

43
   A similar methodology is used by Newell and Siikamäki (2015) to elicit time discounting parameters in the
context of energy-efficiency investments.
44
   Alloctt et al. (2014) consider targeting policies when consumers are heterogeneous in their undervaluing of
energy costs.
                                                    26


high a subsidy could be or how it could be structured. In this case, the policy may not be able to achieve
the first-best outcome, but the model can solve for second-best policies. Additionally, there may be
other policies available besides subsidies, including efficiency standards. Third, though the motivating
example is energy efficiency investments, the model could also apply to other risky decisions that can be
characterized by prospect theory, for example, decisions over health investments or health insurance.
Fourth and finally, the model only considers the behavioral failures caused by prospect theory. There are
other alternatives to expected utility theory besides prospect theory for modeling decisions under risk,
for example, rank-dependent expected utility (Quiggen 1982) and regret aversion (Loomes and Sugden
1982). Furthermore, there are other sets of behavioral failures, for instance, those caused by time-
inconsistent preferences (Laibson 1997). The relationship between prospect theory and other
behavioral failures could yield further policy refinements.

Appendix – For Online Publication
Appendix A: Comparative Statics of Theoretical Model
          Here I provide the details of the comparative static results presented in Section II of the text.
                                  𝜕𝑒
First, I demonstrate that 𝜕𝜆 < 0. Call the first-order condition 𝐹:
                                               𝜎−1                                                 𝜎−1
          𝐹 ≡ (𝜋(1 − 𝑝)) (𝜆𝜎(𝑐(𝑒))                   ) (−𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝜎(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))                   (𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) = 0

The implicit function theorem tells us

                                                               𝜕𝑒 − 𝜕𝐹⁄𝜕𝜆
                                                                  =
                                                               𝜕𝜆   𝜕𝐹⁄
                                                                       𝜕𝑒
The denominator of this expression is the second-order condition of the optimization problem, which is
                                                                                                     𝜕𝐹
assumed to be negative to ensure an interior maximum. The numerator is                                    = (1 −
                                                                                                     𝜕𝜆
                   𝜎−1                                         𝜕𝑒
𝜋(𝑝))𝜎(𝑐(𝑒))             (−𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) < 0. Therefore, 𝜕𝜆 < 0.

          Second, I solve for the effect of 𝛼 on 𝑒. From the implicit function theorem:

                                                               𝜕𝑒 − 𝜕𝐹⁄𝜕𝛼
                                                                  =
                                                               𝜕𝛼   𝜕𝐹⁄
                                                                       𝜕𝑒
                                                                                     𝜕𝐹       𝜕𝜋(1−𝑝)          𝜎−1
The numerator in this expression (excluding the minus sign) is
                                                                                     𝜕𝛼
                                                                                          =
                                                                                                𝜕𝛼

𝜕𝜋(𝑝)                        𝜎−1                                                                 𝜕𝜋(1−𝑝)

                                                                                                            is negative, and the
                              𝜕𝜋(𝑝)

Appendix B: Derivations of Optimal Subsidies
        Here I provide derivations/proofs of the expressions for optimal subsidies presented in Section
IV of the text.
        The planner's problem is to choose a policy 𝑠 to maximize expected utility conditional on the
consumer's response to the policy. The lump-sum tax 𝑇 is constrained to just equal subsidy
expenditures and thus not modeled as a choice variable.


Externality Only
        In this case, presented in subsection IV.A., the consumer's first-order condition is
       (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) = 0
The planner's problem is thus
                       max(1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                        𝑒,𝑠

such that the consumer's first-order condition holds. The subsidy and lump-sum tax need not appear in
the planner's maximand since they are constrained to exactly offset and thus do not affect social
welfare. The planner's problem can be written as a Lagrangian:
 (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                   + 𝜆[(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠)]
The first-order conditions to this Lagrangian are, with respect to 𝑒, 𝑠, and 𝜆, respectively:
  (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
                                                                                  ′ (𝑒)]
                                                                                         + 𝜆[𝑆𝑂𝐶] = 0
                              𝜆[(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))] = 0
          (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠) = 0
Here the solution to the planner's problem for energy efficiency is simply denoted as 𝑒. The term in
brackets in the first equation labeled 𝑆𝑂𝐶 is the second derivative of the consumer's maximand with
respect to 𝑒, i.e. part of the second-order condition of the consumer's problem. For brevity (it involves
relatively complicated expressions of second derivatives) it is not reported here. Also, it is unnecessary
to report, since the second equation above implies that 𝜆 = 0 (because 𝑈 ′ > 0 and 𝑝 ∈ (0,1)).
Therefore, the 𝑆𝑂𝐶 term drops out of the first first-order condition, and it then becomes identical to the
expression describing the first-best outcome. That is, policy can achieve the first-best. The remaining
two first-order conditions can be solved for 𝑠 (substituting in for (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒))) to
arrive at the expression in the text.
                                                           41


Externality and Probability Weighting
          In this case, presented in subsection IV.B., the consumer's first-order condition is
    𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) = 0
The Lagrangian describing the planner's problem is
                       (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                                         + 𝜆[𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠)
                                         + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠)]
The three first-order conditions for the Lagrangian are identical to the three conditions in the previous
subsection of this appendix, except replacing the probabilities 𝑝 and 1 − 𝑝 with the weighted
probabilities 𝜋(𝑝) and 𝜋(1 − 𝑝), respectively, in the second and third condition and in the expression
𝑆𝑂𝐶. It remains true that the second first-order condition implies that 𝜆 = 0, and thus that the first-
best can be achieved. The first and third conditions can be solved for 𝑠 to yield the expression in the
text.


Externality and Loss Aversion
          In this case, presented in subsection IV.C., the consumer's first-order condition is
            (1 − 𝑝)𝑣 ′ (−𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) + 𝑝𝑣 ′ (𝑏(𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) = 0
The Lagrangian describing the planner's problem is
        (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                         + 𝜆[(1 − 𝑝)𝑣′(−𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠) + 𝑝𝑣 ′ (𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠)]
The three first-order conditions are
  (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
                                                                                  ′ (𝑒)]
                                                                                         + 𝜆[𝑆𝑂𝐶] = 0
                                  𝜆[(1 − 𝑝)𝑣′(−𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝𝑣′(𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))] = 0
            (1 − 𝑝)𝑣 ′ (−𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) + 𝑝𝑣 ′ (𝑏(𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) = 0
As in the previous cases, the second condition implies that 𝜆 = 0, that the the 𝑆𝑂𝐶 term drops out of
the first condition, and the first and third conditions can be solved for 𝑠 to yield the expression in the
                                    ′       ′
text, substituting in the notation 𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 , 𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 , etc.


Externality and Prospect Theory
          In this case, presented in subsection IV.D., the consumer's first-order condition is
          𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣 ′ (−𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣 ′ (𝑏(𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠) = 0
                                                          42


The Lagrangian describing the planner's problem is
   (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                    + 𝜆[𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣′(−𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠) + 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣 ′ (𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠)]
The three first-order conditions are identical to the three conditions from the previous subsection,
except replacing the weighted probabilities for the true probabilities. The second condition implies 𝜆 =
0 once again, so that the first and third conditions can be solved for 𝑠.


State-Dependent Subsidies
        In this case, presented in subsection IV.E., the consumer's first-order condition is
    (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠𝐿𝑂 ) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐(𝑒 ∗ ))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ ) + 𝑠𝐻𝐼 ) = 0
The planner now has an additional choice variable:
                       max (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                     𝑒,𝑠𝐿𝑂 ,𝑠𝐻𝐼

such that the consumer's first-order condition holds. The planner's problem can be written as a
Lagrangian:
                      (1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒)]
                                        + 𝜆[(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠𝐿𝑂 )
                                        + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠𝐻𝐼 )]
Now there are four first-order conditions to this Lagrangian, with respect to 𝑒, 𝑠𝐿𝑂 , 𝑠𝐻𝐼 , and 𝜆,
respectively:
 (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒 ∗ )) + 𝑝[𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡
                                                                                    ′ (𝑒)]
                                                                                           + 𝜆[𝑆𝑂𝐶] = 0
                                           𝜆(1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒)) = 0
                                          𝜆𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒)) = 0
       (1 − 𝑝)𝑈 ′ (𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒))(−𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠𝐿𝑂 ) + 𝑝𝑈 ′ (𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒) − 𝑐(𝑒))(𝑏 ′ (𝑒) − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒) + 𝑠𝐻𝐼 ) = 0
Both the second and third conditions imply that 𝜆 = 0. This leaves two remaining conditions (the first
and fourth) but three remaining unknowns (𝑒, 𝑠𝐿𝑂 , and 𝑠𝐻𝐼 ), which implies that the problem is over-
determined and there are a continuum of solutions for the subsidies.
        For the first solution presented in the text, assume that 𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 0. Then, solve the remaining two
first-order conditions for 𝑠𝐻𝐼 to arrive at the expression for 𝑠𝐻𝐼 in the text. For the second solution,
assume that 𝑠𝐿𝑂 = 𝑐 ′ (𝑒), and solve for 𝑠𝐻𝐼 .

Heterogeneity
         I consider a simple form of heterogeneity. There are just two consumers. One maximizes
according to expected utility theory, while the other maximizes according to prospect theory. The
positive externality market failure applies to both consumers, but the market failure from prospect
theory only applies to the second consumer. The planner now has two scalars to achieve to meet the
first-best allocation: the energy efficiency investments of consumer 1 and of consumer 2. Therefore,
under this specification of heterogeneity, a policy with state-dependent subsidies 𝑠𝐿𝑂 and 𝑠𝐻𝐼 will
uniquely achieve the first-best outcome.45
         Formally, let consumer 1 be the expected utility maximizer and consumer 2 be the prospect
theory maximizer. The first-best outcome is the solution to:

       max 𝑞 [(1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒1 )) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒1 ) − 𝑐(𝑒1 )) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒1 )]]
       𝑒1 ,𝑒2

                             + (1 − 𝑞) [(1 − 𝑝)𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑒2 )) + 𝑝[𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑏(𝑒2 ) − 𝑐(𝑒2 )) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒2 )]]

The parameter 𝑞 represents the weighting in social welfare placed on consumer 1; alternatively, there
are a continuum of consumers and 𝑞 is the fraction that are expected utility maximizers. The utility
function, cost function, internal and external benefit functions, and wealth are allowed to differ across
the two consumer types, though for simplicity here and below I omit subscripts (e.g. 𝑏(𝑒1 ) and 𝑏(𝑒2 )
more formally are 𝑏1 (𝑒1 ) and 𝑏2 (𝑒2 ), respectively).
         The planner's problem is to choose 𝑒1 , 𝑒2 , 𝑠𝐿𝑂 , and 𝑠𝐻𝐼 to maximize weighted expected utility
across the two consumers, constrained by the consumers' first-order conditions describing their choices
in response to the subsidies. The first consumer maximizes according to expected utility theory so has a
first-order condition equivalent to that in subsection IV.A. (though responding to state-dependent
subsidies). The second consumer maximizes according to prospect theory so has the same first-order
condition as in subsection IV.E. The planner's problem can be expressed as a Lagrangian. As in the
previous cases, the first-order conditions imply that the Lagrangian multiplier is zero, so that the first-
best can be achieved. The remaining first-order conditions can be used to solve for the subsidies. The
optimal set of subsidies is:
                                                      ′                            ′

  A trivial policy that includes a subsidy targeted to each consumer type would also achieve the first best by simply
replicating the results from previous sections.

These expressions include det(𝐴1 ) ≡ (1 − 𝑝)𝑈1,𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 − 𝑝𝑈1,𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 and det(𝐴2 ) ≡

(1 − 𝑝)𝑈2,𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝜋(𝑝)𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 − 𝑝𝑈2,𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜋(1 − 𝑝)𝑣𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 . These expressions are complicated and difficult to
interpret, but both the low-state and high-state subsidies include terms that address the externalities
  ′ (𝑒 )     ′
(𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 1 and 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑒2 )) and terms that address consumer's 2's prospect theory maximization.

        These expressions can be slightly simplified by assuming that the utility functions, cost
functions, benefit functions, and wealth levels of the two types are identical to each other. The only
difference between the two consumers is that consumer 2 exhibits prospect theory. This implies that
the two optimal energy efficiency levels are identical to each other (𝑒1 = 𝑒2 ≡ 𝑒), although the planner
still requires two instruments to achieve them. It also implies that det(𝐴1 ) = det(𝐴2 ). The optimal set
of subsidies in this case is:

The first term in 𝑠𝐻𝐼 is approximately 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡   since the term in brackets is approximately equal to
det(𝐴1 ). This term represents the correction for the externality. The remaining term in 𝑠𝐻𝐼 , as well as
the entire expression for 𝑠𝐿𝑂 , represent the correction for consumer 2's prospect theory behavior.
        This policy is analogous to the second constrained state-dependent subsidy that was presented
in section IV.E., in which the low-state subsidy is fixed at the marginal cost of energy efficiency 𝑐 ′ (𝑒).
The first term in 𝑠𝐻𝐼 is analogous to the first term in that earlier expression, though the factor in front of
 ′ (𝑒)
𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡   is modified to account for the fact that only one consumer exhibits prospect theory. The second
term here is identical to the second term from that section.


Multiple States
        Next, I suppose that there more than just two (low and high) possible states. I use the
cumulative prospect theory model developed by Tversky and Kahneman (1992).46 Suppose that there
are 𝑛 + 𝑚 possible states of the world, where 𝑚 states are losses (net gains from energy efficiency


46
  When there are only two outcomes (one gain and one loss), cumulative prospect theory reduces to ordinary
prospect theory.
                                                                      45


investment are negative) and 𝑛 states are gains. Denote the net private gains, not including the
externality, of energy efficiency level 𝑒 in state 𝑖 characterized by random variable 𝜃𝑖 as 𝑥𝑖 (𝜃𝑖 ) ≡
𝑏(𝑒; 𝜃𝑖 ) − 𝑐(𝑒). Arrange all possible states in order from largest net losses (state −𝑚) to largest net
gains (state 𝑛), where the index 𝑖 is negative for losses and positive for gains. That is, 𝑖 ∈ {−𝑚, … , 𝑛}.
Assume that the choice of 𝑒 does not affect the ordering or the sign of the outcome. The value of a
prospect 𝑥𝑖 is 𝑣(𝑥𝑖 ). Denote the decision weight given to state 𝑖 based on its cumulative probability,
relative to the reference point, to be 𝜋𝑖− for losses and 𝜋𝑖+ for gains. Following Tversky and Kahneman
(1982), if 𝑝𝑖 is the objective probability of state 𝑖, then for losses 𝜋𝑖− = 𝑤 − (𝑝−𝑚 + ⋯ + 𝑝𝑖 ) −
𝑤 − (𝑝−𝑚 + ⋯ + 𝑝𝑖−1 ) for 1 − 𝑚 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 0 and 𝜋−𝑚
                                             −
                                                = 𝑤 − (𝑝−𝑚 ), and for gains 𝜋𝑖+ = 𝑤 + (𝑝𝑖 + ⋯ +
𝑝𝑛 ) − 𝑤 + (𝑝𝑖+1 + ⋯ + 𝑝𝑛 ) for 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 and 𝜋𝑛+ = 𝑤 + (𝑝𝑛 ). The functions 𝑤 − and 𝑤 + are capacity
functions, which are strictly increasing functions from the unit interval to itself.
             Suppose there is an externality that is state-dependent, denoted by 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡,𝑖 (𝑒). When this is
positive, it represents a positive externality, as in the previous model, though it could be negative for
some states. The first-best outcome is given by the solution to
                                                        𝑛

                                               max ∑ 𝑝𝑖 [𝑈(𝑤 + 𝑥𝑖 (𝑒)) + 𝑏𝑒𝑥𝑡,𝑖 (𝑒)]
                                                   𝑒
                                                       𝑖=−𝑚

The planner can levy a subsidy 𝑠 per unit of energy efficiency 𝑒, coupled with a revenue-neutral lump-
sum tax 𝑇. Under this policy, the consumer's optimization problem is
                                          −1                                   𝑛

                              max ∑            𝜋𝑖− 𝑣(𝑥𝑖 (𝑒) +     𝑠𝑒 − 𝑇) + ∑ 𝜋𝑖+ 𝑣(𝑥𝑖 (𝑒) + 𝑠𝑒 − 𝑇)
                                𝑒
                                      𝑖=−𝑚                                    𝑖=0

By comparing the first-order condition characterizing the first-best outcome and the first-order
condition characterizing the consumer's solution, it can be shown that the following subsidy induces the
first-best:
                                                   𝑛                                −1

                     𝑠=        {                     𝑜𝑝𝑡   +  ′

                                               𝑖=−𝑚                                𝑖=−𝑚
                                                            𝑛
                                                                  𝜋𝑖+ 𝑣𝑖′ 𝑝𝑖 𝑈𝑖′
                                            − 𝜋𝑘+ 𝑣𝑘′ ∑ (                −       ) 𝑥 ′ (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )}
                                                                  𝜋𝑘′ 𝑣𝑘′ 𝑝𝑘 𝑈𝑘′ 𝑖
                                                        𝑖=0;𝑖≠𝑘

Here   𝑣𝑖′       ′
             ≡ 𝑣 (𝑥𝑖   (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )),   𝑈𝑖′   ≡ 𝑈 (𝑤 + 𝑥𝑖 (𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡 )), and 𝐸[𝑣 ′ ] ≡ ∑−1
                                               ′                                      − ′     𝑛    + ′
                                                                                𝑖=−𝑚 𝜋𝑖 𝑣𝑖 + ∑𝑖=0 𝜋𝑖 𝑣𝑖 . This is

expressed in terms of an arbitrary excluded gain state 𝑘 ∈ {1, … , 𝑛}; any gain state can be used for 𝑘.
The first term in the curly brackets is the term that addresses the externality and is based on the
expected value of the externality. The remaining two terms account for the probability weighting
                                                     46


(comparing 𝜋𝑖 to 𝑝𝑖 ) and the reference-dependent loss-averse preferences (comparing 𝑣𝑖′ to 𝑈𝑖′ ). These
terms are a generalization of the first part of the expression for 𝑠 from section IV.D, where there are just
two possible states.




Appendix D: Details of Numerical Simulations
        I impose the following functional forms and parameter values, described in Appendix Table A7.
The functional forms for utility, the prospect value function, and the probability weighting function are
identical to those used in the comparative statics exercises in Section II and Section IV.F. These are
standard functional forms in the prospect theory literature (e.g. Tanaka et al. 2010). The functions
describing the cost and benefits (internal and external) of energy efficiency are arbitrarily chosen to be
power functions, where costs are convex and benefits are concave. The coefficient of 0.01 in front of
the external benefit function is calibrated to ensure an interior solution. The probability of achieving the
energy savings 𝑝 is 0.75. This, in addition to the assumption that the weighting parameter 𝛼 in the
probability weighting function is less than one, assures that consumers are overweighting the relatively
small probability that the cost savings are unrealized. (In fact, while that probability 1 − 𝑝 = 0.25, the
weighting probability is 𝜋(1 − 𝑝) = 0.279.)
        The simulations are solved in Matlab; code is available upon request. Optimal subsidies are
found both by using the first-order conditions presented in the paper and by numerically maximizing the
relevant optimization function.
