The Effects of Medicare Advantage on Opioid Use

                                         ABSTRACT

Despite a vast literature on the determinants of prescription opioid use, the role of health
insurance plans has received little attention. We study how the form of Medicare beneficiaries’
drug coverage affects the volume of opioids they consume. We find that enrollment in Medicare
Advantage, which integrates drug coverage with other medical benefits, significantly reduces
beneficiaries’ likelihood of filling an opioid prescription, as compared to enrollment in a stand-
alone drug plan. Approximately half of this effect was due to fewer fills from prescribers who
write a very large number of opioid prescriptions.

Introduction

           Since 2000, the U.S. has experienced a dramatic increase in overdose deaths, opioid use

disorder, and other harms from inappropriate use of prescription opioids (Paulozzi, Jones, Mak,

et al. 2011). This rise in harms has occurred contemporaneous with a tripling in the amount of

opioids that were prescribed from 1999-2015 (Guy, Zhang, Bohm, et al. 2017). By 2015, the

amount of opioids prescribed per person in the U.S., 640 morphine milligram equivalents

(MMEs), was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for three weeks,

equivalent to 5mg hydrocodone every 4 hours. 1

           Several indicators suggest at least some of this expansion in opioid use is medically

inappropriate. Physicians in counties in the highest quartile of prescribing write six times the

amounts (in MMEs) than those in the lowest quartile, and most of this variation cannot be

explained by conventional patient, area socioeconomic, or market characteristics (Guy, Zhang,

Bohm, et al. 2017). Medical-claims-based indicators suggest that inappropriate prescribing

behavior is common. In a sample of approximately 3 million commercially-insured adults who

received an opioid prescription, about a quarter had at least one indicator of inappropriate

prescribing, and 5.8 percent had two or more (Liu, Logan, Paulozzi, et al. 2013). Other work

shows that physicians trained at less-selective medical schools write significantly more opioid

prescriptions than those trained at more-selective schools (Schnell and Currie 2017).

           These circumstances offer health plans the opportunity to improve prescribing practices

through management of their physicians. For two reasons, Medicare Part D is an ideal setting in

which to investigate the extent to which plans have taken advantage of this opportunity.

           First, inappropriate use of opioids in Medicare Part D is an important policy problem.

Medicare Part D is a voluntary (but highly subsidized) outpatient prescription drug benefit that

                                                          2
started in 2006. All 59 million Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to prescription drug coverage

through a private plan approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); in

2017, more than 42 million beneficiaries enrolled in a Part D plan (Kaiser Family Foundation

2017).

         Since the adoption of Part D, Medicare has become the largest purchaser of prescription

opioids, covering about 20-30% of total U.S. spending on opioids (Zhou, Florence, and Dowell

2016). Several indicators suggest that there is inappropriate opioid use in Medicare. Many

Medicare beneficiaries have concurrent opioid prescriptions from multiple prescribers (Jena,

Goldman, Weaver, et al. 2014). Opioid prescribing in Medicare is concentrated among a small

number of high prescribers: in the Part D program, 35% of opioids by value were prescribed by

the top 1% of prescribers, and 78% were prescribed by the top 10% of prescribers (Chen,

Humphreys, Shah et al. 2016). According to the Office of the Inspector General of the

Department of Health and Human Services, “extreme use” and “questionable prescribing” have

put almost 90,000 beneficiaries at serious risk for opioid misuse or overdose; almost half of

beneficiaries from some states (Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) received at least one

opioid prescription in 2016 (HHS OIG 2017). In addition, the consequences of opioid

prescribing in Medicare may spill over to the population more broadly: the expanded access to

opioids resulting from the adoption of Part D increased opioid misuse among the Medicare-

ineligible population (Powell, Pacula, and Taylor 2015).

         Second, the way that Part D covers prescription drugs has created a natural experiment

with which to evaluate the effects of insurer strategies on inappropriate opioid use. Part D takes

two different forms in which insurers have very different incentives and abilities to control

inappropriate use of prescription opioids. Beneficiaries can obtain Part D coverage through their



                                                 3
choice of either a stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP) that supplements traditional fee-for-

service Medicare, or a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan (MA-PD) that is integrated

with a Medicare Advantage plan that covers all Medicare benefits including drugs. While the

administrator of a PDP has essentially no incentive or ability to manage the physicians who

prescribe covered drugs, the administrator of a MA-PD plan has the incentive to account for the

spillover effects of prescription drug use on the cost of care overall and can choose which

physicians to include in its network and how it manages care. Previous work has found that the

integration of MA-PD prescription drug coverage with the other benefits provided by Medicare

Advantage plans has some beneficial effects: MA-PD plans have more generous prescription

drug coverage than PDP plans, which translates into higher prescription drug utilization by

enrollees, driven by drugs that reduce overall medical expenditures and treat chronic conditions

(Starc and Town 2018).

       These same forces could also lead to less opioid use in MA-PD versus PDP plans. Yet,

no work has investigated whether this is the case. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We use

Medicare Part D claims to compare the rate of opioid prescriptions for patients enrolled in in

MA-PD plans versus PDPs. For each beneficiary, we construct four measures of the amount of

opioids prescribed in 2014: any prescription for an opioid; any prescription for an opioid from a

high prescriber, defined as the top 1% of prescribers in terms of number of opioid prescriptions

written; any prescription for > 7 days’ supply of an opioid, conditional on any opioid; and any

prescription for > 7 days’ supply of an opioid from a high prescriber, conditional on any opioid

from a high prescriber.

       We estimate the effects on the amount of opioids prescribed of enrollment in an MA-PD

plan using instrumental variables. For our instrument we use a discontinuity in the rules



                                                4
governing payments to MA-PD (but not PDP) plans that give greater payments to MA-PD plans

that cover beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of Metropolitan Statistical Areas

(MSAs) with populations of 250,000 or more. These counties are sometimes described as “urban

floor” counties. The sharp difference in payment rates at the urban floor creates incentives for

MA-PD plans to reduce premiums and increase the generosity of benefits in counties above

versus below the cutoff. The lower premiums and expanded benefits enhance beneficiaries’

incentives to enroll in Medicare Advantage. The induced incremental enrollment, in turn, allows

us to identify the effect of MA-PD plans on opioid prescription rates independent of any

unmeasured characteristics of beneficiaries or areas – as long as the urban floor is not correlated

with these unmeasured characteristics. This approach has been used in other work to identify the

effect of enrollment in Medicare Advantage on other outcomes, such as the hospitalization rate,

medical spending, prescription drug use overall, and mortality (e.g., Afendulis, Chernew, and

Kessler 2017; Cabral, Geruso, and Mahoney 2018; Duggan, Starc, and Vabson 2016; Starc and

Town 2018).



Previous Literature

       There is a vast literature on the social and economic determinants of the rise in use of and

harms from opioids (see, e.g., Dasgupta, Beletsky, and Ciccarone 2018 for a comprehensive

review). Among other factors, health policy researchers have highlighted inappropriate

prescribing. In response, states have adopted numerous policies like prescription drug

monitoring programs (PDMP), statewide databases that gather information from pharmacies on

the dispensing of controlled substances. Several studies have found that mandated use of

PDMPs can help prescribers identify patients at high risk of misuse (Wen, Shcackman, Aden,



                                                 5
and Bao 2017; Buchmueller and Carey 2017; Sacco, Duff, and Sarata 2018; Bao, Wen, Johnson,

et al. 2018). Other work has found that augmenting mandated use of PDMPs with laws requiring

special registration of pain clinics, which prescribe opioids and other controlled substances to

patients in large quantities, can reduce opioid prescriptions and overdose death rates (Dowell,

Zhang, Noonan, et al. 2016). Insurers have also recognized that the techniques they employ to

reduce low-value care in other settings might also be used to reduce inappropriate prescription of

opioids (Laverdier, Pereyda, and Silva 2016).

       Two case studies have evaluated the effectiveness of insurers’ attempts to encourage

more judicious use of opioids. One study found that a utilization management program

implemented by Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts – which required prescribers to

conduct a risk assessment for patient abuse, to obtain prior authorization for certain opioid

prescriptions, and to limit quantities – reduced the rate of new opioid prescriptions and the share

of enrollees with a current opioid prescription (Garcia, Dodek, Kowalski, et al. 2016). Another

study found that a prior authorization requirement implemented by Blue Shield of California –

which required approval for extended-release (ER) oxycodone, one of the most-misused opioids

– decreased the rate of ER oxycodone prescriptions but did not significantly decrease the overall

use of opioids in terms of MME per enrollee (Barnett, Olenski, Thygeson, et al. 2018). Although

these studies have provided valuable evidence about the effectiveness of two particular insurers’

strategies, neither has provided systematic evidence about the broader effectiveness of insurers’

efforts to address inappropriate prescribing of opioids – and no work has examined the effect of

the Medicare Advantage program on opioid use in Medicare Part D.

       There is some suggestive evidence that enrollees in MA-PD plans have lower rates of

prescription opioid use than enrollees in PDPs. Approximately one-quarter of enrollees in



                                                 6
United’s MA-PD plans had an opioid prescription in 2015 (UnitedHealth Group 2017) as

compared to one-third of enrollees in Part D overall (HHS OIG 2017). However, the difference

in opioid use rates between these two studies does not account for numerous factors, such as

enrollees’ demographic characteristics, health status, intensity of prescription drug use overall,

prior opioid use, and location.



Data and Models

        Data. We construct a cohort of a 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 2014.

We restrict our cohort to beneficiaries age 66 or older on January 1, 2014 who became and were

currently eligible because of their age; who were not dual (Medicaid) enrollees; were alive and

enrolled in a single PDP or MA-PD plan for all of 2014; were not enrolled in a private fee-for-

service plan (because these plans have been phased out and so are not relevant to current policy);

and were enrolled in some PDP or MA-PD plan in 2013 (to obtain historical information on each

beneficiary). For each beneficiary, we obtain all outpatient prescription drug claims for 2014.

We match to each claim by National Drug Code whether or not the claim was for an opioid,

according to the CDC’s classification system, 2 and calculate the number of days’ supply of

opioids.

        Returning to the set of prescription drug claims for 2014, we calculate for each prescriber

the number of opioid prescriptions that s/he wrote, and then rank her according to this statistic.

We flag claims for opioids written by the top 1% of opioid prescribers. Then, considering only

flagged claims, we calculate for each beneficiary the number of days’ supply of opioids in 2014

– that is, the days’ supply written by a high prescriber.

       Table 1a reports means (and standard deviations) of our dependent variables for all

nonrural Medicare beneficiaries and beneficiaries from MSAs with population of 100,000–

400,000. For beneficiaries from MSAs in this population range, it also presents means by county

floor status (in MSAs with above versus below 250,000 population), along with 95 percent

confidence intervals and p-values from difference-in-means hypothesis tests (based on

heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the county level).

       The first row of Table 1a shows that floor status affects MA enrollment, as previous

research has shown. Beneficiaries in urban floor counties were significantly more likely to

enroll in a MA-PD plan: 43.9 percent of beneficiaries in counties just above the floor were

enrolled in a MA-PD plan, versus 30.2 percent in counties just below (p < 0.001). The second

row shows that beneficiaries in urban floor counties were significantly less likely to be

prescribed an opioid. In 2014, 30.8 percent of beneficiaries in counties just above the floor had

at least one opioid prescription in 2014, versus 31.9 percent in those just below (p = 0.062).

According to the ratio of these two differences -- the Wald estimate of the effect of MA-PD

enrollment on opioid prescription rates –MA-PD enrollment reduces opioid prescription rates.

Per percentage point of likelihood of MA-PD enrollment, a Medicare beneficiary in 2014 was

0.08 percentage points less likely to be prescribed an opioid (= (30.8 – 31.9) / (43.9 – 30.2)).

This translates into a reduction in opioid prescription rates due to MA-PD enrollment of 8

percentage points (= 100 × 0.08), or approximately 25 percent (≈ 8 / 31.3). Approximately half

of this effect is due to reductions in prescriptions from high prescribers (0.5 percentage point =

4.0 – 4.5 percentage points), although the raw difference in prescriptions from high prescribers is

not statistically significant at conventional levels (p = 0.134).

        Figures 1 and 2 present the Wald estimate graphically. Each point represents a county.

The lines represent quadratic functions of MSA population fitted to the points by (population-

weighted) least squares. The lines show that, at the 250,000 population discontinuity, the effect

of the urban floor on MA enrollment is slightly smaller than the average effect over the 100,000

– 400,000 band. As we show in our robustness checks below, this causes IV estimates of the

effect of MA on opioid use to grow as the bandwidth shrinks.

        The bottom panels of Table 1a present statistics for the subset of beneficiaries with an

opioid prescription, either from any prescriber or from a high prescriber. The bottom panels

show that, conditional on any opioid, the volume of opioid prescriptions does not differ across

the urban floor (p = 0.620 and 0.954, respectively).

        Table 1b presents descriptive statistics of our independent variables, including

characteristics of beneficiaries, counties, and hospital markets. We obtain beneficiaries’

demographic characteristics (age on January 1, 2014; male or female gender; and Black or non-

Black race) from the Medicare enrollment files. We match to each beneficiary several

characteristics of county of residence in 2014 that may affect MA-PD enrollment and opioid use,

including the following: the number of opioid prescriptions per person (from CDC) 3; the county

average risk score of Medicare beneficiaries (from CMS) 4; the median income, land area per

1000 residents, primary care physicians per 1000 residents, and percent of residents in poverty,

disabled, and on Medicaid (from AHRF) 5; and the percent of residents who were obese and

market of her zip code of residence including the Hirschman-Herfindahl index of

competitiveness; bed capacity; the density of for-profit and non-profit hospitals (comparison

category is public hospitals); the density of <100 and >300 bed hospitals (comparison category is

100-300 bed hospitals); and the density of hospitals that are integrated with their physicians,

teaching facilities, and members of a system. 7

        In most dimensions (i.e., the overall opioid prescription rate, the availability of primary

care physicians, the percentage of county residents who were disabled, obese, diabetic, or on

Medicaid), urban floor counties do not differ significantly in ways that would suggest that

Medicare beneficiaries who lived in them would be more or less likely to have an opioid

prescription. Although urban floor counties differ from others along some dimensions that

would suggest their residents would be more likely to have an opioid prescription (e.g., a higher

county average Medicare risk score, p = 0.048), they also differ in ways that would suggest their

residents would be less likely to have an opioid prescription (e.g., higher median income, p =

0.005, and lower poverty rates, p = 0.068). Not surprisingly, urban floor counties (which are, by

construction, in more populous MSAs) have less land area per person (p < 0.001), more

competitive hospital markets (p < 0.001), and more large, teaching hospitals (p = 0.002 and p =

0.034, respectively).

        Table 2 shows that the distribution of opioid prescriptions across prescribers is highly

skewed. To be in the top percentile of prescribers in 2014, a prescriber would have to have

written 217 opioid prescriptions to a 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries; if half of such

prescribers’ patients were Medicare beneficiaries (and their prescribing behavior was age-

invariant), that would imply that prescribers in the top percentile wrote at least 2,170 opioid

prescriptions in 2014 (= 217 * 5 * 2), or at least 8.3 opioid prescriptions per business day (=

2,170 / 260). These 1% of high prescribers accounted for 26.9 percent of all opioid prescriptions

written to Medicare beneficiaries. At the same time, the bottom half of prescribers in Medicare

wrote < 1 opioid prescription, or (under the same assumptions above) at most 10 opioid

prescriptions in 2014.

        Models. Our basic models are of the form

        Yizc     =       α + MAizcβ + Xizcγ + MKTzcδ + Wcη + εizc ,                                    (1)

where

i indexes beneficiaries, z indexes zip codes, c indexes counties;

Yizc    = 1 if i experiences an outcome, such as the receipt of an opioid prescription;

MAizc = 1 if i is enrolled in a MA-PD plan, =0 if enrolled in a PDP plan;

Xizc    is a vector of indicator variables capturing the age, gender, and race of i;

MKTzc is a vector of variables capturing the characteristics of i’s local health care market of i;

Wc      is a vector of variables capturing the socioeconomic and other characteristic of i’s county,

including the county's MSA's population in 2000 (on which its floor status is based, and in

selected models, its square) 8; and

εizc    is an error term that we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each county.

        We begin by estimating (1) by OLS. However, because enrollment in MA-PD is

optional, OLS estimates of β are potentially subject to selection bias. To the extent that

beneficiaries who choose an MA-PD plan are unobservably healthier, or subject to other

unmeasured factors that influence their propensity to receive an opioid prescription, conventional

 Although some regression discontinuity analyses in health economics research control for higher-order
polynominals of the forcing variable, we include only linear and quadratic terms as recommended by Gelman and
Imbens (2018). If we include a cubic term (results not reported), our results grow in magnitude.

                                                      11
estimates of the effect of MA-PD enrollment will represent a combination of the program’s true

causal impact and unmeasured differences in its patient population.

          We also present IV estimates of β, with the urban floor as an instrument. Thus the first

stage of our IV models are of the form

          MAizc =        α* + FLRcβ* + Xizcγ* + MKTzcδ* + Wcη* + ε*izc,                        (2)

where FLRc = 1 if county c is in a MSA with population greater than 250,000, = 0 otherwise.

The validity of our instrumental variables estimates depends on the assumption that residency in

an urban floor county is not correlated with unmeasured determinants of opioid prescribing for

Medicare beneficiaries. To make this assumption as plausible as possible, we limited our

analysis to beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of MSAs with populations between

100,000 and 400,000 (in order to make counties affected by our instrumental variable similar to

those that are not affected); controlled for other characteristics of counties that might be

correlated with MSA size and opioid use (as well as a linear and quadratic function of MSA

size); and conducted several robustness checks that we describe in detail below.



Results

          Table 3 presents estimates of β and β* (and selected elements of η and η* for comparison

purposes) from (1) and (2), where Yizc = 1 if beneficiary i filled at least one opioid prescription in

2014. Column (1) presents estimates of β* and η* from the first stage of our IV models.

Column (1) shows that the effect of the urban floor on MA enrollment from (2) – that is, holding

constant all of our individual, health care market, and county characteristics (including a

quadratic in MSA population) -- is slightly smaller than the raw effect (compare 11.9 percentage

points, Table 3, to 13.7 percentage points, Table 1), with the effect of the urban floor highly

significant (p < 0.001).

           Columns (2) and (3) present OLS and IV estimates, respectively, of β and η from (1).

According to OLS, enrollment in a MA-PD versus PDP plan leads to a 2.8 percentage point

decline in the likelihood of an opioid prescription. The IV estimate of 11.6 percentage points is

approximately four times larger than (but not statistically significantly different from) the OLS

estimate. 9 On a base likelihood of an opioid prescription of 31.3 percentage points, this amounts

to an effect of 9 (= 2.8 / 31.3) to 37 percent (= 11.6 / 31.3).

           The effect of MA on opioid use is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of living

in a socioeconomically-advantaged county. A one-standard-deviation decrease in the rates of

disability, obesity, and poverty in a county is associated with an approximately 4 percentage

point decrease in the opioid prescription rate (0.04 ≈ 0.430*0.043 + 0.350*0.031 + 0.227*0.044,

based on estimates of η from column (3) and standard deviations from Table 1b); this amounts to

between 35 (≈ 4 / 11.6, based on IV estimate) and 140 percent (≈ 4/ 2.8, based on OLS estimate)

of the effect of MA-PD enrollment.

           Columns (4) and (5) present OLS and IV estimates, respectively, of β and η from (2),

where Yizc = 1 if beneficiary i filled >7 days of opioid prescriptions in 2014, conditional on filling

leads to a 1.4 percentage point decline in the likelihood of more than a week of opioids,

conditional on any opioid; the IV effect is very small (< 0.1 percentage point) and statistically

insignificant. These effects are much smaller (at most 0.02 = 1.4 / 68.4) than the effect of

enrollment in a MA-PD plan on any opioid, indicating the impact of MA-PD enrollment is

largely on the extensive margin of opioid use.

    The 95 percent confidence interval around the IV estimate has a lower bound of -2.52 (= -11.592 – (1.96*4.629)).

         Table 4 replicates Table 3, but with Yizc = 1 if beneficiary i filled at least one opioid

prescription in 2014 from a high prescriber. Column (1) of Table 4 replicates column (1) from

Table 3; we report it for convenience, since the first stage of is invariant to the choice of Yizc.

According to the IV estimate in column (3), MA-PD enrollment reduces the likelihood of an

opioid from a high prescriber by 6.4 percentage points; this effect is extremely large, with a 95

percent confidence interval that includes the average likelihood of an opioid from a high

prescriber. The point estimate of β is around half as large as the point estimate of β from Table

3: the effect of MA-PD enrollment on the likelihood of an opioid from a high prescriber

accounts for approximately half of the effect of enrollment in a MA-PD plan on the likelihood of

any opioid. As was the case with the effect on the intensive margin of opioid use more

generally, the effect of MA-PD enrollment on the intensive margin of the use of opioids from

high prescribers is small and statistically insignificant.

         Table 5 presents results from four robustness checks. Columns (1) and (2) report

estimates from variants of (1) and (2) that exclude the quadratic term in the forcing variable; the

estimates are virtually unchanged. Columns (3) and (4) include a control for the county-average

opioid prescription rate. By construction, this variable is endogenous, as it contains the effect of

the urban floor through the floor’s effect on Medicare beneficiaries’ opioid prescriptions.

Nonetheless we report estimates from models that control for it to investigate the extent to which

omitted characteristics of counties that affect the demand for or supply of opioids more broadly

are correlated with the urban floor. 10 The results show this is not an important concern.

Although the effect of MA-PD enrollment declines slightly, it remains statistically significant

and economically important. Columns (5) and (6) report estimates from models based on

  Ideally, we would include a control for the county average opioid prescription rate to patients other than Medicare
beneficiaries, but this information is not available.

beneficiaries who live in the 92 counties with MSA population in a more narrow bandwidth

(200,000 – 300,000). Consistent with Figures 1 and 2, the estimated effect of MA-PD

enrollment on opioid use grows, although the 95 percent confidence intervals around the estimate

from the restricted sample of counties includes the estimate from the 100,000 – 400,000 sample.

Columns (7) and (8) restrict the sample to the 69% (= 370,529 / 536,481) of beneficiaries who

were opioid-naïve, defined as those without an opioid prescription in 2013. Estimates from this

restricted model show that MA-PD enrollment has a smaller effect on this larger population,

which implies that the effect of MA-PD enrollment is larger for prior opioid users.



Discussion

       Inappropriate use of opioids in Medicare Part D, and in the U.S. in general, is an

important social problem. Yet, except for two important case studies of the effect of individual

insurers’ policy changes on opioid prescribing in populations of commercially-insured enrollees,

there is no systematic evidence about the effectiveness of health plans’ efforts to address

inappropriate use of prescription opioids, and no evidence at all of the effectiveness of health

plans’ efforts to address inappropriate use in the Medicare program.

       The fact that the Part D program covers prescription drugs in two very different ways –

either through a stand-alone PDP that works as a supplement to traditional fee-for-service

Medicare, or through a MA-PD plan that is integrated with a (managed) Medicare Advantage

plan – creates a natural experiment for evaluating insurers’ efforts to reduce inappropriate opioid

prescription practices. However, because enrollment in a MA-PD plan is optional, conventional

regression estimates of the effect of MA-PD enrollment are potentially subject to selection bias.




                                                 15
        In this paper, we offer a new approach to evaluating the impact of enrollment in a MA-

PD plan on the likelihood of receiving an opioid prescription and the volume of opioids

prescribed. We use an instrumental variables approach that has been validated in several papers

to isolate the effect of MA-PD enrollment from the effects of unmeasured characteristics that

may simultaneously influence prescription opioid use and MA-PD enrollment.

        We report three key findings. First, based on our IV estimates, enrollment in a MA-PD

plan reduced the likelihood of filling an opioid prescription by 11.6 percentage points in 2014 (p

= 0.012) , amounting to a 37 percent reduction relative to the average likelihood of 31.3

percentage points. OLS estimates of the effect of MA-PD enrollment are around one-fourth as

large (2.8 percentage points), but within the 95 percent confidence interval around the IV

estimate. Second, slightly more than half of the 11.6-percentage-point reduction came from the

effect of MA-PD enrollment on beneficiaries’ likelihood of an opioid prescription from a high

prescriber, defined as a prescription from the top 1% of opioid prescribers. Third, for those

beneficiaries with an opioid prescription (or an opioid prescription from a high prescriber), MA-

PD enrollment does not have a statistically significant effect on the number of days’ supply of

opioids received, either from any prescriber or a high prescriber.

        Our approach has several limitations. Because our instrument operates at the county

level, our IV estimates represent a combination of the direct plus the spillover effects of MA-PD

enrollment. 11 Distinguishing the direct from the spillover effects would require an additional

instrument that operates at the individual level, an instrument that we do not have. Because there

are likely to be spillover effects from MA-PD to PDP plans (Baker 1997; Chernew, DeCicca,

and Town 2008), our estimates likely overstate the causal impact of moving an individual

11
  The direct effect is the reduction in opioid use obtained by PDP enrollees who switch to MA-PD; the spillover
effect is the reduction in opioid use obtained by PDP enrollees who stay in PDP, as a result of the switchers’
influence on the treatment of the stayers.

                                                        16
beneficiary from a PDP to a MA-PD plan. In addition, our estimates can only be interpreted as

causal for an individual PDP enrollee under the assumption that the local average treatment

effect estimated around the urban floor (with a likelihood of MA enrollment of around 37

percent) applies across the distribution of likelihoods of MA enrollment – an assumption that

may be incorrect. For these reasons, our estimates should be interpreted as the market-wide

effect of an incremental increase in the likelihood of MA enrollment near the current average.

       Because we did not examine the effect of MA-PD enrollment on measures of health

outcomes, we cannot say definitively that enrollment in MA-PD reduced only inappropriate

opioid use. However, two aspects of our results suggest that it did. First, the fact that previous

work found that MA-PD enrollees had higher prescription drug utilization overall means that the

reduction in opioid use in MA-PD was targeted rather than an artifact of a broader effort to

restrict access to treatment. Second, we found that the reduction in opioid use by MA-PD

enrollees was disproportionately due to a reduction in prescriptions from the top 1% of opioid

prescribers. Although the top 1% of prescribers accounted for approximately one-seventh of the

average beneficiary’s likelihood of an opioid prescription (≈ 4.2 percentage points / 31.3

percentage points, Table 1a), slightly more than half of the reduction in the opioid prescription

rate due to MA-PD enrollment overall came from the effect of MA-PD on beneficiaries’

likelihood of an opioid prescription from a high prescriber. We did not determine whether this

was due to exclusion of high prescribers from Medicare Advantage plans’ networks, other

aspects of benefit design that encourage patients to avoid high prescribers, or other changes in

treatment that reduce the need for opioids; this is a topic for future research.

       Our results support the conclusions of Starc and Town (2018) that integration of

prescription drug coverage with the other benefits provided by Medicare Advantage plans



                                                  17
improves the quality of care. The extent to which this occurs in commercial insurance coverage

for the non-elderly is another topic for future research.
