                                             ABSTRACT

Features of Part D gave rise to broad concern that the drug benefit would negatively impact prescription
utilization among the six million dual eligible beneficiaries, either during the transition from state
Medicaid to Part D coverage, or in the long-run. At the same time, Part D contained other features,
such as its auto-enrollment and premium subsidization policies, which were designed to safeguard
utilization for this vulnerable group. Using national retail pharmacy claims, we examine the experience
of dual eligibles during the first 18 months of Part D. We find no evidence that Part D adversely affected
pharmaceutical utilization or out-of-pocket expenditures in the transition period, or in the 18 months
subsequent to Part D implementation.

INTRODUCTION

The Part D drug benefit represents the single largest change to

Medicare in its 40 year history. Due to the size of the program—

the program enrolls over 25 million seniors and is expected to

cost over $700B in its first 10 years of implementation—

considerable attention has been paid to studying the effect of

the part D benefit on aggregate drug utilization among seniors,

seniors’ out-of-pocket expenditures, total federal expenditures

and revenues of drug manufacturers (1).


There are, however, important reasons to examine the effect of

the Part D drug benefit on specific subpopulations, especially

the more six million beneficiaries who were dually eligible for

Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles). With Part D

implementation, dual eligible beneficiaries faced new rules

governing their access to pharmaceuticals and were no longer

subject to the same protections found under Medicaid law (2).

Further, while dual eligibles pay no premium and face no

deductible under Part D, they may face slightly higher co-

payments for covered drugs, or full out-of-pocket cost of drugs

not included in their Part D plan formulary. Potential adverse

effects of instances of higher cost sharing are compounded by the

relatively low income and asset levels among dual beneficiaries,

and by random auto-enrollment of the vast majority of duals

beneficiaries into Part D plans whose formularies may not include

drugs demanded by specific individuals (3).
In addition, dual eligible beneficiaries have a higher incidence

of disabling and chronic illness and lower incomes and education

than the average Medicare population (4), making these

beneficiaries more vulnerable to coverage lapses due to the

administrative complexity associated with transitioning from

Medicaid to Part D.


Early data on dual eligibles’ access to prescription drugs

provided cause for concern. For example, in a telephone survey of

employed dual–eligibles in Kansas conducted in early 2006, 20% of

participants reported difficulties obtaining medications, 13%

were required to switch medications, and 8% stopped taking at

least 1 medication (5). In another study of a nationally random

sample survey of psychiatrists regarding their experiences with

prescription drug access among dual eligibles, more than one half

(53%) of physician respondents had at least one patient with a

medication access problem and more than one fifth (23%) of

physicians reported having discontinued or temporarily stopped a

patients’ medication because of prescription drug coverage or

management issues (6). Some of these problems may have been due

to system level difficulties (such as identifying the low-income

status of patients) in transition where the dual eligibles were

incorrectly charged, improperly asked to pay deductibles, or not

listed in plans they thought they were enrolled in.


These new rules and other challenges to implementing Part D were

widely anticipated and there was considerable apprehension
regarding the potential for disrupted access to prescription

drugs for the dual eligibles (7). In response, varying state

contingency plans were developed to help transition dual

eligibles into PDPs.   For example, during early 2006, 37 states

implemented temporary coverage programs to provide low-income

Medicare beneficiaries access to drugs through Medicaid (6).

Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

(CMS), required all Part D plans to have “transition plans,” for

example, to offer a one-time supply of drugs not included in the

formulary but which were previously consumed by new enrollees

(8). These programs may have played an important role in

mitigating any short-run difficulties faced by dual-eligibles

during their transition between Medicaid and Part D coverage.


To date, no empirical analyses have been performed to look at the

effect of Part D on the burden faced by dual eligibles in terms

of drug usage, out-of-pocket costs and total drug expenditures

(9). We attempt to fill this gap by using pharmacy claims from a

national pharmacy chain accounting for approximately 15% of the

outpatient prescription drug market in the United States.

Therefore, this study offers an opportunity to study the impact

of Part D on this vulnerable population based on a broad national

sample of Medicare beneficiaries.
METHODS

Data

We selected a 5% random sample of unique pharmacy customers who

filled at least one prescription both in the 2005 and the 2006

calendar years at any retail or mail order member of a national

pharmacy chain.   For each of these subjects, we obtained claims

data for every prescription filled between January 1, 2005 and

April 31, 2007.   We formed two groups – a ‘treatment’ group

comprising of dual-eligibles who were between 65- 78 year old on

January 1, 2005; and a ’control’ group comprising near-elderly

patients with Medicaid coverage between 60-63 year as of January

1, 2005(17). Importantly, these near-elderly control subjects

were not eligible for Medicare. For identification of Medicaid

subjects, we looked for the use at least one prescription that

was reimbursed by Medicaid during the entire pre-Part D period of

January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. Subjects identified as

covered by Medicaid and ages 65-78 as of January 1, 2005,

constituted our sample of dual eligibles.   Due to the infrequent

churning of the dual eligibles in and out of Medicaid (10), we

relied on a single Medicaid prescription to identify dual-

eligibles (11). Subjects in the control group were identified by

their having filled at least one prescription reimbursed by

Medicaid during both the pre- and post-Part D periods. In order

to ensure that we do not include non-elderly dual eligible

patients in the control group, we excluded patients in this age
range if any of their prescriptions were reimbursed by Medicare

during the entire study period (12).


For each prescription claim, we obtained data including subjects'

demographic characteristics (age, sex, language preference, zip

code of residence), insurance characteristics (prescription drug

plan, method of payment), pharmacy characteristics (zip code

location), prescription characteristics (National Drug Code

[NDC], therapeutic class, drug dose, number of treatment days,

date dispensed, number of refills), and expenditures (amount paid

out-of-pocket, amount paid by third party).   We used data on

subjects’ zip code of residence (i.e. the residence recorded at

subjects' first pharmacy claim in 2005) to link the pharmacy

claims data to data from the 2000 Census, including information

on the total population, median household income, income per

capita, fraction urban, fraction African American, unemployment

rate, and poverty rate within the zip code of residence.




Statistical analyses

We began with a simple exploration of how our data matched up to

national estimates on total number of prescriptions used, total

out-of-pocket payments and total prescription expenditures (13).

We then studied the effect of Medicare Part D on four

pharmaceutical outcomes using regression discontinuity designs:

(1) total number of prescriptions per month, (2) pill-day – a
prescription utilization measure similar to medication possession

ratio that counts the number of days with a pill summed across

all prescriptions, (3) monthly out-of-pocket costs, and (4) total

prescription expenditures (14). We excluded subjects age 80 and

over, since the proportion of subjects in nursing homes is higher

among subjects in this group and since changes in the Medicare

Modernization Act regarding nursing and long-term care subjects

do not extend to the majority of the Medicare population (15).


To estimate the impact of Part D, we estimate the break in trend

at the start of 2006 for each of the outcome variables among the

dually eligible sample. To interpret this trend break as the

impact of Part D, we control for secular trends in the outcome

variable unrelated to Part D. The most straightforward way to do

this is to estimate a difference-in-differences multivariate

regression: we estimate the break in trend among our Medicare

dual eligible subject sample (while controlling for

characteristics of each subject); we then adjust this impact by

the break in trend estimated among the near-elderly control

sample. The adjusted trend break provides an estimate of the

impact of Part D on dual eligible beneficiaries, having net out

secular trends in the outcome variable. Estimating trend breaks

is done using multivariate Generalized Estimating Equations

(GEE), which is commonly preferred over linear least squares when

estimating highly skewed medical expenditure and utilization

outcomes (cite?)(18).
In our fully specified model, we estimate the impact of Part D

during both the enrollment period and “stable” period after the

May 31, 2006, enrollment deadline; and allow for both the

intercept (break in trend) and the slope of outcome variable

trend lines to differ. Details about the specifications of these

models are given in the Appendix.


Note that for the near-elderly to be a good control for dual

eligible subjects, secular trends in their prescription drug

expenditures and utilization must be similar. We test whether

trends in outcomes among the 60-63 year old sample was similar to

our dual eligible sample group during the pre-Part D period

(January 2005 to December 2005).    To do so, test whether the

slope of the trend lines during the pre-Part D period differ

significantly. We expect there to be a difference in mean level

of each outcome variable between the two groups; however, the

difference in the outcome variables need to be constant over the

pre-Part D period in order for the near-elderly to suffice as a

good control.


Next, we examine medication adherence and discontinuation as some

of the heterogeneity in medication switches maybe masked in the

total utilization measures that we studied above. Using

multinomial regressions we estimated the probability of

continuing, discontinuing or initiating a medication with a

specific NDC-code between the pre-Part D period and the stable

Part D period (19). We studied the differential rate of
continuation between dual–eligibles and the control group. We

compared this profile in continuation probabilities between dual

eligibles and control group.


Finally, we use the same difference-in-difference strategy

discussed earlier to examine changes in the overall percentage of

generic prescription use between pre Part–D and stable post-Part

D period and contrasted them between the dual-eligibles and

control group patients with at least one prescription in the

stable post period.


Standard errors for all parameters were obtained via 1000

bootstrap replicates clustered by subjects, and a variety of

model fit criteria was used to check the goodness of fit for our

models (20).




RESULTS

Table 1 describes basic characteristics of our dual eligible (n =

10,837) and control cohorts (n = 3,199).   Dual eligibles were

older and fewer preferred English as their primary language, but

were otherwise comparable to the control group of patients.

Despite being younger, our control group had greater average

annual drug utilization and expenditures, which may reflect both

the severity of health conditions for elderly Medicaid patients

about to enter Medicare as well as the most death of the most
severely ill patient before reaching older ages (mortality

effects).   Unadjusted changes between pre and post Part D periods

were not significant for any of the drug utilization measures for

either the control or the dual-eligible group.




Trends in expenditures and utilization

Figure 1a shows the trends in average monthly out-of-pocket

expenditures for dual eligibles and the control group of near-

elderly subjects ages 60-63.   Expenditures for the two groups

tracked each other closely in the pre-Part D period, suggesting

that the near-elderly suffices as a comparison group. Trends in

expenditures continue to track each other closely in the post

Part D period (21). Immediately following the implementation of

Part D, expenditures for both groups continue to decrease during

the transition period and then leveled off.




Figure 1b compares the trend in actual observed expenditures to

the trend in predicted expenditures assuming Part D was never

implemented (this is a “counterfactual” trend calculated using

parameter estimates from the GEE regression analysis) (16). There

were no significant changes in trends in the dual-eligibles’ out-

of-pocket expenditures due to Part-D. Similar results were found

for total monthly expenditures (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)); pill-days

(Figures 2(a) and 2(b)); and total number of prescriptions

(Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). The formal results are summarized in
Table 2. Although slightly higher levels of changes were found

for each of the outcomes in the transition period than the stable

period, these changes were neither meaningfully large in

magnitude or nor statistically different from zero.




Probability of starting, stopping, or continuing medication

Next, we studied the probability of continuing, discontinuing or

initiating a new medication between pre Part D and the stable

phase of post Part-D.   We find that among all medications for

which at least one prescription was filled in either of the two

periods, dual eligibles filled a prescription for 17.5% of the

medications in both the pre and post periods (continuation),

filled a prescription in the pre period but not in the post

period for 42.5% of the medications (discontinuation), and filled

a prescription in the post period but not in the pre periods for

40% of the medication (initiation) (Table 3). These proportions

were almost identical for the control group patients implying

that Part D did not meaningfully impact patterns of prescription

usage among dual eligibles.


Focusing on only those medications that were used in the pre-Part

D period, we found that the probability of filling a prescription

for the same medication following Part D increased with the

number of prescriptions filled in the pre period among both

beneficiaries and control subjects. This supports the fact that

patients who use a medication in a chronic manner are more likely
to continue to use it over time. However, as before, we did not

find any difference in the probability of continuation between

dual eligibles and the control group at any level of pre-period

usage (Figure 3).


Finally we studied the proportion of generic prescriptions used

between the pre- and the post-Part D period.   We find that

compared to the pre-period, dual eligibles were 4.8% more likely

to use generic prescriptions in the post–period (Table 3).

However, we see a similar change in the control group and

suggested that this change was not due to Part D.


DISCUSSION

In this analysis of a diverse sample of dual eligibles accounting

for a substantial portion of the overall U.S. market of

prescription drugs, we found that Part D did not adversely impact

either prescription utilization or expenditures among

beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.      In

addition, our results suggest that other aspects of dual

eligibles’ prescription utilization, such as the initiation of

new therapies and the rates of generic drug utilization, also

were not adversely impacted by Part D.



Despite designing Part D benefits for dual eligibles to protect

this vulnerable population against the lack of continuity of

necessary drugs, several concerns regarding its implementation

and its promise of seamless access to drugs were raised at the
time of transition.   Our findings of no adverse impact of Part D

on dual eligibles both in the short-run and the in the long–run

post part-D implementation are important to mitigate these

concerns and also to highlight the joint role of federal and

state policy-makers who devoted substantial efforts to ensuring

that the transition to Part D would not lead to unintended

consequences among this group. Perhaps, the most important of

these efforts were the rapid steps taken by several state

governments in allocating additional funds to cover drugs for

dual eligibles during the first three months of Part D

implementation, during which pharmacies, patients and providers

figured out the nuances of the disintegrated system of PDPs and

the varying formularies that accompanied them.



One interesting implication of our study results is that since

the total reimbursed amount for prescriptions and also the total

number of prescriptions and pill-days were not found to be

affected by Part-D, it may indirectly imply that prices may not

have been affected due to this transition. This is in line with

the Congressional Budget Office’s anticipation of the price

effects of Part D (23).



Although our data are not nationally representative and may not

characterize the experience of all dual eligibles, the data offer

an important opportunity to examine the impact of this marked

change in prescription coverage for millions of Americans.
Furthermore, in prior analyses, our subjects were found to be

similar to a nationally representative sample, and estimates of

the overall impact of Part D on prescription utilization were

highly consistent with those predicted by economic theory (23).

However, the experiences for the dual eligible patients that we

find in our study may also be attributed to resources allocated

by this pharmacy chain which may not be representative of the

national experiences of all dual eligibles.



One limitation of our study is that we assume that the absence of

a prescription claim for an individual subject represents zero

utilization for that subject, rather than missing data.     However,

individuals may obtain their prescriptions from more than one

pharmacy chain, and thus it is possible that subjects observed

here obtained only part of their medicines from this chain alone.

Although loyalty to one pharmacy chain would not threaten our

conclusions (due to our use of a similarly defined control

group), any correlation between loyalty and Part D enrollment

would influence findings drawn from this serial cross-sectional

analysis.   However, our analysis of a sub-sample of subjects for

whom we have complete prescription benefits manager (PBM) data

suggested that similar large proportions of subjects of each age

group (>90%) filled all of their prescriptions within the

pharmacy chain in both 2005 and 2006, and we applied inclusion

criteria requiring subjects to have at least one prescription

claim during both 2005 and 2006.
Conclusions

Part D represents a policy change of enormous proportions.    Any

undertaking as complex as this is bound to face challenges, and

particularly during the transition period during the first few

months of the benefit there was considerable concern about the

impact of the transition on dual eligibles.   Many of these

challenges were anticipated, and efforts by numerous stakeholders

were made to address those that weren’t anticipated.   Our report

suggests that dual eligible patients’ prescription utilization

and expenditures have neither increased nor decreased due to Part

D.

2. For example, some dual eligibles faced changes in cost sharing as
   many of the prevailing Medicaid plans did not charge copayments
   for drugs, while under Part D, dual eligibles face fixed
   copayments for generic and brand therapies. Moreover, dual
   eligible individuals also faced new or more stringent formularies
   and formulary management tools enforced by the privately-
   administered prescription drug plans (PDPs). In theory, choice
   among PDPs available within a Medicare region would allow dual
   eligibles to select the plan with the formulary that best matches
   their needs. However, duals’ who failed to exercise such
   selection were randomly enrolled into a standard PDP which may
   have negatively impacted prescription utilization and cost-
   sharing relative to pre-existing Medicaid coverage; see Crowley

11.In fact, using the Panel 9 of the Medical Expenditure Survey data
   we estimated that in this age-group, 85% remained continuously
   eligible for Medicaid between 2004 and 2005.
12.Again using the Panel 9 of the Medical Expenditure Survey data we
   estimated that in the 60-63 years age-group, 88% remained
   continuously eligible for Medicaid between 2004 and 2005.
13.Even though our data are not nationally representative, we wanted
   to ensure that we do not have an atypical group of dual-eligibles
   or the control group. Therefore, we compared descriptive
   statistics on the utilization measures for our data with MEPS
   subjects aged 60-63 and 65-78 years old in 2005 and who were
   continuously Medicaid eligible or dual-eligible respectively
   during 2004 and 2005.
14.Each subject in our sample contributed 28 observations
   corresponding to 28 months of data. We divided the 28 months into
   three periods. The first period, January 2005 to December 2005,
   represented the “pre-Part D” period. The second period, January
   2006 to May 2006, represented months during which various state-
   level and federal-level temporary measures installed to
   facilitate transition are believed to have influenced utilization
   and is referred to as the “transition post-Part D” period. The
   third period, June 2006 to April 2007, represented months
   following this initial transition period and is called the
   “stable post Part D period”.

16.To estimate counterfactual trends, we used the contemporaneous
   time-profile of the corresponding outcomes in a control group of
   Medicaid–eligible subjects aged 60-63 years. We first confirmed
   that the trends in outcomes in the 60-63 year old cohort provided
   an adequate control for the subjects in our elderly dual-eligible
   group during the pre Part-D era (September 2004 to December
   2005). To do so, we examined both the statistical significance
   and the substantive relevance of the coefficients in our
   regression model that represented the differential trends between
   the dual-eligible and the control group during the pre Part-D
   era. We then used the predicted control trends in the post Part-D
   era to represent the outcomes in the dual-eligible group had
   there been no Part-D policy in place.
17. The precise age cut-off for the control group was 62 years and 8
   months as of January 1, 2005 so that they do not become eligible
   for Medicare at the end of our analysis period. Also we exclude
   64 and 65 year olds as of January 1, 2006 since they had partial
   year Medicare eligibility and would transition into the dual-
   eligible status in the middle of our time-frame of analysis.
18.These trends were estimated and predictions were generated using
   generalized estimating equations (GEE). We adjusted for subject
   demographics (gender, English-speaking status, Medicaid coverage,
   and age), zip-code level characteristics (total population,
   median household income, per-capita income, urbanicity,
   proportion black, unemployment rate and poverty), fixed effects
   for calendar months (January – December), periods (pre Part D,
   transition post Part D, and stable post Part D), and the
   treatment group. Moreover, we explored a variety of splines for
   representing differential time trends between periods, ultimately
   using cubic splines because they produced the best fit for both
   the pre Part D and the stable post Part D periods. A linear
   spline was used for the transition post Part D period due to the
   short time interval in this period. We added up to three-way
   interactions between the period and treatment group fixed effects
   and the splines over time. We assessed overall model fit using a
   variety of goodness of test criteria. We used a gamma
   distribution for modeling out-of-pocket expenditures and negative
   binomial distributions for modeling pill-days and number of
   prescriptions. All estimators employed log-link models.
   Additionally, we explored the correlation structure between
   monthly observations within subjects and finally employed a
   first-order auto-regressive correlation structure for out-of-
   pocket costs and number of prescriptions and an unstructured
   correlation matrix for pill-days.
19.The average probabilities per person for continuing,
   discontinuing or initiating a medication were compared between
   the dual eligible group and the control group. In an adjoining
   analysis, we restricted our analysis to only those NDC codes that
   were filled in the pre-Part D period. Using logistic regression,
   we estimated the probabilities of continuation as a function of
   the number of prescription filled in the pre Part D period.
   Higher number of prescriptions filled in the pre-period indicates
   a chronic use of that medication that patients should be more
   likely to continue in the next period.
20.Model fit criteria to check the goodness of fit for our models
   included the Pearson correlation test between residuals and
   predicted values, Hosmer Lemeshow test examining systematic
   biases in predictions across deciles of the corresponding linear
   predictors, and Pregibon Link Test examining residual non-
   linearity in outcomes with respect to covariates. Although all of
   these test were statistically significant for both the outcomes,
   none showed any substantive bias in predictions. For example the
   Pearson correlations coefficient for out-of-pocket costs and
   pill-days were -0.009 and 0.004 respectively and yet they were
   statistically significant (p-values < 0.001 for both). The
   overall model fits are illustrated in Figures 1 (a), (c) and 2
   (a), (c) and appear to track the trends in observed outcome well.
   All analyses were performed with Stata version 9.2 (Stata Corp.,
   College Station, TX).
21.In fact, the joint test of the three coefficients that represent
   the interactions of the cubic monthly splines with the dual-
   eligible group and the pre-part-D era (Appendix) was not
   significant (p-value= 0.11).

Step 1: Examine estimates of β4, β5 and β6. They represent the
changes in the cubic trend between the treatment and control group
during the pre-Part D period. Perform joint test to see if
statistically significant. Even if significant (which may be a
manifestation of sample size), examine the values to infer whether
the trends are substantively different between the treatment and
control groups. If they are not different, then we proceed to form
counterfactual using the control trends in the post Part D period.



Step 2: Predict factual and counterfactual trends:

2.a. Predict Factual trend for the Ramp-up post Part D period:

Ê {Y| XTrt, MRU} = exp( β̂ 0 + β̂ 4 + β̂8 +      β̂ 9 *M + β̂10 + β̂11 *M   + γ̂ T*X),

where only M in the Ramp-up post Part D period and X’s for the
treatment group are used.

2.b. Predict Counterfactual trend for the Ramp-up post Part D
period:

Ê {Y| XTrt, MRU} = exp( β̂ 0 + β̂ 4 + β̂8 +      β̂ 9 *M   + γ̂ T*X),

where only M in the Ramp-up post Part D period and X’s for the
treatment group are used.

2.c. Difference between these factual and counterfactual
estimates averaged over the M in the               Ramp-up post Part D period
and X’s in the treatment group provides as estimate of the policy
effect for the Ramp-up post Part D period.



2.d. Predict Factual trend for the Stable post Part D period:

Ê {Y| XTrt, MSTB} = exp( β̂ 0 + β̂ 4 + β̂12 +      β̂13 *M + β̂14 *M2 + β̂15 *M3 + β̂16

+ β̂17 *M + β̂18 *M2   + β̂19 *M3 + γ̂ T*X),

where only M in the Stable post Part D period and X’s for the
treatment group are used.

2.e. Predict Counterfactual trend for the Stable post Part D
period:

Ê {Y | XTrt, MSTB} = exp( β̂ 0 + β̂ 4 + β̂12 +      β̂13 *M + β̂14 *M2 + β̂15 *M3 +
γ̂ T*X),
where only M in the Stable post Part D period and X’s for the
treatment group are used.

2.f. Difference between these factual and counterfactual
estimates averaged over the M in the Stable post Part D period
and X’s in the treatment group provides as estimate of the policy
effect for the Stable post Part D period.
