                                         ABSTRACT

Productivity growth in the United States was considerably faster during 2000-2003 than in the boom
years of 1995-2000. This ebullient productivity performance raises numerous questions about its
interpretation and its implications for the future, and these are stated here in the form of five puzzles.

(1) Whatever happened to the cyclical effect? Skeptics were justified on the basis of data through
the end of 1999 in their claim that part of the post-1995 productivity growth revival reflected the
normal cyclical correlation between productivity and output growth. In contrast data through mid-
2003 reveal only a negligible cyclical effect for 1995-99 but rather a temporary bubble in 2002-03.
(2) Why did productivity growth accelerate after 2000 when the ICT investment boom was
collapsing? The most persuasive argument points to unusually savage corporate cost-cutting and
hidden intangible investments in the late 1990s that provided productivity benefits after 2000.

(3) The steady decline in the price of computer power implies steady technical progress, but then
why did computers produce so little productivity growth before 1995 and so much afterwards? We
draw an analogy to electricity, where miniaturization was the key step in making small electric
motors practicable, and the internal combustion engine, where complementary investments,
especially roads, were necessary to reap benefits. (4) What does the collapse of the investment boom
imply about the future of innovation? First-rate inventions in the 1990s, notably the web and user-
friendly business productivity software, are being followed by second-rate inventions in the current
decade. (5) Finally, why did productivity growth slow down in Europe but accelerate in the U. S.?
A consensus is emerging that U. S. institutions foster creative destruction and financial markets that
welcome innovation, while Europe remains under the control of corporatist institutions that dampen
competition and inhibit new entry. Further, Europe lacks a youth culture like that of the U. S. which
fosters independence: U. S. teenagers work after school and college students must work to pay for
much of their educational expense. There is a chasm of values across the Atlantic.

Introduction

       Understanding the interplay between innovation, technology, and productivity growth

is the foundation for projecting the future economic growth rate of a country, a region, or the

world. Because the United States has been at the frontier of productivity and living standards

for at least the past century, it is understandable that so much of the productivity literature is U.

S.-centric. Studies tend to divide the issues into those that involve accelerations and slowdowns

in the rate of productivity growth in the United States, i.e., ʺat the frontier,ʺ and those that

involve catching up and falling behind of other countries or regions relative to the United

States. U. S.-centricity obviously overstates the role of the United States as a leader and

innovator. There is plenty of innovation in the rest of the world, and U. S. manufacturers have

been battered by losses of market share to higher quality and more innovative products from

Japan, Europe, and elsewhere, especially in such industries as automobiles and machine tools.

Further, the absolute level of productivity in several European countries now exceeds that of the

U. S.1 Nevertheless, this paper follows the U. S.-centric mold by placing disproportionate

emphasis on U. S. developments and debates about their causes. Attention to Europe is

secondary, mainly limited to the last section of the paper.

       Almost four years after the end of the boom in the U. S. stock market and in Information

and Communication Technology (ICT) investment, initial certainties about the causes of the

post-1995 U. S. productivity growth revival are unraveling and puzzles deepen regarding not

only its causes but also its durability. For numerous policy issues in the U. S. and other

countries, long-term forecasts not just of productivity growth but of GDP growth are essential.

For instance, long-run projections of government budget deficits and exhaustion dates for

entitlement funds like U. S. Social Security depend heavily on projected growth rates of

productivity and the population into the far future. Over a shorter horizon of one to two

decades, growth forecasts are essential to inform government policy and corporate investment

decisions and to predict the evolution of world trade, saving, and investment. As of early 2004,

the U. S. productivity growth revival has lasted for more than eight years, and as it persists, it

deserves an increasing weight relative to the dismal 1972-95 period of slow growth when

making forecasts out into the distant future.

The Five Puzzles

       It is difficult to understate the extent to which the recent behavior of U. S. productivity

growth has surprised laymen and experts alike. Instead of fading after the economyʹs peak in

mid-2000, U. S. nonfarm business productivity growth has actually accelerated from a 2.45

percent annual rate during 1995-2000 to a stunning 3.51 percent annual growth rate in the 14

quarters between 2000:Q2 and 2003:Q4. As U. S. productivity performance has become even

stronger over the past three years, (at least) five puzzles have emerged regarding the revival, its

causes, and the performance of the U. S. relative to the rest of the world.

       1. Whatever happened to the cyclical effect? Is there any remaining support for the

view that part of the post-1995 U. S. productivity revival contains a cyclical component, as I

argued beginning in 1999 (Gordon, 2000)? In retrospect, was the initial decomposition of the



                                                 2
                                                                             Five Puzzles, Page 3



revival as of 2000 between cyclical and trend elements justified, based on data available at that

time? Can the early-recovery upsurge in productivity growth between late 2001 and mid-2003

be interpreted as a temporary phenomenon, as were temporary early-recovery upsurges in

1975-76, 1982-83, and 1991-92?

       2. If the role of ICT investment has been exaggerated, what else caused the revival?

U. S. productivity grew even more rapidly after the mid-2000 peak in ICT investment and the

stock market than in 1995-2000 when ICT investment was strong. Yet the first round of

academic research on the revival (Jorgenson-Stiroh 2000, Oliner-Sichel 2000) attributed most of

the revival to the post-1995 explosion of ICT investment. Faster growth in ICT investment

translated directly into a productivity benefit coming from the production of ICT hardware, and

in addition a second, larger component came from the use of ICT capital across the economy,

particularly in ICT-intensive industries. The continuation of relatively rapid productivity

growth after the mid-2000 collapse of the ICT investment boom is puzzling and raises the

question as to whether previous research attributed too large a causal role to ICT investment

and, if so, what other factors could have contributed to the revival and its post-2000

continuation?

       3. After fifty years of computers, what aspects of innovation caused productivity

growth to take off? In previous writing (Gordon, 2000), I have argued that sustained rapid

growth of U. S. productivity between World War I and the mid-1960s was propelled by a set of



                                                3
                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 4



ʺGreat Inventionsʺ at the end of the nineteenth century, of which the most important were

electricity and the internal combustion engine. Simply inventing the computer did not deliver a

similarly long and sustained era of rapid productivity growth; almost half of the fifty years

since the first commercial application of the computer in 1954 experienced slow producitivity

growth in the U. S. What were the key innovations that produced the post-1995 productivity

revival in the U. S.? Have those key innovations already occurred, or can we expect a

continuous pace of innovation over the several decades equal in importance to the late 1990s?

       4. Does the slump in ICT investment tell us anything about the pace of innovation, or

does a continuous pace of innovation suggest that ICT investment will soon return to the

heady boom of the late 1990s? Like any magnitude in economics, the behavior of ICT

investment can be summarized by changes in forces influencing supply and demand. The

demand side depends on the steady arrival of innovations that create profitable investment

opportunities. Without innovation, investment would have stopped centuries ago, as it would

have involved ʺpiling wooden ploughs on top of wooden ploughsʺ (Domar, 1961, p. 712). If

innovation is the fundamental driver of the demand for investment, what does the rise and fall

of ICT investment since 1995 tell us about the pace of innovation over the past decade, and

what are the implications for the next decade?

       5. Why has Europe failed to experience a productivity growth revival? Early

interpreters of the post-1995 U. S. productivity growth revival immediately noted that,



                                                 4
                                                                             Five Puzzles, Page 5



compared to the period 1990-95, Europe did not match the U. S. productivity growth

acceleration but rather exhibited a growth slowdown. European productivity growth has

remained slow in the years after 2000, while the U. S. has experienced yet another upsurge.

Thus the puzzle deepens as to why Europe continues to slip behind, especially since Europeans

use the same types of ICT hardware and software as in the U. S. This puzzle reinforces Puzzle

#2, suggesting that there is some other source of U. S. advantage, but why should this have

emerged only after 1995?

Plan of the Paper

       The paper begins with Puzzle #1, discussing the cyclical behavior of productivity and

the evolution of statistical trends estimated for U. S. productivity growth. Todayʹs view of the

underlying productivity growth trend in the 1995-1999 era is much more optimistic than from

the vantage point of the year 2000, and this helps to explain why I could argue back then that a

significant component of the post-1995 revival was ʺcyclical,ʺ whereas todayʹs more optimistic

trend for that period does not support a cyclical interpretation. Moreover, there remains a

cyclical element in post-2000 productivity behavior, in the sense that in previous recoveries, an

early recovery productivity growth ʺbubbleʺ has been followed by below-trend growth during

the subsequent two years, and there are reasons to suspect that ebullient U. S. productivity

growth in 2002-03 could be followed by more modest (but still respectable gains) in 2004-05.

       The treatment of Puzzle #2 also centers on data for the U. S., in this case the evolution



                                                5
                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 6



over time of studies of the sources of the post-1995 productivity growth revival. How do such

studies explain the continuation and acceleration of the productivity revival from the

perspective of the post-2000 crash in ICT investment? Did such studies overstate the role of ICT

investment in achieving the 1995-99 portion of the revival?

       Examining Puzzle #3, we provide an overview of several major innovations that were

important for productivity gains, including the ʺGreat Inventionsʺ of the late nineteenth

century, their subsidiary and supplementary offshoots in the first half of the twentieth century,

the initial impact of electronic computers, and finally the key aspects of the post-1995 ʺNew

Economy.ʺ Our key question is why the initial impact of computers on productivity growth

petered out after 1970, and why an apparently continuous stream of innovations finally brought

a productivity reward only after 1995.

       Our treatment of Puzzle #4 argues that traditional decompositions of the sources of

growth overstate the role of the quantity and quality of capital, and of improvements in the

quality of labor, and understate the role of innovation in the process of economic growth.

Innovation is necessary but not sufficient for investment to occur, and accelerations and

decelerations of investment can be signals of changes in the pace of innovation.

       Finally, Puzzle #5 leads us to examine the contrast in productivity behavior between the

U. S. and Europe over various sub-intervals since 1990. Why did productivity growth slow

down in Europe but accelerate in the U. S.?2 To look for an answer, we provide an informal

survey of explanations for the failure of Europe to join the U. S. in its productivity revival. We

sift through a litany of complaints about European structural rigidity and overregulation in a

search for convincing explanations of the differences. The final section summarizes and

interrelates our proposed solutions to the five puzzles.



Puzzle #1: Whatever Happened to the Cyclical Effect?

         Over the past five decades the growth rate of productivity in the U. S. has been highly

volatile. Displayed in Figure 1 is the four-quarter rate of change of nonfarm private business

productivity, displayed as the jagged black line. Despite the appearance of random zig-zags,

we can pick out a few patterns in the behavior of the black line if we know the chronology of U.

S. growth and business cycles.

Decomposing Cycle and Trend

         The growth of productivity is not uniformly high in economic expansions and low in

recessions. Instead, it tends to be relatively low in the last stages of an expansion, as firms

optimistically hire too many workers just when the economyʹs growth is slowing. This ʺend-of-

expansionʺ phenomenon was first identified in Gordon (1979) and then reaffirmed in

subsequent data (Gordon 1993, 2003b). Examples go back to the 1950s and include 1968-69,




          2. This acceleration has been made much stronger over the 2000-03 period by recent revisions to the
U. S. data that are not yet reflected in most academic and journalistic comparisons across countries.

                                                          7
                                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 8



1973-74, 1978-80, and 1988-90. Periods of most rapid growth are in the quarters immediately

following the business cycle trough, when output begins to grow but firms are still cutting costs

and laying off workers. Examples of early-recovery productivity ʺbubblesʺ include 1975-76,

1982-83, and 1991-92. In these three cases there was a sharp slowdown in productivity growth

after an initial four to six quarters of the ʺbubble.ʺ

         To interpret productivity behavior since 1995, we add to the black line in Figure 1 two

different trends for the rate of change, using the methodology of the Hodrick-Prescott (H-P)

filter.3 The extent of the post-1995 revival in trend differs, depending on how much data the H-

P filter is allowed to ʺseeʺ. The solid smooth line is allowed to see data only through the end of

1999:Q4; it moves upward beginning in 1994 to reflect the sharp increase after 1995 in the

average growth rate, but as of 1999:Q4 had increased only from 1.66 to 1.89 percent per annum.

Allowing the trend estimation to be exposed to the full set of data through 2003:Q4 yields a

much more rapid acceleration of the trend as far back as 1995. Clearly, the verdict on whether

any of the post-1995 acceleration represented a cyclical effect depends on when that assessment

was made and what data were available at the time. Both trend lines are identical prior to 1994

and agree that the productivity growth trend reached its maximum point in the early 1960s and

then slowed to a trough of only around 1.0 percent per year in 1980, followed by a two-step




          3. We use an H-P parameter of 6400 in preference to the standard 1600, which in our view causes
trends to be too volatile and to adhere too closely to the actual values. Further discussion of detrending
issues, and a comparison of the H-P and Kalman filters, is contained in Gordon (2003b, pp. 216-26).

                                                          8
                                                                                               Five Puzzles, Page 9



revival, the first between 1980 and 1985, and the second after 1995.

         Table 1 provides specific numbers for the actual and trend growth rates over alternative

intervals. Between the 1950-72 and 1972-95 periods, the actual growth rate slowed from 2.60 to

1.53 percent per annum.4 Stopping the clock at 1999:Q4, the actual growth rate for 1995:Q4-

1999:Q4 had accelerated to 2.35 percent and the trend estimated at that point had accelerated to

1.81 percent, leaving a cyclical effect of 0.54 percent. The same exercise carried out by Gordon

(2000, reproduced in the bottom line of Table 1) yielded somewhat higher numbers for actual

and trend (because the data for that period have been revised downward since his paper was

written) but almost exactly the same estimate of the cyclical effect, 0.50 percent.5

         When the trend estimator is allowed to take into account all the data through 2003:Q4,

the story changes substantially. Now the 1995-99 trend growth rate is 2.08 percent, not 1.81

percent, and the cyclical effect is down to 0.27 points. Further, the average actual growth rate

after 1999 is up to 3.50 percent, of which 2.87 is estimated to represent trend growth and a

remaining 0.63 represents a renewed cyclical effect.

Interpreting the Productivity Growth ʺBubblesʺ

         In view of the volatile zig-zags of productivity growth evident over the postwar history




         4. All the numbers in Table 1 are based on BLS data as of March, 2004, and reflect the revisions to
the national accounts and hours data introduced in August and December, 2003.

         5. Gordon (2000) estimated the trend by an alternative technique that had been used in Gordon
(1993), which was to find the 1995-99 productivity trend that provided the best fit in a regression of changes
in detrended hours on changes in detrended output, allowing for lags in both hours and output..

                                                            9
                                                                              Five Puzzles, Page 10



displayed in Figure 1, how much of the robust post-1999 behavior is likely to persist? The HP

trend had reached 3.04 percent by late 2003 -- will it level off, accelerate further, or decelerate as

happened after the peak of slightly above 3.00 percent was reached in 1964? One way to

examine this question is to liken the peak growth in 2002-03 to three earlier ʺbubbleʺ periods in

the first few quarters of recoveries from recession troughs, namely 1975-76, 1982-83, and 1991-

92.

       We can use the regression specification developed in Gordon (1993, 2003b) to divide up

productivity growth into three components, (1) a portion explained by the lag of hours

adjustment behind output changes, (2) the ʺend-of-expansionʺ (EOE) mechanism, and (3) an

unexplained residual. The decomposition is shown in Table 2. In the 1975-76 episode the sharp

downward and upward zigzag of output followed by hours in that sharp recession explained

about half of the temporary spike of productivity growth, and the EOE more than explains the

rest. In 1982-83 most of the explanation is carried by the EOE effect, with only a small

contribution of lagged adjustment. In the two mild recessions of 1990-91 and 2001 there was

only a mild drop in output, and so lagged adjustment explains nothing, the EOE explanation is

partial, and particularly in 2001-2002 most the bubble remains unexplained.

       For our purposes in trying to guesstimate what the productivity trend will look like in

the future, an important precedent is that over the eight quarters following the bubble,

productivity growth was slower than trend by an average of -0.27 percentage points over the



                                                  10
                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 11



three previous episodes, and the deceleration from the four-quarter bubble period to the eight-

quarter post-bubble period was an average of -3.07 percentage points. Applying this average

reaction to the current period would imply that actual productivity growth between 2002:Q4

and 2004:Q4 would fall 0.27 points short of its 3.04 percent trend, averaging 2.77 percent over

this interval. However, the first five quarters of this interval have already occurred and the

average annual growth rate so far is not 2.77 percent but rather 4.62 percent, much faster than

the prediction based on past post-bubble episodes and also much faster than the trend

estimated for late 2003.

       The extraordinary explosion of productivity growth in 2002-03 goes far beyond any

precedent based on normal cyclical behavior. Below we discuss two possible explanations, the

role of unmeasured intangible capital, and the unusual trajectory of profits and the stock market

which led to savage cost-cutting in the years after mid-2000. The counterpart of the

productivity growth explosion is a ʺjobless recoveryʺ much more extreme than in 1991-92; this

has become a central issue in the U. S. Presidential election campaign of 2004.

       Our verdict on Puzzle #1 is that, based on data in late 1999, skeptics were correct to

attribute part of the post-1995 productivity growth acceleration to a temporary cyclical effect.

But the data that emerged in 2000-03 provide a much more optimistic measure of the

acceleration in the growth trend and suggest that little of the late 1990s upsurge was cyclical.

However, based on data up to the end of 2003, it appears that a substantial part of explosive



                                                11
                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 12



productivity growth of 2002-03 is unsustainable, even though the trend itself has accelerated to

slightly above 3 percent, thus matching the previous postwar peak reached in 1964. In 2002-03,

the ʺearly recovery productivity bubbleʺ lasted substantially longer than in previous early

recovery episodes, and the counterpart of a ʺjobless recoveryʺ also lasted longer. The U. S.

economy is on track to achieving a rate of productivity growth over the decade 1995-2005 of

almost three percent per year, raising deep questions about why this has occurred and why

these causes have not been equally relevant in Europe. .Below we return to the explanation of

this unusual productivity cycle.



Puzzle #2: If the Role of ICT Investment has been Exaggerated, What Else
Caused the Revival?

         As we have seen, productivity growth was substantially more rapid after mid-2000

than during the initial revival period of 1995-2000. However, the most prominent studies by

Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000) and Oliner and Sichel (2000) attributed a large fraction of the

revival to the production and use of ICT equipment and software. In the case of Oliner and

Sichel, the analysis included not only ICT capital, including software, but also the

semiconductors that powered the hardware. This leads us to Puzzle #2, the fact that

productivity growth proceeded to a second stage of acceleration during 2000-2003 just as the

ICT investment boom collapsed.

changes become increasingly more misleading as time extends past the base year in the national

income accounts, currently 1996 in the U. S. To avoid potential errors of interpretation, the

correct measure of the importance of ICT investment is the nominal share of that particular type

of investment in nominal GDP. For computer hardware itself, that share averaged 0.96 percent

in 1997-2000 but then crashed to 0.71 percent in 2002 and by 2003:Q2 had recovered only to 0.77

percent. A more comprehensive measure that includes not just computer hardware but also

software and ʺotherʺ (mainly communications) equipment registered an average GDP share of

4.23 percent in 1997-2000, reaching 4.55 percent in the year 2000, and then fell to 3.83 percent in

2002 before recovering to 3.94 percent in 2003:Q2.

The Oliner-Sichel Decomposition

       The most influential research supporting a large role for ICT investment in the post-1995

productivity growth revival appears in a series of papers by Stephen Oliner and Daniel Sichel,

hereafter O-S (2000, 2002). Their approach, presented in Table 3, has attracted wide attention

because of the clarity with which they distinguish between the role of capital deepening of ICT

capital (line 3), that is, the benefits of rapid ICT investment to the users of ICT capital, from the

separate role of the production of ICT capital in raising the growth rate of multifactor

productivity for the economy as a whole (line 10). It is easy to follow the evolution of the O-S

results as new data emerge, because they are always presented in the same format, and because

the same initial time period (growth rates from 1973 to 1995) is compared with the revival



                                                  13

period of 1995 to the latest year for which data are available.

         Table 3 compares the initial O-S (2000) decomposition with their latest unpublished

results which extend the findings to an end-date of 2002.6 The table displays the growth rate of

labor productivity in line 1 and then in lines 2 and 8 subtracts the contributions of capital

deepening and improvements in labor quality (i.e., education) to arrive at the growth rate of

multifactor productivity (MFP). The capital deepening component is further subdivided into

ICT and other capital and into three types of ICT capital (lines 4-6). The resulting MFP growth

rate is then decomposed into the role of the production of ICT capital and all other contributions

to MFP growth (lines 10-11).

         In Table 3 we add two additional lines to the standard O-S decomposition. The two

types of ICT capital contribution, capital deepening (line 3) and the MFP effect (line 10) can be

added together, as in line 12. Then the total ICT contribution in line 12 can be divided by the

growth rate of labor productivity from line 3 to yield the total contribution of ICT capital to

productivity growth and to the productivity revival, as shown in line 13. Table 3 shows three

different decompositions of the post-1995 productivity growth revival, each shown in boldface

and italic type. The first with data through 1999 is taken from the initial O-S paper, while the

second uses the latest data for the same period. Data revisions reduce the overall productivity

revival in line 3 while leaving the ICT contribution intact, and this boosts the contribution of



          6. There have been intervening analyses of data ending in 2000 and 2001 (see Oliner-Sichel 2002);
these are omitted to simplify the table and because the most recent results are of greatest interest.

ICT capital to the 1995-99 revival from 81 to 98 percent (line 13).

         When the end-point of the data is extended from 1999 to 2002, the revival in the growth

rate of labor productivity (line 3) increases from 0.96 to 1.20 percentage points while the

contribution of ICT capital (line 12) shows surprisingly little response to the decline in ICT

investment discussed above. As a result, the contribution of ICT capital declines from 98

percent in the period ending in 1999 to 76 percent in the period ending in 2002.7 The spurt in

productivity growth from 1999 to 2002 is more than explained by capital-deepening in ʺother

capitalʺ (line 7) and more rapid MFP growth contributed by sectors of the economy other than

ICT and semiconductor capital. The puzzling absence of a decline in the ICT contribution as

well as the upsurge in ʺotherʺ capital deepening both can be traced to the same cause, the rapid

decline in hours of labor input in 2001-2002. Since all the capital deepening terms in lines 2-7

represent the change in a capital-labor ratio times an income share of that type of capital, the

apparent resilience of the ICT role disguises the fact that the ICT contribution by itself fell by

half between 2000 and 2002, but this is dampened by the rapid decline in labor input.

Delay and Intangible (ʺHiddenʺ) Capital

         Drawing back from the details of Table 3, we can take a broader view of the claim that,



          7. Data revisions released on August 7 would further reduce the ICT share of the 1995-2002 revival
from the 76 percent figure shown in Table 3 to 67 percent, allowing only for the revisions in labor
productivity and assuming no revisions for any other figure in the final column of Table 3. Current
productivity data may exaggerate the 2002-2003 productivity performance, as they reflect extensive downward
revisions in aggregate hours of labor input but will not until December, 2003, reflect the most important set
of benchmark revisions in the national income accounts (which contribute output, investment, and capital
data) to occur since 1999.

at least through 1999, virtually all of the productivity growth revival can be attributed to the

production and use of ICT capital. This finding seems compatible with numerous studies,

especially Triplett-Bosworth (2002) and Nordhaus (2002c), which pinpoint wholesale and retail

trade and securities trading as the industries outside of ICT manufacturing where the

productivity growth revival is most evident. The largest single contribution to the revival in

their work is capital-deepening in ICT capital (Table 3, line 3), and this is precisely the capital

that has been used so effectively in trade and securities trading.

         Nevertheless, several questions may be raised about the implication of Table 3 that the

post-1995 productivity revival, at least through 1999, resulted entirely from the production and

use of ICT equipment.8 First, the Oliner-Sichel technique requires that the full productivity

payoff from the use of computers occurs at the exact moment that the computer is produced.9

Leaving aside any delay between production and installation, the computer produces its

ultimate productivity benefit on the first day of use. Numerous observers, led by David (1990),

argue instead that there is a substantial time delay in reorganizing business practices to take

advantage of new hardware and software. If there is a substantial delay in the real world that

is not taken into account by the Oliner-Sichel method, then they would exaggerate the




        8. One of the interim versions of the O-S decomposition went through an end-point of 2001 and
concluded that ICT capital overexplains the revival dated as 1995-2001 (see Sichel's discussion of Nordhaus,
2002c).

         9. Recall that the GDP statistics on which they rely measure output by production, and treat any
unsold goods as inventory accumulation, a part of GDP.

                                                           16

contribution of ICT capital-deepening to the post-1995 revival during the years of peak ICT

investment. Then, in the period 2001-03 when ICT investment has declined, they would

understate the left-over benefits from previous ICT investment.

       Davidʹs (1990) ʺdelayʺ hypothesis was based on a very general analogy between the

invention of electricity and computers. We will return to this analogy in more detail below

when we discuss Puzzle #3 about the fundamentals of New Economy innovation. In this

section we consider a more specific and focussed argument by Yang and Brynjolfsson, hereafter

Y-B (2001), that the productivity revival in the late 1990s was fundamentally mismeasured, due

to the exclusion of massive amounts of ʺintangibleʺ or ʺhiddenʺ capital from the investment and

capital data in the national accounts, and hence from the growth accounting exercises such as

that of O-S as summarized in Table 3.

       Y-B begin by treating computer hardware as the tip of the ICT iceberg, concealing a

large quantity of complementary capital investment, perhaps in their words as much as 10

dollars of ʺcomplementary intangible capital (including software and data), new business

processes, and human capital.ʺ The key distinction is between the portion of the total

investment that is included as investment in the national accounts, and the remaining

intangible portion that is ʺhiddenʺ as a business expense rather than treated as investment.

However, the Y-B 10-to-1 ratio greatly exaggerates the hidden component. We have already

seen that in 2002 investment in computers and peripherals was just 0.71 percent of GDP, in



                                               17
                                                                           Five Puzzles, Page 18



contrast to investment in all ICT capital, including software, of 3.83 percent of GDP, or more

than five times as much. Thus a better rule of thumb might be that each dollar of investment in

computer hardware (including peripherals) generates four additional dollars of measured ICT

investment in software and communications equipment, and as much as five additional hidden

dollars of business process reorganization and investment in human capital, i.e., retraining.

       Picking up a theme discussed below in regard to Puzzle #3, we regard investment in

computer hardware as automatically generating not only investment in software but also

investment in communication equipment, and in fact that is why we use the abbreviation ʺICTʺ

in preference to ʺITʺ throughout this paper. The essence of the New Economy was the marriage

of computer and communications hardware with software; the computer hardware and

communications hardware interacted in so many ways that it is impossible to separate them

and claim that one is at the tip of the iceberg while the other remains under water. The

invention of the World Wide Web (WWW) spurred not just a massive wave of computer and

peripheral purchases, along with the development of Windows 95 and 98 that incorporated

integrated web browsers, but also an enormous investment in communications hardware,

including not just fibre-optic cable but also everything from mundane plugs to complex

electronic switching networks. Working in the opposite direction, the rapid spread of mobile

phones required heavy investment in computer hardware to operate and manage the mobile

phone networks. The entire computer and communications hardware component of



                                               18
                                                                             Five Puzzles, Page 19



investment, as well as software, is a portion of the iceberg that is fully visible and above water.

       Whatever the ratio of hidden intangible capital, more likely 1-to-1 than 9-to-1, the

implications of the Y-B argument become clear. The economyʹs production function for final

goods depends on measured labor, measured capital input, and hidden intangible capital input.

In a steady state, when new investment in open and hidden capital is balanced by depreciation,

and human capital and retraining functions are at a normal level required to replace workers

who quit or retire, then hidden inputs and hidden outputs offset each other, and there is no

mismeasurement of productivity.

       But when visible ICT is growing rapidly as during 1995-2000, then complementary

hidden investments are growing rapidly as well, and the unmeasured output (the present value

of future benefits from business process reorganization, human capital improvements, and

retraining) exceed unmeasured inputs. Yet much of this intangible capital is being created by

measured labor inputs (programmers, consultants, trainers) that appear in the denominator of

productivity while their output is not counted in the numerator. Thus during 1995-2000 the

ʺtrueʺ revival of productivity growth, including the hidden output in additional to measured

output, was substantially greater than the measured revival of productivity growth which was

held down both by the failure to count intangible investment and also by the counting of a

temporary upsurge in labor input devoted to creating intangible hidden capital.

       The period 2000-2003 has been marked by a sharp downturn in ICT investment,



                                                 19
                                                                           Five Puzzles, Page 20



particularly in computer hardware but also in software and communications equipment, and a

rapid decline in employment. Output can grow despite a continuing decline in labor hours,

because the benefits of the previous hidden investment in improved business processes and

better trained employees are transmitted to production, while the workers that produced the

hidden output in the late 1990s (programmers, consultants, trainers) have been laid off and are

walking the streets. In a sense the U. S. economy of 2000-2003 has been getting a ʺfree rideʺ

from the 1995-2000 wave of investment in hidden capital.

       The Y-B analysis seems convincing as at least a partial explanation of why U. S.

productivity growth has been so healthy during a period of relatively low measured ICT

investment. However, its starting point is that an imbalance of measured and hidden

investment is inherently temporary and depends on an acceleration or deceleration in visible,

measured investment such as that which occurred on the up side during 1995-2000 and on the

down side during 2000-2003. The implication is that part of the ebullient productivity

performance of 2000-2003 was based on the ʺfree rideʺ and is inherently temporary. This

argument is in addition to the historical precedent of an early-recovery productivity growth

ʺbubbleʺ such as occurred in 2001-2002, which suggests that average measured productivity

growth during 2000-2003 contains a cyclical component.

       At least one obvious question is raised by the Y-B analysis, and this is why intangible

capital did not produce a productivity growth upsurge during previous periods when the share



                                               20
                                                                               Five Puzzles, Page 21



of spending on computer hardware was growing rapidly, particularly 1972-87, the interval that

led Robert Solow to utter his famous quip that later became known as the Solow ʺcomputer

paradox,ʺ that ʺwe see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statisticsʺ. One

possible answer is that the 1972-87 increase in the share of computer spending in GDP was slow

and gradual, while the post-1995 upsurge was sudden and hence created a greater imbalance

between measured and unmeasured ICT investment. A second possibility is that the nature of

ICT innovation in the 1990s was more disruptive and required a more substantial investment in

intangible capital than did earlier waves of computer innovation. We turn to this possibility in

the next section.

       The Y-B intangible capital hypothesis is not the only explanation of the extraordinary

behavior of U. S. productivity growth in the 2000-03 period, which as we have seen goes well

beyond the usual early-recovery bubble phenomenon. Another explanation centers on the

unusual behavior of profits in the late-1990s boom and subsequent stock market collapse,

leading to unusually savage cost-cutting in 2000-03, with the resulting ʺjoblessʺ recovery and

productivity growth explosion.

       Profits are related to productivity through the income shares of labor and capital. By

definition labor’’s share is equal to real compensation per hour divided by output per hour. If

increases in compensation lag behind productivity in the early phases of a cyclical expansion,

then labor’’s share will decline and capital’’s share will rise, and the rate of return on capital will



                                                  21
                                                                               Five Puzzles, Page 22



rise even faster to the extent that the rising utilization of capital causes an increase in capital

productivity. The cyclical expansion of the 1990s exhibited typical behavior of corporate profits

as measured in the NIPA, which registered a near-doubling of nominal profits between 1992

and 1997 followed by a decline in nominal profits between mid-1997 and early 2000, little

further decline into 2001, and then a recovery in 2002 and early 2003 back to the 1997 nominal

peak and beyond.

       Nordhaus (2002b) contrasts the behavior of NIPA profits with that of S&P reported

profits, which show a very different timing pattern, growing by 70 percent between early 1998

and early 2000, and then declining by more than half between early 2000 and early 2001. He

attributes a substantial role in this “most unusual pattern” to a wide variety of shady

accounting tricks to which corporations turned as they desperately attempted to pump up

reported profits during 1998-2000 in an environment in which true profits were declining. In

Nordhausʹ words, these tricks led to ʺthe enrichment of the few and depleted pension plans of

the many.” A further unusual aspect of 2001-02 was the extremely low ratio of S&P reported

earnings to S&P operating earnings, primarily due to one-time charges that firms take to correct

for previous business or accounting mistakes. Overall, Nordhaus estimated that reported S&P

earnings for 2001 were held down by about 30 percent by a combination of normal cyclical and

extraordinary accounting impacts.

       The unusual trajectory of S&P reported profits in 1998-2001 placed unusual pressure on



                                                  22
                                                                           Five Puzzles, Page 23



corporate managers to cut costs and reduce employment. During the 1990s corporate

compensation had shifted to substantial reliance on stock options, leading both to the

temptation to engage in accounting tricks during 1998-2000 to maintain the momentum of

earnings growth, and then sheer desperation to cut costs in response to the post-2000 collapse in

reported S&P earnings and in the stock market. The stock market collapse had an independent

impact on the pressure for corporate cost-cutting, beyond its effect on the stock-option portion

of executive compensation, by shifting many corporate-sponsored defined benefit pension plans

from overfunded to underfunded status.

       A plausible interpretation of the unusual upsurge of productivity growth in 2002-03 is

that it was the counterpart of an unusual degree of pressure for corporate cost-cutting, which in

turn was caused by the role of accounting scandals and corporate write-offs that led to the

unusual trajectory of reported S&P profits relative to NIPA profits. The unusual nature of

corporate cost cutting was widely recognized:

       “The mildness of the recession masked a ferocious corporate-profits crunch that

       has many chief executives still slashing jobs and other costs. . . . Many CEOs

       were so traumatized by last year’’s profits debacle that they are paring costs

       rather than planning plant expansions”” (Hilsenrath, 2002).

The chain of causation from the profits “debacle” to the 2002-03 productivity surge seems

plausible as the leading explanation of the unusual productivity paper documented in previous



                                                23
                                                                             Five Puzzles, Page 24



sections. But it raises a central question –– how were corporate managers able to maintain

output growth while cutting costs so savagely? Why didnʹ’t massive layoffs cause output to fall,

as would have occurred if productivity growth had stagnated? This brings us to the central role

of ICT investment in the post-1995 productivity growth revival and to the puzzle that

productivity growth surged after 2000 as ICT investment growth was collapsing along with

corporate profits and the stock market.



Puzzle #3. What Aspects of Innovation Caused Productivity Growth to
                 Take Off?

       A fundamental puzzle in the history of computers is that innovation proceeded apace

throughout the 50 years after the introduction of the first commerical computer in 1951, but

productivity gains in the overall economy were slow during most of the 1972-95 period when

some of the most important innovations occurred. Nordhaus (2002a) has documented that the

rate of price decline of one standardized unit of computing power was roughly constant from

the late 1940s to the present time at an annual rate of 40 to 50 percent per year, after barely

declining at all from the first punch-card machines of the 1890s to the introduction of the

electronic computer in the late 1940s. Thus the technology that allowed the price of one unit of

computing power to decline at such a steady pace must itself have improved steadily. Why

was the economyʹs response in terms of productivity growth so slow between 1972 and 1995,

and so much more rapid after 1995? How long will the rapid response continue, or is the



                                                 24

economy doomed to return, starting tomorrow or in several years, to an era of slow

productivity growth?

The Early Years of Computers compared to the Great Inventions

       I have previously compared, somewhat unfavorably, the invention and development of

the electronic computer with that of the ʺGreat Inventionsʺ, of which the two most important

were the heroic twin inventions of the late nineteenth century, electricity and the internal

combustion engine. Davidʹs (1990) ʺdelayʺ hypothesis provided the first suggestion that it was

useful to compare the early years after the invention of electricity to the early years after the

invention of the electronic computer. We may look for analogies also with the early years after

the invention of the internal combustion engine.

       Electricity dates from the simultaneous invention of the electric light bulb in 1879 by

Thomas A. Edison in the U. S. and by Joseph W. Swan in England, and the first power station in

1882. As shown by Nordhaus (1997), electricity drastically reduced the price of a lumen of

light. Electric motors, after a developmental period of several decades, revolutionized

manufacturing by decentralizing the source of power and making possible flexible and portable

tools and machines. After a somewhat longer lag, electric motors embodied in consumer

appliances eliminated the greatest source of drudgery of all, manual laundry; through

refrigeration virtually eliminated food spoilage; and through air conditioning made summers

enjoyable and opened the southern United States for modern economic development. In fact, it



                                                 25
                                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 26



has been said that the most important economic development in Asia in the twentieth century

was the invention of air conditioning.10

         When comparing the importance of electricity and electronic computers, the initial and

most obvious remark is that computers are one more subsidiary invention made possible by

electricity and could not exist without it. More interesting is the role of size in the evolution of

both electricity and computers. The upsurge in U. S. manufacturing productivity in the 1920s

has been attributed to success, after a long delay, in making electric motors small and reliable

enough to be stationed at each workplace in the factory and to replace the clumsy system of

belts linking a large central power source to the individual work stations (David-Wright, 1999).

In turn, the miniaturization of the electric motor made possible consumer appliances and air

conditioning, subsidiary inventions that were not possible in the early days (say, 1880-1910) of

electric power generation.

         The history of the electronic computer in similar fashion reflects the role of

miniaturization. Early electronic computers were massive and required separate air

conditioned rooms or even separate buildings.11 The 1950-80 period was characterized by the




         10. This remark was made in the discussant remarks of Tacho Bark of Seoul National University at
the International Conference on Growth Engines of Korea, Seoul, July 24, 2003.

          11. The first electronic computer, the ENIAC developed in the late 1940s, had only a tiny fraction
of the computing power of a contemporary laptop but was 100 feet long, ten feet high, three feet wide, and
contained about 18,000 vacuum tubes. It was "programmed" by setting thousands of switches (Gordon,
1990, p. 191). For the early history of computing prior to 1950, see Nordhaus (2002a) and the sources

gradual shrinkage of the mainframe computer and the gradual transition of its input-output

interface from punch cards to ʺdumbʺ terminals that had no separate computational capability.

The earliest uses of electronic computers were similar to those of the early punch-card sorting

machines dating back to the 1890s, namely to count the U. S. decennial census. Early

commercial uses in the 1960s and 1970s were the production of telephone and utility bills, bank

statements, and once the dumb terminal was available, prototypes of the modern airline

reservation systems. Computers should have yielded major improvements in productivity by

eliminating many rows of clerks sitting at desks with electro-mechanical calculators, and

doubtless they did. But, as originally pointed out by Oliner and Sichel (1994) and Sichel (1997),

these productivity gains barely showed above the surface in an economy where, in the 1960s,

computer investment was barely 0.2 percent of GDP.

       The invention of the personal computer in the early 1980s is analogous to the spread of

small electric motors installed in machine tools and other factory equipment in the 1920s. Now

individually controllable computational capability was available at every desk. While

mainframes were still necessary for large assembly-line functions like bills, bank statements,

and airline reservations systems, the personal computer allowed the introduction of word

processing and spreadsheets. Economy-wide productivity should have surged in the 1980s as

personal computers made it possible for firms to economize on secretaries who had previously

been engaged in repetitive typing of legal briefs and contracts. Professors soon found that it

was faster to word process their own papers from scratch than to follow the tedious previous

process of endless rounds of revising drafts typed by a secretary. Indeed, one can see a faint

glimmering of an early revival in productivity growth in the 1981-85 period in Figure 1 above.

         Sharing the title with electricity for the most important invention that had its main

diffusion in the twentieth century is the internal combustion engine, which made possible

personal autos, motor transport, and air transport.12 The early years of the internal combustion

engine were also characterized by a David-type delay, but this did not involve miniaturization.

Initially automobiles were quirky and unreliable, and while autos soon became capable of

traveling at much faster speeds than horses, the roads required for such speeds did not exist.

Only in the 1920s did automobiles become sufficiently pervasive to spell the doom of inter-

urban street railways. Only in the 1950s did the full set of the automobileʹs complementary

inventions, including supermarkets, suburbs, and superhighways, finally emerge. Similarly

more than twenty years elapsed after the Wright Brothersʹ first flight before the start of the

commercial aviation industry in the late 1920s, and ten more years intervened before the

development of the DC-3, the workhorse commercial aircraft that made possible the modern

airline industry beginning in the late 1930s.

         The analogy of the internal combustion engine provides the key to understanding why



         12. The first internal combustion engine operating on modern principles is attributed to Julius Hock
in 1870 and the first four-cycle engine to Nikolaus Otto in 1877. The first high-speed engine was built by
Gottlieb Daimler in 1883 and the first three-wheeled automobile by Karl Benz in 1885. See Bunch and
Hellemans (1993), pp. 268-93.

the productivity payoff of the personal computer waited until the mid-1990s. Just as

complementary investments in roads and suburbs were necessary to provide the full benefits of

motorcars and motor transport, so complementary innovations in software and communication

technology were necessary to provide the full potential benefits of the personal computer.

Windows 95 and 98 provided an intuitive interface that instantly replaced DOS, with its

command lines and DOS-based programs with their arcane codes. While the replacement of

DOS programs with Windows-based programs may have been little more than an annoyance

for experienced DOS users in the business world, they made it possible for business firms to

reduce training expenses, and also for the personal computer to penetrate the household.13

Because we are interested in the determinants of measured business-sector productivity, it is

important for us to distinguish between the benefits of computers in business firms and for

consumers in the household, and we shall return to this theme below.

         But the ʺkiller applicationʺ that powered the post-1995 productivity revival was the

marriage of computer hardware and Windows-type software to communications technology

that made possible the WWW. Equally important were developments in hardware power and

software that made it trivial to send documents as e-mail attachments, thus eliminating the

need to print out many preliminary documents and spreadsheets and to send the printed



           13. I am one of those experienced DOS users who still writes papers like this one on Wordperfect
for DOS 6.0. My fingers automatically know that CTRL+F7,1,1 creates a footnote and that SHIFT+F8,7,6,u
will insert an "up" vertical advance code. But those examples underline the training cost faced by business
firms ten years ago and the barriers to household adoption of PCs.

versions via fax or courier service. Cheap communications caused a revolution in business

practice such as those emphasized by Y-B in our discussion of Puzzle #2; now proprietary

systems for electronic communication within firms, and between firms and suppliers, could be

replaced by generic systems based on web software that combined transparent interfaces with

security protection. In short, the ʺmarriageʺ of computer hardware with software and

communications hardware in the 1990s was as important to the development of the computer

as was the development of paved roads and then superhighways to the full exploitation of the

internal combustion engine.

Productivity-enhancing Innovation Goes Beyond the ICT Sector

        We know that productivity growth accelerated after 1995, and we can speculate as above

about the aspects of ICT innovation that helped this acceleration to occur. But the simultaneous

acceleration in productivity growth and in ICT investment as a share of GDP amounts, at least

in part, to circumstantial evidence. Other aspects of innovation were occurring as well, and

these may be as important as ICT in explaining the outstanding productivity performance since

1995 of the retail trade sector.

        This performance did not occur evenly across the board in retailing but rather was

concentrated in ʺlarge stores offering a wide array of goods accompanied by low prices and

relatively high use of self-service systemsʺ (Sieling et al. 2001, p. 10). A complementary finding

by Foster et al. (2002) based on a study of a large set of individual retail establishments shows



                                                30
                                                                              Five Puzzles, Page 31



that all of retail productivity growth (not just the revival but the entire measured amount of

productivity growth over the decade of the 1990s) can be attributed to more productive entering

establishments which displaced much less productive existing establishments. The average

establishment that continued in business exhibited zero productivity growth, and this despite

the massive investment of the retail industry in ICT equipment that presumably went to both

old and new establishments.     In the Foster results, productivity growth reflects the greater

efficiency of newly opened stores, and the Sieling comment implies that most of these highly

efficient new stores were large discount operations, the proverbial ʺbig boxesʺ like Wal-Mart,

Home Depot, Best Buy, Circuit City, and new large supermarkets.

       The Sieling and Foster findings seem to conflict with the Oliner-Sichel implication in

Table 3, at least for the period through 1999, that all of the productivity revival in retailing was

achieved by purchasing new computers, software, and communications equipment. All

retailers, whether new estabilishments of the 1990s or older establishments of the 1980s or prior

decades, have adopted ICT technology. Bar-code readers have become universal in new and

old stores. It is likely that the productivity revival in retailing associated with newly built ʺbig

boxʺ stores involves far more than the use of computers, including large size, economies of

scale, efficient design to allow large-volume unloading from delivery trucks, stacking of

merchandise on tall racks with fork-lift trucks, and large-scale purchases taken by customers to

vehicles in large adjacent parking lots.

       In the taxonomy of Table 3, these sources of efficiency gains should count as a

contribution of non-ICT capital (i.e., big-box structures and fork-lift trucks) and organizational

improvements that raise MFP in the non-ICT sector. In the latest results of O-S in the right

column of Table 3, there has been a substantial acceleration in the contribution to MFP growth

of ʺother nonfarm businessʺ outside the ICT sector, and some of these innovations in retailing

may be showing up there. The role of non-ICT capital and non-ICT innovations may also help

us to understand the failure of Europe to experience a post-1995 productivity revival, as

discussed below in connection with Puzzle #5.



Puzzle #4. Will Continuous Innovation Revive ICT Investment?

       Interpretations of the interplay between ICT investment and the post-1995 productivity

revival are both of academic interest and also of enormous historical importance in trying to

assess whether the rapid productivity growth of 1995-2003 can continue, whether it requires the

ʺsupportʺ of a revival in ICT investment, and indeed whether that revival will occur. This

section goes back to fundamentals in the economics of economic growth to argue that the

contribution to productivity growth of capital deepening and MFP are not independent, as they

appear to be in Table 3, but rather are both ultimately dependent on the pace of innovation.

This will then lead us to speculate on the likely pace of innovation over the next few years and

to distinguish between those aspects of innovation that will provide a further boost to business

productivity from those that will mainly provide consumers with improved or additional

                                                32

entertainment options.

The Pace of Innovation is Measured by Growth in Labor Productivity, not MFP

       Standard growth accounting exercises such as the O-S decomposition displayed in Table

3 above seem to make growth in labor productivity depend on a contribution of capital

deepening and a contribution of MFP growth, as if these two were independent. Dale

Jorgenson with many co-authors, originally with Zvi Griliches (Jorgenson-Griliches 1967) and

more recently with Kevin Stiroh (Jorgenson-Stiroh 2000), has argued that the driving forces in

economic growth are increases in the quantity and quality of inputs, with only a small

remaining role for MFP, the residual that usually is taken to measure the importance of

technical change.

       In thinking about the future of productivity growth and its determinants, we need to flip

the Jorgenson approach on its head. The basic argument was developed in Gordon (1968,

reprinted in 2003c) and independently by Thomas K. Rymes (1971). A simple example

demonstrates the deep truth that capital deepening -- that is, the growth in the capital-labor

ratio -- must be directly attributable to innovation. If in the year 1770 all capital equipment

consisted of vintage 1770 Watt-Bolton steam engines, and if technical change was all

disembodied (that is, figuring out how to rearrange the Watt-Bolton steam engines to boost

production) then capital accumulation would have ground to a halt within a few decades of

1770, exhausted by diminishing returns. The entire contribution of capital deepening to labor



                                                33
                                                                             Five Puzzles, Page 34



productivity growth since 1770 is attributable to trillions of dollars of investment in railroads,

autos, trucks, airplanes, electrical machinery, oil refineries, computers, and much else, that was

invented and further developed after 1770 and would not have occurred without those post-

1770 inventions. Or, in the evocative words of Evsey Domar, without technical change capital

accumulation would just amount to ʺwooden ploughs piled up on top of existing wooden

ploughsʺ (Domar, 1961, p. 712).

       This point applies only to capital deepening, not to all capital accumulation. Technical

change is not necessary for growth in the capital stock that keeps pace with growth in labor

input, maintaining a fixed capital-labor ratio; investment would then be entirely devoted to

equipping the additional members of the population with additional machines of a given

technology, whether wooden ploughs or personal computers. But because all capital deepening

ultimately requires technical change, existing measures of multi-factor productivity (MFP)

growth cannot be interpreted as measuring the pace of technical progress, since the capital-

deepening effect (due also to technical change) is subtracted out in calculating MFP growth.

       Standard growth analyses include corrections for changes in the ʺqualityʺ of capital in

addition to its quantity (included but not shown separately in Table 3), and for changes in the

ʺqualityʺ of labor (shown in line 8 of Table 3). Yet changes in the quality of both capital and

labor require technical change, just as does capital deepening. Capitalʹs quality improves when

the composition of capital input shifts from long-lived assets like structures to short-lived assets



                                                 34
                                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 35



like computers, because short-lived assets need to earn a higher marginal product in order to

ʺpay forʺ their higher rate of depreciation. Yet the very shift from structures to computers

reflects technical change that allows the relative price of computers to structures to decline

continuously. Even the quality of labor depends on technical change. As shown in Gordon

(1968), the returns to education are endogenous as well to the pace of technical change, in the

sense that workers in the research sector paid to develop innovations would not be paid as

much if they had no creative ideas. This point is still not widely recognized.14

         These points can be applied to a further understanding of the productivity revival of the

late 1990s in the United States. Calculations like those of Table 3 show that after 1995 MFP

growth revived, indicating an acceleration of technical change, but this understates the role of

technical change, which together with an abundant supply of capital directly created the

investment boom and hence the capital-deepening effect of the late 1990s. The post-2000

collapse of the investment boom may signal that the underlying pace of innovation began to

slow, and in turn this raises questions about future advances in innovation and ICT investment.




Thinking About the Productivity Implications of Future Innovation

         Speculating about future innovation opens up a huge array of topics, but fortunately



         14. This is part of a broader point in the study of cross-country differences in economic growth.
Many of the so-called "causes" of economic growth, e.g., education, are themselves in large part the
consequence of growth. Countries as they become richer can afford to spread the bounty to education,
research subsidies, better infrastructure, and better justice systems that reduce crime and corruption.

only a subcomponent of innovation is relevant for future changes in measured business

productivity. Many ongoing innovations are providing higher quality entertainment and

communication options to consumer households, but that is not relevant to business

productivity. The consumer surplus created by such consumer-oriented innovations is typically

missed by price indexes when new products are introduced. While final product is understated

by the omission of the benefits of these innovations, at least price indexes today are revised

more often than in the past to track the price declines of new consumer products after they are

introduced. Past examples of long delays in the introduction of consumer durable goods into

the U. S. Consumer Price Index include a 35 year delay for automobiles, a 12 year delay for

room air conditioners, and a nine-year delay for the VCR.15

         Between 1996 and 2000 the annual growth rate of investment in computer hardware

doubled to 40 percent from around 20 percent in the previous decade. This acceleration

reflected the working of both supply and demand. On the supply side, an acceleration of

technical change created a faster rate of decline of computer prices per unit of performance, and

this generated an increased demand for computers through a standard substitution effect. On

the demand side, the demand for new computer hardware was raised by a set of five factors

that were important at the time but did not persist beyond the year 2000. As argued in Gordon




         15. New price indexes and an assessment of official price indexes for consumer appliances and
automobiles is provided in Gordon (1990), Chapters 7 and 8. A recent assessment of the problem of
introducing new goods into price indexes is provided by Schultze and Mackie (2002), Chapter 5.

(2003a), the first of these factors that stimulated the demand for computers, but only for a

temporary period, was that the WWW could only be invented once. By the year 2000 most

firms, government agencies, and other organizations had invested in the initial construction of

their web sites, and further developments and refinements required lower levels of investment

in software engineers and computer hardware. Second, much of the computer hardware and

software development was purchased by ʺdot.comʺ internet start-up companies that promptly

went out of business, indicating that their hardware and software investment yielded a negative

rate of return. Third, a new generation of user-friendly but memory-hogging business software,

notably Windows 95 and 98 and Office 97, both required the purchase of new computers and

also revolutionized business productivity by finally creating a universal business language that

facilitated networking and electronic exchange of documents and data. But this revolution was

temporary as well; since 1998 the exponential growth of computer power has far outrun the

pace of innovation in business software. Todayʹs Office XP functions almost identically to

Office 97, which was introduced six years ago. Fourth, the ʺY2Kʺ crisis led to an artificial

compression of the replacement cycle for computer hardware and software investment into the

1998-99 period, both boosting investment in those years and depressing investment in 2000 and

beyond. Fifth, deregulation of the telecommunications industry in 1996 led to a free-for-all of

investment in the late 1990s that left the U. S. vastly oversupplied with fibre-optic

communications capacity, only a small fraction of which is being utilized.

       Rapid productivity growth since 1995 combines the one-time-only aspects of the

measured portion of the ICT investment boom during 1995-2000, with the disequilibrium

argument of Y-B that current productivity growth is being propelled by intangible investments

made during the boom years, even after the programmers-consultants-trainers who produced

that intangible capital have been laid off, thus further boosting labor productivity by reducing

its denominator. To project a repetition of the 1995-2003 experience, and to believe that the HP

trend of Figure 1 is actually relevant to future productivity growth over the next five to ten

years, we need to look for sources of innovation that could possibly generate another ICT

investment boom of the magnitude of the late 1990s.

       It is useful to think of inventions as having different levels of fundamental importance,

both in terms of their initial effects and in terms of their potential spin-offs and complements.

Electricity and the internal combustion engine were mega-inventions, both for their direct

effects and the number and importance of their spin-offs (consumer appliances, air

conditioning) and complements (roads, superhighways, suburbs, supermarkets). The

semiconductor, computer chip, and digitalization taken together represent a first-rate invention,

if not a mega-invention. Some of the spinoffs of electricity, like television and the motion

picture, were first-rate inventions, albeit nevertheless spinoffs. Down another level were

products like the VCR, at best a second-rate invention that combined motion pictures with

television. The computer and personal computer are first-rate inventions that have created



                                                38
                                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 39



first-rate complements, namely the WWW and internet. But the PDA, internet-accessible

mobile phone, and wi-fi enabled laptop are second-rate inventions at best, themselves

representing spinoffs of the previous merging of computer hardware, communications

hardware, and software that occurred in the 1990s.

         Unfortunately, most of the excitement about current and near-term future innovations in

the ICT industry involve second-rate inventions of either consumer or business products.

Consumers may be thrilled about their digital cameras, camera phones, flat plasma TV screens,

and ever-more-exotic game-playing machines, but these innovations are a continuation of

previous incremental improvements and in any case have few if any implications for future

business productivity growth.16 For true consumer impact, none of these innovations creates

the kind of quantum jump in consumer welfare that was achieved by the refrigerator, automatic

washing machine, dishwasher, the first black-and-white televisions, the first color televisions,

the room air conditioner and then central air conditioning. Nevertheless, much of the

dynamism in electronic innovation currently and in the future revolves around consumer

entertainment, and it has been argued that the average home user now needs greater processing

power than the average business employee working at a desk.

         Innovations likely to stimulate ICT investment spending for business productivity


          16. Consumer electronic spending could stimulate business productivity through a subtle link.
Consider two classes of consumer products, electronic products with relative price declines and productivity
increases, and non-electronic products with small relative price increases and slightly below-average
productivity growth. Innovations that cause consumers to shift their budget share toward more consumer
electronic products could raise the growth-rate of economywide productivity.

purposes over the next few years are already known. Another round of miniaturization is at

hand, with improved internet capability of Personal Digital Assistants and cellular phones. The

rush to compress e-mail and web access onto tiny screens of PDAs with tiny or nonexistent

keyboards will clash head-to-head with the rapid spread of wi-fi hotspots that will extend the

utility of laptop computers and make it easy to enjoy e-mail and web access from virtually

anywhere with a full-sized screen and full-sized keyboard. The ability of business employees to

hook up everywhere and anytime, whether by PDA, cell phone, or wi-fied laptop, raises

additional issues about work hours. If travel time becomes worktime, and business employees

feel that they must be accessible 24/7, including while on vacation, then the productivity data

may overstate the level of productivity by understating the level of hours.17 Looking further

ahead, it is easy to foresee the day when keyboards are no longer necessary for PDAs, when e-

mails can be composed by voice-recognition sofware, and incoming e-mail can be automatically

translated by computer voice and transmitted over tiny earphones.

       One way of assessing the likely productivity impact of near-term ICT innovation is to

ask whether such innovations can break through the inherent impediments to the replacement

of human beings by computers. As I argued in Gordon (2000, pp. 65-66), some uses of labor are

immune to replacement by computers, including airline pilots, truck drivers, doctors, nurses,

dentists, lawyers, professors, investment bankers, management consultants, bartenders, wait




       17. This point has long been made by Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley.

staff, bus boys, flight attendants, barbers, lawn maintenance services, auto repair, hotel

housekeepers, and almost every type of home maintenance. Innovation operates around the

edges but does not change the nature of these jobs fundamentally. For the first time at a recent

visit my doctor used new (at least for him) software in the examination room that allowed him

to scan previous test results, current prescriptions, and to issue new prescriptions by checking a

few boxes. But as a byproduct he spent most of the visit looking at his computer screen rather

than examining me! Professors are on this list as a species unlikely to be replaced by

computers, but professors have been affected by ICT investments. In my case the office-

productivity innovations of the 1990s, particularly Excel and e-mail attachments, have made it

possible for my research assistants to send me 10 or 20 rounds of results per day without ever

talking to me in person. But those innovations were all in place by 1998 and little on the

horizon has appeared that remotely approaches their importance.

        A different but equally skeptical view is offered by Carr (2003).18 In his view, the failure

of the dot.coms in the late 1990s reflected a pervasive tendency of ICT innovation to be easily

copied, thus quickly eroding the competitive advantage for any one company that is essential

for ICT investments to be profitable. Benefits for consumers and improvements in productivity

Sabre reservations system provided a competitive advantage for a decade or more because they

were so hard to copy, but recent developments ʺtoward openness, toward standardization,

toward greater power, toward ever more powerful hardware and softwareʺ have greatly eased

the task of competitors wanting to copy a single companyʹs initial innovation. Carrʹs argument

comes down to diminishing returns, the same force that Gordon (2000) argued makes it ever

more difficult to think up truly important innovations for business productivity. In Carrʹs

words, ʺa lot of the core things that businesses do have already been automated with

information technologies.ʺ19

        Even optimists like Intelʹs Andy Grove project a recovery of ICT investment, but one

based on ʺmore of the sameʺ rather than any important new innovations. In Groveʹs view, the

continuing exponential growth of e-commerce at those dot.com firms which survived the 1990s

shake-out will inevitably require sizeable further investments to ʺlight [presently unutilized]

fibreʺ and to handle ever-growing e-commerce transactions. Grove agrees that the investment

boom of the late 1990s was ʺunsustainable,ʺ and his favorite examples of the future potential

growth in ICT investment seem remote from business productivity, including ʺdigital

distribution of music,ʺ ʺdigital electronics applied to warfare,ʺ and use of ICT in the health care

industry.20

       The operation of diminishing returns makes it difficult to believe that over the next five

or ten years innovation related to business productivity will be sufficiently dynamic to allow a

repeat of the ICT investment boom of the late 1990s. Because innovation is the ultimate driver of

the capital-deepening process, it is possible that the ebullient 2000-2003 performance of U. S.

productivity growth summarized in the HP trend line of Figure 1 may prove to be a historical

high-water mark of productivity growth.



Puzzle #5: Why has Europe failed to experience a productivity growth
           revival?

       Europeans are perplexed by the failure of Europe (i.e., the European Union) to

experience a post-1995 productivity growth revival. In fact, Europe experienced a substantial

post-1995 productivity growth slowdown, as shown in Table 4. The initial European slowdown

evident in data for 1995-2000 worsened with data for 2000-2003, whereas the U. S. (as we saw

above) experienced accelerating productivity growth at the cost of rapidly declining hours of

work during 2000-2002. All the data in Table 4 are taken from a recent Conference Board

pamphlet by McGuckin-van Ark (2003). Readers should note that international comparisons

are based on data on GDP per hour for the entire economy including the government sector,

and these generally display slower growth rates of productivity than the data for the nonfarm

private business sector that we examined in Table 1 and Figure 1 above.

       The right-hand column of Table 4 displays the change in output, hours, and output per



                                                43
                                                                             Five Puzzles, Page 44



hour between 1990-95 and 1995-2003. Surprisingly, the post-1995 acceleration in output growth

was only slightly less in Europe as in the U. S., 0.6 vs. 0.9 percentage points, respectively. But

Europeʹs performance in hours of work was the diametric opposite of the U. S., accelerating by

almost two percentage points compared to pre-1995, whereas hours growth in the U. S. was flat.

As a result, the productivity change between 1990-95 and 1995-2003 was the mirror image of

the hours change, with an acceleration of 0.9 percent for the U. S. and a deceleration of more

than one percent for Europe.

       Most of the literature on the failure of Europe to achieve a post-1995 productivity

growth acceleration treats Europe as overregulated and stuck in the mud, ignoring the

turnaround from hours contraction to hours expansion before and after 1995. In this section we

review recent findings on the Europe-U. S. difference in a search for useful conclusions. An

initial reaction is that this difference appears to deny the kind of importance for ICT investment

in causing the post-1995 U. S. revival that appears in the decomposition of O-S in Table 3.

Business firms, not to mention university professors, use the same PCs and Microsoft software

everywhere in Europe, and Europe is widely acknowledged to be ahead in the use of mobile

telephones. This reaction provides further circumstantial evidence that the O-S growth

accounting exercise in Table 3 may overstate the contribution of ICT investment to the U. S.

post-1995 revival.

         Part of the European puzzle is resolved when we recognize that heterogeneity among

European countries is more pronounced than the difference between the European Union and

the U. S. Numerous studies have shown a relatively strong positive correlation between MFP

growth and measures of ICT intensity, e.g., the ratio of ICT expenditure to GDP or the change in

PC intensity per 100 inhabitants over the 1990s. In such comparisons, numerous countries

achieved higher MFP growth rates than the U. S. over the 1990s, including Ireland, Finland,

Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Canada, and Australia. Some, but not all, of these countries

surpass the U. S. in PC intensity and/or in the share of ICT expenditure. What differs most

between Europe and the U. S. is the low level of PC adoption and ICT expenditure in the ʺolive

beltʺ ranging from Portugal and Spain on the west to Italy and Greece in the east.21

         A comprehensive recent study by van Ark et al. (2002) provides a few answers at a more

formal level. It allows us to trace the location of productivity growth accelerations and

decelerations to particular industrial sectors, divided into ICT-producing, ICT-using, and non-

ICT industries. The core of the U. S. success story appears to have been in ICT-using industries,

i.e., the same wholesale, retail, and securities trading industries already discussed above. The

decomposition of van Ark et al. (2002, Figure 2a) shows that literally all of the productivity

growth differential of the U. S. over Europe in the late 1990s came from these three industries,

with retail contributing about 55 percent of the differential, wholesale 24 percent, and securities



         21. Scatter plots supporting these correlations between MFP growth and computer intensity are
presented in Bartelsman et al. (2002, Figures 8 and 9).

                                                         45

trade 20 percent. The remaining industries had small positive or negative differentials, netting

out to zero. As might have been expected, the U. S.-Europe differential was negative in telecom

services, reflecting U. S. backwardness in mobile phones.

         These results for Europe link to our discussion of retailing in the previous section; the

retail sector was a major factor explaining Europeʹs poor performance in the late 1990s. Just as

we argued earlier that the U. S. retailing sector has achieved efficiency gains for reasons not

directly related to computers, including physical investments in a new type of ʺbig boxʺ

organization, so we can suggest in parallel that Europe has fallen behind because European

firms are much less free to develop the ʺbig boxʺ retail formats.22 Impediments include land use

regulations that prevent the carving out of new ʺgreenfieldʺ sites for ʺbig boxʺ stores in

suburban and exurban locations, shop-closing regulations that restrict the revenue potential of

new investments, congestion in central-city locations that are near the nodes of Europeʹs

extensive urban public transit systems, and restrictive labor rules that limit flexibility in

organizing the workplace and make it expensive to hire and fire workers with the near-total

freedom to which U. S. firms are accustomed.

         A complementary interpretation is provided in a cross-country study of productivity

differences in the service sector by the McKinsey Global Institute (1992). Their set of policy




         22. Any generalizations here about "Europe" must be qualified by differences across countries. The
Germans until recently were notorious for restrictive shop-closing hours, while the French firm Carrefour
and the Swedish firm Ikea are innovators in "big box" retailing formats.

recommendations (Chapter 2-D, pp. 13-14) seem as relevant today as when written a decade

ago and echo the previous paragraph by pointing to impediments to the development of

modern retailing in some but not all European countries. European policymakers have adopted

a set of policies that encourage high density and a concentration of retailing activity in the

central city. The development of modern ʺbig boxʺ retailing formats has been hindered by these

policies and the resulting high cost of real estate and the complex and precarious process of

obtaining planning approval for large plots of land.

       An issue identified by McKinsey is the role of resale price maintenance policies that in

the U. S. assure new competitors that they will be able to attain the same access to suppliers at

roughly the same prices as existing retailers. In contrast, in some European countries producers

refuse to discount to new, high-volume, low-cost retailing formats in order to protect smaller

high-cost merchants. In some European countries, regulations directly prohibit the entry of

large-scale stores and/or limit store opening days and hours, thus preventing large stores from

fully amortizing their investments.

       A partial survey of other cross-country studies reveals a disappointing lack of specific

conclusions at the level of the van Ark et al. and McKinsey studies. The typical study conducts

a growth accounting exercise, concludes that Europe has lagged behind the U. S. in adopting

ICT technology to a greater or lesser degree, does not trace differences in behavior to specific

industries, and concludes with a general plea for unspecified structural reforms. Among the

studies that fit this characterization are Colecchia and Schreyer (2001), Daveri (2002), Rhine-

Westphalia Institute for Economic Research (2002), and Vijselaar and Albers (2002).

Economic Institutions and Culture

       A refreshing contrast is provided by Phelps (2003), who takes a broader view of

economic institutions that promote economic ʺdynamismʺ and those that suppress it. His

analysis of ʺdynamismʺ starts from Schumpeterʹs concept of ʺcreative destructionʺ. He adds to

Schumpeterʹs emphasis on entrepreneurship an equal if not greater emphasis on ʺfinanciership,ʺ

that is, the ability of financial markets to steer finance to worthy innovations. The greater

success of the U. S. in encouraging innovation is attributed in part to its greater emphasis on

venture capital and initial public equity offerings (IPO) than in Europe.

       In Phelpsʹ view, the relatively poor economic performance of continental Europe results

both from the underdevelopment of capitalist institutions like venture capital and equity

finance, and the overdevelopment on corporatist institutions which suppress innovation and

competition. These corporatist institutions impose ʺpenalties, impediments, prohibitions, and

mandates . . . generally intended to damp down creative destruction.ʺ Among these

impediments are licenses and permissions to set up a new plant or firm, the need to consult

with workers on changes in the mix of products or plants, and employment protection

legislation. Because these institutions are designed to dampen down the changes inherent in

ʺunbridled capitalism,ʺ they also lead to the underdevelopment of the stock market, resulting in



                                                48

lower ratios of stock market valuation to GDP in continental Europe than in the U. S. and other

less corporatist economies like Britain, Canada, and Australia.

       Phelps provides a complementary analysis of cultural differences between Europe and

the U. S. Europeans view with disdain the money-grubbing Americans with their out-sized

rewards for CEOs and successful entrepreneurs. American children begin to work earlier than

European children, earning baby-sitting money in their early teens, working in fast-food outlets

while in high school, and are forced to work during college in contrast to European youth who

ʺfree rideʺ on government-paid college tuition and stipends. Phelps concludes that Europe has

developed a culture of ʺdependencyʺ that ʺbreeds an unduly large share of young people who

have little sense of independence and are unwilling to strike out on their own.ʺ He might have

added that high levels of long-term youth unemployment discourage independence and

encourage young adults to live with their parents in their 20s and, in Italy, into their 30s.




Caveats

       Europeans do not take these criticisms lying down. Yes, they admit that high youth

unemployment, low labor force participation, and a generation of young adults living with their

parents represents an economic and social failure. But they are quick to criticize aspects of

American economic and political institutions that, while making it easy for Wal-Mart and Home

Depot to find the land to build thousands of ʺbig boxʺ stores, has offsetting disadvantages.



                                                 49

       Europeans find abhorrent the hundreds of billions, or even trillions, that Americans

have spent on extra highways and extra energy to support the dispersion of the population into

huge metropolitan areas spreading over hundreds or even thousands of square miles, in many

cases with few transport options other than the automobile. Productivity data do not give

Europe sufficient credit for the convenience benefits of frequent bus, subway, and train

(including TGV) public transit. Excessive American dispersion is viewed as a response to

misguided public policies, especially subsidies to interstate highways in vast amounts relative

to public transport, local zoning measures in some suburbs that prohibit residential land

allocations below a fixed size, e.g., two acres, and the infamous and politically untouchable

deduction of mortgage interest payments from income tax.

       Europeans enjoy shopping at small individually owned shops on lively central city main

streets and pedestrian arcades, and recoil with distaste from the ubiquitous and cheerless

American strip malls and big-box retailers — although Carrefour, Ikea, and others provide

American-like options in some European cities. To counter the effects of American land use

regulations that create overly dispersed metropolitan areas, Europeans counter with their own

brand of land use rules that preserve greenbelts and inhibit growth of suburban and exurban

retailing. A more complete consideration of these differences leads to the conclusion that GDP

data understate the Europe/U. S. ratio of both productivity and real GDP per capita (see

Gordon, 2002).



Conclusion

       This paper began with five puzzles, and we are now prepared to provide some tentative

resolutions. Puzzle #1 asked about the ʺcyclical effectʺ that was invoked in discussions of the

early 1995-99 portion of the post-1995 U. S. productivity revival to argue that the revival was in

part temporary, and that unsustainably rapid growth in output had created unsustainably fast

growth in productivity. The further acceleration of productivity growth in 2000-03 has laid the

cyclical argument to rest insofar as it applies to the 1995-99 period. But another cyclical

phenomenon has emerged more recently, the ʺearly-recovery productivity bubbleʺ that pushed

up productivity growth in 2002 to incredible levels. This phenomenon is cyclical in the sense

that it is periodic; similar ʺbubblesʺ occurred in 1975-76, 1982-83, and 1991-92, and in each case

were followed by two or more years of productivity growth below trend. Data on productivity

growth rates during 2000-03 are pushed up by the bubble phenomenon, as are estimated

Hodrick-Prescott productivity trends that respond relatively rapidly to the evolution of the

actual data.

       Puzzle #2 was suggested by the paradox that productivity growth accelerated after the

year 2000 despite the collapse in the ICT investment boom, raising the possibility that standard

studies of growth accounting may exaggerate the causal role of ICT in achieving the first 1995-

99 phase of the productivity revival. Three factors support the case for exaggeration. First, the

                                                51
                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 52



growth accounting methodology unrealistically assumes that the full productivity benefits of

ICT hardware and software are achieved at the instant of production, with no allowance for

reorganization or training effects. Second, independent evidence for the retail trade sector finds

that all of the rapid productivity growth in the 1990s was achieved by new establishments and

none by old establishments, even though ICT investment has been made in both. Third, and

most important, the boom in measured ICT investment in the late 1990s was accompanied by a

boom of perhaps equal size in unmeasured or ʺhiddenʺ improvements in intangible and human

capital, as suggested by Yang and Brynjolfsson. The numerator of productivity omitted the

creation of the intangible capital but the denominator included the labor input, artificially

holding down the magnitude of the productivity growth revival. Then after 2000 productivity

growth was exaggerated, because output was supported by intangible capital input that had

been created before 2000, but the labor input that had created the intangible capital had

declined, as programmers, consultants, and trainers were laid off. The cyclical analysis of the

2002 productivity growth ʺbubbleʺ and the intangible capital argument both suggest that

observed productivity growth in 2002-2003 may represent a high water mark and cannot be

expected to continue.

       Puzzle #3 poses the paradox that technological change in computers has apparently

proceeded at a relatively steady pace, judging by the relatively constant rate of price decline of

computer power and the relatively exponential rate of increase of the performance-price ratio,



                                                52
                                                                              Five Puzzles, Page 53



yet the payoff from computer innovation in the form of productivity growth occurred in the late

1990s but not in the 1970s or 1980s. Drawing on analogies from the Great Inventions of the late

nineteenth century, electricity and the internal combustion engine, we pointed to

miniaturization and the development of complementary innovations as common threads

linking the Great Inventions to the development of computers. The key development of the

1990s was the marriage of computer and communications technology with software that made

possible the internet, the WWW, and the pervasive spread of the mobile telephone. Yet some of

the productivity growth revival of the 1990s was not directly attributable to this ICT marriage,

but rather, especially in the retail trade sector, reflected the benefits of an organization

revolution and large scale that made possible the ʺbig boxʺ retail phenomenon.

       Puzzle #4 focusses on the chicken-egg interrelationship between productivity,

investment, and innovation. That major source of productivity growth, capital-deepening

investment, cannot occur forever without a continuous flow of innovations, and so the post-

2000 crash in ICT investment raises the question as to whether the wave of innovation in the

1990s had a one-time-only component, and whether a new wave of innovations will emerge

over the next few years to create a repetition of the investment boom. We classify innovations

as ʺmega,ʺ ʺfirst-rateʺ, ʺsecond-rate,ʺ and beyond and argue that the marriage of computer and

communications hardware with software in the 1990s was a first-rate invention, but that it had

a one-time-only component because the web could only be invented once, because part of the



                                                  53
                                                                            Five Puzzles, Page 54



boom consisted of demand from dot.com firms which promptly went bust, because of the

mismatch between hardware and software innovation, because of the timing of Y2K, and

because of the overbuilding of telecom infrastructure. The main areas of ICT investment in the

near future are innovations that look distinctly second-rate, the further move toward mobility

with internet-enabled mobile phones and wi-fi enabled laptops that will allow e-mail, web

access, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint to be accessed more conveniently, but the functions to be

accessed will be the same as five years ago.

       The final puzzle #5 is why Europe failed to exhibit any sign of a post-1995 productivity

growth revival, despite its use of the same hardware and software and its evident lead in

mobile telephony. References to ʺEuropeʺ disguise a wide variety of performance, with Ireland

and Finland exhibiting much faster productivity growth than the U. S., but ʺolive beltʺ nations

like Italy and Greece scoring low on productivity and ICT investment (except for mobile

phones). Disaggregated studies of industrial sectors suggest that the main difference between

Europe and the U. S. is in ICT-using industries like wholesale and retail trade and in securities

trading, the same industries that were discussed above as leading the vanguard of computer

using industries. Yet the contrast in retailing calls attention to regulatory barriers and land-use

regulations in Europe that inhibit the development of the ʺbig boxʺ retailing formats that have

created many of the productivity gains in the U. S.

       Phelps provides a unifying framework in which economic dynamism is promoted by



                                                54
                                                                           Five Puzzles, Page 55



policies that promote competition and flexible equity finance and is retarded by corporatist

institutions which are designed to protect incumbent producers and inhibit new entry. He also

points to European cultural attributes that inhibit the development of ambition and

independence by teenagers and young adults, in contrast to their encouragement in the U. S.

While competition, corporatism, and culture may help to explain the differing evolution of

productivity growth on the two sides of the Atlantic since 1995, they reveal institutional flaws

in both continents that are inbred and likely to persist.
