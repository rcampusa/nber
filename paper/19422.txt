Heterogeneity in Long Term Health Outcomes of Migrants within Italy

JEL No. C21,I15

                                              ABSTRACT

This article examines the long term physical and mental health effects of internal migration focusing
on a relatively unique migration experience from Southern and Northeastern regions of Italy to Northwestern
regions and to the region around Rome concentrated over a relatively short period from 1950-1970.
OLS regression estimates show significant evidence of a migration effect among early-cohort females
on physical health. We find no evidence of migration-health effects for the later cohort, nor for males
in the early cohort. We use finite mixture models to further explore the possibility of heterogeneous
effects and find that there is a significant and substantial improvement in physical and mental health
for a fraction of migrant females in the early cohort but not for others. Analysis of the group for which
effects are significant suggest that health effects are concentrated among rural females in the early
cohort.

1         Introduction
The analysis of migration flows, its determinants and its effects on a wide range of
socio-economic phenomena have been examined in the literature beginning with the
seminal contribution of Chiswick (1978) and Carliner (1980) who use cross-section of
earning functions to investigate earning profiles for native born and immigrants in
the United States. Jasso and Rosenzweig (1986) and Borjas (1985, 1987) extended
this analysis using panel data techniques that allowed for the disentangling of aging
from cohort effects. These, and other similar analyses, have focused either on the
determinants of migration decisions or on the effects of migration on labor market
outcomes and earnings and have been mostly confined to the United States. More
recently, Antolin and Bover (1997) and Giannetti (2001) have explored migration
related issues within Europe, investigating why the rate of European Union internal
migration has been very low, despite the pronounced regional disparities which persist
in many European Union countries.
        The relationship between migration decisions and migrant health status (especially
in the long-run) still remains a relatively neglected topic in the economics literature.
According to Hull (1979) individual health status can affect migration decisions (the
health selection hypothesis), and migration can affect the health of those who move
(due to disruption of individual life and adaptation to new environments and due
to better health care services in the hosting country), those who stay (due to remit-
tances from migrants), and perhaps even the health of the hosting populations (due
to diffusion of new pathologies and/or new life styles). From an economic standpoint,
understanding the net effect of migration on health status is important for several
reasons. In terms of economic growth the “healthy body” drain could negatively af-
fect sending countries and benefit hosting counties. In addition, this drain could have
significant long-term public finance consequences for origin and destination countries.
In fact, the benefits of increasing productivity and higher economic growth due to
migration flows could be counter-balanced by long-term health care and social assis-
tance costs if migration results in deteriorating health status. The relevance of these
problems has been magnified in recent years as migration flows have dramatically
increased.1

        According to a report commissioned by the BBC World Service (Fix et al., 2009), in 2005 the


                                                  1
    Italy has a relatively unique migration experience, which makes it a valuable case
study. Migration took place in two concentrated waves, the first abroad and the
second internal from the South and Northeast of Italy to the Northwest and the
region near Rome. These migration flows were a direct consequence of especially
harsh living conditions in the South and were accompanied by two secular societal
changes. First, employment for women virtually collapsed. Second, the agricultural
sector shrank dramatically, especially in the Northwest, as industrialization made
rapid strides. The historical record shows that men led the migration process and
that women and children followed, i.e., men went to the North for “work reasons”,
while women followed for “family reasons”.
    In this paper, we study the health effects of internal migration from Southern and
Northeastern regions of Italy to Northwestern ones and to the region around Rome,
which was concentrated over a relatively short period of time from 1950 to 1970.
We are able to test if current health differences between migrants and non-migrants
are purely due to selection effects at the origin, or to living conditions effects at the
destination. Our study improves on the existing literature in substantial ways. First,
because our dataset includes information on the region of birth of each person, we can
conduct a comparison between migrants and and non-migrants from the origin regions
as well as between migrants and non-migrants in the destination region. Second, we
compare the health of migrants to non-migrants more than 30 years after migration for
one cohort and over 40 years after migration for another cohort, allowing us to identify
long term impacts. Third, because we examine internal migration, heterogeneity
among sending or origin regions is considerably reduced.
    There are many intuitive reasons for expecting that health-effects of migration
are not constant across the population, some of which we explore in this paper.
We distinguish between impacts on women and men as we expect the existence of
some heterogeneity driven by differences in their life experiences (mainly due to work
experiences). We also distinguish the experience of “early” migrants with that of
“late” migrants as it is likely that health effects of migration are influenced by whether
the migrants were “pioneers” and also by the states of the origin and destination
regions over time. We also expect heterogeneous effects on some characteristics that
number of international migrants was close to 195 million, a value two and a half times greater than
the 75 million recorded in 1960.


                                                 2
are unobserved in our data. Arguably, an important unobserved characteristic is
whether the person lived in a rural or urban area at the “origin”. We estimate finite
mixture models (Mclachlan and Peel, 2000; Deb and Trivedi, 1997) to explore the
possibility of such heterogeneity, to estimate heterogeneous effects of migration and
to characterize the sources of such unobserved heterogeneity.
    In what follows, section 2 introduces a short review of the literature on the rela-
tionship between health status and migration decision. Section 3 provides a historical
overview of internal migration in Italy since the second World War. Section 4 intro-
duces our empirical strategy and the econometric model and section 5 presents the
data. Section 6 discusses the empirical results and provides some interpretations. We
wrap up with conclusions in section 7.


2     Health status and migration: a review of the
      literature
The empirical relationship between migration decision and health status can be exam-
ined from two different points of view: one can compare the health status of migrants
to that of the hosting population, or to that of the origin country. As noted by Lu
(2008), the vast majority of the existing literature on migration and health compares
the health status of migrants to that of the population in the destination countries,
rather than to that in the origin countries. According to this literature, immigrants
are found to be generally healthier than hosting populations. However, this health
advantage deteriorates over time (Anson, 2004; Feranil, 2005; Marmot, Adelstein,
and Bulusu, 1984a, 1984b; Palloni and Morenoff, 2001) due to harsh life conditions
in the new country. This phenomenon has been referred to in the literature as the
“epidemiological paradox”.
    A number of studies examine the short run health effects of migration relative
to the origin population. When compared to the origin populations, Kanaiaupuni
and Donato (1999) found that infant mortality declined with the increased flow of
remittances for five Mexican states that have traditionally sent migrants to the U.S..
Carballo et al. (1998) showed that migration involves a great deal of stress and
anxiety. Antman (2010) showed that migration to the U.S. increased the likelihood
that an elderly parent “left behind” in Mexico would be in poor physical and men-

                                           3
tal health. Lu (2012) shows that adults left behind by migrants in the context of
Indonesia are more susceptible to stress-related health impairments and to psycho-
logical distress than others. Andaln, et al (2012) show that households of internal
migrants within Mexico exhibit worse adult and child health in the near term than
non-migrant households. Gibson and McKenzie (2007) showed that migrants from
Tonga to New Zealand had lower health status than those in a control group who did
not migrate. They exploited a New Zealand immigrant lottery as an instrument to
identify the causal effect of migration on health. But other research on the same data
shows favorable effects of migration (Hildebrandt and McKenzie, 2005). In addition,
Frank and Hummer (2002) also find that the incidence of low birthweight is reduced
in households with migrants. In sum, it appears that, while migrants have better
health and lower mortality than the local-born population due to the selection of
the fittest applicants for immigration, migration may also have a negative impact on
the health status of migrants due to the multiple physical and psychosocial strains
affecting them during the entire process of migration.


3     Italian migration flows: a brief overview
Italy experienced large migration flows since its unification in 1860, mostly in two
waves. The first wave took place before World War II, when the vast majority of
migrants went to other European countries and to North and South America. Between
1880 and 1920, approximately 14 million Italians left for the New World (Favero and
Tassello, 1978; Sori, 1979). The second large migration occurred after World War II,
from 1946 until 1970. Italian migration in this era included a new phenomenon: a
mass internal migration from the South and Northeast of Italy to the Northwest.
    According to a Report prepared in 1951 by the Parliamentary Commission on
Poverty, these migration flows were a direct consequence of harsh living conditions
faced by a large share of the Italian population. Overall, 870,000 households stated
that they had not consumed meat, sugar or wine in a whole year. More than 3 million
households did not consume adequate food calories and over 600,000 households did
not wear serviceable shoes. Many of the households interviewed were still sharing
their living with animals in caves and cellars. These harsh living conditions were
heterogeneous across regions. For example, the share of households with more than

                                          4
4 persons living in a single room was 2.9% in the North and 15.5% in the South.
Similarly, the share of households with scarce or no consumption of meat, sugar and
wine was 6.9% in the North and an incredible 57% in the South.
   The Italian situation reflects many features of general trends in migration also
witnessed in other European countries. However, what made Italy different from
the rest of Europe was that the internal migration process occurred after WWII was
concentrated in a relatively short time span (1955-1975), as clearly shown in Figures
1 and 2. In fact, as reported by Bonifazi and Heinz (2000, p.112), “in the early 1950s,
Italy was still mainly agricultural and rural: 43% of the workforce was employed in
the primary sector and 27% of the population lived in municipalities with fewer than
5,000 inhabitants. The economic growth of subsequent years radically changed the
situation, enabling the growth of a definitive modern industrial sector able to compete
in European markets. Inevitably, this process coincided with enormous population
flows. The major industrial areas in northwestern Italy concentrated in the ‘industrial
triangle’ of Milan, Turin and Genoa, which together with Rome were powerful points
of attraction that could absorb immigrants from adjacent provinces and regions, and
also from the regions of northeastern Italy and the South. After this intense initial
phase ended in the early 1970s, the flows tended to follow patterns less linked to
regional economic imbalances.”
   It is important to note that, despite the sustained period of economic expansion,
the total number of employed workers in Italy decreased by 1,524,000 between 1959
and 1971 of which a disproportionate share of 1,212,000 were women (ISTAT, 1976,
Table 107.) Employment declined by 500,000 over the period 1959-1963, almost en-
tirely among women. Some authors have questioned these data (Padoa-Schioppa,
1977; Cacioppo, 1982), claiming that official statistical sources were not able to cap-
ture the vast complexity of the occupational opportunities (mainly informal market)
that women were able to exploit, but it would be difficult not to acknowledge gender
differences. The primary sector was the most affected sector in terms of job losses.
All regions were equally affected, although the timing was different, with Northern
regions experiencing this phenomenon before Central and Southern regions. The
contraction of the labor force in the agricultural sector was so intense that in some
regions there was a complete abandonment of rural areas. In the Southern regions


                                          5
the abandonment was slower and connected to migration flows (both internal and
international).
    Changing labor market and living conditions over the decades of migration and
differences in those conditions between the Southern and Northwestern regions lead
us to separately analyze the sample from which migration “pioneers” would have been
drawn from the sample from which later migrants were drawn.


4     Empirical strategy and econometric model
Over time, the stock of health of each individual can deteriorate (improve) as long as
the individual investment in health is lower (greater) than his/her health deteriora-
tion. If we assume that the origin region is the South of Italy while the destination
region is the North of Italy, then we can define the following variables:

    • H s,n is the health status at time t of an individual who migrated at time t − k
      from the south to the north;

    • H s,s is the health status at time t of an individual who did not migrate at time
      t − k from the south.

    If we observe that H s,s ≤ H s,n , and assuming that k is large, this may be the
result of one or both of the following situations:

    • migrants were positively selected in terms of health status and living and work-
      ing conditions in the destination regions did not play an important role;

    • migrants were not positively selected in terms of health status, but they found
      better living and working conditions in the destination region;

    Similarly, if we observe that H s,s ≥ H s,n , this may be the result of one or both of
the following situations:

    • migrants were positively selected in terms of health status, but living and work-
      ing conditions in the destination region did play an important role;




                                            6
   • migrants where not positively selected in terms of health status and living and
      working conditions in the destination region had a negative impact on health
      status.

   Clearly, following this approach we could also compare situations like H s,n ≤ H n,n
or H s,n ≥ H n,n . However, these are comparisons of migrants to individuals in the
destination rather than in the origin region, thus are considerably less interesting (Lu,
2008).
   A corollary of this conceptual framework is that the long-term health effects of
migration may be substantially heterogeneous. In fact, we should expect the effect
to be different for men and women, as well as for individuals in the early versus late
cohorts. We expect living and, especially, working conditions to be quite different
for men than for women. Migrants in early cohorts would be pioneers and face sub-
stantially unknown conditions while migrants in later cohorts would be more likely to
arrive to locations where others had already migrated. Finally, as standard migration
theories (Harris and Todaro, 1970; Basu, 1997) and empirical evidence (Lanzona,
1998; Agesa, 2001) suggest, migration from rural areas will likely be quite different
than migration from urban areas. Thus health outcome effects of migration may differ
by rural-urban status in the origin location. For all these reasons, our econometric
strategy is to take into account all the heterogeneity that we believe will shape the
results of our analysis.
   We identify these effects using the following econometric specification:

  Hi = β0 + β1 Misn + β2 AgeatMisn + β3 Mio + β4 AgeatMio
                                                          + β5 BornNi + Xi α + i (1)

where i refers to the individual and Hi is the health component summary measure.
The variable Agei denotes age in years, M SN is an indicator variable that equals 1
for individuals who moved from the South or Northeast to the Northwest or Rome
while M O is an indicator for individuals who migrated across other regions, i.e.,
within South, within North and North to South. AgeatM SN and AgeatM O measure
exposure to the origin region among migrants. Specifically, AgeatM SN is the age
at which the individual migrated from the “South” to the “North”. AgeatM O is
the age at which the individual migrated across “other” regions. Both AgeatM SN

                                           7
and AgeatM O are equal to zero for non-migrants, i.e, among individuals who were
not exposed to migration. Xi is a vector of control variables consisting of age and
education (measured at individual level) and income in 1931 and migration rate out
of the region in 1945 (measured at regional level).
       The coefficient β1 incorporates both selection effects and treatment effects of mi-
gration. The coefficient β2 denotes the effect of a year of exposure to the origin (South
and Northeast) for migrants. Thus, if any positive health effect of migration is entirely
due to selection, we expect only origin effects (β1 > 0) and no migration treatment
effects (β2 = 0). In other words, if differences between migrants and non-migrants
are purely due to selection, exposure to the origin conditions among migrants should
not affect outcomes. Alternatively, suppose that migration improves health because
of exposure to better living and environmental conditions in the North. Then, β2 < 0
regardless of the existence of selection effects at the origin. In this case, however, β1
incorporates both selection and living/working condition effects.
       Finally, for the issue of heterogeneity due to rural vs. urban migration, although
we know current rural/urban status, we do not observe migrant rural/urban status
in the origin community. If rural-urban origin status is an important determinant
of outcomes, a simple regression of outcomes on migration status would produce
a sort of “average” estimate, which might be not particularly insightful for either
rural or urban migrants. Thus, we explore the possible effects of such unobserved
heterogeneity by estimating a finite mixture model for the distribution of the errors
in the equation above.2
       Following Deb and Trivedi (1997), the density function for a C-component finite
mixture is
                                                                        C
                                                                        X
                    f (y|x; θ1 , θ2 , ..., θC ; π1 , π2 , ..., πC ) =         πj fj (y|x; θj )   (2)
                                                                        j=1

     Finite Mixture Models have received increasing attention in the statistics literature mainly
because of the number of areas in which such distributions are encountered (see McLachlan andPeel,
2000; Lindsay, 1995, for numerous applications). Econometric applications of finite mixture models
include the seminal work of Heckman and Singer (1984) to labor economics, Wedel et al.(1993)
to marketing data, El-Gamal and Grether(1995) to data from experiments indecision making under
uncertainty, Deb and Trivedi(1997) to the economics of health care. More recent applications include
Ayyagari, et al. (2013) and Deb, et al. (2011) in studies of BMI and alcohol consumption, Bruhin,
et al. (2010) to experimental data and Caudill et al (2009) and Günther and Launov (2012) to issues
in economic development.

where 0 < πj < 1, and              j=1   πj = 1 and fj denotes an appropriate density given the
characteristics of the error terms. As we will describe below, normally (Gaussian)
distributed components appear to be appropriate in the context of the outcome of
interest. We estimate the parameters of this model using maximum likelihood.
        As a further step, in post estimation, we calculate the posterior probability that
observation yi belongs to component c (the prior probability is assumed to be a
constant):

                                                  πc fc (yi |xi , θc )
             Pr[yi ∈ population c|xi , yi; θ] = PC                            ,   c = 1, 2, ..C   (3)

which we use to explore the determinants of class membership, and especially to see
if these determinants are consistent with our a priori notion that rural/urban status
at the origin is a likely source of essential unobserved heterogeneity.


5         Data and descriptive statistics
The data used for the empirical analysis are from the Multiscopo Survey (MS), con-
ducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics in 2004-2005 (ISTAT, 2005). This
survey is conducted every 5 years with the aim of evaluating prevalence of chronic
health conditions and the use of the health care services in the Italian population.
MS includes information on health conditions, disabilities, life styles, prevention, use
of health care services and several socio-demographic variables. The dataset includes
50,474 households, for a total of 128,040 individuals, sampled in 1,465 areas known
as “comune”. In addition to the information available in the public-use MS datasets,
ISTAT provided us with information on the region of birth of each individual and
the number of years the person has lived in the region observed at the time of the
survey, giving us the opportunity to identify the migration flows and the duration of
migration.3
        The outcomes in our analysis are two recognized measures of health status, the
Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS),
    3
    Note that if an individual migrated from one region to another more than once, we would observe
duration of migration away from the birth region with error, as we would only observe the duration
of the final migration. However, multiple spells of migration are rare in the Italian context.



                                                       9
which are based on the SF-12 (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller, 1996). The SF-12 contains
12 questions in which people are asked about the following topics:

  1.   Limitations in performing moderate physical activities, such as moving a table.
  2.   Limitations in climbing several flights of stairs.
  3.   Extent to which pain interfered with normal work.
  4.   Whether they accomplished less than they would like at work or other regular
       activity as a result of their physical health.
  5.   Whether they were limited in kind of work or other activities as a result of their
       physical health.
  6.   How often they felt calm and peaceful.
  7.   How often they felt downhearted and blue.
  8.   Whether they accomplished less than they would like at work or other regular
       activity as a result of emotional problems.
  9.   Whether they didn’t do work or other activities as carefully as usual as a result
       of emotional problems.
 10.   How often they felt that they had a lot of energy.
 11.   How often physical health or emotional problems interfered with social activi-
       ties.
 12.   Overall rating of health (from excellent to poor).

   Responses to these questions are combined to form two summary scores. The
PCS weights responses to the first five items more heavily, while the MCS weights
responses to items 6-9 more heavily. Each score is typically scaled to have a mean
of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the reference population. We multiply each
score by 100 so that the scores are centered at 5,000 in the reference population.
   Regressors include dummies for migration distinguishing between the migration
variable of interest (from south and northeast to northwest and Rome) from other
migration, the age at which the individual migrated to capture exposure to the des-
tination, coded as zero for non-migrants, a dummy for location of birth, and control
variables including age, education and gender.
   We conduct separate analyses for men and women. As described in Section 3,
there are historical reasons to expect different effects for women than for men. In
addition, while selection effects among men may be large, given the expectation that
only the “fittest” men would consider making the migrant’s journey, one would expect
less selection on health fitness for the women who “followed” them.


                                           10
    We also expect results to vary by wave of migration. For this reason we define as
“early cohort” individuals born between 1925 and 1945 (60 to 80 years old in 2005)
and as “early” migrants those among them who moved before 1965. Similarly, we
define as “late” cohort individuals born between 1945 and 1965 (40 to 60 years old in
2005) and as “late” migrants those among them who moved before 1975. As standard
in all migration waves, we expect the early cohort to experience different conditions
at both origin and destination and, possibly, exhibit different selection effects into
migration as compared to the late cohort. Thus we also estimate separate models for
early and late cohorts.
    Our final samples, after a small amount of listwise deletion for missing values,
consist of 11,050 and 12,895 individuals for early cohort males and females and 15,730
and 16,326 individuals for their late cohort counterparts. Table 1 shows summary
statistics for the outcomes and regressors for each of these samples. Health status is
apparently better in the late cohort, but they are also 20 years younger on average.
Migration rates were about 7.5% in the early cohort and about 1 percentage point
lower in the late cohort.


6     Empirical results
Tables 2 and 3 present OLS estimates of migration on PCS and MCS respectively. In
both cases, there is little evidence of migrant or exposure effects, except for physical
health of women in the early cohort. In this case, the results show that South (and
Northeast) to Northwest migrant women are significantly healthier than non-migrant
women and that the health of migrant women is better the earlier they migrated to
the North, i.e., the shorter their exposure to the South. Some of the “other” migration
coefficients are also significant, but it is difficult to interpret these effects because other
migration includes within-region migration, and because these are relatively few in
number. The effects of other demographic characteristics are statistically significant
and intuitive. Those who were born in the North have significantly better physical
and mental health. Older and less educated individuals report worse physical and
mental health.
    There are a number of important sources of unobserved heterogeneity that may
mask significant effects for some groups of migrants. As we have mentioned above,

                                              11
the health outcomes for rural to urban migrants may be quite different than those
for urban to urban or rural to rural migrants. Indeed, evidence of the existence
of such heterogeneity may be seen in figures 3 - 6. These figures are kernel density
estimates of the distribution of OLS residuals from our model in equation 1. Especially
for the early cohort samples shown in figure 3 for physical health and figure 5 for
mental health, the distributions of the residuals indicate the existence of bimodal
distributions of errors. In addition, as these are “textbook” examples of mixtures of
Gaussian distributions, we conduct our subsequent analyses using finite mixtures of
Gaussian distributions.
      Parameter estimates of the finite mixture model for PCS are reported in table 4 for
the early cohort and in table 5 for the late cohort. Similarly, parameter estimates for
MCS are reported in tables 6 and 7 for the early and late cohorts respectively. These
results support the graphical impression that migrant health outcomes are generated
by two different distributions. Individuals in component 1 have lower physical and
mental health status than individuals in component 2. For example, in the early
cohort the predicted mean PCS for males and females in component 1 are 4,107
and 3,884 respectively, while the mean PCS in component 2 are 5,436 and 5,361
respectively.4 Now, very consistent evidence emerges for the early cohort samples.
Although there are no migration effects for males, there is a statistically significant
and substantial improvement in physical and mental health for females who started
out in lower health. In other words, migrant women in component 1 exhibit better
health via the migrant status dummy for PCS and via the exposure variable (age of
South to North migration) for both PCS and MCS. The estimates on the exposure
coefficient are also remarkably similar, a decrease of 16.2 in PCS and of 15.3 in MCS
for every year spent in the South.
      Focusing on the results for the early cohort in tables 4 and 6, we find once again
a consistent negative effect of age and low education on health for individuals in
both components. Being born in the North has a significant effect on PCS for men
and women in component 1 but a significant effect on MCS for men and women in
component 2.
      The estimated class probabilities are informative vis-a-vis our speculative hypoth-

esis that the distributions are drawn from rural and urban populations, with the
evidence consistent with the view that component 1 represents the rural population.
First, note that in table 4, for the early cohort, the probabilities of being in component
1 are 0.59 and 0.68 for the male and female samples respectively, while for the later
cohort, reported in Table 5, the class 1 probabilities drop to 0.46 and 0.54 respectively.
These magnitudes of the probabilities and the decline over cohorts are consistent with
estimates of the rural population rates and changes over the relevant decades (United
Nations, 2011) as shown in figure 7. Second, we characterize class membership, for
the sample of non-migrants in the early cohort, by estimating OLS regressions of the
posterior probability (multiplied by 100) of belonging to class 1 on an indicator for
born in the North, age, education status and current height. The results presented in
table 8 support the rural-urban categorization. Shorter non-migrants are more likely
to be in class 1. This is consistent with a long tradition of nutritional studies and
population studies that sees in rural population a less healthy and shorter population
due to non-optimal diet. Furthermore, low educated individuals are more prone to
belong to rural areas. This is consistent with the fact that illiteracy rates are higher
in rural areas (Barberis, 2009). Finally, individuals born in the North are less likely
to be in class 1. While all of these evidence point towards heterogeneous effects of
migration by rural-urban status, these analyses are exploratory so other explanations
for the latent classes cannot be ruled out.
   Overall, the results obtained show that less healthy (rural) women benefited from
migration; migration does not appear to have benefited men. This is an interesting
result and prompts the question of why only women - more specifically less healthy
women - benefited and not men? The findings are consistent with the historical
record which shows that men led the migration process and that women and children
followed, i.e., healthy men went to the North for “work reasons”, while women just
followed as wives for “family reasons”. Men may have been positively selected on
health status but would have faced harsh, industrial work environments at the desti-
nation. For women, one expects less positive selection, so that the fact that migrant
women’s health is better suggests that, although there might still be some amount
of positive selection, the majority of the improvement could be attributed to better

7         Conclusion
The historical record of Italy allows us to study a relatively unique migration experi-
ence from Southern and Northeastern regions of Italy to Northwestern regions and to
the region around Rome concentrated over a relatively short period from 1950-1970.
We find little evidence of health effects of migration in our analysis using OLS re-
gression. When we allow for heterogeneous effects, over and above heterogeneity by
gender and cohort, we find very consistent evidence for the early cohort samples. Al-
though there is no migration health effect for males, there is a statistically significant
and substantial improvement in physical and mental health for females who started
out in lower health and who very likely migrated from rural areas. In addition, for
these women the effect can be attributed to better living conditions at the destination
and not simply due to selection. We find no evidence of migration-health effects for
the later cohort.
        As described above, in the years following WWII Italy went through a period of
profound economic and social change that transformed the country from a agricultural
to an industrial economy. These changes particularly affected women and their labor
choices. Phenomena such as economic development, the exodus from the rural areas
and internal migration all played a role in shaping a new form of relationship between
women and the labor market. During the period of the early waves of migration,
the South and Northeast of Italy were substantially rural and much poorer, and
had inferior infrastructure compared to the Northwest of Italy and around Rome.
Thus, migrants moved away from substantial deprivation to urban areas with better
living conditions. Unfortunately, men who made that journey would then have been
confronted by poor industrial working conditions. Women, by and large, would have
not been engaged in the formal labor market and would have been spared the ill effects
    5
    The dataset has no childhood measures of health so it is not possible to test the selection
hypothesis rigorously. Nevertheless, assuming that today’s height is a good proxy for height in
teenage years when individuals migrated, we estimated probit models of migration from South to
North for males and females in the early cohort who were born in the South on age, education status
and height. These results, available upon request, show that the effect of height is not statistically
significant for males or females, arguably ruling out substantial selection effects.



                                                 14
of those working conditions. By the time of the later waves of migration, however,
the South had become considerably more industrialized and urban, and women were
much more likely to be engaged in the formal labor market.
   Our empirical results are consistent with the historical record suggesting that
long term health improvements may be observed in migrant populations relative to
their peers in the origin location but only if the improved living conditions at the
destination are not countered by worse working conditions. In the developing country
context, to the extent that migrant households from poor, rural areas migrate to
richer, urban areas, we may expect to see long term health improvements for women
and children, but not for men who may often take up undesirable jobs in undesirable
work environments.
