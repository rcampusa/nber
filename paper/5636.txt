         Arguably the most important development     in recent decades in US factor markets is the

decline in the relative wage of the unskilled.   By contrast, in Europe it is undoubtedly   the rise

and persistence of unemployment.      Technology has been identified as a key reason for the rising

US wage inequality, while labor market rigidities are often cited as a key reason for European

unemployment.      This paper seeks to provide a unified account of these major factor market

developments.    It models the impact of technical change on relative wages and unemployment

in a world in which one country has flexible and the other rigid labor market institutions.     The

results depart significantly   but sensibly from what one would expect in a fully flexible wage

world.   A few stylized facts help to narrow the field to a few candidates to account for these

factor market developments.

1       Introduction

         1.1     A Global Approach

        Over the past twenty years factor market developments in the United States and much of

Europe have contrasted sharply.1 Arguably the most important development in the United States

is the sharp decline in the relative wage of the unskilled. By contrast, in Europe the most

important development is undoubtedly the rise and persistence of unemployment.       A growing body

of research traces the growing wage inequality in the United States to technical change. One

interpretation   of the rising unemployment in Europe focuses on labor market rigidities.

        There is an important respect in which these accounts are unsatis~ing.    The United States

and Europe are part of a single global economy, and they share a common technological regime.

Yet research has focused on the cases one at a rime. This suggests that an important check of the

robustness of these accounts is to examine them in a unified model of a trading world, It must

provide a general equilibrium determination of wages and unemployment, while allowing for

cross-country    differences in the structure of labor market institutions. The model of Davis (1996)

provides just such a framework. The present paper considers the implications of technical change

for the evolution of wages and unemployment in a global trading equilibrium.

        This study has a single central message. Allowing for even one of the countries in a

trading world to have rigid labor market institutions fundamentally alters the link between

technical change and factor returns~or the whole world. At times the results will be exactly

contrary to those derived in a fully flexible wage setting. Nonetheless our flexible wage results




        1 See e.g. Freeman and Katz ( 995) and CEPR (1995).

                                                    1
continue to provide insight. They are here key to understanding movements in employment in the

economy with real rigidities.z

       From a wide array of comparative statics considered, the paper identifies just a few that

seem to be of real interest. These hold promise of providing a unified account of the major factor

market developments of recent decades in both the United States and Europe.




        1.2       Back~ound

       The role of technical change in giving rise to observed movements in skilled to unskilled

wages has been a source of great interest and controversy, Some researchers, as Berman, Bound,

and Griliches (1994), have identified technical change as the central cause for the decline of

unskilled relative wages in the United States. This viewpoint has been supported by the work of

Lawrence and Slaughter (1993), and Berman, Machin and Bound (1996), among others. A

contra~ view has been advanced by Learner (1994), with a more mixed picture emerging in

Learner (1995).

        This discussion has focused on the role of labor-saving technical change, with the

computer revolution particularly in mind. However there has been some dispute about the

relevance of factor versus sector bias in technical change, as in Learner (1995) and Krugman

(1995). Learner focused on a case in which the United States is a small country, and in which

technical change is local. Krugman focused on a case in which the United States is a large country




        2 The departures from conventional flexible wage results here underscore the importance
of considering all three elements of the Freeman, Katz (1995) Supply-Demand-Institutions
paradigm within a unified general equilibrium fi-amework.

                                                  2
and the technical change is global. In the former, the sector bias of technical change is key,

whereas in the latter conditions are specified under which only the factor bias matters for the

qualitative effects on relative wages. Freeman and Katz (1995) concur with Krugman that many

of the major tectilcal    innovations should be looked on as global rather than local shocks. Thus if

one also wants to account for the different experience of Europe and America regarding wages,

one cannot look only at technology. If technical progress is to be part of the explanation, then it

must be via the form in which local labor institutions mediate the shocks.

         There are a few stylized facts that will prove usefil in considering the theory [see Freeman

and Katz (1995)]. (1A) The relative position of unskilled in the United States has deteriorated

more sharply in the US than in Europe. (lB) A stronger version of this would state that the

relative wage of the unskilled declined in the United States while it was unchanged in Europe.

(2) Unemployment      in Europe rises. (3A) Some work, as in Lawrence and Slaughter (1993), has

suggested that this occurred at unchanged relative goods prices. (3B) Other work, such as

Krueger (1995) and Sachs and Shatz (1995) has argued that the relative price of unskilled

intensive goods has fallen. (4) Measured skill intensities of production have been rising, even

where the relative wage of skill has risen. We will take this in a weak form, excluding cases in

which skill intensity falls in all sectors.

        The paper has three additional sections, Section 2 outlines the global trading model.

Section 3 develops some basic concepts regarding the links between technical change and factor

returns. It then derives the implications of technical change for relative wages and unemployment

when one country features a rigid minimum wage. Section 4 concludes.

2       A Simple Model of Trade and Unemployment

        In this section we develop a simple model on which to found our analysis of the effects of

technical change on trade, wages and unemployment, The basic structure of the economy will be

that of the canonical Heckscher-Ohlin   model. This is amended to allow for a rigid real wage for

the unskilled, in the spirit of Brecher (1974).3 The general equilibrium links between endowments,

goods prices and factor prices, and the link to the level of unemployment are illustrated in a

diagram from Davis (1996). Conditions are noted which allow even economies with sharply

divergent factor market institutions to feature factor price equalization,4 Since many of the           ‘

comparative statics that we later consider will lead factor price equalization to break down, we

also develop an import demand, export supply framework for determining equilibrium. This

emphasizes that in the presence of factor -- hence goods -- price rigidities, equilibrium in markets

is attained by movements in the level of employment.




         3 In choosing this approach, we abstract from the important issue of the source of wage
rigidity. This is justified by the transparency that it allows in examining the already complex links
between technology, trade, factor prices and unemployment. One more explicit approach is to
treat the minimum wage as the result of a simple game between governments, as in Davis (1996).
This remains a direction for additional research,

        4 Using a model which features factor price equalization as a benchmark is justified by the
great simplicity it yields to the analysis. However, as Learner (1994) has emphasized, the FPE
result implies that conditional on goods prices, technology, and diversified production, factor
prices are independent of local factor supplies. The work of Freeman and Katz (1 995), as well as
that of Robbins (1996), suggests that local relative factor supplies do matter for relative wages,
This suggests the value of pursuing extensions to the present study in directions in which local
factor supplies do matter.

                                                  4
        Consider the integrated world economy.s The structure of this economy is the simple

Heckscher-Ohlin   model, except that employment of unskilled labor will be subject to a binding

minimum wage. There are two goods, X and Y. Let P be the relative price of X in terms of Y, We

assume that preferences of all consumers are identical and homothetic. Thus the ratio of Xto Y

consumed depends only on relative goods prices. Technologies are constant returns to scale. We

assume that at all factor price ratios, and for all comparative statics on technology, X is the

relatively skill intensive good. Both goods and factor markets are perfectly competitive.

       The goods are produced with skilled and unskilled labor, available in fixed supply given by

Hand L. Since the skilled wage is assumed flexible, skilled labor will always be filly employed.

Market clearing requires:

                               Hx+Hr=H

With a minimum wage for unskilled labor above the market clearing level, unskilled labor will not

be filly employed. Letting N be world unskilled employment, U be the number of unemployed,

and L the number of unskilled, the factor market constraint is that:

                       Nx+Nr+U=N+U=L

       The contrast between the flexible and rigid real wage worlds is summarized in a simple

diagram from Davis (1996), appearing as Figure 1. Two relations sufice to describe the essentials

of the global economy. The first can be thought of as a “Heckscher-Ohlin”     mapping between the

relative world endowment, h   ❑   H/L,   and the equilibrium relative goods price, P. This appears in


         5 Dixit and Norman (1980) turn the parableofSamuelson(1949)      into a powefil analytic
device. They establish conditions under which a fill employment world with trade but no factor
mobility replicates the “integrated equilibrium” of an economy with perfect goods and factor
mobility. Davis (1996) extends this to the case in which one country has unemployment (due to
rigid real wages) while the other does not.

                                                   5
quadrant one, and has the sensible result that a world relatively more abundant in skill will have a

lower relative price of the skill intensive good. The second relation can be thought of as a

“Stolper-Samuelson”    mapping between relative goods prices and factor prices. While this is

typically written as a relation with relative factor prices, it is more convenient to depict it as a

relation between the goods price, P, and the wage of the unskilled, w~. This appears in quadrant 2.

This has the sensible interpretation that the wage of the unskilled is directly tied to the relative

price of the good that employs the unskilled relatively intensively. Heuristically, one can think of

the path of determination in the flexible wage economy as moving from the exogenous world

endowments to the equilibrium goods price, and thus to establish the return for unskilled labor.

       However this path is not available when there is a rigid minimum wage for the unskilled at

a level w~* above the flexible wage, w~F. The Stolper-Samuelson       relation continues to hold




                                                   6
exactly, ‘Ifin equilibrium the unskilled wage is to be w~*, then this must be supported by an

equilibrium goods price of P*. But the Heckscher-Ohlin      relation holds now not in terms of

endowments, but in terms of employed factors. If the equilibrium goods prices are to be P*, then

the employment composition must be at h* > h. Since all skilled labor is employed, due to its

flexible wage, equilibrium requires that unemployment among the unskilled rise to the point that

employed factors are in the ratio h*. Given the world endowment of skilled and unskilled labor,

this will determine a precise level of unemployment. This can be done for each level that the

minimum wage could be set at. This gives rise to what I have termed the “Brecher” relation, afier

Brecher (1 974), which appears in quadrant four.

        The conditions under which a world with distinct countries linked by goods trade

replicates this integrated world economy is detailed in Davis (1996). A key result is that in spite of

the institutional differences, and the fact that unemployment arises only in the country that

implements the minimum wage, free trade in commodities leads to complete factor price

equalization. The reason is that in spite of the institutional differences, trade equates goods prices,

hence all producers face the same zero profit conditions, which in turn yield equal factor prices.

       Here we develop a two country version of this model that builds on these insights.G But

since we will consider comparative statics that introduce cross-country    differences in

technologies, our framework must be robust to failures of factor price equalization. Consider a

world with two countries, which following Krugman (1995) we will call America and Europe.

The essential difference between America and Europe lies in their factor market institutions.

America is a flexible wage, fill employment economy. Europe has a rigid minimum wage for the


       GWe assume here and throughout that both countries are always diversified in production.

                                                   7
unskilled set at w~* in terns of the numeraire. The two countries have conventional market

clearing conditions for skilled labor. But these conditions look different for America and Europe

in the market for unskilled labor. For America:

                         LXA.+ L+. = L.4.


But in Europe, the condition instead appears as:

                         NxE+NrE+U=@+U=LE

        A key insight to the international equilibrium is that with wages -- and so goods prices --

fixed, it is unemployment that adjusts to clear the market. Thus, we can depict the international

equilibrium in an import demand/export     supply framework with European unemployment      on the

vertical axis. This appears as Figure 2.

        Where the minimum wage w~* binds, goods prices must be P*. But since American import

demand depends only on the price P*, it is independent of the level of European unemployment.

The role that European unemployment plays is to make the unskilled good sufficiently scarce so

as to support the price P*. Thus at this price, Europe is obliged to meet whatever excess demand

or supply the rest of the world may present to it at P*. Given our assumptions on demand and

technology, European unemployment rises linearly with the world excess demand for X.

Equilibrium is determined at point T, with unemployment at the level T’.

        The case depicted in Figure 2 is the benchmark case developed in Davis (1996), in which

America and Europe have identical endowments. In this case, trade with America doubles

European unemployment from its autarky rate, moving from A to T’. More generally, depending

on the position of the American import demand curve, trade could raise or lower European

unemployment.7




3      Technical Change: Global and Local

       3.1       A Two-Sector Leontief Model

       The effect of technical change on factor prices in the two sector general equilibrium model

has a variety of facets to consider.a These include whether the change is (geographically)      local or

global, the sector bias, the factor bias, elasticities of goods supply and demand, and factor




       7 None of the results derived in this paper depend on the pattern of trade, or equivalently,
whether trade with America raises or lowers European unemployment,

         8 The classic analysis of technical change in the two-sector general equilibrium model with
flexible wages and fill employment is Findlay and Grubert (1959).

                                                  9
substitution.9 For analytic purposes, it is convenient to begin with a model of Leontief

technologies. 10As well, throughout we restrict attention to three cases of factor bias -- neutral,

pure labor saving, and pure skill saving.

        A simple setting for thinking about the links between technical change and factor returns is

that ofMussa(1979)     [see Figure 3]. We consider the case of two goods produced under perfect

competition and constant returns to scale. This yields two conditions equating prices and unit

costs for the respective goods. The concavity of the cost finction assures that in factor price

space the upper contour sets are (weakly) convex, In the case of Leontief technologies, the

respective zero profit conditions are linear.

        P =cx(w~)    w~) =w~am+        wLau             1 = CY(WH,wL) = w~a~        + w~a~~

When production is diversified, equilibrium factor prices are determined by the intersection of the

zero profit curves in factor price space.




         9 If technology was a pure public good, freely available to all, then the local vs. global
distinction would not be relevant -- all shocks would be global. And no doubt one of the
important shocks that we would want to think about -- the microcomputer revolution -- is in
important respects global. Nevertheless, carefil estimation has confirmed the existence and
importance of cross-country technical differences at the industry level, as well as variations in
these across time [see Jorgenson (1995)],

         10We consider the effects of factor substitution in Section 3.4 below. The restriction to
Leontief technologies here was made for three reasons. First, making this restriction allows for a
greatly simplified analysis of a number of points that have remained opaque in previous
treatments. A similar restriction has been made in sections of Learner (1 995) and Krugman
(1995). Second, the work of Lawrence and Slaughter (1993) showing steady rises in skill intensity
across all sectors even as relative skilled wages rose suggests that factor substitution is not the
dominant element of the story. Finally, we will demonstrate below that of the cases in which the
principal qualitative results depend on factor substitution, none satis~ the set of stylized facts that
we use as a screen,

                                                  10
        A few general results from the analysis of technical change in a flexible wage economy will

be useful in considering the effect on relative wages of our experiments. men     good prices are

fixed, the qualitative impact on relative factor prices is entirely determined by the sector in which

the technical change occurs, independent of the factor bias. For example, technical progress in X

always leads to an outward movement of the zero profit curve. As is evident from Figure 3, the

relative skilled wage ahvays rises as a result. This point has been emphasized by Learner (1994).




 Figure 3    Neutral Technical Progress in X
                at Fixed Prices

        When goods prices do adjust endogenously, this bifurcation by sector need not hold. The

reason is that changes in goods prices may mute or reverse the impact effect of technical change

on factor prices. The first step towards understanding this is to determine how the technical

change affects output supplies and demands at unchanged prices, hence to determine the direction

in which goods prices will change. One can then identi~ the cases in which price changes

reinforce the impact effect on the unskilled wage, as well as those in which it may mute or reverse

these effects. The induced price changes will only mute the impact effect when demands and

                                                  11
supplies are sufficiently elastic -- what we will call the “elastic case. ” In the contraty “inelastic

case,” the price movement is sufficient to reverse the impact effect on the unskilled wage. The

possibility that induced price changes may reverse the impact effect of technical change on factor

prices figures prominently in the discussion of Krugman (1995).

        Here Leontief technologies allow a simple conclusion.ll Neutral technical progress at fixed

goods prices always raises output of the progressing sector, while leaving output of the other

sector unchanged. The reason is that with Leontief technologies, neutral progress does not affect

the sectoral allocation of resources. Thus output rises only in the progressing sector. Since the

implied change in income will, with homothetic preferences, raise demand for both goods

proportionally,   it follows that the relative price of the progressing sector’s good must fall. So

neutral technical change always leaves open the possibility that endogenous price changes will

reverse the impact effect on relative factor prices. 12

        Pure labor saving technical progress, in either sector, always raises the output of the labor

intensive good at unchanged prices, while reducing output of the skill intensive good. We

illustrate this for the case of progress in the X sector in Figure 4, Consider the problem in two

steps. For the moment, we fix the resources allocated to Y (at B), and so leave Y output

unchanged. Now note that a pure labor saving change in X means that the initial level of output in

X can be produced with the same level of employed skill and less labor (a move from A to A’). Of




        11For a complete list of results with a flexible wage, see Appendix A,

         12Krugman(1995) provides a convenient boundary case. When technology is Leontief,
tectilcal progress is global, both countries are diversified, and preferences are Cobb-Douglas,
then the induced price changes exactly offset the impact effect of technical progress on relative
wages.

                                                    12
course, this labor will in equilibrium be employed. We can invoke the Rybczynsti        theorem, which

here implies that the output of labor intensive Y will rise while that of X declines at fixed prices.

Since with homothetic demand the incremental income has raised demand for both goods at the

initial prices, this implies an excess supply of the labor intensive good. Its relative price must fall,

which then works toward a rise in the relative skilled wage. Thus, in our example of labor saving

technical change in the X sector, the goods price movement reitiorces the rise in the relative

skilled wage,




Figure 4     Labor Saving Progress in X:
                Output Effects



        If instead the labor saving progress were in the labor intensive sector, then the price

movements instead would mute or reverse the impact effect of technical change. A parallel story

can be told for pure skill saving technical change. This depresses the price of the skill intensive

good, so reinforces the decline in the relative skilled wage if the progress is in the Y sector, but

mutes or reverses the impact effect of skill saving technical progress in the X sector.



                                                   13
        3.2     Technical Change, Wages, and Unemployment

        We now consider the effects of technical change for the case in which Europe imposes a

minimum wage.13 Our base case assumes that technologies in America and Europe are initially

identical. We first consider technical change that is global in scope, and then change that is

localized in Europe or America.

        The effects of global technical change are quite similar to those described above. The ordy

amendment that we need to consider is that any implied changes in the unskilled wage must now

be met with changes in unemployment that return the unskilled wage to its initial level. We saw

above that there were two broad cases to consider. In the elastic case, the unskilled wage is

always depressed by progress of whatever kind in the X sector. Accordingly global technical

progress in X would require a rise in European unemployment to meet the wage target. Progress

in Y, by contrast, would reduce unemployment. In the inelastic case, the induced price changes

may reverse the impact sectoral effects on factor prices. In this case, at unchanged employment,

the unskilled wage will fall with all labor saving technical change (in X or Y), and with neutral

technical change in the Y sector. Accordingly, a rise in European unemployment will be required

to again attain the target wage. By contrast, all skill saving technical change, and neutral technical

change in the X sector will reduce European unemployment. In the full equilibrium, price changes

will always filly offset the impact effect on factor prices. Thus technical change in X of whatever

factor bias will in fi.111
                         equilibrium always lead to a fall in the price of X [See Figure 5]. As well,

technical progress in Y always leads in full equilibrium to a rise in the price of X which returns the

unskilled wage to its initial level. Accordingly, none of the global shocks satis& the Lawrence-

Slaughter criterion that relative goods prices should be unaffected. Nonetheless, all forms of

global progress in the Y sector satisfi the alternative Krueger-Sachs-Shatz     criterion that the

relative price of the unskilled good declined.

           Because incipient rises or declines in the unskilled wage are met with accommodating

changes in unemployment, the level of the unskilled wage is not affected by global technical

progress. The fill equilibrium effect on relative factor prices depends exclusively on the sector of

technical progress. If progress is in the X sector, then the relative wage will be unchanged; if in

the Y sector, then the re!ative wage of the skilled will rise. This is precisely opposite to the

conclusion that one would have in a model with fixed prices and no unemployment          [see Learner

(1995)].




                                                                15
        We may also identifi cases of global technical progress in which the European

unemployment rate rises and the relative wage of the skilled rises. This combination occurs only in

the cases of neutral or labor saving technical change in the Y sector in the inelastic case. Recall

also that since our general system is consistent with factor price equalization, that the global

technical progress will not help us to understand divergent patterns of wage evolution between

Europe and America.]4

        Consider now the case of technical progress which is localized in Europe. The basic

analysis outlined above continues to hold for Europe, with one amendment. There will be a

smaller supply shock for a fixed magnitude of technical change, hence the likelihood of price

changes reversing the impact effect on factor prices is diminished. This will tend to emphasize the

sectoral nature of technical change relative to its factor bias. Now consider the impact of local

European technical change on America. Since America does not experience any technical change,

the fill impact on its relative factor prices is determined ala Stolper-Samuelson   by the

equilibrium changes in goods prices. Thus the relative skilled wage in America will rise as the

equilibrium relative price of X rises. A curious consequence is that local European technical

change gives rise to a magnified relative wage response in America relative to that in Europe.

From above, the European relative skilled wage rises with local tecfilcal    progress in the Y sector,

and is unaffected by progress in the X sector. The effect of local European technical progress on

America is yet more dramatic. When this progress is in the Y sector, the American relative skilled

wage rises faster than in Europe, and when in the X sector actually declines. If we restrict


        14Of course, a sharp result such as this depends on the fill set of assumptions that underlie
the conventional factor price equalization theorem. Departures from these assumptions,
accordingly, may modifi this conclusion.

                                                  16
attention to cases in which European unemployment rises, the relative skilled wage in America

rises, and in which this rise occurs more strongly than in Europe, then we have the cases of

European local technical progress that is either neutral or labor saving in the Y sector. As in the

case of global technical progress, none of the cases of progress in Europe satis~ the Lawrence-

Slaughter criterion that relative goods prices remain fixed, Ml cases of European progress in Y

satis& the Krueger-S achs-Shatz criterion that the relative price of the unskilled intensive good

falls.

            Finally, consider the case of local technical change in America. A first observation is that

since Europe is not experiencing technical change, its commitment to the minimum wage will

mean that in full equilibrium the goods price cannot change. Any induced excess supplies or

demands at this price in America will be filly accommodated                         via changes in employment in

Europe, Hence unemployment in Europe will rise as a result of all local American labor saving



                                                                               17
technical change as well as neutral technical change in the Y sector, It will fall in the remaining

cases. In all cases, European absolute and relative wages are unchanged. By contrast, in Arneric~

since goods prices are constant in equilibrium the changes in relative wages depend only on the

sector in which technical change occurs, not its factor bias. Thus Learner’s suggestion that it is

only the sector bias of technical change that matters is true for local American technical progress

even when America is large in the world, so long as Europe is committed to its minimum wage.

The relative skilled wage in America rises with tecfilcal              progress of any variety in the X sector,

and conversely falls with progress in the Y sector.

             The final case is what we may call the Lawrence-Slaughter-Learner            case [see Figure 7].

This is the case of local American labor saving technical progress in the skill intensive X sector.

This leads to a rise in the American relative skilled wage, no change in the European relative

skilled wage, a rise in European unemployment. The relative goods price is unchanged.



                                                                  18
        3,3      The Role of Factor Substitution

        To this point we have made the strategic assumption that technologies are Leontief. This

greatly simplifies the analysis. However it can affect the qualitative results, so here we consider

the cases where factor substitution matters. One manifestation of the simplicity of the Leontief

framework is that it yields unambiguous predictions of the effects of tectilcal     progress on the

terms of trade. When we allow for factor substitution we will need to reexamine this problem. We

first return to’our fill employment specification, and then consider it within our America/Europe

model with a fixed minimum wage and unemployment.

        Where possible, we substitute away from the factor whose relative price has risen. This

substitution tends to relieve the scarcity of that factor, At fixed goods prices, this implies that

relative to the zero-substitution   case, output will’shift toward the good that uses this factor

intensively. In some cases this only reinforces the effects described earlier, so has qualitatively the

same effect as the Leontief case. This is true for all neutral technical progress, and for factor-

saving progress in the sector that uses that factor intensively. However, this leaves two cases in

which the output effects resulting from factor substitution oppose and may reverse those we have

detailed earlier. This occurs in the cases of labor saving technical progress in the skill intensive

sector, and skill-saving technical progress in the labor intensive sector.

        Consider the case of labor saving technical progress in the skill intensive sector. At

unchanged goods prices, the technical change raises the relative skilled wage. If technologies were

Leontie~ at fixed prices the labor saving progress would lead to a rise in the relative supply of Y.

Here, though, the substitution away from higher-priced skill leads both sectors to economize on

the use of skill, This substitution biases production toward X, and given sufficiently elastic factor


                                                    19
substitution could lead to a rise in the relative supply of X, Thus the relative price of X in

equilibrium would rise if factor substitution possibilities are poor, but fall if these possibilities are

excellent. In the former case, the terms of trade movement reinforces the impact effect on factor

prices. In the latter case, it opposes and potentially could reverse these effects. Thus labor saving

technical progress in the skill intensive sector will tend to raise the relative skilled wage when

factor substitution is poor. However, if factor substitution is excellent, it could depress the

relative wage of the skilled. This is made more likely when substitution in demand across goods is

poor, A parallel ambiguity could be derived for skill saving technical progress in the labor

intensive sector. If factor substitution possibilities are poor, then the relative price of X will fall

and the relative skilled wage will fall for sure. In the substitution possibilities are excellent, the

relative price of X will rise, and this will counteract and perhaps reverse the impact effect which

lowered the relative skilled wage.

        It remains to consider the implications of these results in our fill model with

unemployment. We will continue to relate these changes to the stylized facts developed above.

Consider first the case of labor saving technical progress in the skill intensive sector. Whether this

progress is global, or localized in Europe or America, the new possibility opened up is that at the

initial level of unemployment this could cause the European unskilled wage to rise. Thus, in

equilibrium this could be associated with afall in European unemployment. While this is an

interesting observation, and not obvious, it also conflicts with the stylized fact that European

unemployment has risen. Accordingly, we will rule these out as cases of interest.

       Now consider the case of skill saving technical progress in the labor intensive sector.

Whether this progress is global, or localized in Europe or America, the new possibility opened up


                                                   20
is that at the initial level of unemployment this could cause the European unskilled wage to fall.

Thus, in equilibrium this could be associated with a rise in European unemployment.        This is in

accord with the stylized facts. The equilibrium changes in relative wages, though, are exactly the

same as previously for the various cases. When the progress is global, the relative skilled wage

rises as sharply in Europe as America, violating one of our stylized facts. When this progress is

localized in A.meric~ the relative skilled wage there actually declines, again violating one of our

stylized facts. Finally, when the progress is localized in Europe, the relative skilled wage rises in

Europe, but it rises yet more sharply in America. The one stylized fact that is violated by this case

is that here skill intensity falls in both sectors. Accordingly, we can conclude that none of the

cases that rely on factor substitution to establish qualitative results are consistent with the stylized

facts we set out at the start.




4       Conclusion

        The most important contribution of this paper is that it provides a unified framework       for

examining the role of technical change in the salient factor market developments in recent decades

in the United States and Europe. It demonstrates that the mediation of local institutions maybe

crucial in understanding the qualitative effects of technical change on relative wages and

employment for the world as a whole, These depart in important but sensible ways from what we

would anticipate in a world of universally flexible wages. It also identifies the few specific patterns

of technical change that satisfi a set of key stylized facts. Accordingly, it aims to sharpen the

focus of the discussion relating technical change to movements in relative wages and employment.




                                                   21
        These points are developed in a stylized model of trade between a flexible wage America

and a rigid real wage Europe. In spite of the simplicity of the fi-amework, a number of strong

results emerge: 15

        First, global technical progress never raises the relative wage of the unskilled, Moreover,

for the economy in which the minimum wage is imposed, no technological progress -- local or

global -- can raise the relative wage of the unskilled. This is not to say that the unskilled

necessarily lose from technical progress. While they do not gain in relative wage terms, their real

wage may be raised by technical progress. More importantly, the locus, sector, and factor bias of

this change will be important in determining the impact on unemployment,

        Second, global technical progress here will not help to account for divergent wage trends,

even when accompanied by strongly differentiated factor market institutions. The reason, of

course, is the factor price equalization result noted earlier.

        Third, the qualitative change in relative wages does depend on whether the technical

progress is global or local, and if the latter, in which country it is localized. However it does not

depend on the factor bias of the technical change. This, however, does not suggest that it returns

us to the simple small economy case of Learner (1995). One reason is that the direction of the

change in relative wages may appear perverse relative to that case, For example, we will see that

when technical progress is localized in Europe, all forms of progress in the labor intensive good

raise the relative wage of the skilled in both countries. While this particular result depends

importantly on the good in which the minimum wage is specified, it does caution against assuming


         15The results are stated here for the set of comparative statics examined. They assume that
technologies are initially identical, that the minimum wage in Europe binds throughout, that
relative factor intensities are unchanged, and that diversification of production is maintained.

                                                   22
that the flexible wage results will be robust to the introduction of alternative specifications of the

factor market institutions.

        Fourth, the Leamer-Krugman        discussion of the relevance of sector versus factor bias of

technical change here maps precisely into a debate over the impact on unemployment.         Thus both

the sector and factor bias of tectilcal   change play important roles in accounting for movements in

relative wages and unemployment.

        Fifih, when technical progress is local, in either country, the American relative wage

responds with systematically higher variance, regardless of the sector or factor bias of the change.

The European commitment to the minimum wage shields it from the variable wage effects, but the

pressures are absorbed through changes in employment.

        Finally, the possibility of distinguishing technical change by sector, by factor bias, by local

versus global, and by the strength of induced price effects, suggests an unmanageable number of

cases to contemplate. However, if we use the few stylized facts sketched above, the theory

identifies only a few candidates that can explain these facts. Two are what may be thought of as

“Krugman” cases -- where induced price changes become a central part of the story. These

include global neutral and labor saving technical progress concentrated in the unskilled intensive

sector. This raises the relative skilled wage in both America and Europe, while also raising

European unemployment. It accords with the Krueger-Sachs-Shatz          view that the relative wage of

the unskilled intensive good has fallen, rather than with the Lawrence-Slaughter     view that it is

unchanged. Its one drawback is that it does not help to account for the stronger rise of relative

skilled wages in America. The second case is local European neutral and labor saving technical

progress concentrated in the unskilled intensive sector. This is similar to the previous case, except


                                                   23
that American relative skilled wages do rise more sharply than in Europe. The final case of

particular interest is what maybe termed the Lawrence-Slaughter-Learner      case, that of local

American labor saving technical progress concentrated in the skill intensive sector. This raises the

relative skilled wage in America, and leaves it unchanged in Europe. It accords with the view of

Lawrence-Slaughter,   rather than that of Krueger-Sachs-Shatz,   in that relative goods prices do not

change.
