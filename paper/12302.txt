                                           ABSTRACT

         Since almost eliminating net debt, the Australian Government’s attention has turned to the
financing of broader balance sheet liabilities, such as public sector superannuation. Australia will
be developing a significant financial asset portfolio in the ‘Future Fund’ to smooth the financing of
expenses through time. This raises the significant policy question of how best to manage the
government balance sheet to reduce risk.
         This paper provides a framework for optimal balance sheet management. The major
conclusions are that:
– fiscal sustainability depends on both the expected path of future taxation and the risks around that
path;
– optimal balance sheet management requires knowledge of how risks affect the balance sheet (and
therefore volatility in tax rates); and
– the government’s financial investment strategy should reduce the risk to government finances from
macroeconomic shocks that permanently affect the budget.
         Based on this framework, we find that a Future Fund portfolio that included (amongst other
potential investments) domestic nominal securities and equities of selected countries would reduce
overall balance sheet risk.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Australian Government has taken steps over the past decade to improve the sustainability of

government finances. In particular, the Government has significantly reduced its debt liabilities,

avoiding many of the risks associated with high debt levels.

Having achieved a low level of debt, the Government’s attention has turned to the financing of

broader balance sheet liabilities, such as superannuation obligations to its employees. The

Government has announced that it will establish a Future Fund to finance public sector

superannuation liabilities. 1 This will assist in relieving future generations of some of the

financing burden associated with other intergenerational fiscal pressures which are expected to

emerge over the medium term.

The creation of the Future Fund raises the significant policy question of how best to structure

the Government’s balance sheet to reduce overall financial risk. This paper sets out a

framework for optimal government balance sheet management and presents some preliminary

estimates of the types of financial assets and liabilities that would reduce overall financial risk.2




1     These liabilities relate to public sector employees only, not broader social insurance obligations found in
      many OECD countries.
2     The paper does not discuss the appropriate size of government expenditure, the level or composition of
      taxation necessary to fund it or the optimal size of a net asset portfolio (Future Fund) through time.
2. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BALANCE SHEET

The Australian Government’s Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter) highlights the

need for governments to manage balance sheet risks. The purpose of the Charter is to improve

fiscal policy outcomes by requiring the fiscal strategy to be based on principles of sound fiscal

management and by facilitating public scrutiny of fiscal policy and performance.

The Charter facilitates optimal balance sheet management in two ways. First, the Charter

requires governments to make regular financial reports that comply with external reporting

standards, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Government Finance Statistics

(GFS) and Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). This means the government balance sheet

is comparable across entities and jurisdictions. Second, the Charter requires the ‘prudent’

management of financial risks, including those relating to the broader government balance sheet

(such as risks relating to the tax base). By requiring transparent presentation of the balance

sheet and effective management of financial risks, the Charter allows the community to hold the

government accountable for its financial performance.

2.1 The balance sheet

The Australian Government general government sector has published a balance sheet in the

budget papers since 1999-2000 consistent with international reporting standards. 3 The balance

sheet reported in the 2003-04 Final Budget Outlook is reproduced below.




3     The Charter requires a balance sheet to be published as part of the budget papers (usually produced in May),
      the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (by the end of January in each year, or within six months after the
      last budget, whichever is later) and at the final budget outcome (up to 3 months after the end of the financial
      year). The Charter requires the balance sheet to be on both the ABS GFS and AAS basis. However, the
      primary budget statements (and therefore all references in this paper) are on a GFS basis.

The major assets on the Government’s balance sheet are: financial equity, mainly reflecting the

government’s remaining share in Australia’s major telecommunication company Telstra

($50 billion); non-equity assets, mainly taxes owed but not yet received by the Government

($17 billion); and investments, loans and placements, largely deposits at the Reserve Bank

($24 billion). The major liabilities are superannuation liabilities ($88 billion) and gross debt

issuance ($61 billion).

There are two notable aspects to the Australian Government balance sheet. First, the

government has reduced net debt to very low levels — net debt has fallen from $96 billion

(18.2 per cent of GDP) in 1996-97 to $23 billion (2.9 per cent of GDP) in 2003-04. This is in

stark contrast with the net debt positions in nearly all other OECD countries (Chart 1).

The reduction in net debt reflects fiscal surpluses and asset sales over a number of years. It also

reflects that these surpluses have been invested in debt assets. Following the Review of the

Commonwealth Government Securities Market 2002, the Government decided to maintain the

domestic bond market to facilitate interest rate risk management by the private sector. The

Government therefore maintains a stock of around $50 billion of mainly long dated securities,

while investing the proceeds of debt issuance in term deposits at the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The other notable feature about the balance sheet is that the Government’s most significant

financial liability is public sector superannuation, estimated to grow to $105 billion (9.9 per cent

of GDP) by 2008-09 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2005). While this liability is expected to

increase further in the future, a significant portion reflects liabilities to past government

employees. The Australian Government closed the main public sector superannuation fund to



                                                                                                        7
new members from 1 July 2005. This means the government will pay the superannuation

liability for new public servants employed after this date as they accrue, rather than growing the

superannuation liability further. Also, in 2004-05 the government paid $4.6 billion to Telstra

and Australia Post to extinguish remanent superannuation liabilities from the corporatisation of

these firms a decade or so ago.

Despite these policies, the existing superannuation liability is expected to remain sizeable,

reaching $140 billion in 2020 (7.1 per cent of GDP), largely due to growth in the superannuation

schemes for Military and Defence employees.4

In response to these financial management challenges, the government has announced the

creation of a ‘Future Fund’ with the aim of offsetting the Government’s unfunded

superannuation liabilities by 2020. The fund will assist in increasing the Government’s net




4     Since the liability depends on the final salaries of public sector employees, there are risks around this
      estimate. Revaluations of the liability are regularly reported in the budget papers.

worth and increasing national savings. Contributions will be made to the fund whenever the

budget is in surplus. That is, rather than realised budget surpluses being used to retire debt or

build up term deposits at the Reserve Bank as currently occurs, they will be invested in the fund.

The fund will be established using accumulated cash reserves currently on term deposit with

the Reserve Bank. Additional contributions from realised surpluses and the reinvestment of

returns on the fund’s assets will be needed to meet the Government’s target.


2.2 Contingent risks

The government balance sheet provides important information on the financial performance of

the government from period to period. An increasing net worth means that a government is

reducing rather than increasing net liabilities on future generations. However, there are many

rights and obligations of government that are excluded from the balance sheet, mainly because

of valuation problems. The most significant item missing from the balance sheet is the ‘primary

asset’ of the government — the power to tax. 5 While this power is limited by such factors as the

constitution, international tax competition, the size and growth of the economy, the effects of tax

rate and base changes on economic efficiency and equity — the taxing power provides strong

assurance of the government’s ability to meet its liabilities.

On the other side of the ledger, certain explicit government obligations that do not meet

accounting standards tests for the recognition of liabilities are also not recorded. 6 Under the

international IMF GFS framework, only obligations payable in any event are on balance sheet,

whereas those that occur only on uncertain events (even if they are probable) are not

(International Monetary Fund, 2001:34). Unless presented carefully, this can lead to




5     Problems also exist in valuing substantial heritage assets on the balance sheet, such as Parliament House and
      the Australian War Memorial.
6     This paper is concerned only with explicit financial risks, defined as rights or obligations on government
      established by law or contract. Implicit financial risks provide a different set of policy problems, such as
      policy issues, which are beyond the scope of this paper.

mis-understanding of the underlying economic value of specific assets and liabilities on a

government’s balance sheet. For example, the Australian Government departs from the GFS

framework by recording provisions against expected defaults on student loans in the balance

sheet. 7

Probably the largest contingent liabilities not recorded on the balance sheet relate to future

pensions and public health costs. However, these obligations to fund future expenses have an

impact on the economy today, as well as on fiscal sustainability. So the Charter also requires

the government to produce an inter-generational report every five years, which essentially

captures those obligations not recorded on the balance sheet. The last report from 2002-03

projected spending associated with an ageing population to require a fiscal adjustment of

5.0 per cent of GDP by 2041-42, or $87 billion in 2002-03 dollars (Commonwealth of Australia,

1:2002a).

These conceptual and measurement problems mean the government balance sheet is not directly

comparable with similar private sector financial statements. 8            Government balance sheet

management therefore requires a different framework for determining whether investment

strategies are optimal. In particular, contingent assets and liabilities are likely to have a

significant influence on how best to structure the government balance sheet to reduce risk and

improve fiscal sustainability.




7      The Swedish government budgets by appropriating the anticipated loss from guarantees for individual risks,
       ensuring equivalence between traditional outlays and financial instruments that transfer risk to the
       government (Hagelin and Thor, 2003). Similarly, the governments of the United States and the Netherlands
       explicitly appropriate the subsidy component of concessional loans and loan guarantees (Schick, 2002:90).
       The Australian National Audit Office has valued the potential exposure from other selected financial
       instruments containing contingent risks — such as financial guarantees — at $115 billion (ANAO, 2003).
8      Indeed, the National Commission of Audit (Commonwealth of Australia, 1996) recommended that the term
       ‘balance sheet’ be replaced with ‘Statement of Assets and Liabilities’ to avoid misleading comparisons with
       the private sector.

3. GOVERNMENT BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT

The government balance sheet is a measure of the government’s financial position at a point in

time. Government balance sheet management is concerned with how the balance sheet may

move through time. Managing the risks affecting the government balance sheet can assist in

avoiding, or at least ameliorating, sharp changes in the financial position flowing from

macroeconomic shocks. In particular, a government’s balance sheet can be significantly

affected by contingent risks affecting the tax base. This paper argues that a government

financial portfolio – including financial assets, superannuation liabilities and government

securities – can be structured to reduce the financial impact of these risks.

Despite reportedly sound monetary and fiscal policies, as well as high domestic savings rates,

many Asian economies suffered serious recessions in the late 1990’s (for example World Bank,

1993). These recessions were compounded, if not caused, by the crystalisation of contingent

liabilities, particularly around commitments to support exchange rates and banking systems.

Public injections into the banking system after the Asian crisis more than doubled the size of

government debt to GDP in Korea and Thailand (Wheeler, 2004:105). 9 In emerging countries

more generally over the 1990s, bail outs to public enterprises and banking systems have

contributed more to the build up of government debt than recurrent deficits (Kharas and Mishra,

2001). Indeed, the deterioration in the debt positions of emerging countries since the 1990’s has

been largely attributed to interest rate and exchange rate movements and the recognition of

off-balance sheet and contingent liabilities (International Monetary Fund, 2003:117).

For developed nations, managing balance sheet risks may not be as important in averting crises.

However, balance sheet management can be used to improve the fiscal sustainability of




9     Korea’s government debt to GDP ratio went from 10.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent after the costs of bank
      recapitalisation, while Thailand went from 14.6 per cent to 46.6 per cent.


                                                                                                              11
government through time (and ultimately, avoid financial crises). 10 Since governments can rely

on taxation to finance themselves, the concept of fiscal sustainability must relate in some way to

the expected path of taxation. Fiscal sustainability not only requires that governments are likely

to remain solvent — in the sense that the anticipated path of taxation is reasonable — but that

the volatility (or risks) around that path are not significant. The International Monetary Fund is

incorporating country risk analyses into their fiscal sustainability assessments for some countries

(for example, Barnhill and Kopits, 2003). Indeed, the relationship between taxation and balance

sheet assets and liabilities is central to the economics literature on balance sheet management.

3.1 A framework for analysis

3.1.1 Inter-temporal budget constraint

An important conceptual tool for analyzing government balance sheet management is the

inter-temporal budget constraint. This budget constraint requires that at any date the sum of net

worth and the net present value of taxation be equal to the net present value of government

spending.

In this way, the inter-temporal budget constraint relates the government balance sheet in any

                                                                                           11
period to the contingent asset and liabilities that can affect the balance sheet.               If current

period government spending is higher than current period taxation, the government can issue

debt (or some other liability). However, this simply means taxes need to be higher sometime in

the future. In this framework, debt (and other liabilities) passed onto the future are effectively




10    There are other potential objectives of debt management policy, such as attempting to ameliorate the effects
      of incomplete or imperfect markets (eg improving market efficiency through improved risk sharing).
      However, alternative objectives have a less secure conceptual basis and some implementation problems (see
      Missale, 1997).
11    In a series of excellent papers (from Bradbury et al, 1999 and Grimes, 2001, onwards) the New Zealand
      Treasury has used the inter-temporal budget constraint to derive the concept of ‘comprehensive net worth’
      for balance sheet management purposes.



                                                       12
‘congealed taxation’. The inter-temporal budget constraint requires taxes to rise from their

current levels to finance future anticipated expenses.


3.1.2 Tax smoothing

Once the limit to future taxation and spending is identified, the optimal path of taxation needs to

be found. Barro (1979) uses the standard public finance assumption that the excess burden of

taxation rises by more than any rise in the tax rate — a doubling of tax rates has more than twice

as many costs. These costs are the loss in overall welfare caused by tax rates distorting

individual’s and firm’s consumption choices.

Given anticipated government expenditure, these costs are minimised through time if tax

(defined as a proportion of GDP) is constant, with temporary macroeconomic shocks leading to

deficit financing and surpluses. That is, for a given financing requirement, a constant tax rate

through time will impose a smaller cost on the economy than would a low tax rate in one year

and a high tax rate in the next. An important implication of tax smoothing is that it is

anticipated future tax rises, rather than simply current tax rates, which distort economic

behaviour. For example, if tax rates are expected to rise significantly in the future, investment

(and therefore growth) is likely to be discouraged. This standard result on optimal long run

fiscal policy accords with the Australian Government’s commitment of ‘no increase in the

overall tax burden from 1996-97 levels’.

This result depends critically on assumptions of the excess burden of taxation. 12 In the absence

of these costs, there may be no role for Government to smooth taxes through time, since

individuals could adjust their own portfolios to account for the uncertainty in future tax

liabilities. It is the presence of such costs which gives government balance sheet management

its power.



12    If the loss function is linear, then there is no need to minimise the variance in tax rates (Hansen, 2003:9).


                                                                                                                      13
3.1.3 Balance sheet risk

For a macroeconomic shock that temporarily reduces economic growth, the government could

resort to deficit financing by selling financial assets or issuing debt. However, if an

unanticipated shock lead to a permanent change in the resources available to government (for

example, a fall in the present value of taxation revenue), the government would need to adjust

fiscal policy because deficit financing would not be sustainable. Alternatively, governments

could attempt to structure their financial portfolios to hedge against such risks.

Bohn (1990) extends the tax smoothing result to incorporate such uncertainty, by imposing a

budget constraint across all anticipated states of the world, as well as across time. Bohn shows

that the government can reduce the expectation that tax rates will change, by holding and issuing

specific financial instruments. 13 In particular, an effective budget hedge would see the

government’s financial returns vary negatively with tax revenue during a macroeconomic shock.

For example, the government’s balance sheet is protected somewhat if it issues debt where

repayments fall with economic growth and tax revenue.

This framework suggests that the optimal portfolio for a country depends on the structure of the

economy. If an economy is susceptible to supply side shocks, where inflation and growth move

in opposite directions, then nominal debt issuance performs such a role. For example, the real

value of government debt falls if an oil shock causes recession and inflation. Alternatively, if an

economy is subject to demand side shocks, where inflation and growth are positively correlated,

then inflation-indexed and variable interest rate debt are better hedges. Of course, ex ante, it is

extremely difficult to form an assessment of the types of shocks an economy will be subjected to

in the future.




13    Bohn (1990) assumes risk neutral individuals, so the costs relate to the expectation that taxes will change.
      For risk averse individuals, the uncertainty that the government will raise taxes at times of low financial
      returns (i.e. high marginal utility of consumption) is an additional cost (see the Appendix in Hansen, 2003).


                                                        14
3.2 Formal presentation of the model

The intuition expressed above is set out more formally below and draws on the model developed

by Bohn (1990).

Individuals are assumed to be infinitely lived and risk neutral, and maximise the expected utility

derived from all future consumption:


 U t = Et ∑ ρ j ct + j                                                                                            (1)
                j ≥0



where ρ is a discount factor, and ct+j is consumption in period t + j.

Individuals receive a stream of endowments Yt+j and pay taxes on endowments at a rate τt. As

taxes are distortionary there is an excess burden of taxation denoted by a convex loss function

h(τt). Individuals are also able to trade a given set of assets, so that the individual budget

constraint is given by


 ct + ∑ pt ,k At ,k = Yt [1 − τ t − h(τ t )] + ∑ ( pt , k + f t ,k ) At −1, k                                     (2)
        k                                          k


where At,k is the quantity of asset k held at the end of period t; pt,k is the price of asset k (denoted

in terms of consumption goods); and ft+j,k is the stream of cash flows derived from holding asset

k. Individual optimisation implies that expected returns across assets are equal, that is:

Et(1+rt+1,k) = 1/ρ for all k, where rt+1,k = ( pt +1, k + f t +1,k ) / pt , k − 1 . This assumption is non-trivial,

particularly so when we introduce equities into our analysis.

The government can use tax revenues τtYt and issue debt, Bt,k, to finance government

expenditure, Gt (which we treat as exogenous in this model), and to meet outstanding debt

obligations. The government budget constraint is given by:


 τ tYt + ∑ pt ,k Bt ,k = Gt + ∑ ( pt ,k + ft ,k )Bt −1,k                                                          (3)
            k                      k




                                                                                                                      15
The government can choose the type of debt instrument, k, and may be a net lender or net

borrower in any security, as such Bt should be interpreted as the government’s net liabilities.
                                                 B




Following Bohn, we recast the objective function in terms of government policy by substituting

(2) and (3) into (1), which gives 14


                    {
 U t = Et ∑ ρ j Yt + j ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t + j ) ⎤⎦
            j ≥0
                                            }                                                                      (4)


The government chooses an optimal tax rate and debt portfolio to maximise individual utility (4)

subject to its own budget constraint (3). In effect, the government’s objective is to choose the

structure of taxes and debt that minimise the expected present value of the excess burden of

h(τt). The first-order conditions are 15


 Et ⎡⎣ h ' (τ t +1 ) ⎤⎦ = h ' (τ t ) for k = 0


 ρ Et ⎡⎣ h ' (τ t +1 ) (1 + rt +1,k )⎤⎦ = h ' (τ t ) for k > 0                                                     (5)

where k = 0 is the risk free asset. That is, optimality requires that the expected marginal excess

burden of taxation is constant through time.

As in Bohn, we assume a quadratic excess burden, so that the deadweight loss of a tax rate, τt, is

h(τt) = (h/2)τt2. It follows then from the first order conditions that an optimal policy requires


 Covt (τˆt + 1, rˆt + 1, k ) = 0                                                                                   (6)

where τˆt +1 = τ t +1 − Eτ t +1 is the innovation in the tax rate, and rˆt + 1, k is the innovation in the return

to asset k. These innovations reflect the unanticipated components of changes in tax rates or

returns.




14 As in Bohn (1990) we drop exogenous terms for simplicity, as they are irrelevant for deriving the first order
   conditions for optimality.
15 See Appendix A for derivation of the first order conditions.


                                                                 16
Equation (6) implies zero conditional covariance between taxes and returns on available

securities. That is, if the covariance between innovations in the tax rate and returns, for a

specific debt, is negative then the government could improve tax-smoothing by issuing more of

this form of debt. The converse is also true: if the covariance is positive then the government

could improve tax smoothing by purchasing more of this form of debt. This is the principal

conclusion of Bohn — the government should smooth tax rates across different states of the

world, as well as over time.

3.3 The optimal structure of the Government’s balance sheet

To estimate the government’s optimal portfolio an expression for the innovation in tax rates is

required. The innovation in the tax rate determined by the government’s budget constraint is:

                        ⎡                                   ⎤
 τˆt +1 = (1 −ψ ) e− y ⎢ ∑ rˆt +1,k dt ,k + ∑ ρ j gˆ t +1+ j ⎥ − τ t ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j                                 (7)
                        ⎣   k                j ≥0           ⎦       j ≥0



where yt is the growth rate of real output and y is its mean. The term                ∑      ψ j yˆt +1+ j is the
                                                                                          j ≥0



present value of innovations in future growth rates of real output, where ψ is the discount factor

and yˆt +1+ j = Et +1 yt +1+ j − Et yt +1+ j . That is, it captures unexpected permanent changes in output and

therefore in the government’s ability to raise tax revenues at a constant tax rate. Similarly,

∑   j ≥0
           ρ j gˆ t +1+ j is the present value of innovations in government spending relative to output,

where gˆ t +1+ j = ( Et +1Gt +1+ j − Et Gt +1+ j ) / Yt . The ratio of security k debt to output is denoted by dt,k.


The intuition behind equation (7) is that the present value of tax revenues must cover initial debt

plus the present value of government spending. That is, tax rates will need to adjust whenever

there are unexpected changes in the value of government debt, government spending or output

growth. For a government that is already optimally managing the balance sheet, the current tax

rate already incorporates anticipated obligations.



                                                                                                                    17
Substituting the above into equation (6) gives the optimality condition for each government

security:

                                                              ⎛                             ⎞           ⎛                           ⎞
 ∑ cov ( rˆ       t       t +1, k   , rˆt +1,l ) dt ,l + covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ ρ j gˆ t +1+ j ⎟ − wt covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j ⎟ = 0   (8)
     l                                                        ⎝            j ≥0             ⎠           ⎝            j ≥0           ⎠

           ⎡ ey ⎤
where wt = ⎢         ⎥ τ t is a weighting factor.
                                                  16

           ⎣ (1 −ψ ) ⎦

That is, the government can smooth taxes to offset unexpected shocks in the present value of

government spending and output through the issuance or purchase of state contingent securities.

As the paper focuses on shocks that affect the present value of output growth, we assume that

the covariance between innovations in the present value of government spending and returns on

assets (the second term in equation (8)), is zero. The following equation provides us with a

solution to the government’s optimal portfolio: 17


 dt = wt ∑ r ⋅∑ y , r
                           −1
                                                                                                                                            (9)

where            ∑    r
                              is the variance–covariance matrix of returns (assumed to be non-singular) and


∑        y ,r
                 is the covariance vector matrix between returns and the present value of unexpected

innovations in real output growth.

3.3.1 Methodology

In order to solve equation (9) and evaluate the optimality of various portfolios of government

assets, we need to calculate innovations in returns and the present value of future rates of growth

in real output.




16              For the purposes of the empirical analysis, we assume a discount factor of 0.98 (which equates to a 2 per
                cent per quarter discount), an average tax rate of 24 per cent and an average real growth rate of 0.75 per cent
                per quarter. The value of the weighting factor does not affect any of the qualitative conclusions.
17              For derivation of equation (9) see Appendix B.


                                                                                      18
We limit our analysis to a bivarate comparison. For our first analysis we are interested in the

optimal share of long-term domestic debt and long-term foreign debt. We then extend this

analysis to consider alternative asset classes, such as equites.

The real return on long-term domestic debt, rt+1,d, is influenced by the domestic nominal long

term interest rate lt+1, changes in the current long-term market interest rate (which is used as an

approximation of the capital gain component), and domestic inflation, πt+1. 18 Foreign long-term

debt returns, rt+1,f, will in addition be influenced by the change in the exchange rate Δst+1.

Innovations in returns are therefore given by:

rˆt +1, d = − (   t +1, d   − Et   t +1, d   ) − (πt +1       − Etπ t +1 )
rˆt +1, f = − (   t +1, f   − Et   t +1, f    ) − (π   t +1   − Etπ t +1 ) + ( Δst +1 − Et Δst +1 )


To calculate these innovations in real returns, vector autoregressions (VARs) are used to

formulate expectations for the inflation rate, the percentage change in the exchange rate, the

long-term domestic interest rate and the long-term foreign interest rate. Following Hawkesby

and Wright (1997) expectations are formed for each variable (yt+1, πt+1, lt+1,d, Δst+1, lt+1,f) by

regressing that variable on a constant and one lag of the variable, together with one lag of all

other variables. 19 As expectations at time t depend only on information available up to time t,

we must run a new VAR for each time period. 20




18       The proxy used for capital gains may lead to an understatement of this component in the innovation of real
         returns since it does not take into account the time to maturity. The longer the time to maturity the larger will
         be the capital gain (or loss) associated with changes in interest rates.
19       The lag specification was chosen based on the lag length that minimised the Akaike and Schwarz
         information criteria. The estimated model does not capture the full range of variables that could be expected
         to determine output and inflation. For a more complete model of the Australian economy see Dungey and
         Pagan (2000).
20       This essentially involves growing the sample size with each estimation. We also investigated an alternative
         approach of rolling the sample, thereby keeping the sample size constant. However, this did not have a
         material impact on the results.



                                                                                                                       19
The same method is used to calculate innovations in the growth of real output:

yˆ t +1+ j = Et +1 yt +1+ j − Et yt +1+ j
                                            . Expectations for real output growth need to be formed at each time

period for rates of growth in all future time periods. That is an expectation is formed at time t,

for (yt+1, yt+2,…..yt+n) and at time t+1 for (yt+1, yt+2,…..yt+n) given the additional information. The

differences in expectations are then discounted at a rate, ψ (assumed to be 0.98). 21 This process

is repeated for each time period to derive a time series for innovations in the present value of

output.

The methodology used to derive innovations in equity returns and output is the same as that

outlined above, with innovations in equity returns given by:


         (                      )
rˆt +1,e = pt +1, f − Et p t +1, f − (π t +1 − Etπ t +1 ) + ( Δst +1 − Et Δst +1 )


                   (                  )
where pˆ t +1 = p*t +1 − Et p*t+1 is the unanticipated component of capital gains. Capital gains are

calculated using accumulation share indices for each country, which incorporate both share price

growth and dividend growth.

3.3.2 Data

All data are quarterly data for the post float period 1983:4 — 2004:3. Long-term interest rates

are the long-term government bond yields converted into quarterly returns. We take the first

difference in bond yields, as we cannot reject non-stationarity over the sample period (based on

the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests). Expectations for bond yields are then

derived from the summing the expectations of the first difference. Equity returns are derived

using accumulation indices when these are available and for the periods where they are not,

capital weighted share indices are used (this effectively assumes that dividend growth is

constant over this period). The exchange rate data is the log difference of the spot exchange rate

expressed as the Australian dollar price of foreign currency. Inflation is estimated by taking the

log differences of the GDP deflator. Growth rates in output are the log differences of real GDP.

3.3.3. Results

Table 2 shows the variance-covariance matrix for innovations series using domestic and foreign

debt. The results show that innovations in domestic returns and foreign returns vary negatively

with innovations in output. This suggests that it is optimal for the Australian Government to

purchase securities denominated in both domestic and foreign currency. These results are

consistent with the findings of Hawkesby and Wright (1997) and Missale (1999).

We also report the optimal portfolio of domestic and foreign debt as a ratio to quarterly GDP,

calculated by solving equation (9). These shares should be interpreted with some caution, as the

magnitudes are sensitive to the estimation methodology. We discuss some of the key

qualifications in detail below. With this in mind, the results show that it is optimal for the

government to invest a relatively larger amount in domestic rather than foreign debt. This is

largely driven by the volatility in the exchange rate, which acts as a ‘penalty’ on foreign

investment. Volatility in the exchange rate (and therefore in foreign returns) is not necessarily



                                                                                                              21
bad, provided innovations in the exchange vary negatively with innovations in output. While

this is the case for Japan and Germany, our results show a positive covariance between

innovations in the exchange rate and output for the US. 22

The above results can be disaggregated into the various elements that make up innovations (or

unexpected changes) in returns (see Appendix C). Doing so reveals that there is a positive

covariance between innovations in output and inflation, which is a key driver of our results. This

implies that periods of unexpectedly low inflation (and therefore high returns) have tended to

occur during periods of unexpectedly low output. This may largely result from the early 1990s

recession, where inflation and domestic interest rates fell substantially.

Turning now to equities, a priori, we might expect that it would be unlikely that domestic equity

investment would provide an effective hedge against macroeconomic shocks, given the high

correlation between company profits and output. This is confirmed by our results, which show

that the covariance between innovations in domestic equities and output is positive (table 3).

22     The volatility in the exchange may be partly driven by the method used to derive exchange rate innovations.
       Meese and Rogoff (1983) have shown that models used to explain exchange rate movements over short
       intervals, generally perform worse than a simple random walk.

In contrast, the covariance between innovations in foreign equities and output is negative,

suggesting that an optimal portfolio would include some investment in foreign equities for the

countries considered.

3.4 Qualifications

There are some significant qualifications to our results that require further investigative effort.

First, the paper focuses on unconstrained portfolios for only a select number of countries.

Further work to determine the optimal constrained portfolio involving multi-variate financial

assets needs to be undertaken before using the model for policy purposes. For example, the

optimal portfolio suggests that 2 per cent of quarterly GDP should be invested in German

shares. This is clearly unrealistic. However, in the absence of obvious constraints on the

portfolio at the time of writing this paper, we decided to report the unconstrained case only.

Similarly, Japan, Germany and the United States were chosen since they represent the largest

economies in their respective geographical regions of Asia, Europe and the Americas.

Second, we have ignored the relationship between innovations in output and government

spending. That is, government expenditure is also likely to be linked to macroeconomic shocks

and potentially able to be offset by government financial investment policy. It is likely that the

effects of a macroeconomic shock on spending reinforce the impact on taxation. However,

Bohn (1990) suggests that this impact is likely to be small and insignificant. In theory it should

be possible to determine the present value risk characteristics associated with major expense

obligations (such as health care) and invest in assets to offset these risks.

Third, the results are based on agents forming expectations on future financial risks based on

past financial events. This expectations formulation defies the rational expectations (Lucas)

critique that economic agents should use all available information when forming expectations —

past returns (or risks) are no guide to future returns (or risks) in the presence of significant

policy change (Lucas, 1976). In particular, Australia has been subject to significant economic

                                                                                                      23
reforms over the past two decades which may make relying on certain systematic relationships

to form expectations difficult. However, nearly all financial models in regular use rely on past

data to measure risks (for example, the capital asset pricing model). Further, our results use data

from 1983, after the floating of the Australian dollar, which was perhaps the largest structural

change in the financial sector.

Finally, the model does not explicitly incorporate the existing stock of assets and liabilities held

by other levels of government and by the private sector. In Australia, the State governments are

in a net asset positions (2 per cent of GDP in 2004-05), however the private sector has

significant net external debt (48 per cent of GDP in 2004-05). The current model assumes that

the obligations of the private sector and other governments are independent of the fiscal position

of the Australian Government. By focusing only on the explicit assets and liabilities of the

central government (ie rights or obligations established by law or contract), the paper ignores

those that may be implicit (ie rights or obligations dependent on moral suasion). For example,

the community may expect the government to take over some of the financial obligations of

large financial institutions that would otherwise be subject to failure. These expectations make

the distinction between private and public sector debt in the paper (and by investors) less clear.

One potential way around this caveat is to include the net external obligations of the private

sector when determining the optimal government portfolio. 23 For example, roughly half of net

Australian private sector debt is held in US dollars, implying that an optimal portfolio would

hold less of these liabilities if the government were also considering implicit risks on the

government balance sheet. Of course, there may be significant moral hazard type problems for




23
      The model incorporates implicit liabilities to the extent they are incorporated in Gt. Managing the
      government balance sheet against implicit obligations is problematical for the moral hazard reasons
      discussed in section 4.2.1 below.

any government which makes this an explicit portfolio objective (see the discussion on policy

endogeneity in Section 4).


4. DISCUSSION

4.1 Policy implications

The key conclusion from the debt management literature is that the optimal financial investment

strategy depends on the types of shocks affecting the macro economy. That is, the optimal way

to structure debt (short or long, nominal or price-indexed, domestic or foreign currency) or

invest in financial assets is an empirical question. Hansen (2003) (following Missale (1997))

summarised the main results from this literature:

(a)   buy (short-sell) assets whose returns have a positive (negative) correlation to public

      spending and negative (positive) correlation to the tax base; and

(b)   issue

             nominal debt for government spending and productivity shocks;

             price-indexed debt for monetary and real demand shocks causing inflation;

             foreign currency debt when output and inflation shocks are correlated

              internationally;

             maturity structure of debt to match structure of planned fiscal surpluses; and

             short maturity debt when positive correlation between output and real interest rates.

Our results suggest that the Australian economy has been subject to more demand shocks than

supply side shocks over the sample period. If this were to continue to be the case going forward,

then the tax smoothing framework adopted in this paper suggests that the government should

purchase domestic nominal bonds. During high output periods in Australia, inflation and tax

revenues would increase offset by lower real returns on domestic nominal bonds, such as

                                                                                                  25
government (including State government debt) or high grade corporate debt. However, during

low output periods, inflation and tax revenues will fall and be offset by higher real returns to

domestic nominal bonds. These results support the government’s policy of reducing net debt —

both by reducing the size of gross debt issuance and investing in debt assets. The results also

suggest that balance sheet risk could be further reduced by issuing price-indexed bonds (such as

Treasury indexed bonds), rather than nominal bonds.

Our results also suggest that investing in foreign equities is likely to reduce overall balance sheet

risk. In effect, the government already has a significant stake in Australian equities because of

the tax revenue earned from domestic capital income (not to mention the presumably highly

correlated flow on effects through taxation of domestic labour income). Auerbach (2004) notes

that, even though the US government does not hold much equity directly, it has significant

exposure to variations in stock prices through its claims to future tax revenues. Indeed,

Auerbach argues that the US government’s ‘implicit equity position’ is larger than the stock

market itself, consistent with the fact that revenues from all sources are responsive to stock

market returns.

4.2 Potential criticisms

4.2.1 Policy endogeneity

There are some important criticisms of the tax smoothing approach that can affect our policy

conclusions. First, there is the potential problem of policy endogeneity. If the government’s

improved financial asset performance encourages greater government spending then the

independence between government spending and taxing is violated. Similarly, there may be

risks that if the government takes a controlling interest in a domestic company, some sections of

the community may expect increased assistance for that company. In such circumstances, the

optimal balance sheet strategy for government might be to avoid accruing a financial asset

portfolio altogether and simply eliminate all risk, balancing the budget through the cycle (see

                                                 26
Pinfield, 1998). Another potential solution is to restrict the degree of controlling interest a

government investment fund can maintain in specific domestic companies. Further, it is

unlikely that the Future Fund will increase the incentive of future governments to spend more on

public sector superannuation expenses. The bulk of the super liability relates to previously

accrued entitlements that are reasonably well defined. Finally, the government reports its

underlying cash surplus exclusive of fund earnings so that they cannot be used for recurrent

expenditure.

Moral hazard is a particularly severe form of policy endogeneity that appears to have limited the

use of some financial instruments to manage government balance sheets. Traditionally, the

economics literature on optimal debt management has focused on ‘state-contingent’ debt. As

early as 1941, inflation-indexed bonds were seen as a means for removing the incentive of

governments to inflate the economy and reduce the real value of their obligations (Bach and

Musgrave, 1941). However, in the real world there is little evidence of state-contingent debt

instruments being issued by governments. 24 This may primarily be due to some state-contingent

debt instruments being subject to moral hazard problems (sometimes referred to as ‘time

inconsistency’) if governments can affect the states (Calvo and Guidotti, 1990; Bohn, 1990).

For example, bond returns that fall when an index of government expenditure rises would hedge

the balance sheet against economic downturns. However, governments would also have an

incentive to increase expenditure. This risk would then be priced in the value of such bonds,

making them unattractive even for well-intentioned governments to issue.

More recently, the literature has focused on hedging the balance sheet by optimal design of the

maturity and denomination of conventional debt securities. For example, a shorter average debt



24    Real world examples include Mexico issuing bonds tied to oil prices and Costa Rica, Bulgaria and Bosnia
      issuing bonds containing an element of indexation to GDP (Borensztein and Mauro, 2002). Even in
      Australia, the pool of inflation indexed bonds is relatively small, with outstanding Treasury Indexed Bonds
      around 10 per cent (or $6.4 billion) of total Commonwealth debt (Commonwealth of Australia, 2002b).


                                                                                                                27
maturity increases the exposure to short term interest rate rises. Long maturities can avoid

exposure to ‘roll-over’ risk (Barro, 1995). It is not necessary, as our results show, to issue state

contingent debt to offset specific balance sheet risks. Investing in a broad and diverse range of

financial assets effectively eliminates moral hazard type problems.

4.2.2 Agency costs

Second, there are significant agency costs associated with government management of financial

assets. In the tax smoothing model, the government is assumed to maximize the welfare of all

individuals in the community. However, in practice the incentives of government and the agents

used by government may not be so aligned. This can lead to poor investment decisions. The

solution to the agency cost problem is to ensure that the governance of the Future Fund is clear

and transparent and investments are made on a commercial basis within the investment

guidelines set by government. Indeed, applying best corporate practice would allow individual

government financial entities to set their own strategic asset allocation, after taking into account

the nature of their liabilities (Grimes, 2001). This is likely to improve governance,

accountability and entity performance. In the case of the Future Fund, this would involve

directing the Fund to invest in assets of a similar risk to the government’s superannuation

liabilities.

In dealing with agency costs, the government imposes constraints on the optimal portfolio. The

significance of these constraints has been highlighted by the results of Fowlie and Wright (1997)

for New Zealand. They found that the optimal financial portfolio incorporated foreign currency

denominated debt when taxes are included, but only domestic debt when taxes are excluded.

This means that a narrow focus only on balance sheet assets can lead to financial investments

that increase the chances of volatile tax changes.

However, this does not mean that financial investment decisions should not be decentralized

(down to an agency level) or linked to narrow portfolio benchmarks (such as matching financial

                                                 28
assets to future superannuation liabilities). Rather, a single central agency needs to be aware of

how individual elements of the balance sheet interact with each other during macroeconomic

shocks. Some commentators see the centralisation of broader balance sheet risk management

with debt management as a ‘logical step’ (Currie and Velandia-Rubiano, 2002). For example,

the Swedish Debt Management Office advises government on the costs of contingent liabilities

and the government debt portfolio (Hörngren, 2003a). 25 Such a structure allows natural hedges

in the balance sheet to be identified, reducing the need (and costs) from individual agencies

hedging. Alternatively, such a balance sheet perspective allows for large cumulative risks to be

identified and brought to the attention of government (Wheeler, 2004:67).

4.2.3 Imperfect capital markets

The model discussed in this paper assumes that capital markets are not perfect; or at least that

certain restrictions exist that stop governments from using financial instruments to perfectly

hedge balance sheet risk. While governments can use some existing financial instruments to

reduce balance sheet risk, certain types of risks are still likely to remain unhedged. In particular,

incomplete capital markets may mean governments are unable to hedge against certain types of

risks (such as catastrophic risk). There may be no private sector substitutes for government

bonds (Arrow and Lind 1970, Stiglitz 1983). If capital markets are incomplete, there may be

gains from governments issuing standardised products which can outweigh benefits from

state-contingent products (Missale, 1997). Alternatively, governments may have other policy

objectives, such as maintaining some debt to allow the development of important financial

products (Comley and Turvey, 2005). There may also be other reasons for investing

domestically. For example, informational, governance or tax advantages may lead to a home




25    Other countries where debt managers are integrated with contingent liability management include New
      Zealand, South Africa and Colombia (Wheeler, 2004:24).


                                                                                                            29
country bias for equities (for a review, see Karolyi and Stulz, 2002). Such constraints can limit

the ability of government’s movement towards the optimal portfolio outlined in this paper.

Even if capital markets are imperfect, government’s can still invest in financial assets to the

fullest extent possible using available securities. For the remnant unhedged risks, the

government should consider building and maintaining a positive balance of net worth as

self-insurance against large rare events. 26


5. CONCLUSION

The economics literature relating to balance sheet management suggests that the government’s

financial portfolio should be structured to reduce the budget impacts of macroeconomic shocks.

More specifically, an optimally structured balance sheet can reduce the risk that a major

macroeconomic shock will see large changes in tax rates. This not only reduces the distortions

caused by volatile tax rates, but increases the flexibility of governments to respond to

unexpected fiscal pressures. A government that invests well has less need to significantly raise

taxes or cut spending to finance itself. In most countries, this has meant structuring the debt

portfolio so that liabilities do not become overly burdensome during recessions. However,

Australia is amongst a small number of countries determining how best to structure a financial

portfolio that includes positive net financial assets. 27

This paper has shown that it is not only the budget position that is important for sustainability,

but how the financial assets and liabilities of government are allocated. Our results support the

Future Fund investing in a broad range of financial assets that includes nominal domestic debt




26    Hansen (2003:11) notes that building a ‘precautionary balance’ is worthwhile if and only if the unhedged
      risks would otherwise result in a negative correlation between tax rates and consumption.
27    Other OECD countries with significant financial asset funds (including pension funds) are New Zealand,
      Norway, Ireland, Finland Denmark (see Comley and McKissack, 2005).

reduce risks on the budget and improve growth prospects.

                          APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF FIRST ORDER CONDITIONS


The government chooses taxes and debt to maximise the individual objective function (A1)

subject to its budget constraint (A2).


                      {
U t = Et ∑ ρ j Yt + j ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t + j ) ⎤⎦
               j ≥0
                                                   }                                   (A1)
                                             {                     }
     = EtYt ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t ) ⎤⎦ + ρ Et Yt +1 ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t +1 ) ⎤⎦ + ...



τ tYt + ∑ pt ,k Bt ,k = Gt + ∑ ( pt ,k + ft ,k )Bt −1,k                                (A2)
           k                             k



From the budget constraint, we can solve for τt , τt+1 , etc, and substitute into the objective

function, Ut, which can then be maximised with respect to Bt,k, Bt+1,k , etc.

The first order condition with respect to Bt,k is:


∂U t        ⎧⎪ ⎡               ∂τ ⎤ ⎫⎪      ⎧⎪ ⎡                  ∂τ ⎤ ⎫⎪
       = Et ⎨Yt ⎢ − h ' (τ t ) t ⎥ ⎬ + ρ Et ⎨Yt +1 ⎢ h ' (τ t +1 ) t +1 ⎥ ⎬ = 0        (A3)
∂Bt ,k       ⎩⎪ ⎣⎢            ∂Bt ,k ⎦⎥ ⎭⎪   ⎩⎪ ⎣⎢                ∂Bt , k ⎦⎥ ⎪⎭


Now, from the constraints:


 ∂τ t      p                                      ∂τ t +1 ( pt +1,k + ft +1.k )
        = − t ,k             and,                        =                             (A4)
∂Bt , k     Yt                                    ∂Bt ,k          Yt +1


Substituting into (A3) gives:


                                     {                                 }
Et {− h ' (τ t ) pt , k } + ρ Et h ' (τ t +1 ) ( pt +1, k + f t +1, k ) = 0


Since pt,k is known at time t, and τt is chosen at time t, equation (A4) can be written as:


                  ⎧⎪ h ' (τ t +1 ) ( pt +1, k + f t +1, k ) ⎫⎪
h ' (τ t ) = ρ Et ⎨                                          ⎬
                   ⎩⎪                pt , k                  ⎭⎪
Recalling that rt+1,k = (pt+1,k+ ft+1,k)/pt,k — 1, and noting also that the condition that expected

returns must be equal implies that for the risk free asset (defined as k = 0), r ≡ 1/ρ — 1, then the

above expression will yield the first-order condition obtained in equation (5) of section 3.




                                                   36
                                        APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF EQUATION (9)


The optimality condition for each Government security k (k=1,…,K) given in equation (8) is:

                                                    ⎛                             ⎞           ⎛                           ⎞
∑ cov ( rˆ t    t +1, k   , rˆt +1,l ) dt ,l + covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ p j gˆ t +1+ j ⎟ − wt covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j ⎟ = 0      (B1)
 l                                                  ⎝            j ≥0             ⎠           ⎝            j ≥0           ⎠

As discussed in Section 3 we assume that the second term is equal to zero and so the above can

be reduced to:

                                                       ⎛                           ⎞

We recall that the domestic and foreign innovation of returns is given by the following equations

rˆt +1, f = −   (   *

and define Δs = Δst +1 − Et Δst +1 , π = π t +1 − Etπ t +1 , l = lt +1 − Et lt +1 , y = ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j and denote
