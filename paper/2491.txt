                    The Real Exchange Rate, Employment, and Output in
                           Manufacturing in the U.S. and Japan


                                        ABSTRACT

             In the spring of 1981 the U.S. dollar began a four—year period of
       real appreciation that took it to a peak of more than 50 percent by first
       quarter 1985. Since then, the dollar has depreciated substantially, but
       remains above its 1980 level. During the same period, the Japanese yen
       first depreciated by 12 percent in real terms from 1981 to 1982, and then
       appreciated by some 30 percent to 1986. These swings in real exchange rates
       effects on the relative competitiveness of U.S. and Japanese industry, and
       have effects on employment and output in sectors producing tradeable goods.
       This paper presents estimates of these effects.

            Using time series data for the period 1970 to 1986, we use a simple
       model of supply and demand to estimate the impact of swings in the effective
       real. exchange rate of the dollar and the yen on manufacturing employment
       and output In the U.S. and Japan, disaggregated by industry sectors, and
       by production and non—production workers in the case of the U.S. employment.
       These results are part of a larger research project to estimate the effects
       of the movements in the real exchange rate on world manufacturing indus-
       tries.

           We find significant and substantial effects of the dollar appre-
      ciation on employment and output in U.S. manufacturing. In particular,
      we find that exchange rate movements have had important effects on the
      durable goods sectors, including primary metals, fabricated metal products,
      and non—electrical machinery. Other sectors that suffer large employment
      and output losses when the dollar appreciates are Stone, clay and glass
      products, transportation, instruments, and chemicals. Estimates are also
      presented for non—production and production workers in the U.S. employment
      of the latter is more sensitive to the real exchange rate, especially in
      the durable goods sectors. This suggests the possibility of hysteresis
      in trade.

            For Japan, we find significant effects of movements in the yen on
      employment and output in the durable goods sectors, especially those
      producing machinery. In particular, yen appreciation causes substantial
      losses in employment and output in fabricated metal products, general
      machinery, and electrical machinery. The results for Japan are not as
      clear as for the U.S., perhaps because we have only annual data for
      Japan, but quarterly data for the U.S.. Nevertheless, the importance
      of movements In the real exchange rate for employment and output in
      manufacturing is evident in both cases.

     THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE, EMPLOYMENT, AND OUTPUT IN MANUFACTURING

                       IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN



I.   Introduction and Summary

     In the spring of 1981 the U.S. dollar began a four-year period of

real appreciation that took it to a peak of more than 50 percent by first

quarter 1985. Since then, the dollar has depreciated substantially, but

remains above its 1980 level. The causes for this movement are described

in Branson (1985). During the same period, the Japanese yen first

depreciated by 12 percent in real terms from 1981 to 1982, and then

appreciated by some 30 percent to 1986. These swings in real exchange

rates have effects on the relative competitiveness of U.S. and Japanese

industry, and would be expected to influence employment and output in

sectors producing tradeable goods. This paper presents estimates of these

effects.

     Using time series data for the period 1970 to 1986, we use a simple

model of supply and demand to estimate the impact of swings in the

effective real exchange rate of the dollar and the yen on manufacturing

employment and output in the U.S. and Japan, disaggregated by industry

sectors, and by production and non-production workers in the case of U.S.
                                      2

employment. These results are part of a larger research project to

estimate the effects of movements in the real exchange rate on world

manufacturing industries.

     Section II of the paper provides a brief theoretical background for

the estimation procedure. In section III we discuss the estimating

equation and the data. Section IV presents the basic results for U.S.

employment and output at the 2-digit level of manufacturing. In section

V we present the estimates for non-production and production workers in

the U.S., and find that employment of the latter is more sensitive to the

real exchange rate, especially in the durable goods sectors. This raises

the possibility of hysteresis in trade. In section VI we present the

results for employment and output for Japan.

     We find significant and substantial effects of the dollar

appreciation on employment and output in U.S. manufacturing. In

particular, we find that exchange rate movements have had important

effects on the durable goods sectors, including primary metals,

fabricated metal products, and non-electrical machinery. Other sectors

that suffer large employment and output losses when the dollar

appreciates are stone, clay, and glass products, transportation,

instruments, and chemicals. We also find especially significant effects

on production workers.

     For Japan, we find significant effects of movements in the yen on

employment and output in the durable goods sectors, esprcially those

producing machinery. In particular, yen appreciation causes substantial

losses in employment and output in fabricated metal products, general
                                      3

machinery, and electrical machinery. The results for Japan are not as

clear as for the U.S., perhaps because we have only annual data for

Japan, but quarterly data for the U.S. Nevertheless, the importance of

movements in the real exchange rate for employment and output in

manufacturing is evident in both cases.



II. Theoretical Outline



     In this section we sketch the theoretical basis for the estimating

equations. The discussion is brief, as the basic ideas are well known

from trade and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models that

distinguish three sectors: exportables X, import-competing goods M, and

non-traded goods N. We employ this sectorization for two reasons.

First, to study output and employment effects, we must focus on

exportables and import-competing production, rather than on trade in

exports and imports. Second, given this focus, we must provide a minimum

model of the non-traded sector the economy to ensure consistency.

     The general line of the analysis can be stated simply. In each of

the three sectors, demand is sensitive to the relative price of home and

foreign goods. In the short run at least, we assume that a change in the

nominal exchange rate E moves that relative price, which we interpret as

the "real" exchange rate e   EP*/P, where p(p*) is the relevant home

(foreign) price. It is important to note the limiting force of this

assumption. If we were to assume that exportables and import-competing

goods were perfect substitutes in demand for foreign goods, then a change
                                        4

in the nominal rate E would have no effect on the relative price e, since
       *
     eP and P = eP
                  *
                      ,
                                *.
                          where P is the relevant home (foreign) price.

Even in this case, in the short run we would see a change in the relative

price of non-traded goods when E changes. In the long run, as wages

adjust to the change in goods prices, a cost-based model of pricing in

the non-traded goods sector would result in the restoration of the

original relative price in that sector. The change in P would be equal

to the initial change in E, in percentage terms. A rational-expectations

model with instantaneous market-clearing would collapse in this long run

into the short run, leaving no effect of E on e in any of the three

sectors. We do not assume perfect substitution or instantaneous market-

clearing in the empirical work, but rather assume that changes in the

nominal rate move the real exchange rates of the U.S. and Japan in the

short run, and attempt to estimate the consequences.

    An appreciation of the home currency, reducing e, reduces the

relative price of foreign to home goods. This tends to shift demand from

home to foreign goods, reducing output and employment in all three

producing sectors. Changes in home and foreign real income, Y and

respectively, also enter the demand for exportables, while we assume that

only home income Y is relevant for importables and non-traded goods.

     On the supply side, we assume that the output of each sector depends

on its price relative to the nominal wage. As the real product wage

falls, supply increases. We do not attempt to model inter-sectoral

supply reactions as relative prices change, given the common nominal wage
                                             5

 rate. The supply functions below should, in theory, contain all relative

prices.

     In the theoretical background to our empirical work, then, is a

model of supply and demand in each of the three sectors with supply

sensitive to the product wage, and demand sensitive to the relative price

of home and foreign goods and the relevant income variable.             A log-

linear model of demand and supply of exportables is described below, with

analogous results for import-competing goods and non-tradeables.



Exyortables

     The demand for exportables is written in log-linear form as:



(1) ln Q ln c1 + d            ln (EP*/P) +        ln Y +        in Y.
                                             g1            g2

Here Q is the quantity demanded, EP*/P is the relative price of

exportables and foreign goods, and y(y*) is home (foreign) real income.

The parameter d is the positive price elasticity of demand, and the g's

are the income elasticities. The supply of exportables is assumed to be

an inverse function of the product wage:



(2) in Q =    in   c2 +   s   in(P/W).



Here W is the nominal wage rate and s is the price eiasticity of suppiy.

As P/W increases Q supplied increases.
                                                 6

     The demand and supply equations (1) and (2) can be solved to obtain

the "reduced form" expressions for               and P, give E,    W, Y, and Y'.

The solution for Q, the output of exportables, is given by:


                                     *
                          sd        EP       s
(3) in Q = A1         +        in        +           [g1 mY + g2lnY*],
                                             S+d
                 s c1 -
                  X
                           dXc1
where     A        sx +dx         is the constant term.
            ix


Both coefficients in the reduced form are positive, given the way d was

defined in equation (1). An appreciation of the home currency, expressed
                                                                          *
as the fall in the exchange rate E, reduces competitive prices EP

relative to domestic costs W, reducing Q. Growth in Y or y* increases

demand and production.

        The estimating equations in sections IV-VI below follow (3). The
                     *
real exchange rate EP /W is inverted in those equations, since the data

use the inverse IMF definition of the exchange rate. This makes the

estimated coefficients for the real exchange rate negative. The domestic

income variable is broken into trend and cyclical components, to attempt

to identify a cyclical output elasticity.

        The equation for employment N in the exportable sectors takes the

same form as the output equation, with the two tied by a production

function. If the production function is Q=Q(N,K), with the capital stock

K fixed in the short run, variations in output are given by dQ = Q            dN,

where Q is the marginal product of labor. Then the employment equation

in variation terms would be the output equation (3) divided by Q, which
                                       7

 is positive. Since all the estimated equations below have a separate

 trend term, differential productivity growth trends across sectors are

 included in the controlled variable set. The employment equations are

the same as the output equations with in N replacing in      on the left-

hand side of the equation (3).




Imort-Cometing and Non-Traded Goods

     The basic demand and supply equations for import-competing and non-

traded goods will have exactly the same form as (1) and (2) for

exportables, so the quantity solutions will have the same form as (3).

For both sectors we will eliminate the foreign output variable from the

demand function, although in principle it (and many others) should be

included. In both sectors supply is again an inverse function of the

product wage, and demand depends on the price of own output relative to
                                                     *
competing foreign goods, represented in general by EP .
                                                              *
                                                          As EP rises, we

expect substitution towards both domestic production of import-competing

goods and non-traded output, and vice-versa as EP* falls, that is, the

home currency appreciates.

     Again, in principle we should include all product wages in each

supply function, to catch supply-side substitution as any relative price

changes. And, we should include all relative prices in each demand

function for a similar reason. In the empirical work, we focus on the

exogenous event of a major swing in E, producing a swing in the real

exchange rate. The maintained hypothesis expressed in the exclusion of
                                         8

the other relative prices is that there was no significant exogenous

shift amongst them during the sample period, or that shifts over time are

captured by a trend variable. The obvious exception is the energy price,

which is included explicitly in the empirical work.
           *
     With Y excluded from the demand functions, and m and n subscripts
denoting import-competing and non-traded output and price, respectively,

the reduced-form solutions for       and Q are equation (3) with no term in

y* and the subscripts on the elasticities altered appropriately. The

employment equations, again, are similar to the output equations via a

production function. Trend terms will adjust for differences in

productivity growth across sectors. The presumed difference in demand

substitution against foreign goods among exportable, import-competing,

and non-traded goods should come out in the estimated values of the

demand elasticities, d , d       and d
                      x m    ,
                                     n


III. The Model to be Estimated



     In the following sections we report the empirical estimates of the

relationship between movements in the real exchange rate and employment

and output in manufacturing in the U.S. and Japan. We take the

manufacturing sector to represent both import-competing and exportable

goods. Inital estimates for non-traded goods for the U.S. are reported

in Branson and Love (1986, Table 2). For the U.S., employment within the

manufacturing sector is disaggregated by the 20 industries defined by the

Standard Industrial Classification [SICJ system, and output is measured
                                       9

by the index of industrial production. For Japan, employment and real

value added are disaggregated into 13 manufacturing sectors in the

national accounts datd. We have not modeled each industry within the

manufacturing sector individually, taking into account the special

sectoral demand shocks and cost effects that may be important. A general

reduced form model is applied to all manufacturing sectors.

     The left-hand dependent variables are the natural logarithms of

employment and output. The right-hand independent variables include a

constant, three variables to capture secular, cyclical and structural

changes in demand, and the real exchange rate. The secular variable is

time [TREND]. For the U.S., the cyclical variable is the natural

logarithm of the national unemployment rate [LTJRT]. For Japan, the

cyclical variable is a constructed series of deviations from trend in

real GNP. Details on its construction are given in an Appendix. Inclusion

of these variables in the estimating equation is meant to catch the

effect of fluctuations in aggregate demand. The coefficients of the real

exchange rate therefore give the distributive effects of exchange-rate

movements adjusted for cyclical movements in total demand. These

coefficients are the effects of relative price changes of traded and non-

traded goods, compensated for income effects.

     The structural variable is the natural logarithm of an index to

measure the real price of energy [LRENGY]. For the U.S., this is the

ratio of the energy component of the CPI to the total CPI. For Japan, it

is an index of the dollar price of petroleum times the yen-dollar

exchange rate divided by the Japanese GNP deflator. This variable is
                                                 10

meant to catch the effects of shifts of energy costs on employment and

output by sector. The net effects of a given change in the real exchange

rate is therefore the coefficient of the exchange rate plus the

coefficient of the relative energy price times the effect of the movement

of the exchange rate on the energy price. The exchange rate variables

are the natural logarithms of indexes that measure the real U.S. and

Japanese trade-weighted exchange rate [LREX].1 The exchange rate used

here is the IMF index of relative unit labor costs. We considered the

inclusion of a foreign demand variable, but found that deviations from

trend growth in foreign demand were so highly correlated with changes in

domestic demand in the case of the U.S. that no additional explanatory

power came from foreign demand.2 We have not yet experimented with a

foreign demand variable in the case of Japan. The form of the estimating

equation for the U.S. is


                            4                     4               6

where:
          the log of employment or output in sector i,

t    =   the TREND   variable time,
LURT     = the log    of the national unemployment rate,

LRENGY = the log of the relative price of energy,

LREX = the log of the IMF real exchange rate index, adjusted
             for changes in changes in relative unit labor costs,


mt
    =    the stochastic error term,
and the A's are the parameters to be estimated. The estimating equation
for Japan has the same form, but with only one lag at most, because the
Japanese data are annual, while the U.S. are quarterly.
                                      11



     The U.S. equations are estimated over a period that ends in the

first quarter of l986. In most cases the equations were estimated over

the periods beginning at first quarter 1970. Longer and shorter time

periods were tested and are reported in Branson and Love (1987). The

1970:1 to 1986:1 estimates have 65 observations and 46 degrees of

freedom. The Japanese equations are estimated over the period 1970 to

1985. These estimates have 15 observations and 12 degrees of freedom.

     For the U.S., the exchange rate variable LREX includes the current

observation plus six quarters of lagged observations. The real energy

price LRENGY and the unemployment rate LUR.T variables both include the

current value plus four quarters of lags. For Japan, LREX and LRENGY are

entered into the equation with a one-period lag. Since the Japanese data

are annual, it is likely that last year's LREX and LRENCY affect this

year's employment and output. We attempted to separate trend from cycle

in real GNP in Japan, as described in the Appendix. But the estimated

coefficients of the cycle variable were generally insignificant and

frequently negative. Since we found that simply using actual real GNP

did not worsen the results, we report estimates below that use real GNP

instead of separate trend and cycle variables for Japan. For the U.S.,

the numbers we report are the sums of the coefficients on the lag

distributions and the test statistics on these sums. For Japan, single

coefficients and their t-ratios are reported.

    The coefficient for the TREND variable (t) in the U.S. equations is

the estimated exponential rate of growth or decline in employment or
                                     12

output that occurs due to secular changes in income, tastes, comparative

advantage, or technology. For the U.S., a coefficient for TREND of -.001

means that, holding everything else constant, the dependent variable will

decline at the percentage rate of 0.1 percent each quarter.

     The coefficients for the real exchange rate, the real price of

energy, and the unemployment rate for the U.S. and real CNP for Japan can

be interpreted as elasticities, since the equations are estimated in log-

linear form. For example, a coefficient of - .3 for the real exchange

rate variable LREX in an employment equation means that a 10 percent

increase in the exchange rate will lead to a 3 percent decrease in the

number of workers employed.

     For the U.S. equations, the source of the data on employment is the

Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Employment and Earnings. The

employment variable here includes all workers, to be comparable to the

Japanese equations. Results for production vs non-production workers are

reported in Branson and Love (1987) for the 2-digit SIC manufacturing

sectors. The data on output are the Federal Reserve Board's indexes of

industrial production. The real exchange rate index is the IMF index of

relative unit labor costs.4 The real energy index is the CPI-Urban index

for energy divided by the CPI-Urban index for all consumer goods. The

unemployment rate is for all workers.5

     For the Japanese equations, the data on employment and value-added

are taken from the Economic Planning Agency's National Accounts tables.

The other data are taken from the IMF's International Financial

Statistics data base. As for the U.S., the real exchange rate index for
                                                                              13

Japan is the IMF index of relative unit labor costs. The relative energy

price was described above, and the cyclical variable is described in the

     Table 1 reports the results of the econometric estimates for total

employment in the twenty 2-digit SIC manufacturing sectors. It provides

the results from the equations that use "all workers" as the dependent

variable, estimated over the period 1970:1 to 1986:1. The table reports

the first order autocorrelation coefficient RHO, the coefficients for

each of the independent variables, and a significance statistic. When

independent variables are lagged, the coefficient represents the sum of

all lagged coefficients. The significance measure [SIC] is the

probability that the true value of the sum of the coefficients is zero,

using a two-tailed t-test. The standard error [SE] for the sum of the

exchange rate coefficients is also reported.

     The RHO is positive and large for most of the sectors indicating a

high degree of serial correlation in employment.    The variable TREND is

positive for 12 of the industries, and statistically significant at the

.05 level in 16 of the regressions.    Among the durable goods sectors,

only primary metal industries [S1C32    and miscellaneous [39] had negative

trend terms over the sample period. The cyclical variable LURT measures

the impact of cyclical movements in the national economy; the predicted

sign for this variable is negative, as high sectoral employment is
                                                                             14

associated with lower national unemployment rates. In the regressions,

LURT is negative in all 20 sectors, and is significant at the .05 level

17 times.

       The real price of energy variable LRENCY is positive 11 times, and

significant 8 times. The predicted sign of this variable is ambiguous.

An increase in the relative energy price increases cost in all sectors,

reducing employment. But some sectors produce outputs that substitute

for energy, or are inputs to energy-substitute products. In five of the

eight cases where this variable is statistically significant, the sign is

positive [SIC 28, 29, 31, 35 and 38].

       The real exchange rate variable LREX is negative for 18 of the 20

sectors, and statistically significant at the .05 level 14 times. In 13

of the 14 sectors where the exchange rate coefficient is statistically

significant, the sign of the coefficient is negative, the sole exception

being print and publishing [SIC 27]. The exchange rate has its greatest

impact on primary metal industries [SIC 33], with an elasticity of -.57,

and non-electrical machinery [SIC 35], with an elasticity of -.41.

Fabricated metal industries [SIC 34], petroleum and coal products [SIC

29], stone, clay and glass products [SIC 32], and miscellaneous

manufacturing [SIC 39], all have elasticities grouped between -.25 and -

.30.   We observe somewhat smaller, but important, effects on textiles and

apparel [SIC 22 and 23], chemicals and allied products [SIC 28], rubber

and miscellaneous products [SIC 30], lumber and wood products [SIC 24)

transportation equipment [SIC 37], and instruments and related products

[SIC 38].
                                                                            15

      The LREX coefficients for food and kindred products [SIC 20],

tobacco manufactures [SIC 21], leather and leather goods [SIC 31],

furniture and fixtures [SIC 25], and electrical and electronic equipment

[SIC 36] are negative, but not statistically different from zero. Only

paper and allied products [SIC 26] and print and publishing [SIC 27] have

positive signs, and only the latter is statistically significant.

     Table 2 reports the results of the econometric estimates for

industrial production in the U.S. at the two-digit level. It follows the

same format as Table 1, except that in Table 2 the dependent variable is

the log of industrial production in each sector. The variable TREND is

positive in 18 of the 20 sectors, and significantly so in 16 of the 18.

The only sector with a significant negative trend is leather and leather

goods [SIC 31]. This illustrates the generally upward trend in output in

U.S. manufacturing over the sample .period 1970-86.

     The cyclical variable LURATE [the same as LIJRT in Table 1] enters

negatively in all 20 sectors, and is not significant only in apparel and

other textile products [SIC 23] and leather and leather goods [SIC 31].

This illustrates the cyclical nature of industrial production in U.S.

manufacturing. The real price of energy is significantly positive only in

leather and leather goods. It is significantly negative in 5 sectors:

chemicals [SIC 28], furniture [25], fabricated metal products [34],

stone, clay and glass products [32], and transporttation equipment [37].

     The real exchange rate is negative in 15 of the 20 sectors, and the

coefficient is significant in 11 of the 15. Of the 5 positive

coefficients,only those for food [SIC 20] and print and publishing [27]
                                                                            16

are significant. The results for industrial production are consistent

with those for employment, in that1there is no sector where the LREX

coefficient has different signs, both significant, in the two sets of

estimates. As in the employment estimates, primary metal industries [SIC

33] has the largest elasticity of industrial production with respect to

the exchange rate. A 50 percent real appreciation of the dollar reduces

industrial production in the sector by 27.5 percent. Among the other

durable goods sectors, instruments [SIC 38] stands out with a

substantially larger coefficient in the industrial production equation [-

0.41] than in the employment equation [-0.15].
     Overall, the results confirm the sensitivity of employment and

output in U.S. manufacturing to changes in the real exchange rate. That

sensitivity is greater in the durable goods sectors than in non-durables,

as expected. Some puzzles remain, such as the positive coefficients in

the print and publishing sector, and the insignificant ones in the

electrical and electronic equipment sector. Print and publishing will

remain a puzzle, but the breakdown between production and non-production

workers will help us understand electrical and electronic equipment.



V. Production Workers and Non Production Workers



     The empirical results presented in Section IV relate to total

employment in the U.S.. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides a

series for the employment of production workers. The complement of this

series, all workers minus the production workers, will be referred to
                                                                            17

here as non-production workers. Production workers include employees who

are directly engaged in the physical processes of production of

manufactured goods--workers on assembly lines. The "non-production"

series includes workers who are involved in research and development,

marketing, transportation, secretarial and clerical tasks, and management

activities.

     If the market structure is such that the industry has a fixed ratio

of production to non-production workers and if production and non-

production workers are both domiciled in the United States, then a

movement in the real exchange rate would have the same percentage impact

on production and non-production workers. If, on the other hand, the

industry was characterized by increasing returns to scale or if the

results of the production workers' activities are more tradeable than is

the case for non-production workers, then exchange rate movements may

have much different impacts on the production and non-production workers.

     In Tables 3 through 5 the two time series are compared. In Table 3

the estimated coefficients of our same estimating equation for production

workers are presented. The results for non-production workers are

presented in Table 4. The two sets of coefficients for the real exchange

rate are compared in Table 5. This table also shows the percentage change

in employment of the two types of worker in each sector estimated to be

due to the appreciation of the dollar from 1980 to 1985.

    The comparison between the production and non-production worker

results in Table 5 shows that in fifteen of the twenty industries, the

difference between the LREX coefficients is greater than two standard
                                                                            18

errors for the production worker series. Moreover, the signs of the

coefficients are different for 8 of the 20 industries.

     Within the non-durable goods industries the results are mixed. For

half the industries, the exchange rate elasticities are more negative for

production workers than is the case for non-production workers. Within

the durable goods industries, the LREX coefficients are more negative in

nine of ten sectors, suggesting that production workers provide services

that are more tradeable than the services provided by non-production

workers. Indeed, for three durable goods industries- -electrical and

electronic equipment, transportation equipment, and instruments and

related products- -the coefficients are negative and statistically

significant for production workers, and positive and statistically

significant for non-production workers. Thus for the instruments and

related products industry, for example, the dollar appreciation from 1980

to 1985 is estimated to have caused a decrease of 11.3 percent for

production workers, but an increase of 3.5 percent for non-production

workers. Since the level of overall unemployment is controlled for in

the estimates, the relative increase in non-production workers is not

surprising.

     These results suggest that a dollar appreciation may cause U.S.

firms to move production facilities out of the United States, thus

leading to a larger proportional reduction in production workers. This

may mean that the jobs will not return to the U.S. now that the real

value of the dollar has declined relative to foreign currencies. This
                                                                            19

may also imply that to some extent our model may be mis-specified, due to

hysteresis effects.

     Hysteresis reflects the dependence of present employment not only on

the levels of the independent variables, but also the path of those

variables over the past. Industries or sectors where hysteresis effects

may be important include industries where economies of scale or learning

by doing are important, and where there are "sunk" costs for R&D,

relocation, marketing efforts, capital investments, or other items that

could represent a strategic barrier to entry in a market. It may be that

once the initial costs of relocating production workers in foreign

countries have been incurred, it will not be cost-effective to relocate

the workers back in the U.S. after the dollar depreciates. Thus, while

our model is useful in decomposing the causes of the changes in

employment from 1980 to 1985, for some industries it may not be a good

predictor of the employment changes that will occur in the more recent

period of dollar depreciation.



VI. Results for Employment and Output in Japan



    We now turn to the data for Japan. The annual data (1970-85) on

employment and value added for 13 manufacturing sectors are taken from

the Economic Planning Agency's Tables on national income, and were

provided by Richard Marston (1987), who used them to analyze the relative

competitiveness of the U.S. and Japan. The real exchange rate is the

IMF's relative unit labor cost for Japan. The real energy price is the
                                                                            20

world price of petroleum in dollars, converted to yen using the yen-

dollar exchange rate, expressed as a ratio to the GNP deflator. These

data are taken from the International Financial Statistics data base.

They enter the estimating equations in log form.

     The Appendix describes our construction of a cyclical variable as

the deviation from trend in real GNP. A three-part equation for trend

real CNP was estimated to account for the break in the growth path of

real GNP after the 1973 oil price shock. Separation of real GNP into

trend and cycle components did not improve the results, however, so we

used just real CNP as a regressor. We also experimented with a variable

for real world imports, less Japan. This was collinear with Japanese

real GNP, and gave worse results when it was used as an alternative.

     Since the data for Japan are annual, we do not estimate lag

distributions, but simply enter the current value for the log of real CNP

and the once-lagged values of the logs of the real exchange rate and the

real energy price. The dependent variables are the logs of employment and

output by sector. A list of the sectors, and their weights in real CDP is

given in Table 6.

     The estimated equations for employment in manufacturing in Japan are

shown in Table 7. The format is slightly different from that of Tables

l4.6 Table 7, and Table 8 for output, show the coefficient for each

variable and its t-ratio as the significance test. Also shown are the the

adjusted    and the Durbin-Watson statistic. The equations in Tables 7

and 8 are not adjusted for serial correlation. This is done in Tables 9

and 10. Estimates are shown for each of the 13 sectors, for a machinery
                                                                           21

 aggregate that combines sectors 8 through 12, and for total

 manufacturing.

       The real GNP coefficients [LRGNP} in Table 7 represent a

 combination of trend and cycle influences. For non-durables they are

 mixed, with two significantly positive and two significantly negative.

 For durables, only one is negative, and the two aggregates have

 significantly positive real GNP coefficients. The real energy variable

 is negative in all sectors except food and beverages, but significantly

so only in fabricated metal products [8] and electrical machinery [10].

     The variable of direct interest here, LREX, shows a similar pattern

to the U.S. results. The signs are negative for all durable goods

sectors except transport equipment [11], and there the coefficient is

insignificant. The general machinery [9], electrical machinery [10], and

aggregate machinery [8-12] sectors all have significabtly negative

coefficients. A 20 percent appreciation of the yen reduces employment in

the electrical machinery sector by 12.6 percent, and in aggregate

machinery production by 5.6 percent. Thus movements in the real

effective yen exchange rate seem to have significant effects on

employment in the durable goods sectors within a year.

     The results for output in manufacturing in Japan are shown in Table

8, which has the same format as Table 7. The positive coefficients of

real GNP for all sectors except petroleum and coal products [5] are

striking. Electrical machinery [10] shows an elasticity of 5.6 with

respect to GNP growth. The difference between the real GNP terms in

Tables 7 and 8 is a rough measure of productivity growth. As noted by
                                                                            22

Marston (1987), productivity grew rapidly in the expanding sectors, with

electrical machinery in the lead, and fell slightly in food and beverages

[1] and petroleum and coal products [5]. The elasticity of productivity

in the machinery aggregate with respect to growth in real GNP is 2.3, on

these estimates. Marston (1987), who focussed directly on estimating

productivity growth, showed the same pattern across sectors, with an

average of 6 percent per year for the machinery aggregate. The real

energy price is generally negative, except in the petroleum and coal

products sector [51, where it is significantly positive, as expected.

      The real exchange rate coefficients show more mixed results for

output than for employment. The fabricated metal [8] and general

machinery [9] sectors have very significant negative coefficients, as do

both aggregates. The marginally insignificant coefficient for electrical

machinery [10] is puzzling, given its highly significant negative value

in the enployment regressions. Why would appreciation reduce employment

significantly more than output in the electrical machinery sector?

     The large negative coefficient for LREX in the equation for the

machinery aggregate implies a larger elasticity of output in response to

changes in the real exchange rate in Japan than in the U.S. In Table 2,

the largest of the estimates in the group SIC 34-38 is -0.41 in

instruments [SIC 38], where in Table 8, it is -0.60 for the machinery

aggregate. The remaining puzzle is why the disaggregated machinery

sectors 10-12 do not show greater sensitivity of output to the exchange

rate, given the estimate for the aggregate. Marston (1987) suggests that

this is due to absorption of exchange rate changes in profits. but he
                                                                            23

shows this effect in the machinery sector to be greatest in general

machinery [9], which has the largest negative coefficient in Table 8. So

while we find significant effects of changes in the real exchange rate on

output in the durable goods sectors in Japan, the pattern of coefficients

across sectors remains somewhat puzzling.

     The Durbin-Watson statistics in Tables 7 and 8 indicate substantial

serial correlation in the error terms, especially in the employment

equations for durables. So all the regressions were re-estimated using

alternatively the Cochrane-Orcutt adjustment for serial correlation and a

lagged dependant variable to reflect partial adjustment.7 The serial

correlation results are presented in Tables 9 and 10. The results with

the lagged dependant variable, represented by LY(-l), are shown in Tables

11 and 12.

     Comparing the employment estimates in Tables 9 and 11, we see that

the lagged dependant variable performs better than the serial

correlation correction. With the exceptions of sectors 1-3 [food,

textiles, and paper], the serial correlation RHO coefficients in Table 9

are all significantly positive, as are the lagged dependant variables in

Table 11, with the further exception of sector 13 [miscellaneous]. But

the Table 11 equations fit better and have Durbin-Watson statistics

closer to 2 than the Table 9 equations. Thus the evidence favors the

partial adjustment model for employment in Japan.8 The coefficients for

the real exchange rate and the relative energy price in the employment

equations for sectors 4-12 in Table 11 should be interpreted as

representing one-year adjustment. The long-run coefficients can be
                                                                             24

obtained by dividing these by one minus the coefficient of the lagged

dependant variable. In Table 11, the exchange rate coefficients for the

durable sectors and the two aggregates are uniformly negative, as are

those for the energy price in all sectors but food.

     The evidence is less clear in the output equations in Tables 10 and

12. Both the RHO and the coefficients of the lagged dependant variables

are smaller than those for employment, and most often insignificant. The

adjusted R2 and D statistics are about the same in the two tables. The

real exchange rate coefficients in the fabricated metal and machinery-

producing sectors [8-10] are large and negative in both tables. In Tables

10 and 12, the output elasticity with respect to LREX in the electrical

machinery sector [10] is larger than the employment elasticity in Tables

9 and 11, providing a possible dynamic explanation of the apparent puzzle

from Tables 7 and 8. With the serial correlation correction in Table 10,

the output elasticity with respect to LREX of - .44 for the machinery

aggregate is closer to the estimate from the U.S. data in Table 2. In

Table 12, this elasticity is - .33 in one year, and - .50 in the long run.

These bracket the elasticity of SIC 38 in the U.S. estimates.

     With only 15 annual observations in this data set, further

exploration of the dynamics of adjustment in manufacturing in Japan would

be inconclusive.   It does appear that lagged adjustment of employment is

supported more strongly by the data than lagged adjustment of output.

This is consistent with employment-smoothing in Japan. The pattern of

coefficients for the real exchange rate in Tables 7-12 for Japan is

broadly similar to that in Tables 1-2 for the U.S., with negative
                                                                            25

coefficients for durables, and mixed results for non-durables. Thus,

while the dynamic specification is still not precise, the results for

Japan show sensitivities of employment and output in manufacturing to the

real exchange rate that are not unlike those of the U.S.

 1. The IMF defines the exchange rate as the inverse of EP*/W from

 Section II. An increase of the index is an appreciation of the home

currency.

2. We further considered the inclusion of a real interest rate variable, but

found, surprisingly, that it had little explanatory power, and did not

significantly change the estimated exchange rate elasticities. The lack of

explanatory power may be due to mulitcolinarity between the interest rate

variable and the three variables TREND, LURT, and LRENGY.

3. The Beach-Mackinnon (1978) maximum likelihood procedure for

correcting first order autocorrelation was used in estimating the U.S.

equations. The Cochrane-Orcutt procedure was used for the Japanese

equations.

4. In an early version of this paper [Branson and Love (1986)] we used a six

country index of exchange rates deflated by consumer prices. We have also

experimented with an index based wholesale prices and we have used different

weighing methods for the countries in the index. In general, changes in the

country weights or the price deflators have changed the metric of the

estimates, but not the ranking of the coefficients. The index based on unit

labor costs tends to fit the data better that indexes based on wholesale or

consumer prices.

5. Detrending of the unemployment rate to account for secular changes in labor

force participation rates [a higher "natural rate"] changes the estimated

coefficient for the LURT variable and the TREND variable, but does not change

the other coefficients.

6. The regressions reported in Tables 1-4 were performed on a PC using

the GAUSS package, but the regressions reported in Tables 7 and 8 were

performed on the Unisys at the IMF.

7. The same tests on the U.S. equations yielded long-run coefficients for

the real exchange rate with the lagged dependant variable that were equal

to the sums of the six-quarter lags reported in Tables 1-4. Thus in the

U.S. case, the evidence supported the serial correlation correction, once

a 6-quarter lag was introduced.

8. We attempted to test the two alternatives by adding lagged values of

the independant variables to the regressions, but the results were mixed

and inconclusive. With 13 observations and 7 regressors, degrees of

freedom become insufficient to obtain clear results.

9. In collaboration with Richard Marston, we are now working with a

monthly data set to explore the dynamics of adjustment in Japan more

thoroughly.

                     Appendix: Trend and Cycle in Japan


     The path of real GNP in Japan is shown as the solid line in

Figure A—i. The break in the trend in 1973—74 following the oil price

increase is clear. It appears that the growth path both shifted down

and decreased in slope. It also appears that the growth paths before

1973 and after 1974 are approximately linear. To compute trend and

cycle variables for Japan, we fitted a piece—wise linear regression to

the real GNP time series from 1968 to 1986, using two time trends,

one (TIM 1) for 1968—73, and one (TIM 2) for 1975—86, and two dummy

variables. DUN 1 is unity in 1974 and zero otherwise, and DUN 2 is zero

for 1968—74 and unity for 1975—86. The regression, including a constant

term, is summarized in Table A—i. The fitted values from the regression

are shown as the dashed line in Figure A—i. The cyclical variable LCYC

in the regressions for Japan in section VI is the series of residuals
