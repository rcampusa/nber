This article studies optimal fines when an offender's wealth is private information that can be
obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. I derive the optimal fine for the
underlying offense, the optimal fine for misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit
probability. I demonstrate that the optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth equals the fine for the
offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The
optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the
cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals
who are capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also show
that the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth
levels.

I. Introduction

           Despite the obvious ability of individuals to hide assets (for example, by hoarding cash or

distributing property to relatives or friends), prior analyses of optimal fines nearly universally

assume that an offender’s level of wealth is costlessly observable by the enforcement authority.1

The contribution of this article is to consider optimal fines when an offender’s wealth is private

information that can be obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit.

Obviously, the conventional analysis is a special case of the present analysis, when the audit cost

is zero.

           I employ a model in which there is a continuum of individuals with respect to their level

of wealth and their potential benefit from committing an offense. If an individual commits the

offense and is caught, he is sanctioned with a fine. If he claims that he cannot pay the fine, he

may be audited. If the audit determines that he misrepresented his wealth level, he can be fined

for having lied about his wealth. The enforcement authority’s problem is to choose the

probability of detecting the offense, the fine for the offense, the probability of an audit, and the

fine for misrepresentation of wealth so as to maximize social welfare.

           Among other things, I demonstrate that the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s

wealth level equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore

generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive,

increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low.

If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are

capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also

show that the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of

auditing wealth levels.

         Section II presents the model. Section III derives the optimal fines and audit probability.

Section IV contains some concluding observations about the use of imprisonment to sanction

misrepresentation of wealth and the offense.2



II. Model

         In the model, risk-neutral individuals contemplate whether to commit an offense that

causes harm. Each individual is identified by the benefit he would obtain from committing the

offense and by his level of wealth. An individual who commits the offense is detected with some

probability (which is costly for the state to maintain) and fined. If he claims that he cannot pay

the fine because he has insufficient wealth, he may be audited at some cost to the state to

determine his wealth level (audits are assumed to be accurate). If an audit reveals that the

individual misrepresented his wealth level, he may be sanctioned further, by a higher fine. The

fine imposed on an individual, whether for the offense or for misrepresenting his wealth level,

cannot exceed his wealth. Fines are assumed to be socially costless to impose.

         The following notation will be used.

         h = harm caused if the offense is committed; h > 0;

         2
           To my knowledge, this article is the first to analyze optimal fines when the offender’s level of wealth can
be observed by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. Several studies of related interest should be
mentioned, however. Chu and Jiang (1993) and Levitt (1997) consider the choice between fines and imprisonment
when wealth cannot be discovered by the enforcement authority at any cost (in Chu and Jiang’s case, this
assumption is implicit). Garoupa (1998) investigates optimal fines when the enforcement authority is assumed to
costlessly observe an underestimate of offenders’ wealth levels. See also the discussion of Polinsky (2004) in
section IV below. The large theoretical literature on the auditing of wealth levels in the context of controlling tax
evasion — see Mookherjee (1997, pp. 207-31) and Andreoni, Erard, and Feinstein (1998, pp. 823-35) — is only
tangentially relevant to the analysis here because its focus is on controlling offenses that affect the distribution of




                                                    -3-
         b = benefit from committing the offense; b $ 0;

      r(b) = probability density of b; r(b) is positive for all b $ 0;

        w = wealth of an individual; w $ 0;

     g(w) = probability density of w; g(w) is positive for all w $ 0;

         p = probability of detection;

     e(p) = enforcement expenditures of the state; e(0) = 0; e'(p) > 0;

        fO = fine for committing the offense; fO $ 0;3

         q = probability of an audit; q $ 0;

         k = cost to the state of an audit; k > 0; and

        fM = fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level; fM $ 0.

        The distributions of benefits and of wealth are assumed to be independent and known by

the state. Without loss of generality, I assume that if an offender is found to have misrepresented

his wealth level, the fine fM is imposed instead of the fine fO that otherwise would be applicable.

        Behavior of individuals. First consider the decision of an individual who has been caught

committing the offense whether to misrepresent his wealth level w. If he does not do so, he will

pay the fine for the offense fO if w $ fO, and w otherwise. In other words, he will pay min[w, fO].

If he pays w because his wealth is insufficient to pay fO and he is subsequently audited, he will be

found to have not misrepresented his wealth level.

        Suppose, however, that the individual does misrepresent his wealth level, claiming he is

only capable of paying wN < fO. If he is not audited, he will pay wN. If he is audited, he will pay


income rather than that cause harm. Thus, for example, much of this literature is concerned with how auditing
policy should be designed and coordinated with tax policy so as to facilitate the raising of revenue.
        3
          This is the nominal fine. An individual might not have sufficient wealth to pay this fine. The same
statement applies to the fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level.



                                                   -4-
fM if he has sufficient wealth to pay this fine; otherwise he will pay his wealth w. Thus, if he

misrepresents his wealth level, his expected payment is (1 – q)wN + qmin[w, fM]. If an individual

misrepresents his wealth level, he will do so to the greatest extent possible, claiming that he has

no wealth.4 Hence, his expected payment would be qmin[w, fM].

           Given the preceding discussion, an individual will misrepresent his wealth level if and

only if5

                                            qmin[w, fM] < min[w, fO].                                               (1)

           Let

        w^ = critical level of wealth below which individuals who are detected

                 committing the offense will misrepresent their wealth levels and at

                 and above which individuals will not misrepresent their wealth levels.

It can be demonstrated from (1) that

                                    fO/q if qfM $ fO
                            ^
                           w=                                                                                       (2)
                                    4       if qfM < fO.6

In other words, if the expected fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level equals or exceeds the

fine for the offense, individuals with wealth less than fO/q will misrepresent their wealth levels


           4
          This occurs because the fine for misrepresentation is assumed not to depend on the extent of
misrepresentation and the probability of being audited is assumed not to depend on the reported wealth level. The
analysis would be much more complicated if these assumptions were not made, because it would become necessary
to choose the optimal schedules for the fine for misrepresentation and the audit probability, as well as to derive the
behavior of individuals with different levels of wealth in response to these schedules.
           5
          It is convenient to assume that if an individual is indifferent between misrepresenting his wealth level and
not, he does not misrepresent his wealth level. None of the results depend on this assumption.
           6
           To prove this requires evaluating (1) in three cases — whether qfM exceeds, equals, or is less than fO.
Because a complete treatment of these cases is tedious, I consider only one here. Suppose that qfM > fO. In this case,
fO < fO/q < fM. If w # fO, (1) becomes qw < w, which clearly holds. If fO < w < fO/q, (1) becomes qw < fO, which
holds because w < fO/q. If fO/q # w < fM, (1) becomes qw < fO, which does not hold because fO/q # w. If w $ fM, (1)
becomes qfM < fO, which does not hold because fO/q < fM. Hence, if qfM > fO, individuals with wealth levels less than
fO/q will misrepresent their wealth levels, while individuals with wealth levels equal to or greater than fO/q will not.



                                                    -5-
(claiming to be zero-wealth individuals), while individuals with wealth equal to or greater than

fO/q will pay the fine for the offense fO. Note that if q < 1, there are some individuals who are

capable of paying fO who choose to misrepresent their wealth levels (individuals with wealth

between fO and fO/q).7 If, however, the expected fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level is

less than the fine for the offense, all individuals will misrepresent their wealth levels.

        Next consider the decision of an individual whether to commit the offense. Let

     b(w) = critical value of benefit below which an individual whose wealth is w will

                not commit the offense and at and above which he will.8

Thus, the higher b(w) is, the greater the level of deterrence.

        An individual will commit the offense if his benefit equals or exceeds the expected fine

he faces, which depends on whether he will misrepresent his wealth level if he is caught. Since

he will misrepresent his wealth if and only if (1) holds, it follows that the critical value of benefit

is

                                     b(w) = pmin{qmin[w, fM], min[w, fO]}.                                      (3)

        Social welfare. Social welfare is the sum of the benefits obtained by individuals who

commit the offense, less the harm done, less the cost of detection, and less the cost of auditing.

Thus, social welfare is

                       w^   4
                      I { I [b - h - pqk]r(b)db}g(w)dw
                      0 b(w)                                                                                    (4)
                                              4    4
                                          + I { I [b - h]r(b)db}g(w)dw - e(p),
                                             w^   b(w)



        7
          Individuals whose wealth is less than fO obviously will not pay anything because the worst that can
happen to them is that they are audited and lose their wealth.
        8
            I assume without loss of generality that an individual commits the offense if he is indifferent.

where b(w) is given by (3) and w^ by (2). The first term in (4) is the contribution to social

welfare associated with individuals with relatively low levels of wealth (less than w^ ) who

misrepresent their wealth levels and do not pay the fine for the offense fO. Every individual in

this group whose benefit equals or exceeds b(w) commits the offense, resulting in a benefit b, a

harm h, and an expected auditing cost of pqk. The second term is the contribution to social

welfare associated with relatively high-wealth individuals who pay the fine for the offense fO.

The state also incurs enforcement expenditures e.

         The state’s problem. The state’s problem is to maximize social welfare through the

choice of the probability of detection p, the fine for the offense fO, the audit probability q, and the

fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level fM.9 The fines actually paid by individuals cannot

exceed their levels of wealth. Asterisks will be used to denote the solution to the state’s

problem, which I assume is unique.

         Because the choice of the optimal probability of detection p* does not bear in any

interesting way on the analysis of optimal fines and auditing, I will not analyze the choice of p*

below. However, I assume that some enforcement is optimal, that is, p* > 0; otherwise, the

problem is uninteresting.



III. Analysis

         In this section I describe the optimal enforcement system through four propositions.

Following the proof of each proposition is a brief informal discussion of the result.10



         9
           Because my objective is to derive the socially optimal enforcement policy, I do not consider whether the
state’s policy is credible.
         10
              Although some of the proofs convey useful intuition, they may be skipped with little loss of continuity.



                                                      -7-
        Propositions 1 and 2 describe the optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth, and its effect

on individuals’ decisions to engage in misrepresentation, when the audit probability is,

respectively, less than or equal to unity. Proposition 3 characterizes the optimal fine for the

offense. Proposition 4 establishes that the optimal audit probability is positive and may be less

than or equal to unity.

        Proposition 1. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, q* < 1, then:

        (a) the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level fM
                                                                     * exceeds the optimal fine for

the offense; in particular, it equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability: fM
                                                                                                  *=

f*O/q* > f*O;11

        (b) individuals with wealth below the fine for misrepresentation fM
                                                                          * misrepresent their

wealth levels, while individuals with wealth at and above fM
                                                           * pay the fine for the offense f*O; and

        (c) there are some individuals who are capable of paying the fine for the offense f*O who

misrepresent their wealth levels (individuals with wealth between f*O and fM
                                                                           * ).

        Proof: (i) I first show that the optimal enforcement system is characterized by qfM $ fO.

Assume otherwise, that qfM < fO. If this condition were to hold, then individuals would

misrepresent their wealth regardless of their level of wealth (see (2)). Consequently, everyone

will be audited with probability q and their expected fine, conditional on having been detected

committing the offense, will be qw for w < fM and qfM for w $ fM. It is possible, however, to raise

social welfare by lowering fO to qfM. If fO = qfM, then fO < fM. If w # fO, (1) becomes qw < w,

which holds. If fO < w < fM, (1) becomes qw < fO, which holds because fO = qfM and w < fM. If w

$ fM, (1) becomes qfM < fO, which does not hold because fO = qfM. Thus, if fO is lowered to qfM,


        11
           As will be seen, fM
                             * is not unique. Any fM equal to or greater than f*/q*
                                                                               O    is optimal. An analogous
observation applies to Proposition 2 below.



                                                   -8-
individuals for whom w < fM will continue to misrepresent their wealth levels, be audited with

probability q, and face an expected fine conditional on detection of qw. But individuals for

whom w $ fM will now choose to pay the fine for the offense fO and not misrepresent their wealth

levels. Since fO = qfM, they are deterred to the same extent as before. But since they pay the fine

fO, they are not audited. Thus, the behavior of individuals is not affected, but auditing costs are

reduced, thereby raising social welfare. In the optimal enforcement system, therefore, it must be

that qfM $ fO.

        (ii) I next show that in the optimal enforcement system one can assume without loss of

generality that qfM = fO. Since step (i) rules out qfM < fO, suppose qfM > fO. Then, by (2),

individuals for whom w < fO/q would misrepresent their wealth levels and individuals for whom

w $ fO/q would not misrepresent their wealth. Consequently, an individual in the former group

will be audited with probability q and his expected fine, conditional on detection, will be qw (he

is unable to pay fM since w < fO/q < fM). Individuals in the latter group will pay the fine for the

offense fO (they are able to because w $ fO/q > fO) and not be audited. If fM is lowered until qfM =

fO, it is easy to see that individuals’ decisions about misrepresenting their wealth levels, and their

expected fines, are not affected. Hence, fM such that qfM = fO is optimal (as is any higher fM),

establishing part (a) of the proposition.

        (iii) Given qfM = fO, (2) implies that w^ = fO/q = fM. In other words, individuals with

wealth below fM misrepresent their wealth levels, while individuals with wealth at or above fM do

not. Since fM = fO/q > fO, the latter individuals pay the fine fO. This establishes part (b).

        (iv) Part (c) follows immediately from step (iii) since individuals with wealth between fO

and fM = fO/q > fO misrepresent their wealth levels.




                                             -9-
        Comment: It is easy to see why the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level fM
                                                                                                *

must be at least equal to the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, f*O/q*. If this

were not the case, then the expected fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level, q*fM
                                                                                     * , would be

less than the fine for the offense, f*O, and no one would pay the fine for the offense. To induce

individuals to pay the fine for the offense, the fine for misrepresentation must be at least equal to

f*O/q*. Any higher fine for misrepresentation has the same effect. Even if fM
                                                                            * = f*O/q*, not

everyone will pay the fine for the offense. In particular, individuals whose wealth is below fM
                                                                                              *

are unable to pay the full fine for misrepresentation, and thus cannot be induced to pay the fine

                        * > f*O, this includes some individuals who are capable of paying f*O. But
for the offense; since fM

everyone else can be threatened with a fine for misrepresentation of fM
                                                                      * and therefore will pay the

fine for the offense.

        Proposition 2. If the optimal audit probability equals unity, q* = 1, then:

        (a) the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level equals the optimal fine for the

offense: fM
          * = f*O;

        (b) individuals do not misrepresent their wealth levels; and

        (c) everyone who is able to pay the fine for the offense f*O does so.

        Proof: The proof of part (a) parallels steps (i) and (ii) in the proof of Proposition 1. Part

(b) follows from (1) given fM = fO. Part (c) follows immediately from part (b).

        Comment: Clearly, if an audit is certain if one does not pay the fine for the offense, then a

fine for misrepresentation equal to the fine for the offense will induce those who are able to pay

the fine for the offense to do so. Individuals who are unable to pay the fine for the offense do not

have an incentive to misrepresent their wealth levels since they will have to pay their wealth

whether they are subject to the fine for the offense or the fine for misrepresentation.

       Proposition 3. The optimal fine for the offense f*O

       (a) is less than the harm divided by the probability of detection: f*O < h/p;

       (b) results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing; and

       (c) declines as the cost of auditing k increases.

       Proof: (i) To show that f*O < h/p, first rewrite social welfare (4) using the result from part

(a) of Proposition 1 that qfM = fO. It follows from (2) that w^ = fO/q. For w # fO/q = fM, it follows

from (3) that b(w) = pmin{qw, min[w, fO]} = pqw. For w > fO/q = fM, b(w) = pmin{qfM, fO} =

pfO. Thus, social welfare can be rewritten as:

                 fO/q 4
                  I { I [b – h – pqk]r(b)db}g(w)dw
                  0 pqw                                                                               (5)
                                       4 4
                                   + I { I [b – h]r(b)db}g(w)dw – e(p).
                                     fO/q pfO

From (5), the first-order condition with respect to the fine for the offense fO is:

         –pqk[1 – R(pfO)][dG(fO/q)/dfO] – [pfO – h][1 – G(fO/q)][dR(pfO)/dfO] = 0,                    (6)

where G(.) is the cumulative distribution of wealth and R(.) is the cumulative distribution of

benefits. Since the first term in (6) is negative, the second term must be positive, which requires

pfO – h to be negative. In other words, it must be that fO < h/p, establishing part (a).

       (ii) If auditing were costless, k = 0, (6) would require that pfO – h = 0, or pfO = h; since

the expected fine for the offense equals the harm, this would result in first-best deterrence (for

everyone who pays fO). But if auditing is costly, k > 0, step (i) showed that pfO < h, resulting in

underdeterrence. This establishes part (b).

       (iii) By the implicit function theorem and the assumption that the second-order condition

for a maximum is satisfied with respect to the fine for the offense fO, the sign of dfO/dk is the




                                             - 11 -
same as the sign of the derivative of the left-hand side of (6) with respect to k. The latter

derivative is –pq[1 – R(pfO)][dG(fO/q)/dfO] < 0. Thus, dfO/dk < 0, proving part (c).

         Comment: To achieve first-best deterrence, the expected fine for the offense pfO would

have to equal the harm h or, equivalently, the fine for the offense fO would have to equal h/p.

The reason it is optimal to employ a lower fine, and tolerate some underdeterrence, is that doing

so reduces auditing costs. Specifically, if fO is lowered, more individuals will be willing to pay

fO rather than misrepresent their wealth levels (Proposition 1 established that individuals with

wealth levels above fM = fO/q will pay the fine for the offense). These individuals no longer will

be audited, thereby saving auditing costs. There is no first-order reduction in social welfare due

to the marginal individuals who now commit the offense as a result of the lower fine for the

offense, because they were individuals whose benefits just equaled the harm. Thus, it is optimal

to set the fine for the offense fO such that there is some underdeterrence, in order to reduce

auditing costs. Obviously, the higher the cost of an audit, the greater the motive to lower fO for

this reason.

         Note that, although a fine usually is treated as a socially costless sanction because it is a

mere transfer of wealth, it is no longer socially costless if auditing is required to induce

individuals to pay the fine. In effect, there is a marginal social cost incurred from imposing a

higher fine due to the need for a higher audit rate to induce the payment of the fine. As a

consequence, the fine for the offense should not be as high as it would be in the absence of

auditing costs.12

         12
           The results in Polinsky and Shavell (1991), where it was assumed that offenders’ wealth levels could be
observed without cost, are a special case of the present analysis — when the cost of an audit, k, is zero. There it was
shown that the optimal fine for the offense is h/p, implying that individuals with wealth levels equal to or greater
than h/p are deterred to the first-best extent. Here, due to the cost of auditing, the optimal fine is less than h/p,
implying that all individuals are underdeterred.

         Proposition 4. The optimal audit probability q*

         (a) is positive: q* > 0;

         (b) rises as the cost of auditing k declines; and

         (c) equals unity for k sufficiently low.

         Proof: (i) To demonstrate that the optimal audit probability q* is positive, suppose it

were zero. Then everyone would misrepresent their wealth levels. The critical value of benefit

b(w) would be zero for all wealth levels, regardless of the probability of detection p (see (3)).

But then it would be optimal for the state to spend nothing on enforcement, contradicting the

assumption that p* > 0. Thus, if the offense is worth deterring to any extent — that is, if p* >

0 — it must be that q* is positive, establishing part (a).13

         (ii) To see that q* rises as k declines, consider the first-order condition with respect to q;

using (5), and after some manipulation, it can be written as:

               4                                fO/q                          4
        k –{Ipqr(b)db}[dG(fO/q)/dq] + I{[pq][dR(pqw)/dq] – Ipr(b)db}g(w)dw
              pfO                                0                          pqw
                                                                                                                       (7)
                                      fO/q
                                     – I {[pqw – h][dR(pqw)/dq]}g(w)dw = 0.
                                       0

By the implicit function theorem and the assumption that the second-order condition for a

maximum is satisfied with respect to q, the sign of dq/dk is the same as the sign of the derivative

of (7) with respect to k. The latter derivative is the expression in large brackets in (7). To see

that this expression must be negative, observe that pqw – h < 0 for w # fO/q because, by part (a)




         13
            This result does not require that the lowest level of wealth is zero, only that it is sufficiently low. Even if
the state could impose a fine for the offense equal to the lowest level of wealth without auditing individuals, if this
level is sufficiently low, the value of the resulting deterrence will be less than the cost of detection.

of Proposition 3, fO/q < h/pq. Thus, the last term in (7) is positive, which implies that the

expression in large brackets must be negative. This proves part (b).

        (iii) To see that q* = 1 for k sufficiently low, I will first show that if k = 0, q* = 1. If k =

0, the derivative of social welfare with respect to q evaluated at q = 1 is the second term on the

left-hand side of (7) evaluated at q = 1, which is

                                  fO
                               – I {[pw – h][dR(pw)/dq]}g(w)dw.                                       (8)
                                 0

If k = 0, step (ii) of the proof of Proposition 3 showed that fO = h/p. Since pw – h < 0 for all w <

h/p, (8) is positive. This implies that q* = 1 if k = 0. Clearly, if k is sufficiently small, the

derivative of social welfare with respect to q evaluated at q = 1 will continue to be positive, in

which case q* will continue to equal unity. This establishes part (c).

        Comment: If it is optimal to expend resources on trying to detect offenders, it must be

optimal to audit them with some probability if they are caught, since otherwise the expenditures

on detection would be wasted. (Of course, it might be optimal not to deter the harmful activity at

all if the cost of detection and/or the cost of auditing is sufficiently great.) For any given

probability of detection, a higher audit probability is beneficial because it induces more offenders

to pay the fine for the offense fO rather than misrepresent their wealth levels (see parts (a) and (b)

of Proposition 1), and thereby deters them to a better degree. Thus, if the cost of auditing were

to decline, the optimal audit probability would rise, and if the cost were low enough, the optimal

audit probability would be unity.

IV. Concluding Remarks

       Although this article has considered monetary sanctions only, I want to observe in closing

that the appropriate use of an imprisonment sanction for misrepresenting one’s wealth could

increase social welfare. Specifically, suppose an imprisonment sentence, in addition to the fine

fM, is imposed on individuals who are found to have been capable of paying the fine for the

offense fO but who nonetheless misrepresented their wealth level. (Individuals who are not able

to pay the fine fO are sanctioned only with a fine equal to their wealth if they are found to have

misrepresented their wealth level, as above.) If the imprisonment sentence is high enough, such

individuals now can be induced to pay fO instead of misrepresenting their wealth level; and since

they pay fO, they will not be audited and will not bear the sentence. The behavior of all other

individuals is unaffected under this sentencing policy. Hence, social welfare rises because the

extent of underdeterrence, as well as the cost of auditing, declines for the affected individuals.

       The preceding paragraph establishes that some use of the threat of imprisonment to deter

misrepresentation of wealth is socially desirable, but it does not derive the optimal use of

imprisonment sanctions for this purpose. It may be optimal also to impose imprisonment

sentences for misrepresentation on individuals who are not capable of paying the fine for the

offense fO. Although some of these individuals will be audited and bear the imprisonment

sentence, the additional deterrence due to use of an imprisonment sanction can allow the auditing

probability q or the probability of detection p to be lowered, thereby saving auditing or

enforcement costs. Thus, the optimal use of imprisonment to sanction misrepresentation of

wealth might involve sentences that depend on whether an individual is found to have been

capable of paying the fine for the offense fO.




                                            - 15 -
          Another possibility is to use imprisonment to sanction the offense. In a companion

paper — Polinsky (2004) — I consider the optimal use of fines and imprisonment when wealth is

assumed to be impossible to observe. I demonstrate in the model employed there that when

imprisonment sentences are used, the optimal choice of sanctions induces high-wealth offenders

to pay a fine that exceeds the wealth level of low-wealth offenders; by paying the fine, they

avoid a less desirable combination of sanctions they would bear if they paid only as much as

low-wealth offenders and faced a longer imprisonment sentence.14 Thus, an appropriately

designed sanctioning policy that includes imprisonment sentences for the offense can serve as an

alternative to auditing — both can reduce the incentive of offenders to misrepresent their wealth

levels.




          14
          This result is similar in spirit to a point developed by Levitt (1997), though he formally considers fines
and imprisonment sentences as alternatives, rather than the optimal combination of the sanctions.
