Structuring Incentives Within Organizations: The Case of Accountable Care Organizations

                                           ABSTRACT

Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are new organizations created by the Affordable Care Act
to encourage more efficient, integrated care delivery. To promote efficiency, ACOs sign contracts
under which they keep a fraction of the savings from keeping costs below target provided they also
maintain quality levels. To promote integration and facilitate measurement, ACOs are required to
have at least 5,000 enrollees and so must coordinate across many providers. We calibrate a model
of optimal ACO incentives using proprietary performance measures from a large insurer. Our key
finding is that free-riding is a severe problem and causes optimal incentive payments to exceed cost
savings unless ACOs simultaneously achieve extremely large efficiency gains. This implies that
successfulACOs will likely rely on motivational strategies that amplify the effects of under-powered
incentives.These motivational strategies raise important questions about the limits of ACOs as a
policy for promotingmore efficient, integrated care.

                                           Introduction

       Economists and others concerned about inefficiencies in the U.S. health care

delivery system frequently worry about the fragmented structure of physician practices.

Fragmented care delivered by physicians working as independent owners of small

practices is, so the story goes, incapable of matching the high quality or low cost of care

delivered by large integrated systems. The inefficient fragmented providers are not

driven out of the market, however, because they operate in a largely “fee-for-service”

payment environment that does not measure or reward cost-efficient delivery of health

care services.

       The view that fragmented care delivery has both lower quality and higher cost

raises two fundamental economic questions. First, what is it about care delivered within

an organization that enables superior performance? Secondly, do these advantages

accrue only to traditional hierarchical organizations that own hospitals and clinics and

hire physicians as employees? Or might the advantages of integration also accrue to

hybrid forms that more closely resemble the organizational environment in which health

care is currently delivered in much of the United States?

       We explore these questions in the context of Accountable Care Organizations

(ACOs). ACOs are a new model for integrated health care delivery created by the

Obama administration’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ACOs are designed

to promote the benefits of integrated care by allowing a network of hospitals and

providers to jointly contract with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

to provide care to a population of Medicare patients in an environment that rewards cost



                                                                                              1
efficiency. The key feature of these contracts is the use of shared savings to contain costs

combined with incentives to maintain care quality at acceptable levels.

       In health care settings, there is a very compelling reason to aggregate incentives

within organizations: quality measures are typically quite noisy and averaging measured

performance across the members of an organization improves precision. One study

finds, for example, that primary care physicians had annual median caseloads of 260

Medicare patients (Nyweide et al., 2009). Of these, 25 were women eligible for

mammography and 30 had diabetes. With such low numbers, individual primary care

physician practices simply do not have a sufficient caseload to reliably detect, say, a 10

percent improvement in the rate of use of relevant preventive care measures such as

routine breast exams and monitoring hemoglobin levels in blood. If real improvements in

quality cannot be distinguished from changes due to random chance, pay-for-

performance comes uncomfortably close to pay for luck. On this basis, Fisher et al.

(2009) argue that ACOs require a minimum of 5,000 beneficiaries for performance

measures to have sufficient power to reliably identify meaningful performance

improvements, a minimum size requirement that CMS has since adopted.

       From an economic perspective this statistical approach to determining the optimal

scale of an organization is incomplete. Improving the precision of performance measures

does indeed enhance the efficiency of incentive pay arrangements, but this gain comes at

a cost. Increasing the size of patient populations usually requires bringing more

physicians into the ACO. As the number of physicians grows, the effect of any




                                                                                             2
physician’s action on the organization’s overall performance is diminished and so

incentives are diluted.

       On this basis one might expect that there exists some optimal ACO size that

balances the marginal costs from free-riding against the marginal benefits of enhanced

precision in performance measures. Surprisingly we find that this is not the case.

Increasing the size of ACOs simply makes the incentive problem more severe. We

establish this result using a model of physicians operating under ACO-style incentives.

Our approach builds upon conventional principal-agent models, but is unusual in that it

focuses on the sort of nonlinear incentives built into the ACO program and commonly

used elsewhere in health care – shared savings relative to cost benchmarks to encourage

cost-efficient practice styles with payouts conditional on achieving target levels of care

quality.

       We further investigate the nature of the ACO incentive problem by calibrating our

incentive model using confidential claims data and quality measures from a very large

sample of chronically ill patients. Here we find that the free-riding problems within

ACOs of requisite size are so severe that pay-for-performance plans aimed at achieving

meaningful cost reductions will typically not be self-funding; that is, the savings they

produce will not cover the costs of the performance bonuses without extremely large

economies of scale or productivity improvements within ACOs. It follows that ACOs

committed to self-financed pay-for-performance will likely operate with under-powered

incentives. Successful ACOs will have to find ways to augment their under-powered

incentives with motivational strategies that complement pay-for-performance.



                                                                                             3
         The difficulty of implementing these complementary motivational strategies

determines the cost of transacting care delivery within organizations as opposed to

markets. Interestingly some of the complementary strategies we identify will only be

workable within conventional integrated organizations, while others might be

implemented within hybrid organizational forms that are more congruent with

fragmented practice patterns. Gibbons (2010) in his overview of the field, argues that

transaction cost economics has done a good job identifying the costs of transacting within

a market, it but has not yet provided a satisfactory account of variations in the cost of

transacting within an organization. 1 From this perspective ACOs provide an interesting

and policy-relevant laboratory for examining integration costs for varying organizational

types.

         The paper proceeds in four sections. Section one briefly introduces relevant

institutional background on health care fragmentation and the structure of accountable

care organizations. Section two develops our model of incentive pay and section three

presents the results of our calibration exercise. Section four considers the problem of

augmenting under-powered pay-for-performance incentives within ACOs.

         1.      Fragmented Care Delivery and the ACO as Policy Response 2

         Health services researchers have long argued that a central problem with health

care delivery in the U.S. is fragmentation (Cebul et al., 2008). Individual patients are

frequently treated by numerous care providers who have only weak organizational ties

 Masten et al. (1991) identify a similar gap in the literature.

economics of physician’s practices.


                                                                                                 4
with one another and often little expertise in coordinating care. This results in poor

information flows, heightened error rates and inadequate care coordination – problems

that are especially troublesome for the management of patients with costly chronic

diseases. The obvious fix, according to this view, is for physicians to join large

integrated care delivery systems. Yet as late as 2001, 60 percent of physicians worked

either in solo practice or in groups of 2 to 4 physicians and only 7 percent worked in

groups with 50 or more physicians. In that same year, more than 65 percent of physicians

were self-employed and only 35 percent were employees. Why, given their purported

efficiency advantages, don’t we see more physicians going to work for large integrated

care organizations?

         Surprisingly little research has been devoted to this important question, but

conventional wisdom is that the answer lies in the ways health care services are financed

and purchased. 3 More specifically, restrictions on Medicare’s purchasing policies

combined with coordination failures between non-governmental buyers and providers

prevent the emergence of efficient integrated care delivery organizations.

         Medicare, the largest single buyer of medical services, is locked by rules and

legislation into a fee-for-service payment system and cannot selectively contract with

more efficient physician groups. Compounding the problem is the fact that the Medicare

regulatory boards charged with evaluating new technologies are concerned primarily with

whether new drugs or procedures offer positive benefits rather than whether they are

cost-effective (Baicker and Chandra, 2011). The failure to consider cost-effectiveness

 In contrast, there has been a large literature documenting the productive and allocative inefficiencies in
our care delivery systems. For an incisive review see Baicker and Chandra (2011).


                                                                                                              5
likely has system-wide repercussions because commercial health insurance plans are

heavily influenced by Medicare coverage decisions (Baicker and Chandra, 2011).

         If Medicare is hamstrung by regulations, the private sector is constrained by

different considerations. Many employers who purchase insurance on behalf of their

employees are not interested in or capable of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the care

their employees receive. 4 Sophisticated employers (typically large, self-insured

companies) would like to reward high efficiency providers but are thwarted by a thorny

coordination problem. Suppose that the full efficiency gains of integrated care delivery

can only be realized under bundled prospective payment systems (Crosson, 2009). In

communities with highly fragmented care delivery, it is hard to find providers with the

capacity to succeed under such a payment system. As a result payers don’t innovate

away from the status quo fee-for-service payment system and there is little competitive

advantage for providers to move out of their currently fragmented delivery

organizations. 5

         Accountable Care Organizations are designed to overcome these impediments to

payment reform. 6 First, and perhaps most important, ACOs offer a means by which


4
  In a case study of Geisinger’s Provencare program, Clark and Rosenthal quote the results of conversations
between Geisinger and the employers who buy their insurance. “We went with the health plan leadership
and talked to a number of employers. We told them that we would guarantee delivery of the best care and
that we wouldn’t submit a bill otherwise. The employers didn’t want any of that. Their eyes glazed over.
They said, ‘As far as we know, we’re already buying best practices. The evidence we really care about is
whether or not the patients need the procedure in the first place. In addition, we don’t like all of the
unpredictability in costs that you get with each patient. Give us one price per procedure and you worry
about all the other stuff” (Clark and Rosenthal, 2008 p. 8).
5
  In comments on a previous draft of this paper, Daniel Kessler pointed out another contributing issue in the
private sector. The fact that private insurance expenditures are tax exempt further reduces gains from
eliminating inefficient spending.
6
  Although ACOs are only a small part of a huge piece of legislation, they have attracted a great deal of
attention from policy-makers, physicians and managers. As of October 2012, there were a total of 318


                                                                                                           6
Medicare can break away from traditional fee-for-service reimbursements and reward

efficient providers. As a legal entity, ACOs are comprised of a network of hospitals and

providers that contract with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to

provide care to a large bloc of Medicare patients (5,000 or more). The contracts, which

last for three years, create a single risk-bearing entity with incentives to control costs. 7

ACOs that come in under their specified cost benchmarks earn a fraction of the savings.

In order to receive these payments the ACO must also clear stringent threshold quality

levels on a number of indicators that reflect patient and caregiver experience, care

coordination, patient safety, preventive care, and health of at-risk frail and elderly

populations (Ginsburg, 2011).

         The goal of this incentive system is to reward efficient providers without

sacrificing quality. By encouraging the formation of large provider organizations de-

novo, CMS may also overcome the coordination failures that have prevented

sophisticated private buyers from reforming their own payment practices. Indeed there is

nothing stopping ACOs that contract with Medicare from also contracting with private

payers. The prospect of emerging integrated delivery organizations may already be

moving savvy insurance companies to rethink their payment policies. Song et. al (2011)

Meyer, 2012. As an indication of the interest in ACOs, consider the following incomplete list of
relatively recent articles in such leading journals as the New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of
the American Medical Association and Health Affairs: Burns and Pauly (2012), Crosson (2009), Crosson
(2011), Ginsburg (2011), Meyer (2012), Shields et al. (2011), Shortell and Casalino (2010), Singer and
Shortell (2011), and Song et al. (2011) .
7
  The exact nature of the payments to ACOs varies a good deal. All ACOs face a cost benchmark for
taking care of defined groups of patients. If they meet performance standards, they share in any cost
savings they achieve; in some cases, they also may share losses they incur. Medicare ACOs are paid on a
fee-for-service basis rather than on a per member per month basis- further clouding the picture (Meyer,
2012).


                                                                                                             7
analyze the effects of a recently introduced global double-sided payment incentive

system implemented by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. The contract was

similar in many respects to the shared savings program for Medicare but instead of

Medicare patients it was implemented for HMO and point of service commercial

populations.

         From an organizational perspective, ACOs have a number of novel features.

ACOs cannot restrict their members to a specific network of physicians and there is

nothing in the legislation requiring that ACOs be constituted as a traditional organization

in which doctors are either employees or owners of a risk-bearing entity that also owns

the relevant capital equipment. Indeed advocates who favor ACOs as a means of

promoting integrated care systems see them emerging from five different practice

arrangements: integrated delivery systems that combine insurance, hospitals, and

physicians; multi-specialty group practices; physician hospital organizations; independent

practice associations, and virtual physician organizations (Shortell et al., 2010). As we

discuss below, the transformation of hybrid and virtual physician organizations into
                                                                                   8
ACOs poses special problems and opportunities for incentive design.

         Larson, Van Citters, et al. (2012) offer an in-depth look at four recently formed

ACOs that gives a tangible sense of the variety of organizations involved. One is an

independent practice association that employs 700 physicians and has 2400 affiliated;

another is an integrated hospital delivery system that employs 475 doctors and owns five


8
 Meyer (2012) reports that of the 114 provider groups in Medicare Shared Savings ACO Program, nearly
half are physician driven organizations serving fewer than 10,000 beneficiaries. In addition 32 are larger
provider groups with experience in coordinated care started Medicare Pioneer ACOs.


                                                                                                             8
hospitals. The third is a loose independent practice association with 40 employed

physicians and 2500 affiliated ones that has affiliations with 18 hospitals but owns none

of its own. The fourth is a community hospital system that employs 16 physicians and

has 800 affiliated and owns two hospitals.

       In addition to influencing primary care practice, the ACO model may also

transform the link between primary care and specialized care. ACOs may be able to

improve their bottom line by introducing training and computer-assisted decision support

that facilitates generalists substituting their own decisions for those of specialists. It may,

for example, be efficient to train primary care physicians to treat rashes and acne rather

than sending every case of rash or acne to a dermatologist. On the other hand, the vast

explosion in medical knowledge implies that there are limits to the substitution of

generalist for specialist care (Becker and Murphy, 1992). In this case, Garicano and

Santos (2004) analysis suggests that efficiently managing referrals to specialists will

likely entail bringing some specialists into the ACO. Keeping these specialists fully

occupied may also exert additional upward pressure on the scale of ACOs.

       2.      Modeling Incentives in Fee-for-service and ACO Environments

       In this section we present a simple multi-task model of physician incentives.

 Physician effort and attention is divided between finding ways to generate income and

 providing quality care to patients. In a fee-for-service environment there is little tension

 between these two goals: physicians get reimbursed for all the medically necessary care

 their patients require. Things are different, however, in an ACO environment. Here cost

 benchmarks make it possible for providers to profit by not providing care to patients.



                                                                                             9
    For this reason ACO contracts specify that providers can keep some portion of savings

    below the cost benchmark provided that the organization also clears specific quality

    thresholds. 9

          More formally, we model an ACO as a team of 𝑁 doctors who accept a cost

    benchmark for the care of a defined group of patients, and consider how the principal

    (i.e., CMS) should choose savings bonuses and quality thresholds in order to induce a

    desired level of cost savings and care quality. Following the typical contract theoretical

    framework, we first model the physicians’ best responses to a given incentive scheme,

    and take those best responses as constraints in the principal’s decision problem.

           Average costs of care for the team depend on each doctor i’s cost-control efforts,

    𝑒𝑖𝑐 , which are measured in money-metric units, as well as noise, 𝜂𝑖𝑐 :

                                                  𝑁
                                           1
                                       𝐶𝑁 = �(𝐶 + 𝜂𝑖𝑐 − 𝑒𝑖𝑐 )
                                           𝑁
                                                 𝑖=1

where 𝐶 is the average baseline cost of care. Quality of care likewise depends on noise

and money-metric effort devoted to quality. Average quality for the team is
                                                      𝑁
                                            1   𝑞    𝑞
                                        𝑄𝑁 = ��𝑒𝑖 − 𝜂𝑖 �
                                            𝑁
                                                   𝑖=1




9
  The actual incentive contracts are more varied than this. Meyer (2012) briefly describes a number of
different compensation set-ups in Medicare’s ACO program. In the Shared Savings program, ACOs
receive bonuses if they achieve cost and quality targets. In the future, Shared Savings ACOs will have to
accept “two sided risk” and pay CMS back if they exceed spending targets. The Shared Savings program
also includes an Advance Payment ACO model in which smaller groups receive their potential savings up
front to help them fund infrastructure costs. “Pioneer” ACOs are formed from large provider groups with
more experience in coordinated care. These ACOs currently accept “two sided risk” and they must show
that at least half of their revenues in the near future will come from similar contracts with other payers.


                                                                                                         10
The cost and quality disturbances are not observable, have mean zero and variance 𝜎𝑐2 and

𝜎𝑞2 respectively, and are independent from each other and across doctors.

         ACO members are compensated based on the entire team’s level of costs and

quality. The team splits evenly a fraction, 𝑏, of savings (or losses) relative to baseline,

but receives a positive payout only if average quality exceeds a specified threshold 𝑥̅ .

Doctors are risk neutral and maximize expected income minus effort costs. Doctor i’s

payoff is therefore



                                                                                        2
                                                         �𝑒𝑖𝑞 + 𝑒𝑖𝑐 �                                       (1)
      𝑈𝑖 = 𝐸�𝑏(𝐶 − 𝐶𝑁 )�1 − 1(𝑄𝑁 < 𝑥̅ )1(𝐶 − 𝐶𝑁 > 0)�� −

The first term in the utility function in effect assumes that individual physicians are risk-

neutral in bonus income. This assumption may be surprising given the importance of risk

pooling in the structuring of ACOs - but organizations pool risk because of liquidity and

credit constraints and the consequent risk of insolvency should an ACO incur much

higher than expected costs. Our paper does not analyze these enterprise-level risk-

management concerns. Rather we focus on how organization level incentives influence

the actions of individual physicians. In this context, risk neutrality most realistically

captures physicians’ preferences over the relatively small individual payouts at stake in

ACOs. 10 Introducing risk aversion into the model would also greatly complicate the

analysis much without adding insight. The core question of our paper concerns incentive

10
   This is consistent with the conventional economic theory of insurance which finds that rational
individuals ought to be approximately risk neutral over gambles that are small relative to individual net
worth.


                                                                                                            11
and moral hazard problems and these are handled entirely through our analysis of the

variable component of compensation - just as they would be if the model allowed for

risk-averse agents. Introducing risk aversion, however, would also require us to derive

both the variable and fixed component of compensation because this latter component of

compensation provides income insurance for risk-averse agents. Thus by abstracting

from risk aversion, we are greatly simplifying the analysis without altering our

conclusions in a substantive way.

         The last term in the utility function reflects the multi-task nature of effort devoted

to cost reduction and to quality. An increase in 𝑒𝑞 increases the marginal cost of

providing effort for cost-reduction activities and an increase in 𝑒𝑐 similarly increases the

marginal cost of quality improving efforts.                      This specification also implies that

physicians are intrinsically motivated to supply minimum levels of effort to cost and

quality, but additional incentives are required to move them beyond these levels. 11

         Invoking a central limit theorem, the utility function can be rewritten as:

                                                                 1

Consider a symmetric equilibrium where all doctors choose the same effort levels,

𝑒 𝑞 , 𝑒 𝑐 . Then provided the second order conditions are satisfied (which we verify is the

case for the range of parameters we consider) the equilibrium conditions determining

doctors’ effort are:

(CMS) as the principal but the same logic would apply to any private payer. CMS

determines the levels of cost sharing, b, and quality thresholds, 𝑥,
                                                                  � that must be set in

order to induce desired levels of cost savings, 𝑒 𝑐 , and care quality, 𝑒 𝑞 . From the



                                                                                                 13
principal’s point of view, therefore, the first-order conditions determine the required

choice of savings bonus, b, and quality threshold, 𝑥̅ , for any desired effort levels. With

this set-up in place, we can then answer our main theoretical question: how does the

required level of shared savings, 𝑏, change as the team size, 𝑁, increases? As we show

in an appendix, it is straight-forward to show that

   𝑑𝑏⁄𝑑𝑁 > 0.

Thus, to achieve any given level of cost reduction and quality level, principals must

employ higher-powered cost incentives in larger ACOs. The reason for this is that the

free-riding problem swamps any gains from improved precision in performance

measures. This result is, in turn, due to fundamental properties of group incentives and

performance measures. Specifically it reflects the fact that the free-riding incentive

dilution worsens with 1/𝑁 while precision improves with 1/√𝑁.

       3.      Calibrating the Model

       In this section we calibrate our incentive model in order to consider the conditions

under which the ACO pay-for-performance scheme will be self-financing. More

precisely, we ask under what combinations of cost targets, quality targets and group size

will the savings generated by the pay-for-performance incentives be enough to pay for

the requisite performance bonuses.

       Our calibration proceeds in two steps. First, we derive empirical estimates of the

two key parameters in the model, 𝜎𝑐 and 𝜎𝑞 , the standard deviations of the cost and

quality measures, respectively, using data on patient health care costs and actual clinical

quality measures. Plugging these values into our model, we then calculate the maximum



                                                                                           14
ACO size consistent with a self-financing pay-for-performance incentive that achieves a

given cost/quality target.

Estimating the Standard Deviation of Clinical Cost and Quality Measures

       Our observed cost and quality measures are derived from confidential insurance

records on roughly a million chronically ill, commercial insurance members with health

insurance from commercially insured employers. These data are well suited for this

exercise in that the insurer combined billing records with data from pharmacies and labs

to construct an ersatz electronic medical record for each patient that enables the

construction of detailed cost and quality measures. An important limitation of this data is

that they do not include information on Medicare patients. This limitation may not be

that important for our purposes because: (1) this commercial population suffers from

many of the chronic conditions afflicting a Medicare population; and (2) our cost and

quality regressions include quite detailed clinical controls. In this regard it is also

important to remember that commercial populations are themselves very relevant to the

phenomenon we study because ACOs are expected to contract with both Medicare and

commercial insurers.

       Our cost measure is constructed by applying Medicare reimbursement rates to the

diagnostic and procedure codes associated with each claim, and then summing within

each patient. Our cost measure is intended not to reflect the actual amount paid for the

care, which will depend on specific negotiations between providers and the insurer, but

rather the resource costs of care. Our quality measure is also constructed from the

individual claims. The claims records are passed through a sophisticated artificial



                                                                                           15
intelligence program to develop a quality measure which we label Potential Gaps in

Care. The adjective “potential” emphasizes that these are, in fact, noisy indicators of

actual gaps in care. An illustrative issue identified by the system might be that the patient

is a good candidate for an ACE inhibitor but there is no evidence that a prescription for

the drug has been filled (a partial list of targeted issues is provided in an appendix). 12

This measured outcome could reflect a true gap in care arising from physician oversight.

Alternatively, it might be a data error or it may reflect the patient’s failure to fill the

issued script, or an informed decision on the part of the physician not to offer ACE

inhibitors because of some clinical issue not apparent to the software system.

        The insurer invested substantial resources in developing these measures of

potential gaps in care in order to track care quality and to communicate potential issues to

physicians. It is important to note, however, that these measures were not tied to any

incentive plan and there were no financial or other repercussions for physicians whose

patients generated potential gaps in care. These quality measures are also useful for our

purposes because they are based upon widely accepted quality indicators and because

they are constructed from the same sort of billing records that are available to Medicare.

        We restrict our sample to patients with a primary care doctor. Patients are defined

as having a primary care doctor when a physician in a primary care specialty (internal

medicine, family practice, pediatrics, general practice) is also the main provider of care as

determined from claims information. Using this data we construct a dummy variable,


12
   The system used by the insurer identified 1246 unique gaps in care. The most common gaps involved
well-known preventive care guidelines while some of the rarer ones involved more immediately threatening
issues.


                                                                                                     16
Any Potential Gap in Care, which takes a value of one if any potential gap in care was

observed over the period the patient is in the sample. 13 Descriptive statistics for our

population are presented in Table 1.

        <<COMP: Place Table 1 about here>>

        As reported in Table 1, average patient costs in our sample are $8,008, and the

mean of Any Potential Gap in Care is 0.29. To calibrate our model we also require an

estimate of the noise with which care cost and quality are measured. We base these on

the residual variance from regressions of 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠 and Any Potential Gap in Care on

variables for age and gender, physician fixed effects, as well as a vector of commonly

used risk-adjustor variables known as Hierarchical Clinical Condition (HCC) indictors.

The HCC model is used by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a risk score

to predict how costly a Medicare enrollee is likely to be relative to the national average

beneficiary. It includes 70 hierarchical indicators that together describe an enrollee’s

clinical condition (for a full description see Pope et al., 2004). The regression we

estimate relates the cost or quality measure for patient 𝑖, treated by primary care

physician 𝑗, to demographic and underlying clinical variables 𝑋𝑖𝑗 and a physician-specific

effect 𝛼𝑗 :

                                        𝑌𝑖𝑗 = 𝑋′𝑖 𝛽 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 ,

where 𝑌𝑖𝑗 is either patient costs or the quality indicator. From this exercise we find that

the root mean squared error is $10,976 for the cost regressions and 0.430 for potential

gaps in care. Fischer et. al., (2009) report that the average physician group has 260
13
 Costs and Potential gaps in care were identified based on medical claims over a 30 month period. The
median elapsed time between the first and last appearance of a patient in our sample is about 8 months.


                                                                                                          17
Medicare patients. Adopting this as the relevant sample size for each physician, it

follows that an empirical measure for the physician-level cost noise is $10,976/√260 =

$681, and for the physician level quality measure noise is 𝜎 = .43/√260 = .027.

Converting Empirical Measures to Model Units

         The final task is to convert the empirical measures of cost and quality noise to the

money-metric units of the model. To do this, we first observe that money-metric effort

implies effort and noise units are measured in terms of first-best cost-saving effort. The

easiest way to see this is to consider optimal physician effort if team size were N=1,

quality was at the status quo level 𝑒 𝑞 = 0, and physicians keep all cost savings induced

by their efforts, 𝑏 = 1. Under these conditions, equation (1) implies that first-best effort

level occurs when 𝑒 𝑐 = 1. Since both the noise and effort terms are added together in the

model, they must be in the same units – hence the money metric noise term is measured

in terms of first best physician effort levels.

         With this as background, converting observed estimates of noise in costs to

money-metric noise simply requires an assumption about how much costs would fall if

physicians operated under first-best cost reduction incentives. We assume in what

follows that this number is 30 percent. 14 Remembering that average expenditures in our

sample are $8,008, it follows that a unit of money metric effort is equivalent to 0.3*8008

=$2402.40. Using this conversion factor, our estimate of 𝜎𝑐 =$681 becomes 0.283 in the

money-metric units of the model.



14
  Alternative assumptions of 10 percent or 50 percent change the simulation results only slightly (available
upon request).


                                                                                                         18
       Converting the empirical measures for the noise in the care quality measure to the

money-metric units in the model requires an additional assumption about the functional

form relating the empirical quality measures to money-metric effort devoted to quality.

We posit that the exponential distribution is a reasonable functional form because the

transformation likely exhibits decreasing returns and a ceiling to the observed measure of

quality. More formally, we can write the conditional mean of the quality measure as a

function of effort devoted to quality, 𝑒 𝑞 , as 𝐸[𝑋𝑖 |𝑒 𝑞 ] = 1 − exp (−(1 + 𝑒 𝑞 )/𝛽)

= ℎ(𝑒 𝑞 ). The principal’s money-metric effort is just the inverse of this transformation:

𝑥𝑖 = ℎ−1 (𝑋𝑖 ). This framework implies a locally linear mapping from outcome-

denominated variance to input-denominated variance at the normalized status quo-input

level. Applying a delta-method type approximation to convert the empirically observed

mean and standard deviation of the quality measure, 𝜇 and 𝜎, to the money metric quality

noise parameter needed to calibrate the model, 𝜎𝑞 :

                                          𝜎𝑞 = 𝜎𝑋 ℎ−1′ (𝜇).

Using the exponential transformation described above, the calibration becomes

                                                 1 + 𝑒𝑞
                                     𝜎𝑞 = 𝜎                   .
                                            (𝜇 − 1) 𝑙𝑛(1 − 𝜇)

Plugging in the values 𝜇 = 1 − .288 = .712 and 𝜎 = .027 and normalizing so that 𝑒 𝑞 =

0 -implying that the target quality level is the status quo - the model’s quality noise

parameter is then 𝜎𝑞 =0.0741.

       With our empirically-based estimates for the model’s money-metric parameters in

hand, we can proceed with the calibration. We find that for reasonable savings and




                                                                                          19
quality targets, increasing the number of physicians quickly makes the incentive scheme

untenable.

       <<COMP: Place Fig. 1 about here>>

       Figure 1 plots the principal’s optimal cost-sharing parameter as the ACO size

increases from 1 physician to 20 under the assumption that the principal is trying to

achieve 20 percent of the first-best cost reductions. If, for example, first-best incentives

yielded a 30% cost savings, the principal will be designing group incentives for the ACO

to achieve a 6% reduction in costs. Consistent with the comparative statics results from

the previous section, we see that the fraction of savings that are shared increases with

group size. Notice, however, that as the size of the ACO exceeds 5, the sharing

parameter required to achieve the target exceeds one. This surprising result highlights the

primary result of this calibration: even with modest cost and quality targets, it will often

be the case that ACO style pay-for-performance incentives may not be self-financing.

       <<COMP: Place Fig. 2 about here>>

       We present this result more fully in Figure 2. This figure plots the maximum

team size consistent with achieving the presumed cost target and having a self-financing

pay-for-performance system (that is, the fraction of shared savings is less than 100

percent). Examining the figure we find that a self-funding pay-for-performance incentive

aimed at achieving 5 percent of the cost reductions obtainable by first-best incentives (i.e.

those possible with risk neutral physicians working as residual claimants in solo practice)

cannot involve a group larger than 17 physicians. Above this size level, the free-riding

problem becomes so severe, that the requisite cost containment bonus exceeds the




                                                                                           20
savings generated under such a system. If the principal’s aim was to achieve 10 percent

of the gains possible under first-best incentives, the maximum size of a self-funded pay-

for-performance system would be eight physicians. As the desired level of cost savings

rise, the maximum ACO size shrinks dramatically. Cost savings goals aimed at achieving

50% or more of the savings possible under first-best incentives could only be self-

funding under solo-practices. The obvious implication of Figure 2 is that with all but the

most trivial cost reduction targets, ACOs with self-funding pay-for-performance systems

must operate with under-powered financial incentives.

       The analysis so far has assumed that team production is no different from

individual production. In all likelihood, however, there may be efficiency gains from

combining physicians into ACOs which may make self-financed incentives more

feasible. Our calibrated model allows us to quantify how great the efficiency gains from

team production would have to be in order for the required incentives to be self-

financing. We do this by introducing a multiplier, 𝑚(𝑁), on cost-savings effort, so that

physicians in a team of size 𝑁 who each exert cost-savings effort 𝑒 𝑐 actually realize cost

savings equal to 𝑚(𝑁) × 𝑒 𝑐 . This is a simple way of capturing the possibility that team

production amplifies the benefits of each member’s efforts. We do not unfortunately have

estimates of 𝑚(𝑁), but our model allows us to ask how big the multiplier would have to

be for each team size in order for incentives to be self-financing.

<<COMP: Place Fig. 3 about here>>

       Our calibrations show that for the parameters used above, teams of reasonable

size would need efficiency multipliers that are very large relative to estimates of the



                                                                                            21
efficiency gains from team production in the health care literature. Figure 3 plots the

efficiency multiplier, 𝑚(𝑁), that would be necessary for the ACO incentive scheme to be

self-financing for team sizes from 1 to 20 physicians. As before, the savings target is set

at 20 percent of the first-best level of savings, with quality being set at the status quo, and

noise parameters as calibrated above. For teams of 4 or fewer physicians, the multiplier

could actually be less than one, since as we saw in Figure 1, the required payouts for

teams this small are already less than the generated savings. For larger teams, however,

the required efficiency multiplier is greater than one and grows roughly proportionally to

the team size. At 𝑁 = 10 the required multiplier is greater than 200 percent, and at

𝑁 = 20 the required multiplier is greater than 450 percent. Are team efficiencies of this

magnitude realistic? Many studies have compared health care spending in multispecialty

and integrated group practices to national averages and have found efficiencies up to

about 30 percent (see Tollen, 2008 for a summary). More recently, Berwick and

Hackbarth (2012) estimated that total waste in the health care system increased total

spending by 21% in the low estimate to 47% in the high estimate. These studies do not

speak directly to our model of incentives to reduce costs, but they do suggest that the

likelihood of achieving effort efficiencies on the order of those in Figure 3 may be quite

low.

Sensitivity of Results to Assumptions:

       Empirical exercises of the sort we have conducted so far depend critically on key

assumptions. It is worth noting that our results are not the result of choosing a very noisy

performance measure or unrealistically small panel sizes. Taking the second issue first,



                                                                                            22
the median number of Medicare beneficiaries in a practice in Nyweide, Weeks, Gottlieb,

Casalino and Fisher (2009) is 260, suggesting that the median caseload for a physician

would be much smaller. Also, the caseload for any given quality measure is a small

fraction of the total caseload (see their Table 2) – although to compare their results with

ours, we would need to know the caseload per physician not per practice, which they do

not show.

       Similarly, we were concerned about the sensitivity of our results to sampling

variation leading to different estimates of parameters 𝜇, 𝜎𝑐 , and 𝜎𝑞 . To examine the role

of sampling variation we bootstrapped our model and found almost no difference at all

between calibrations using the minimum and maximum estimates. The unimportance of

sampling variation makes sense given the very large samples we use to construct these

estimates.

       The model calibrations also required an assumption on the fraction of costs that

could be saved under first-best incentives, which we set at 30 percent. Repeating the

analyses for alternative assumptions of 10 percent and 50 percent produced only very

slight changes, and no change at all in the qualitative conclusions.

       Finally we were concerned about the sensitivity of our results to the fact that we

weighted all potential gaps in care equally regardless of severity. To assess the

importance of this assumption, we also experimented with replacing the quality measure

described in the text with an alternative quality measure that gives greater weight to more




                                                                                          23
severe potential gaps in care. The severity weighted measure produces bonus estimates

that are very similar to those described in the text. 15

4.        Mitigating Strategies for Organizations with Under-powered Incentives.

     The finding that self-financed pay-for-performance incentive schemes for large provider

organizations are likely to be under-powered suggests that successful ACOs will have to

make use of complementary motivators that augment the influence of pay-for-

performance financial incentives.

          In this section of the paper, we use our model to describe how two such

complementary motivators would work. The first additional incentive instrument we

consider is a performance bond posted by the provider. These bonds would be returned

(with interest) to providers along with a payout based on realized savings should the

ACO achieve its quality targets, but they would be forfeited in the event of failure.

          More formally suppose that physicians are persuaded to post performance bonds

of magnitude 𝑠 with the principal or in escrow at the beginning of the period. At the end

of the period, after team costs and quality outcomes are realized, the bond 𝑠 is returned to

each physician if the quality threshold was met, and not otherwise. The principal also

pays out an amount equal to 𝑏(𝐶 − 𝐶𝑁 ) − 𝑠, unless the quality threshold was not met and

𝐶 − 𝐶𝑁 > 0, in which case the payout is zero. Since the marginal impact of effort on the

physician’s net payout is unaffected by the performance bond, the physicians’ first-order


15
  The insurer gave each potential gap a severity code ranging from one to four. Applying these weights to
Potential Gaps in Care, we ran the same regressions described in the text and used the mean square error
from that regression to calibrate a new value of 𝜎𝑞 =0.095. This new parameter value produced results
estimates very close to those in the text and group production multipliers that are, in fact, larger, so the
approach described in the text was – if anything- conservative.


                                                                                                          24

the performance bond at

where 𝑒 𝑐 and 𝑒 𝑞 are the cost and quality effort levels the principal wishes to induce,

ensures that the average equilibrium payout is equal to 𝑒 𝑐 ; that is, the payout is exactly

financed by the savings the ACO generates.

       The advantage of performance bonds is that they can greatly magnify the power

of self-financing pay-for-performance systems. Their great disadvantage is that it might

be very difficult to persuade agents to post them and to trust that they will be returned

under the right circumstances. In the organizational economics literature this difficulty is

often addressed through the device of deferred compensation in the context of long-term

employment relationships. Employees post bonds by accepting pay less than their

marginal product early in their relationship and this is returned later on in the relationship

through severance pay, pensions and other forms of deferred payments. A closely related

employment strategy is the efficiency wage strategy under which employees receive a

salary greater than their next best alternative. The discounted present value of this pay

premium, when combined with a threat to sever relationships should performance targets

be missed, would also have the effect of augmenting under-powered pay-for-performance

incentives. The future commitments to handling the bonds and dismissal decisions fairly

are presumably enforced by the organization’s desire to maintain its reputation as a

reliable counterparty for these sorts of agreements.


                                                                                               25
       Another possibility for augmenting under-powered incentives is to reduce the cost

to the physician of providing effort. In the case of ACOs, the most important determinant

of the cost of effort is likely the opportunity cost of the physician’s time. A doctor, for

example, who spends more of the day in meetings devoted to making care processes

more cost-efficient loses the opportunity to see more fee-for-service commercial patients.

For physicians who are employees, an obvious way to reduce this opportunity cost of

effort is via job design. The employer can simply mandate that the physician has to

spend certain hours on process improvements and cannot see patients during that time.

This is an illustration of a more general point made by Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991).

In employment relationships, incentive pay and job design are powerful and

complementary motivational instruments. By narrowing the scope of work, employers

can greatly reduce the opportunity cost of effort and so achieve high levels of

coordination and motivation with low powered incentives (Roberts, 2004).

       To capture this idea formally in the model, suppose the principal can set the scope

of a provider’s job, denoted by 𝛿 ∈ (0,1]. Setting 𝛿 to be very small corresponds to a

narrow job scope and therefore a small opportunity cost of time. Setting 𝛿 = 1 gives

complete latitude to the provider and therefore corresponds to a high opportunity cost of

time devoted to, say, process improvements. Introducing the job design parameter, the

provider’s utility function under the ACO incentive scheme becomes




                                                                                              26

This utility function is the same as before except the quadratic effort cost term is

multiplied by 𝛿, capturing the notion that job design can reduce the opportunity cost of

providing effort.

       <<COMP: Place Fig. 4 about here>>

       We can use this adapted model and the calibrated parameters to see how adjusting

the opportunity cost of effort through job design ameliorates the ACO incentive problem.

Figure 4 plots the required level of cost sharing for a physician team of size 𝑁 = 20 for

values of 𝛿, the opportunity cost of effort parameter, ranging from zero to one. As before,

the simulation assumes a cost savings target equal to 20 percent of the first-best savings

while maintaining quality at the status quo. The figure shows that for values of 𝛿 near

one, physicians would have to receive over 400 percent of the generated savings in order

for incentives to be properly aligned. This result was also evident in Figure 1 which

implicitly set 𝛿 = 1. For smaller levels of the opportunity cost of effort, however, the

required shared savings fraction is smaller, and falls below one when 𝛿 is less than 25

percent or so.


                                                                                           27
       These calculations are, of course, purely illustrative. They demonstrate how

reducing the opportunity cost of effort through job design can allow ACOs to succeed

with lower-powered, self-financing incentives or, if that is infeasible, with smaller

performance bonds. To the extent that performance bonds become more difficult to

implement as they grow in size, this example also illustrates the complementary nature of

the entire bundle of motivators available to employers in conventional employment

relationships. Job design makes performance bonds more workable which in turn

enhances the effectiveness of under-powered pay for performance systems.

       Performance bonds and job design are, of course, not the only complementary

motivational instruments that ACOs can employ to augment their under-powered group

incentives. Another possibility, often described in the management literature as high-

performance human resource systems, combines job design with training, screening, and

socialization to motivate employees working under low-powered incentives (Holmstrom

and Milgrom, 1991; Roberts, 2004). Related motivational mechanisms discussed in the

personnel economics literature include peer pressure and mutual monitoring (Kandel and

Lazear, 1992; Encinosa, Gaynor, et al., 2007). These complementary motivational

strategies all have an important element of relationship-specific investments and so it is

natural to think of these investments as the foundation of a relational contract whose

credibility is enforced by the continuing value of the relationship between parties, i.e. by

the “shadow of the future” (Gibbons and Henderson, 2011). In addition there is a

growing body of theoretical argument and empirical research that highlights powerful




                                                                                             28
psychological motivators and the sometimes problematic interaction of intrinsic motives

and financial rewards (Rebitzer and Taylor, 2010; Bowles and Polania-Reyes, 2010).

       It would not be difficult to expand our model to include each of the

complementary motivational strategies we have sketched out in the preceding paragraph.

Doing so, however, would greatly complicate the analysis while obscuring the point we

make in our analysis of performance bonds and job design: that it is theoretically possible

for successful ACOs to implement complementary motivational strategies that are

sufficient to resolve the free-riding issues that plague principal-agent relationships in

large groups.

                                        Conclusions

       ACOs are a new model for integrated health care delivery created by the Obama

Administration’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ACOs are designed to

promote the benefits of integrated care by enabling groups of hospitals and providers to

jointly contract to provide care to a population of enrollees in an environment that

rewards cost-efficiency through shared savings and pay-for-performance incentives. By

aggregating the experience of many enrollees, ACOs improve the signal to noise ratio in

performance measures. For this reason, ACOs are required to have at least 5,000

enrollees. Achieving this scale, however, requires combining physicians and as the

numbers of physicians grow so does the free-riding problem. Working with a model of

ACO incentives, we establish that the negative effects of free-riding swamp the positive

effects of increased precision.




                                                                                            29
       We also calibrate our model using proprietary performance measures from a very

large insurer. Our estimates suggest that even minimally sized ACOs with modest cost

reduction targets will generally not be self-financing unless extremely large economies of

scale or productivity improvements accompany ACOs. As a result, successful ACOs will

have to find ways to operate with under-powered pay-for-performance incentives

augmented by alternative motivational strategies. Some of these complementary

strategies are best implemented in conventional integrated organizations, while others

may prove workable in hybrid organizational forms that more are more congruent with

practice patterns in regions where care delivery is currently highly fragmented.

       Our analysis has a number of limitations. First, the key parameters of the model

are estimated from a population of chronically ill commercial insurance patients and the

measures we use are not the same that CMS might use in tracking care quality for its

population of Medicare patients who are primarily over age 65. In considering this

limitation, it should be noted, however, that one of the goals of the ACO program is to

promote the use of population based pay for performance in commercial populations as

well. Secondly, our formal model is not a detailed depiction of each facet of the ACO

payment system. Rather, it is a stylized representation of the essential features of the

system: cost benchmarks and bonuses linked to noisy cost and quality measures averaged

over groups of physicians. Finally, our calibration of the model is based on a number of

simplifying, but restrictive functional form assumptions – most notably that physicians

are risk neutral in responding to the group incentive.




                                                                                           30
       While none of these limitations is likely to overturn our qualitative conclusions,

they do suggest that our analysis is not likely to provide a precise quantitative prediction

of behavior in actual ACOs. Rather, the contribution of our model and its calibration is

that it helps analysts think systematically about the key determinants of incentive

intensity and their likely effects. If, for example, CMS used much more precise quality

metrics than the commercial health insurer, ACOs would operate with lower powered

incentives. If physicians were highly risk averse with respect to their ACO payments,

optimal incentive intensity would similarly decline, but the cost of compensating

providers to participate in ACOs would also increase.

       From the perspective of health care policy, our analysis has two important

implications. The first is a novel interpretation of prior pay-for-performance experiments

that find small but highly variable results. The most recent of these is Carrie H. Colla et

al. (2012) which describes a demonstration project for large physician groups.

Comparing our calibration with the incentive payouts used in the actual experiment

suggests that the incentives in these experiments were far too low to overcome free-riding

problems. The great variability in outcomes across sites might, therefore, have to do with

the ability of different organizations to employ alternative “motivators” that complement

low-stakes incentives.

       The second implication of our work for health policy is that ACOs will have

difficulty writing workable incentive contacts in the sort of loose, open networks

envisioned in the legislation. To the extent that relatively small commercial payers will

require larger groupings of physicians to achieve target panel sizes, they will likely have



                                                                                            31
an even harder time using pay-for-performance contracts to induce cost-conscious,

quality-preserving practices among their physician networks.

       From the perspective of transaction cost economics, our main conclusion is that

free-riding in large groups creates serious incentive problems but that it is also possible

for ACOs to implement complementary motivational strategies that mitigate these

problems. Conventional organizations routinely use these complementary strategies to

solve team production and incentive problems and variations in the effectiveness of these

complementary strategies are likely to be an important determinant of the costs of

transacting within an organization. What is not conventional or routine about ACOs is the

fragmented state of the US health care system. In much of the US, it is hard to imagine

the large-scale migration of independent practice physicians into truly integrated

organizations. In this context, a large fraction of ACOs will have to begin their existence

by working with providers operating within hybrid organizations that sit somewhere on a

continuum between true integration and a collective of small independent practices.

       Understanding which augmenting motivational strategies are most effective at

different points on this continuum is therefore critical for understanding the potential of

ACOs as a policy for improving the efficiency of the US health care system. If hybrid

organizations can find ways to implement complementary motivational strategies as

effectively as conventional organizations, ACOs might be a very effective tool for

improving efficiency. If not, then gains from ACOs may be limited to regions where care

is “mostly integrated” already.

 conditions hold, and emerges from the simple mathematics of threshold incentives, and

 is true whenever the first order conditions are satisfied. 16 The intuition for the second

 condition is that the monetary reward to quality effort is proportional to the cost-savings

 effort, so the target cost savings effort must be sufficiently high to induce quality effort.

 This condition constitutes a restriction on the set of cost- and quality-efforts the principal

 will be able to induce, but is not binding in the natural setting we consider in which the

 principal wishes to cut costs while maintaining quality.

         Continuing,
16
     To see the intuition, consider that the expected return to marginal effort varies with the threshold
performance level. If 𝑥̅ far exceeds current effort levels, the expected benefit of additional exertion is close
to 0 – only a very rare draw would enable the agent to clear the threshold. The expected marginal benefit
of effort increases as 𝑒̂ approaches 𝑥̅ and at 𝑥̅ = 𝑒̂ the expected marginal benefit of additional effort is at its
maximum and diminishes thereafter. Thus if the agent will choose to exert any effort, she will exert at least
𝑥̅ .

Figure 1: Optimal Sharing by Team Size




This Figure plots the cost sharing parameter, b, required to achieve a target level of cost savings by group
size, N. The target level of savings are 20% of the savings achievable under first-best incentives. The
calibration takes as given the number of doctors in the group, N, the size of their panel of Medicare
enrollees (260), and our estimate of the standard deviation of the noise component of the performance
measure; 𝜎𝑞 = 0.0741. Details in text.
Figure 2: Maximum Self-funding Team Size by Target Cost Savings




This Figure plots the maximum team size (on the vertical axis) that is consistent with self-financing
incentives by target cost savings (the horizontal axis). The target level of cost savings are expressed as a
percent of the savings achievable under first-best incentives. Savings are only paid out if a quality threshold
is cleared. The calibration takes as given the size of each physician’s panel of Medicare enrollees (260), the
quality threshold, and our estimate of the standard deviation of the noise component of the performance
measure; 𝜎𝑞 = 0.0741. Details in text.
Figure 3: Required Team Production Multiplier by Team Size




This Figure plots the efficiency “multiplier” that would have to be achieved in order for team incentives to
be self-financing, as a function of the team size, 𝑁. The target level of cost savings is set at 20 percent of
the first-best level of savings, and the quality target is set at zero (status quo). Positive savings are only paid
out if the quality threshold is cleared, but negative savings (losses) are shared regardless. The calibration
takes as given the size of each physician’s panel of Medicare enrollees (260), the quality threshold, and our
estimate of the standard deviation of the noise component of the performance measure; 𝜎𝑞 = 0.0741.
Details in text.
Figure 4: Optimal Sharing by Opportunity Cost of Effort




This Figure plots the sharing parameter, b, required to achieve a target level of cost savings for a team size
of 𝑁 = 20, by the opportunity cost of effort parameter, 𝛿. The target level of savings are 20% of the
savings achievable under first-best incentives. The calibration takes as given the number of doctors in the
group, N, the size of their panel of Medicare enrollees (260), and our estimate of the standard deviation of
the noise component of the performance measure; 𝜎𝑞 = 0.0741. Details in text.
