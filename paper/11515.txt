There is convincing evidence that the Internet has lowered the prices paid by some consumers in

established industries, for example, term life insurance and car retailing. However, current research

does not reveal much about how using the Internet lowers prices. This paper answers this question

for the auto retailing industry. We use direct measures of search behavior and consumer

characteristics to investigate how the Internet affects negotiated prices. We show that the Internet

lowers prices for two distinct reasons. First, the Internet helps consumers learn the invoice price of

dealers. Second, the referral process of online buying services, a novel institution made possible by

the Internet, also helps consumers obtain lower prices. The combined information and referral price

effects are -1.5%, corresponding to 22% of dealers' average gross profit margin per vehicle. We also

find that buyers with a high disutility of bargaining benefit from information on the specific car they

eventually purchased while buyers who like the bargaining process do not. The results suggest that

the decisions consumers make to use the Internet to gather information and to use the negotiating

clout of an online buying service have a real effect on the prices paid by these consumers.

1    Introduction

There is convincing evidence that the Internet has lowered the prices paid by some consumers

in established industries. In car retailing, for example, Zettelmeyer, Scott Morton, and Silva-

Risso (2004) show that new vehicle buyers who use the Internet pay 2.2% less for their car

than those who do not, a savings of $500 on the average car. In the insurance industry Brown

and Goolsbee (2002) show that the growth of the Internet has reduced the price of term life

insurance by 8-15%.

    While these results are convincing that using the Internet lowers prices, they do not reveal

much about how using the Internet lowers prices. In particular, there are a number of things

a buyer can do with the Internet, including researching product characteristics, making price

comparisons, communicating with sellers, obtaining recommendations from peers, and so on.

Additionally, in some markets, the Internet has made new institutions possible, such as online

buying services, that change price negotiations. We would like to better understand what

aspects of Internet use matter most for the prices paid by consumers.

    We will address this question in the context of price negotiations for new vehicles; we

use direct measures of search behavior and consumer characteristics to investigate how the

Internet affects negotiated prices in car retailing. We match transaction data on 1,500 car

purchases in California with the responses to a survey which asks buyers detailed questions

about their Internet usage, their attitudes towards information search and bargaining, and

their demographics.

    We have two specific goals in this paper. The first goal is to investigate why the Internet

lowers the prices paid by consumers who use it. We consider two basic reasons. First, the

Internet could be lowering prices by decreasing search cost and thereby making more purchase

relevant information available to consumers who use the Internet. Information can be relevant in

various ways. For example, information about invoice prices allow consumers to better estimate



                                               2
the dealer’s reservation price, an important piece of information in negotiations. Lower search

cost may also benefit consumers in their search for low-price dealerships. Because car prices are

negotiated and rarely posted, the Internet is unlikely to help consumer find price information

from competing dealerships without engaging in direct negotiation. However, the Internet may

help consumers find low-price dealerships because it facilitates an information exchange with

other consumers about the prices they paid at various dealerships. Also, consumers may make

price inferences from dealer websites. To some degree the Internet may be a substitute for

visiting multiple dealers.

   The second reason we consider is that the Internet could be lowering prices for some con-

sumers by consolidating their buyer power through online buying services; these institutions

have become widely accessible as a result of the Internet. There is evidence that groups of

buyers should expect to pay lower prices than individual buyers (Snyder 1998). We therefore

expect that consumers who use online buying services will pay lower prices.

   The second goal of this paper is to determine whether there is an interaction between

customer characteristics (such as the disutility of bargaining) and the payoffs from using the

Internet. We are interested in this question because there is evidence that consumers who

are disadvantaged in the bargaining process are more likely to use the Internet (Zettelmeyer,

Scott Morton, and Silva-Risso 2004). The standard economic argument suggests that a con-

sumer’s propensity to engage in a given behavior should be positively related to their benefit

from doing so. In the present context we therefore expect that consumers with characteristics

which disadvantage them in price negotiations will benefit more from using the Internet. For

example, consumers who dislike the face-to-face bargaining process might benefit more from

getting information from the Internet than consumers who don’t mind bargaining.


   We show that the Internet lowers prices for two distinct reasons. First, the Internet informs

consumers. The information that seems to be most valuable to consumers is the invoice price of

the dealer; it enables them to negotiate a low price at a given dealership. Internet information

                                               3
seems not to help consumers find low-price dealerships. In particular, the Internet does not

substitute for searching at multiple dealers. Second, the referral process of online buying

services, a novel institution made possible by the Internet, helps consumers obtain lower prices.

We believe that online buying services are effective because, unlike manufacturers, they can

exert pressure on dealers by directing incremental business to affiliated dealerships—and away

from unaffiliated dealerships.

   Our results show combined information and referral price effects of -1.5%. This corresponds

to 22% of dealers’ average gross profit margin per vehicle. We want to highlight two important

points concerning these results. First, we account for potential selection effects in search and

purchasing behavior by directly controlling for individual buyer characteristics such disutility of

bargaining, willingness to search, and car knowledge. While these controls cannot fully rule out

selection bias, they increase our confidence that the price effects are not an artifact of differences

in unobserved characteristics between people who choose to use the Internet and those who do

not. Second, the estimates are close to the estimates of -2.2% in Zettelmeyer, Scott Morton,

and Silva-Risso (2004), using a different data source, a different estimation method, and a

different time period.

   We also find that the benefits of gathering information differs by consumer type. While

buyers with a high disutility of bargaining pay 1.5% less when they have collected information

on the specific car they eventually purchase than they otherwise would have, buyers who like

the bargaining process do not benefit from such information. This stands in contrast to the

benefits of requesting a referral from an online buying service, which is equal for the two types

of buyers (-0.7%). We have argued above that a referral from an online buying service lowers

prices at a dealer because of the implicit threat an online buying service can make to redirect

customers to the dealer’s competitors if the referral service’s customers are not offered good

prices. Consistent with our findings, if this threat operates, it seems reasonable that it should

apply uniformly across consumers.


                                                  4
   Our paper is related to prior work analyzing how consumers search for car information.

Ratchford and Srinivasan (1993) use survey data on search and choice behavior from a local

automobile market to estimate returns to search time. Moorthy, Ratchford, and Talukdar

(1997) present a model of total search effort with an emphasis on how prior brand perception

affects the search process. Ratchford, Talukdar, and Lee (2003) analyze how the Internet has

changed consumer search behavior for automobiles by comparing data from 1989 and 1999.

Furse, Punj, and Stewart (1984) use a survey to identify clusters of consumers with different

search patterns and find that a sizable segment of consumers search very little. Klein and

Ford (2001) replicate this approach for a sample of Internet users. These papers have been

very useful in informing our survey design. This paper represents a substantial extension of

these previous papers on Internet search for automobiles because it combines survey data with

detailed transaction data on purchase outcomes.

   This paper is also related to Scott Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso (2001) and Zettelmeyer,

Scott Morton, and Silva-Risso (2004). These papers are based on a large dataset of transac-

tion prices for new cars which is then combined with information on Internet usage from a

large online buying service (Autobytel.com). The first paper provides an overview of Internet

car retailing. The second paper controls for selection and shows that using Autobytel.com

reduces price by approximately 2.2%. Neither paper addresses the research questions in the

present paper. This is because the data used in these papers only contains a single search-

or Internet-related explanatory variable, which is whether a consumer used the online buying

service Autobytel.com. This service both informs consumers and allows them to submit an

online referral. Without other explanatory variables measuring, for example, the extent to

which consumers were informed from other sources, these papers cannot determine the effects

of different search and purchasing activities. For the same reason these paper cannot disentan-

gle whether consumers save from using the Internet because they become better informed, or

because online buying services change the way price negotiations are conducted.


                                              5
    Scott Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso (2004) use the same dataset here to test predic-

tions from bargaining theory about how private information, patience, and bargaining disutility

affect the division of surplus between negotiating parties. That paper has no measures of In-

ternet use and does not consider the role of the Internet for car negotiations.

    We proceed as follows. Section 2 describes the survey and transaction data. Section 3

analyzes the different ways in which the Internet lowers prices. Section 4 concludes the paper.



2     Data

Our data come from two sources. The first source is a survey instrument which we mailed to

5250 consumers who purchased one of eight popular new car models in California during April

and May 2002. We match the individual survey data to transaction data from a data supplier

in the automotive industry (henceforth DSA).


2.1   Survey data

Survey instrument: The survey asked questions about (1) the number of dealers a buyer

visited, (2) the buyer’s negotiation strategy, (3) the offline and online sources of information the

buyer used, (4) the information the buyer learned at each of these information sources, (5) the

referrals the buyer requested, (6) demographics, and (7) personal attitudes towards bargaining

and information search. A copy of the survey can be found in the appendix.

Sample: We chose our sample by car type and then mailed the survey to every buyer of

the selected car types for whom we had transaction data in April and May 2002. The first

objective in selecting car types was to include a variety of car categories (e.g. midsize sedan,

luxury sedan, pickup, SUV, etc.). The second objective in selecting car types was to keep the

number of different cars small in order to be able to control for car fixed effects without losing

too many degrees of freedom. We defined a “car” as the interaction of make, model, body


                                                 6
type, transmission, displacement, doors, cylinders, and trim level (for example, one “car” is a

2002 Honda Accord sedan with automatic transmission, a 2.2 liter engine, 4 doors, 4 cylinders,

and the EX trim). We added the purchases of the most common “cars” for a variety of car

categories until we reached our desired sample size. This yielded the most popular variants of

Honda Accord, Chrysler PT Cruiser, Nissan Altima, Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota Corolla, Jeep

Grand Cherokee, Honda Odyssey, and Chevrolet Tahoe.

Procedure: Each potential respondent received three mailings. The first mailing contained

a letter announcing the arrival of the survey, introducing ourselves as the researchers and

explaining the purpose of the project. The second mailing was sent out 5 days later and

contained a cover letter, the survey, a pre-stamped return envelope, and a $1 bill. The third

mailing was sent out 5 days after the second mailing and consisted of a postcard thanking

buyers for their participation and reminding them to return the survey.

   The survey design, including the cover letter, multiple mailings, and token thanks of the

enclosed dollar bill, appeared to be very effective at encouraging response. Of the 5250 we sent,

2470 were returned completed or partially completed, for a response rate of 47%.

Response issues: In cases in which the answer to a question was missing but could be easily

inferred from a followup question we filled in the answer. For example, if a buyer did not answer

whether she had used the Internet but proceeded to detail the types of sites she had visited

we filled in that she had used the Internet. We also corrected two inconsistencies in the way

surveys were filled out. The first correction concerns a question about the respondent having

collected information about the car he or she eventually purchased. We corrected answers for

which there were two ways to determine that the answer was erroneous. For example, if a

person indicated he had researched zero cars and also spent zero hours doing research online

and zero offline, then we did not allow him to be have “collected information about the car

he/she eventually purchased.” The second correction concerns the question of whether the

respondent had in any way used the Internet in conjunction with buying a car. For example,

                                               7
some buyers checked off that they did not use the Internet to search for a car but then continued

to indicate which websites they had visited for research. In this case we changed the answer

on the internet use question to “yes.”1

       In survey based research it is normally difficult to assess how respondents and non-respondents

differ along relevant dimensions. In our case this assessment is easier: since we have transaction

data for respondents and non-respondents alike, we can compare these two groups along any

variable we observe in the transaction data. First, we can compare the census-based demo-

graphic information associated with the census block groups in which buyers reside. Assuming

that these census based measures are representative of individual buyers’ demographics, non-

respondents are significantly (at the 5% level) less likely to be college graduates (27% vs.

31%), more likely to be high school drop-outs (18% vs. 13.5%), more likely to be Hispanic or

black (20% and 5% vs. 16% and 4%, respectively), have lower household incomes ($55,000 vs.

$59,000), and own less valuable houses ($214,000 vs. $228,000). There is no statistically signif-

icant difference between the two groups in the percentage of buyers who are identified as female

on the basis of their first name. Second, we can compare how respondents and non-respondents

differ with regards to behavioral measures contained in the transaction data. With regards

to price—the dependent variable used in this study—there is no significant difference between

respondents and non-respondents at the 5% level. Neither do we find a statistically significant

difference in the dealer profitability of purchases by respondents and by non-respondents.

       We are not concerned about the demographic differences between respondents and non-

respondents. This is for two reasons. First, the differences do not seem large enough for

respondents and non-respondents to differ significantly with respect to our dependent variable

(or other transaction-based behavioral measures). Second, in our previous research we have

   1
     Our conclusions are unaffected by these corrections. To test for robustness, we repeated all specifications
in the paper with a dataset from which we dropped the inconsistent 71 survey responses. We also repeated
all specifications with a dataset which was left completely unaltered. While the magnitude of coefficients vary
slightly between datasets, our substantive findings are unchanged.




                                                       8
found that it is the poorest, least educated buyers who pay most for a car, ceteris paribus.

These are precisely the buyers who were least likely to respond to our survey (although the

difference in prices paid by these buyers compared to respondents is not large enough to be

statistically significant). Thus, since our results rely on between-consumer differences in prices

paid due to differences in search and purchase behavior, price differences are likely to be smaller

within respondents than within the general population. Consequently, our results are likely to

be a conservative lower bound of the true benefits of searching and using the Internet.

Basic survey findings: Seventy-two percent of respondents reported that they used the In-

ternet in some way to help them shop for a new vehicle. The most frequently visited site by

buyers who reported using the Internet were manufacturer websites (70%). Internet consumers

also frequently visited informational websites such as consumerreports.com or kbb.com (63%),

followed by online buying services such as Autobytel.com or Carsdirect.com (56%) and indi-

vidual dealer websites (31%). Only 6% of buyers who used the Internet collected information

via chat rooms or bulletin boards. 78% of buyers who had used the Internet responded that

they had explicitly mentioned that fact to the dealer.

   Internet users report having collected information on more car types than buyers who did

not use the Internet. The median buyer who used the Internet collected information for 2-3

cars whereas the median offline buyer only collected information for 1 car. Most strikingly, only

52% of buyers who did not use the Internet said that they had collected information (from any

source) specifically on the vehicle they ended up buying. This contrasts with 95% for buyers

who used the Internet. Across both groups the average is 82%.


2.2   Transaction data

DSA collects transaction data from a sample of dealers in the major metropolitan areas in the

US. These data include some customer information, the make, model and trim level of the car,

financing information, trade-in information, dealer-added extras, and the profitability of the


                                                9
transaction to the dealership.

       The price observed in the dataset is the price that the customer pays for the vehicle including

factory installed accessories and options and the dealer-installed accessories contracted for at

the time of sale that contribute to the resale value of the car.2 The Price variable we use as

the dependent variable is this price, minus the ManufacturerRebate, if any, given directly to the

consumer, and minus what is known as the TradeInOverAllowance. TradeInOverAllowance is

the difference between the trade-in price paid by the dealer to the consumer and the wholesale

value of the specific trade-in vehicle (as estimated by the dealer). We adjust for this amount

to account for the possibility, for example, that a dealer may offer a consumer a low price for

the new car because the dealer is profiting from the trade-in.

       We control for car fixed effects according to the definition of a “car” above. While our car

fixed effects will control for many of the factors that contribute to the price of a car, it will not

control for the factory- and dealer-installed options which vary within trim level. The price we

observe covers such options but we do not observe what options the car actually has. In order

to control for price differences attributable to options, we include as an explanatory variable

the percent deviation of the dealer’s cost of purchasing the vehicle from the average vehicle cost

of that car in the dataset. This percent deviation, called VehicleCost will be positive when the

car has an unobserved option (for example a CD player) and is therefore relatively expensive

compared to other examples of the same car. Our measure of price also takes into account any

variation in holdback and transportation charges.

       To control for time variation in prices, we define a dummy EndOfMonth that equals 1 if the

car was sold within the last 5 days of the month. This dummy accounts for the fact that sales

people get bonuses when they fulfill monthly sales quotas, changing their incentive to hold out

for a high price. A dummy variable WeekEnd specifies whether the car was purchased on a

   2
    Dealer-installed accessories that contribute to the resale value include items such as upgraded tires or a
sound system, but would exclude options such as undercoating or waxing.

Saturday or Sunday to control for whether consumers who buy cars on weekends are different

from other consumers in ways that are otherwise unobserved. In addition, we include a dummy

for the second month in our 2-month sample period to control for other seasonal effects.

    We control for the competitiveness of each dealer’s market. For each dealership we count

the number of dealerships with the same nameplate that fall in a zip code that is within a

10 mile radius of the zip code of the focal dealership. We take into account cases where one

owner owns several franchises in close proximity so that our measure counts only the number

of separately-controlled entities.

    We also supplement the demographic information from the survey with census data that

DSA matches with the buyer’s address from the transaction record. The data is on the level of

a “block group,” which makes up about one fourth of the area and population of a census tract.

On average, block groups have about 1100 people in them. Finally, we control for whether the

car was sold in Northern or Southern California.

    Combining the two datasets results in 1,436 observations. This is smaller than the number

of returned surveys because of missing information in the transaction dataset and some only

partially completed surveys.



3    Results

We now proceed to using the direct measures of search behavior and consumer characteristics

to investigate how the Internet lowers negotiated prices in car retailing. Our dependent variable

is Price as defined in the data section. In order to provide the appropriate baseline for the

price of the car, we use a standard hedonic regression of log price. We work in logs because

the price effect of many of the attributes of the car, such as being sold in Northern California

or in May, are likely to be better modeled as a percentage of the car’s value than a fixed dollar

increment. We estimate the following specification:



                                               11
                                   ln (Pricei ) = Xi α + Di β + Si γ + i


       The X matrix is composed of transaction and car variables: car, month, and region fixed

effects, car costs, and controls for whether the car was purchased at the end of month or

the weekend, and whether the buyer traded in a vehicle. The D matrix contains demographic

characteristics of the buyer and her census block group (see Table 1 in the appendix for summary

statistics). We use demographic information on gender, age, education, income, and race from

the survey. We use information on house ownership, median house value, and type of occupation

in the census block group in which the buyer resides. We control for these demographic variables

because we know from Scott Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso (2003) that they are related

to negotiated car prices. In addition, these variables are also correlated with the search and

purchasing behavior we intend to analyze in this paper; their inclusion is thus critical to avoid

bias in the coefficients of interest.3 To this basic specification we add a matrix S which contains

survey responses that indicate the search behavior and Internet use of a buyer.

       We begin our investigation of the role of the Internet by including an indicator to the

specification which is one if a buyer answered “yes” to the question “Did you use the Internet

in any way to help you shop for a new vehicle? (e.g. to research vehicles, find a dealer, etc.).”

We refer to this indicator as InternetUse (see column 1 in Table 2). We find that buyers who

reported having used the Internet in any way to help them shop for a new vehicle pay on

average 1.16% less than other buyers (p-value < 0.001).

       While this describes the average difference in the prices paid by Internet users and non-

users, respectively, this average likely does not measure the expected return to a customer of

   3
    For example, education is good predictor of Internet usage. Only 37% of buyers who reported not to have
a high school degree used the Internet. This is in contrast to 81% of buyers with a college degree or higher.
Also, 87% percent of buyers with income above $150,000 but only 47% of buyers with income between $20,000
and $29,999 reported using the Internet for car buying. We will not discuss the estimated coefficients on the
demographics in this paper because they are not the focus of the study. The interested reader is referred to
Scott Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso (2003) for a detailed analysis of the effects of demographics on the
price of a new car. For another approach on the effect of demographics on bargaining outcomes see Chen, Yang,
and Zhao (2003).

deciding to use the Internet. The reason is that the average effect on price likely includes effects

caused by unobserved customer traits (such as being a “smart shopper”) which happen to be

correlated with using the Internet.

Is the Internet effect driven by unobserved differences between online and offline

consumers?

In order to estimate the “treatment effect” of using the Internet, in this section we run the same

specification as above, but this time we control for consumer types. We are able to (imperfectly)

measure normally “unobserved” consumer types by asking our consumers particular questions

on the survey. While controlling for these measures cannot rule out that some of the Internet

effect remains driven by unobserved differences between consumers, we measure consumers

characteristics which we ex-ante believe best predict consumers’ underlying propensity to search

for purchase-relevant information and to use the Internet.4

    We ask consumers to rate their agreement or disagreement with a list of statements to

get a measure of three consumer traits.5 These traits are (1) whether a consumer has a

high willingness to search, (2) whether a consumer is a car enthusiast, and (3) whether a

consumer has a high disutility of bargaining. To get answers that are reliable and as comparable

as possible across respondents we ask survey participants questions about their behavior or

attitudes, not about the traits directly. For example, we are interested in the “car enthusiast”

trait to control for whether a consumer knows a lot about cars, even if they did little or no

search for their car purchase. We could have asked a survey participant to agree or disagree

with the statement “I am a car enthusiast,” thereby leaving it up the respondent to decide

what a car enthusiast is. Instead, we get more consistent answers by asking “I read car- and/or

   4
     At then end of section 4 we show that these consumer characteristics are indeed correlated with Internet use.
This is also true for some other independent variables of interest (not reported). Since our measures of consumer
characteristics are also related to the prices paid by consumers, this shows the importance of controlling for
these characteristics in subsequent specifications in order to avoid biased estimates.
   5
     These measures were chosen based on our prior research findings, and discussions with car and internet
industry experts.

truck-enthusiast magazines regularly” and “I tend to visit dealers whenever a new model is

introduced.”6 Similarly, we get at consumers’ willingness to search with statements such as

“I do a lot of price comparison when making large purchases,” “I am the kind of person who

gathers as much information as possible before visiting car dealers,” and “I frequently use the

Internet to obtain information about products I am interested in.” Finally, to assess whether

a consumer derives a high disutility from the bargaining process we present consumers with

the statements “I am afraid that I will be taken advantage of by a dealer when negotiating the

price of a new car,” and “It is hard for me to find time to shop for a new vehicle.” We assume

that consumers who feel very vulnerable will dislike bargaining more than consumers who do

not feel vulnerable. The response to the second statement measures the consumer’s assessment

of her opportunity cost of being engaged in a bargaining interaction.7

    To investigate how our survey questions map into the three consumer traits they are in-

tended to measure we employ a factor analysis. Three factors have eigenvalues above 1 and

their interpretation corresponds exactly to our three consumer traits. The first factor—with

high factor loadings on the three “willingness to search” questions8 —has an eigenvalue of 1.99

and explains 28% of the variation in the seven items. The second factor—with high factor

loadings on the two “car enthusiast” questions—has an eigenvalue of 1.51 and explains 22% of

the variation in the seven items. The third factor—with high factor loadings on the two “bar-

   6
     Note that these questions may not entirely overcome our concerns associated with asking consumers questions
with vague terms. In particular, some of our questions involve an implicit norm that may differ between, for
example, Internet-based and other buyers. This is a limitation of our survey which we cannot overcome at this
time.
   7
     The consumer traits we construct are based in part on a consumer’s own assessment of his or her bargaining
ability. These assessments are made 6-12 weeks after the consumers purchased a car. If consumers infer their
bargaining ability from the price they obtained for this particular vehicle, there could be an endogeneity between
prices and consumer traits. If this is the case, too much of the price effect will be attributed to consumer traits
and too little to other factors, such as information search. While this endogeneity is of concern, since the primary
purpose of the consumer traits is to function as control variables, we believe such endogeneity biases the results
against our main findings.
   8
     The rotated factor loadings (varimax rotation) for the first factor are 0.82 for DoPriceComparisons, 0.72 for
InternetForInfo, and 0.85 for GatherMuchInfo. For the second factor, corresponding to“car enthusiast,” the fac-
tor loadings are 0.85 for ReadCarMagazine, and 0.84 for VisitDealerForFun. For the third factor, corresponding
to “bargaining disutility,” the factor loadings are 0.73 for AfraidTakenAdvantage, and 0.78 for NoTimeToShop.




                                                        14
gaining disutility” questions—has an eigenvalue of 1.09 and explains 16% of the variation in the

seven items. The reliability of the measures is as follows: Cronbach’s alpha for the three “will-

ingness to search” questions is 0.7; the correlation coefficient for the two two-question scales is

0.45 (p-value < 0.001) for “willingness to search” and 0.18 (p-value < 0.001) for “bargaining

disutility.”

    We begin with specifications which include the answers to the individual consumer trait

questions directly in the regression (later, in section 3.2 we will use the factors). We repeat the

specification in column 1 of Table 2, adding these measures of “unobserved” consumer traits.

The coefficient on InternetUse decreases from −1.16 to −0.98 (p-value 0.01, see column 2 in

Table 2). Consumer traits are related to price as follows: buyers who were more afraid of

being taken advantage of by the dealer pay more, suggesting that they had reason to be afraid.

Consumers who agree more with the statement “I do a lot of price comparison when making

large purchases” pay less (p-value 0.10). Other consumer trait variables are not significantly

different from zero. This reflects one consequence of our approach to include all consumer trait

variables in the regression. Since several of the questions are, by design, quite similar they may

be only jointly significant. Hence we test the hypothesis that the subset of variables which

measure each consumer trait are jointly zero. We reject the hypothesis that the variables mea-

suring consumers’ disutility of bargaining (AfraidTakenAdvantage, NoTimeToShop) are jointly

zero (p-value 0.001). We also reject the hypothesis that the variables measuring consumers’

willingness to search (DoPriceComparisons, InternetForInfo, GatherMuchInfo) are jointly zero

(p-value 0.05). We cannot reject the hypothesis that the variables measuring whether a con-

sumer is a car enthusiast (ReadCarMagazine, VisitDealerForFun) are zero (p-value 0.43).

    We conclude that the Internet effect is unlikely to result from differences between online

and offline consumers in their demographics, their bargaining disutility, their willingness to

search, or their knowledge about cars; buyers who have used the Internet pay approximately




                                                15
1% less, even after controlling for demographics and (normally unobserved) consumer traits.9

This corresponds to 15% of dealers’ average gross profit margin per vehicle.

Does Internet use serve as a signal to dealers?

While we have shown above that the Internet effect seems not to be the result of measurable

differences between online and offline consumers, it could still be that the Internet discount

results from the perception of dealers that Internet consumers are different. We can analyze

this question because we asked consumers whether they had mentioned to the dealer that they

used the Internet to do research. If the Internet saves consumers money because dealers assume

that consumers who used the Internet are different from “regular” consumers, we should find

that the Internet effect should differ between consumers who told the dealer they had used the

Internet and consumers who did not.10 No consumer in our sample reported telling the dealer

that they had used the Internet when, in fact, they had not. We repeat the specification in

column 2 of Table 2 an indicator variable ToldDealer which is one if a buyer who used the

Internet told that dealer that she used the Internet to do research (unreported). We cannot

reject the hypothesis that consumers who used the Internet and told the dealer that they had

done so paid on average the same price for a new car as consumers who did not tell the dealer

about their Internet use (the coefficient on ToldDealer is 0.14, p-value 0.70).

       Based on the results of this and the previous discussion we conclude that, based on the

survey measures at our disposal, the Internet effect is unlikely to result from actual or dealer-

perceived differences between online and offline consumers. We are now interested in determin-

ing the mechanism by which the Internet lowers the prices paid by consumers.

   9
      Another way to control for selection would be to instrument for Internet use. Regrettably, it is very difficult
to find instruments that are correlated with Internet use and uncorrelated with the prices consumers pay for
cars. This is because prices are individually negotiated and thus a function of consumer characteristics which are
also likely to predict Internet use. Hence, it is very difficult to argue that there are measures that could be used
to predict Internet use in the first-step selection equation, but should be excluded from the price equation. This
is why we have chosen the alternative “selection on observables” approach by eliciting normally unobservable
consumer characteristics through a survey instrument.
   10
      This argument is not valid if dealers can tell whether a consumers used the Internet, irrespective of whether
consumers inform the dealer.



                                                         16
3.1   The role of the Internet

In the results so far, we have shown that Internet usage leads to prices that are lower by about

1% and that this is not, insofar as we can tell, because Internet users and non-users differ on

observable demographic characteristics or on individual traits which our survey allows us to

observe. The aim of this paper, however, goes beyond showing that Internet usage does indeed

have a “treatment effect.” Our aim is to “unpack” this treatment effect – to understand what

it is about what consumers are doing online that leads to lower prices. We first consider the

effect the Internet has on prices by aiding consumers in obtaining information.

Does the Internet lower prices by facilitate purchase-relevant information search?

Our aim in this subsection is to estimate how much of the effect of InternetUse on prices is

attributable to a consumer being better informed. To do so we make use of the fact that

in the survey we ask whether a consumer obtained information about the specific vehicle she

eventually purchased. This enables us to observe whether a consumer is informed independently

of whether she used the Internet. This is because Informed includes both consumers who

gathered information entirely offline, and consumers who used the Internet, but not to obtain

information about the specific car they purchased. By comparing the effect of Informed with

the effect of InternetUse we can get some sense of how much of the Internet usage effect on

price is due to being better informed.

   We begin with a specification in which – instead of InternetUse – we include the indicator

Informed for whether the buyer collected information specific to the vehicle that she ended

up purchasing (see column 3 of Table 2). We find that buyers who reported having collected

information for the type of car they eventually purchased pay on average 0.74% less than other

buyers (p-value 0.06). This is somewhat smaller than the coefficient of 0.98% for InternetUse.

In an unreported specification with both variables, Informed becomes insignificant (p-value

0.26) while the InternetUse coefficient changes to -0.81 (p-value 0.045). The similar effect of



                                              17
the two variables and a high and significant correlation coefficient of 0.5 suggests that becoming

better informed is an important part of the advantage of using the Internet.

How is Internet information helping buyers?

Having found that information is an important part of how the Internet helps consumers in

negotiating lower prices, we would like to know how the information is helping. In particular,

we consider two possible hypotheses. First, consumers could be benefitting from using the

Internet because doing so provides them with information that helps them better negotiate

with a dealer. Second, consumers could be benefitting from using the Internet because doing

so helps them find low-price dealers.

    We begin by investigating what kind of information matters most in price negotiations. We

asked respondents what information they researched on the Internet, including “which car to

purchase,” “which dealers to visit or buy from,” “dealer cost (invoice/hold-back),” or the “fair

price or market value.” We find that the only piece of information that affects transaction price

is the invoice price of the car. Consumers who have collected information about the invoice

price of the car they wish to buy pay on average 0.61% less than other buyers (p-value 0.04,

see column 4 in Table 2).11 Since the invoice price of a dealer is closely related to the dealer’s

reservation price for a specific vehicle, our result implies that, on average, consumers who have

better information about a dealer’s reservation price will do better in price negotiations than

consumers who are uninformed. This finding is consistent with predictions from the game-

theoretic literature on bargaining with incomplete information (see Chatterjee and Samuelson

(1983) for a static model, Fudenberg, Levine, and Tirole (1985) and Gul, Sonnenschein, and

Wilson (1986) for dynamic buyer-offer models, and Ausubel and Deneckere (1998) for a dy-

namic alternating-offer model which generate this prediction).12 Overall, consumers seem to

  11
     This result is not due to collinearity between the four information variables. We obtain the same result if we
run four separate specifications, each of which contains all controls but only one of the four information variables
at a time (not reported).
  12
     See Scott Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso (2004) for a more detailed literature review.



                                                        18
be benefitting from using the Internet because it provides them with information that helps

them better negotiate with a dealer.

   In contrast, we can find no evidence that consumers are benefitting from using the Internet

because doing so helps them find low-price dealers. For many non-car products, the Internet

makes it possible to compare prices offered by competing retailers either by checking multiple

sites or with a price comparison site such as MySimon.com. Since dealer franchise laws require

cars to be sold through dealerships and since almost all dealerships engage in price negotiation,

this kind of direct price comparison is not possible for cars. However, we can observe in our

data that some dealers do offer consistently lower prices than others. While it is possible that

consumers may be able to learn this information, for example, in an online discussion forum or

by inference from a dealer’s own website, we find no evidence in our data that this is occurring

to any significant degree.

   We can see this in several specifications. First, in column 4 in Table 2, a response indicating

that a consumers has collected information on “which dealers to visit or buy from” has no

statistically significant effect on the price. Another way of testing whether the Internet effect

is due to consumers finding low-price dealerships is to add dealer fixed effects to the core

specification in column 2 in Table 2. In this unreported regression, the estimated coefficient

on the InternetUse variable is identified by within-dealer variation in whether consumers are

informed or not. Since identification in this specification does not rely on differences in average

price levels between dealers, the results cannot be due to consumers searching for low-price

dealerships. The coefficient on InternetUse remains significant and negative at -0.81% (p-value

0.04).

   A third way of investigating whether the Internet is used to gather information that helps

consumers find low-price dealers is to test whether InternetUse substitutes for search among

dealers. We asked buyers how many other dealerships they visited. If we add the number of

visited dealers to the core specification in column 2 in Table 2, each increase in response scale


                                                19
category for the number of visited dealers decreases price by 0.34% (p-value 0.02, regression

unreported). Most importantly, the coefficient on InternetUse remains significant and changes

little (-0.85%, p-value 0.03). The fact that each variable appears to influence negotiated prices

when both are included in the regression suggests that dealer search and InternetUse are not

performing exactly the same role.

    The results in this subsection suggests that Internet information helps consumers by en-

abling them to negotiate a low price at a given dealership. However, Internet information seems

not to help car buyers find low-price dealerships.

    We now want to know whether the Internet serves any additional role in lowering prices

for consumers. We explore this question by distinguishing among the different ways in which

consumers can use the Internet. In particular, we distinguish between manufacturer websites,

individual dealer websites, online buying services, informational websites, and chat rooms. For

each type of online source we construct an indicator that is one if a buyer used that source of

information. Column 5 in Table 2 reports a specification that contains #DealersVisited, and

the indicators for how the Internet was used. We find that online buying services are the only

type of online site which is associated with lower price.13 The coefficient is -0.90 and highly

significant (p-value 0.001). This leads us to investigate the role of online buying services next.

How are online buying services helping buyers?

Online buying services and manufacturer websites differ from other online sources in that

they go beyond providing information to consumers. All online buying services and many

manufacturer websites allow consumers to request a quote from a dealer. The dealer typically

calls or e-mails the referred consumer within 24-48 hours with a price quote. A consumer can

ask for a price quote in a few seconds on a website, and receive it in his or her home the

next day. This raises the question of whether some of the savings from using the Internet

  13
     This result is not due to collinearity between the five variables describing how consumers use the Internet.
We obtain the same result if we run five separate specifications, each of which contains all controls but only one
of the five information variables at a time (not reported).


                                                       20
could be driven by a mechanism that is distinct from informing customers, namely the referral

process. To investigate the effect of utilizing the referral process, we add to the basic Internet

specification with #DealersVisited an indicator that is one if a consumers answered “yes” to the

question “Did you submit a formal request to any online buying service (e.g. Autobytel.com,

Carpoint.com, Autoweb.com) to be referred to one of the site’s affiliated dealers?” We also add

an indicator that is one if a consumers answered “yes” to the equivalent question for referrals

from manufacturer websites.

   We find that submitting a referral to an independent online buying service is associated

with 0.72% lower prices, in addition to the savings of 0.76% (p-value 0.05) associated with

using the Internet (see column 6 in Table 2). Manufacturer referrals, in contrast, have no effect

on price.

   This result is very important because it indicates that there is some important aspect of the

business model of independent referral sites that drives the difference. The major difference

between a referral from an online buying service and from a manufacturer is that the manufac-

turer refers consumers to the closest dealer selected from the entirety of its dealerships while

online buying services sign contracts with only a subset of dealers. For example, out of the

approximately 22,000 dealers in the US, Autobytel.com in the first quarter of 2001 contracted

with 5,000 dealerships. Online buying services assign dealers exclusive territories, and refer all

customers within that territory who submit a purchase referral for the dealer’s nameplate to

that dealer. Since only a subset of dealers are affiliated with a given online buying service, this

dealer’s exclusive territory will be larger than the territory in which it is the closest dealer of

that nameplate. This implies that referrals from an online buying service will more often be

incremental to the dealership’s regular customers than referrals from manufacturers. Manufac-

turers will refer to dealers only customers for whom the dealer is already the closest dealer of

that nameplate. Provided the incremental stream of customers generated by the online buying

service is valuable to the dealership, the dealership has an incentive to quote prices low enough


                                                21
to convert a substantial number of referrals into sales. This is because online buying services

monitor the percentage of referrals that result in a sale, and if the percentage is too low, the

dealer may be terminated and replaced by another dealer in that area. The implied threat is

not only that incremental sales get lost, but also that the replacement dealer will then “steal”

some of the dealership’s own consumers. Such a threat is not available to manufacturers.

   This argument bears resemblance to that of Klein and Murphy (1988) and Klein (1995) on

contractual provisions in franchising. Klein (1995) argues that three elements are necessary

for the loss of future rents to be a credible threat for a franchisee: (1) the contract between

the franchisor and franchisee must leave downstream rents for the franchisee, (2) the franchisor

must be allowed to monitor the performance of the franchisee, and (3) the franchisor must

be able to easily drop the franchisee. These condition are similar to what we observe for

the contracts between online buying services and their affiliated dealers: (1) Dealers are given

exclusive “online territories” which are substantially larger than their offline territories, thereby

creating incremental profits for dealers, (2) online buying services monitor the performance

of dealers with customer satisfaction surveys, and (3) online buying services can easily drop

dealerships from their roster. This interpretation of the role of exclusive territories is different

from the one hypothesized by Chen, Iyer, and Padmanabhan (2002). In their paper online

buying services grant exclusivity to dealers to avoid Bertrand-type competition among dealers.

In contrast, our argument and that of Klein (1995) suggests that exclusivity is granted in order

to ensure dealer performance, which in this context means offering lower prices to consumers.

In a sense, independent online buying services bargain with dealers on behalf of a large group

of consumers, although that group is not yet formed. With this interpretation our result is also

consistent with the theoretical predictions of Snyder (1998) who shows why groups of buyers

should expect to pay lower prices to a seller than individual buyers.

   In summary, buyers who use the Internet to shop for a car seem to be paying lower prices

for two distinct reasons. First, they become on average better informed than other buyers.


                                                 22
This information gives consumers better knowledge of of a dealer’s opportunity cost, which

tends to lower the transaction price the consumer pays. Second, buyers seem to be able to take

advantage of any pressure that online buying services exert on dealers through their ability to

direct customers among dealers. The total Internet effect is 1.5% of the purchase price, or 22%

of dealers’s average gross profit margin.14


3.2      Does the Internet benefit all consumers equally?

Next, we investigate whether the information and referral effects accrue to all buyers equally.

In particular we are interested in whether the Internet “levels the playing field” by improving

outcomes by more for individuals who would do worse without the Internet. In this paper,

we can examine this question because in our survey we ask explicitly about indicators that

an individual is at a bargaining disadvantage and we observe a range of car-purchase related

Internet activities.

       In the survey, we ask respondents to rate their agreement with the statements “I am afraid

that I will be taken advantage of by a dealer when negotiating the price of a new car” and

“It is hard for me to find time to shop for a car.” We believe there are a number of char-

acteristics that might lead an individual to strongly agree with the first statement, including

aversion to conflict, dislike of stressful situations, or anxiety in high-pressure environments.

Instead of trying to assess these elements independently, we ask for a summary assessment that

describes the consumer’s level of apprehension about the bargaining process. In addition, we

also ask whether individuals have a time constraint that would make participation in extended

negotiations costly for them. We expect that both aspects will make the bargaining process

unattractive and lead to less desirable outcomes for consumers.

  14
     We provide one additional piece of evidence to show that the “Internet effect” can be broken into a referral
and an informational component. In a regression that controls for the referral effect, the variable InternetUse and
the variable Informed are almost interchangeable (see column 6 and 7 in Table 2). The InternetUse coefficient
is estimated at -0.76 in the first column (p-value 0.05). The second specification no longer includes InternetUse
but yields a coefficient estimate of -0.67 for Informed (p-value 0.09). The effect of a referral is similar in the two
specifications.


                                                         23
       We use the responses to these statements to create an indicator variable, DislikeBargain-

ing, which is one if a buyer derives a higher disutility from the bargaining process than the

median buyer. We derive this indicator using two different approaches. In our first approach

we construct a variable which is the sum of the normalized values of the responses to the two

statements.15 We then create an indicator which is one for a buyer with a higher value on

this variable than the median buyer. We run a specification in which we include DislikeBar-

gaining on its own and also interacted with both InternetUse and OBSReferral (see column 1

in Table 3). We find that consumers who DislikeBargaining pay 2.1% more than consumers

who do not (p-value < 0.001). We also find that consumers who obtained a referral from an

online buying service pay 0.83% less than those who do not (p-value 0.07); these savings accrue

equally to buyers who do and do not DislikeBargaining. (The DislikeBargaining-OBSReferral

interaction term is statistically zero.) Using the Internet, however, only benefits consumers who

dislike bargaining (by 1.7%, p-value 0.01); consumers who like to bargain (presumably because

they are good bargainers) do not benefit from using the Internet other than by obtaining a

referral.

       To ensure the robustness of these findings we use the factor BargainingDisutility from the

factor analysis on page 15 to derive our indicator variable. We redefine our indicator to be one

if a buyer derives a higher BargainingDisutility than the median buyer.

       We repeat the previous specification, however, instead of including the consumer trait mea-

sures directly, we make use of the factors WillingnessToSearch and CarEnthusiast to control

for consumer types. The results are similar to the previous specification (see column 2 in Ta-

ble 3). We find that consumers who DislikeBargaining pay 2.0% more than consumers who do

not. We also find that consumers who obtained a request from an online buying service pay

0.74% less than those who do not (p-value 0.10); again these savings accrue equally to buyers

  15
    For each variable we calculate the mean and standard deviation over all respondents. Then we normalize
the answer for each individual by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.




                                                   24
who do and do not DislikeBargaining. As before we find that using the Internet only benefits

consumers who dislike bargaining (by 1.5%); consumers who like to bargain or have the time

to do so do not benefit from using the Internet other than by obtaining a referral. The sum of

the marginal Internet effects is shown in the following table.

                                                       Likes bargaining       Dislikes bargaining
            Used Internet for information                     0%                     -1.5%
            (but did not request referral)
            In addition, requested referral                  -0.7%                    -0.7%
            Total Internet effect                            -0.7%                    -2.2%

    Our first result of this section is that buyers who dislike the bargaining process benefit much

more from being informed. This suggests that the effect of the Internet’s information provision

role is, at least in car buying, to move consumers towards a more level playing field in terms of

bargaining ability. Indeed, individuals who do not dislike bargaining do not appear to benefit

at all from being better informed by the Internet. One can argue that, colloquially, this is the

very definition of being a good bargainer: to be able to do well without knowing much about

one’s own and the other party’s outside options.16

    The second key result is that the benefits of requesting a referral accrue equally to all

buyers. We have argued in section 3.1 that a referral from an online buying service lowers

prices at a dealer because of the implicit threat to direct customers to the dealer’s competitors.

Consistent with our findings, if this threat operates, it seems reasonable that it should apply

uniformly across consumers.

    It is important to note that our result that buyers who like the bargaining process do not

benefit from being informed is not specific to the Internet specification: we repeat the basic

Informed specification from column 7 of Table 2 with the DislikeBargaining dummy and the

interaction of the dummy with Informed.17 We find that consumers who DislikeBargaining pay

2.6% more than consumers who do not (see column 3 in Table 3). We find the same qualitative

  16
     For example, being able to negotiate a salary raise after having received a competing job offer is not a sign
of good bargaining skills. However, negotiating a raise without such an offer may very well be.
  17
     We construct the dummy according to the first approach in this subsection.


                                                       25
result as in our two Internet specifications, namely that the benefits of being Informed accrues

only to consumers who dislike bargaining (by 2.0%).

    Finally, if a subset of consumers gain disproportionately from using the Internet to buy a

car, economic theory suggests that this group should be disproportionately likely to use the

Internet. Our final specification in Table 3 is a probit that relates a buyer’s decision to use the

Internet the consumer trait measures constructed in the factor analysis. We find that buyers

with a higher disutility from the bargaining process are more likely to use the Internet.



4    Conclusion

In this paper we use direct measures of search behavior and consumer characteristics in the car

industry to investigate how the Internet affects negotiated prices in car retailing. We match

transaction data on 1,500 car purchases in California with the responses to a survey which

asks buyers detailed questions about their Internet usage, their attitudes towards information

search and bargaining, and their demographics.

    Our survey data enable us to control directly, at an individual level, for heterogeneity in

attitudes towards search and bargaining disutility. While these controls cannot fully rule out

selection bias, they increase our confidence that the price effects are not an artifact of differences

in unobserved characteristics between people who use the Internet and those who do not.

    We show that the Internet lowers prices for two distinct reasons. First, the Internet informs

consumers. The information that seems to be most valuable to consumers is the invoice price of

the dealer; it enables them to negotiate a low price at a given dealership. Internet information

seems not to help consumers find low-price dealerships. In particular, the Internet does not

substitute for searching at multiple dealers. Nor does searching at multiple dealers substitute

    Second, the incentives provided by online buying services’ contracts with dealerships help



                                                 26
consumers obtain lower prices through a referral process. Referrals from manufacturer web-

sites do not lower prices. We believe that online buying services are more effective because,

unlike manufacturers, they can exert pressure on dealers by directing incremental business to

affiliated—and away from unaffiliated—dealerships. The magnitude of the combined informa-

tion and referral effect of the Internet is 1.5% of the purchase price, or 22% of dealers’s average

gross profit margin.

   We find that the benefit of gathering information differs by consumer type. While buyers

with a high disutility of bargaining pay 1.5% less when they have collected information on the

specific car they eventually purchase, buyers who like the bargaining process do not benefit

from such information.

   The point estimate of the combined information and referral price effects is close to the esti-

mate of Zettelmeyer, Scott Morton, and Silva-Risso (2004). They found that, after controlling

for selection, Autobytel.com lowered prices by 2.2%. Since Autobytel.com is a major online

buying service, we can compare this estimate with the sum of our InternetUse and OBSReferral

coefficients in the last subsection, 1.5%, or with the estimate of 2.2 to 2.5% for consumers with

a high disutility from bargaining. The similarity of the coefficient estimates is remarkable given

that Zettelmeyer, Scott Morton, and Silva-Risso (2004) use data from 1999, the height of the

Internet boom and a time of experimentation by both consumers and retailers. In contrast,

the data in this paper are from April and May of 2002, when the Internet had become more

mainstream.

   More generally, the results in this paper suggest that the decisions consumers make to

use the Internet to gather information and to use the negotiating clout of an online buying

service have a real effect on the prices paid by these consumers. The results speak both to

the significance of the Internet in making information more easily available, and also to the

potential of Internet institutions to affect the distribution of surplus even in established offline

industries like auto retailing.
