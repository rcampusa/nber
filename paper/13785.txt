                                            ABSTRACT

Intimate partner violence is a serious and preventable health problem affecting more than 30 million
Americans each year. We use an innovative new research design to describe the frequency and correlates
of emergency and crisis intervention services provided by domestic violence programs using safe,
non-invasive collection methods. During the 24-hour survey period, 48,350 individuals used the services
of primary purpose domestic violence programs, corresponding to a population rate of 16 per 100,000
people. Of these individuals, 14,518 required emergency shelter, 7,989 required transitional housing
and 25,843 were provided with non-residential services. Seven times more individuals are served
by domestic violence programs than are served in emergency rooms in the US on an average day.
The results show unmet demand for services provided by domestic violence programs with 10 percent
victims (5,183 requests) seeking services at a domestic violence provider unable to be served daily
due to resource constraints. Although DV costs $5.8 billion annually, 70% of which is spent on medical
costs, the government only spends $126 million annually. Thus greater funding of domestic violence
programs is likely to be a cost-effective investment.

       The Senate Judiciary Committee’s 1992 report, “Violence Against Women: A Week in

the Life of American Women” was a historic event in recognizing the pervasive nature of

domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. That report graphically

described 200 incidents of violence that occurred in just one week. Since then, intimate partner

violence (IPV)1 has been recognized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American

Medical Association (AMA), and health care providers as a major public health problem

affecting more than 32 million Americans (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000). 2,3, 4 Although fifteen

years have passed since the federal recognition of domestic violence, nearly one in four women

experiences at least one physical assault by a partner during adulthood.5 In part this may be

because while federal efforts have increased awareness of domestic violence as a serious crime,

there has been only limited willingness to treat domestic violence as a public health issue.6

       Bridging the gap between mainstream criminal justice responses (such as arrest) and the

medical response are federally-funded community-based domestic violence programs. These

programs to provide a range of services to victims some of which are safety focused (such as

shelters and toll-free crisis lines) and some of which are treatment-based (such as counseling

services and legal advocacy). These community-based programs play an important role in the

public response to intimate partner violence since many victims do not disclose abuse to the

police or even to medical professionals. The programs also provide an important referral

destination for physicians and other medical professionals who lack the expertise to address the

multi-faceted issues many domestic violence victims face.

       Existing research on services to domestic violence victims has largely been based on

responses in traditional medical setting such as emergency rooms or community health programs.

For example, recent studies have demonstrated that two to four percent of all women seen in U.S.
hospital emergency departments have acute trauma associated with IPV and another 10 to 12

percent of women have a recent history of intimate partner violence.7,8,9 Overall, an estimated

73,000 hospitalizations and 1,200 deaths are attributed IPV each year. 10,11 While this research

highlights the important intervention role of these medical settings, the majority of reported

injuries sustained by IPV victims are less severe.12 Thus it is likely that many victims of IPV

seek services from these community-based domestic violence programs. Moreover,

understanding both the structure of these programs and the number of people served could yield

important complementary information on interventions in medical settings.

       Unfortunately, little is known about these programs, the services they provide or the

communities they serve. To the authors’ knowledge there have been no large-scale studies of

local domestic violence programs and information collected by the programs themselves have

consisted of data that were not always unduplicated and often did not use consistent definitions.

Alternative methods that attempt to remedy these problems can be dangerous for victims because

they may require disclosure of abuse in unsafe settings or the collection of client-identified

information stored in insecure databases.

       This study presents the results from a noninvasive and unduplicated count of domestic

violence services using the National Census of Domestic Violence Services (NCDVS). The

NCDVS uses a “snapshot” approach to estimate the number of individuals served by any

organization with the primary purpose of serving victims of IPV and their families. By counting

the number of people served by all local domestic violence programs in a single day, it is

possible to construct an unduplicated count, as it is generally unlikely that an individual is served

by more than one local domestic violence program in a single 24-hour period. This can be done

without identifying information about individuals seeking services. The NCDVS thus provides a




                                                 2
safe and viable method for local domestic violence programs to provide an unduplicated count of

individuals they have served without compromising the safety of their clients.

       Based on the responses of domestic violence programs across the US for a 24-hour period,

we estimate that 48,350 individuals were served by domestic violence programs during the single

day survey period. 22,507 of those served sought some type of housing. In addition to providing

in-person services, local programs responded to over 16,000 crisis calls-equivalent to more than

11 calls per minute. These numbers correspond to more than 7 times the implied daily incidence

of violence related injuries seen in emergency rooms in the United States.13



                                      II. DATA AND METHODS

A. Developing a Sample Frame

       Prior to this initiative, there did not exist a complete listing of the community-based

programs providing domestic violence services. Thus, to conduct a census of these programs,

we first collected a listing of all eligible programs. For the purposes of this study, the

community-based programs termed “domestic violence programs” are defined as nonprofit,

nongovernmental organizations whose primary mission is to provide services to victims of

domestic violence, based on the definition included in the Violence Against Women Act of

2005.14 The federal funding structure and coordination needs have also led to the emergence of

state-level entities. These entities, termed “state coalitions”, are federally recognized state-level

nonprofit entities that coordinate funding, training, and education to the domestic violence

programs. Using the “primary purpose” definition, this study attempted to identify a broad range

of local U.S. domestic violence programs through state domestic violence coalitions and via

multiple national listservs frequented by domestic violence service providers. Based on




                                                  3
programs identified through these means, we include 2,016 domestic violence programs in the

sample frame. This is believed to be an almost complete universe of community-based domestic

violence programs.



B. Snapshot Approach

       The National Census of Domestic Violence Services (NCDVS) provides both a census of

programs and program characteristics as well as a measure of the services provided. The survey

method that required local domestic violence programs to conduct an unduplicated count of the

number of people using their program in a single 24-hour period without providing any

identifying information about any individual survivor. The primary assumption for this count to

produce an unbiased estimate of service usage is that relatively few people use the residential or

non-residential services of a more than one local domestic violence service provider in a single

24-hour period. This assumption seems reasonable even in the face of a mobile population like

IPV survivors.

       To ensure applicability and usability, the NCDVS survey instrument was developed by a

team of researchers and experts in the field of domestic violence service provision. Because this

study was the first of its kind and due to the broad scope of the initiative, the census was field

tested and participants were provided with detailed trainings regarding definitions of terms and

other logistical issues.   In May 2006, seven pilot states were selected based on several

dimensions including location, size, and programmatic structure. Based on feedback from the

May 2006 pilot, some revisions to the survey instrument were made.

       On September 13, 2006, the NCDVS survey instrument was distributed publicly. Public

distribution included electronic mail to state coalitions as well as to some listserves frequented




                                                4
by local domestic violence service providers. State coalitions were asked to distribute both the

survey packet and an information sheet to all local domestic violence programs. State coalitions

and local domestic violence programs participated in a one of a series of trainings. These

trainings presented a survey instrument and method and discussed the logistical details of

implementation. They also allowed local programs to submit any questions or concerns and

provided testimonial from pilot participants to encourage participation. The survey was designed

to be short and relatively easy to fill out.

           On November 2, 2006 at 8am, the survey period began and on November 3, 2006 at

7:59am the survey period ended. Domestic violence programs were then encouraged to submit

their counts either online or via fax. Domestic violence programs could then submit their results

online, at a site with a form design nearly identical to the paper survey, or they could fax in

results.     Reminder emails to state domestic violence coalitions, informing them of which

programs had submitted data were sent regularly for 2 weeks following the end of the survey

period. In turn, the state coalitions contacted non-responding domestic violence programs and

encouraged participation.



C. Response Rates

           Of the identified 2,016 domestic violence programs, 1,243 (62%) participated. Table 1

reports the participation rates of local domestic violence programs in each state. Rates do not

appear to be strongly associated with state size, population density, or overall population levels.

For example, among states with a large population, some had slightly below average

participation (e.g. CA, NY) while others had very high participation rates (e.g. IL, PA). Some

smaller states appeared to have better participation rates (e.g. NE, NH, RI, VT), though size was




                                                  5
not a strong predictor. Analysis of non-responding programs indicates that geography and

urbanicity are strong predictors of participation. However, the level to which survey-day service

rates and other program-level characteristics may have affected participation in the survey is

unknown.

       To construct standard errors for survey counts, weights were constructed at the national

and state levels because non-respondents may have different characteristics than respondents. To

analyze non-response and correlates of service usage, the 2000 U.S. Census county-level data

matched to NCDVS survey results based on a linkage between postal zip codes and county codes

(FIPS). Because most counties contain only one domestic violence program, the study assigned

the population of the corresponding county to the domestic violence program. Standard errors to

account for this procedure were then constructed and applied to raw survey sums to account for

errors generated by differential response rates.15 Population estimates to construct population

rates were treated as error free and obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.


D. Validation of Methods

       In order to use safe and noninvasive methods, this census did not use any personally

identifying client information and chose to observe only for a 24-hour period to ensure no

duplication. In order to empirically support this “snapshot approach” to surveying, two measures

were used. First, NCDVS respondents were asked to estimate the number of individuals they

serve on a “usual day.” This procedure is similar to that used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor

Statistics and Census Bureau in the Current Population Survey.16 Many respondents predicted

that they served more individuals on a typical day than on the survey day. This difference is

statistically significant (F(1, 1242) = 240.03, p-value = 0.00). However, the usual-day estimates

are highly correlated with the survey day levels (correlation of 0.77, standard error = 0.01). On



                                                6
average, domestic violence programs reported that they serve about four more people on a usual

day than were served on the survey day—approximately 10 percent more than survey day

estimates might suggest. While this suggests survey day estimates may be a slight undercount,

the data presents a relatively consistent magnitude of around 50,000 individuals served in a 24-

hour period by study respondents.

       An analysis comparing participants in the May 2006 pilot and the November 2006

national survey day was used to determine how representative and valid the numbers presented

might be. Of the 249 domestic violence programs that participated in the pilot, 86 did not

participate in the survey, leaving 163 programs participating in both the pilot and nationwide

survey, approximately 13 percent of the national sample. The results from the comparison of

these two points-in-time show almost no significant difference between the two 24-hour survey

periods, even though the survey days were 6 months apart. The number of women and children

sheltered on the survey day were slightly higher than on the pilot day but results were only

marginally significant at the 10 percent level. All other differences in average service levels

were insignificant between the two days.



E. Limitations

       There are some limitations worth noting which impact our ability to capture the full scope

of domestic violence services.      First, a majority of local domestic violence programs are

members of their state domestic violence coalitions. A small number of local domestic violence

programs may not be affiliated with state domestic violence coalitions and therefore may not

have participated in the count. Programs which serve some IPV victims but do not, as their

primary purpose, serve IPV victims may also not have participated in this survey. For example,




                                                 7
victims access advocacy and housing through other non-profit groups. While we did not restrict

our sample to members of state domestic violence coalitions, to the extent that these programs

are not in contact with domestic violence service providers in their state, we tended to omit them.

       Second, although dual programs (such as those which serve IPV and sexual assault

survivors or those that serve homeless individuals and IPV survivors) were included in these

counts, their ability to fully separate IPV and other clients served may be limited by the

willingness of survivors to disclose the full extent of their history. If survivors of IPV, for

example, prefer to remain in the general homeless population or do not disclose that the

perpetrator of their sexual assault was an intimate partner, we may have failed to count these

individuals. Such programs account for 37 percent of all domestic violence programs.

       Finally, some non-member local domestic violence programs cater to underserved groups

(e.g. immigrants, Native American communities, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender) and while

attempts were made in the national count to include all local domestic violence programs some

groups may not have been aware of the count. In particular, services on Native American

reservations and services at military bases are underrepresented in the sample.



                      III. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICE ON A SINGLE DAY

       Programs are distributed across the country as illustrated in figure 1. While most

counties have a program within their boundaries, some rural areas do not. Table 2 presents some

summary statistics about programs. Many of the programs are very small. Table 3 shows that

most programs have small staffs with more than one-third employing less than 10 and over 70

percent employing fewer than 20. More half of domestic violence programs use fewer than 20

paid staff and volunteers and nearly 20 percent have fewer than 10 paid staff members and




                                                8
volunteers. Programs rely on a large number of volunteers with 20 percent of programs relying

on over 40 volunteers. Nearly half of all programs have more than 20 volunteers.

       To measure service usage, services were divided into three, mutually-exclusive services:

emergency shelter, transitional housing, or non-residential advocacy services. Emergency

shelter was defined as any short-term living space provided to victims of IPV in response to an

immediate crisis. Transitional housing was defined as temporary housing designed to house

victims of IPV for a mid-length period of time, while helping them transition into permanent

living arrangements. Non-residential services included both group and individual services

provided to any individual not residing in housing provided by the serving program. Services

were classified as individual if they were provided to victims of IPV or their friends or families

in a one-on-one setting, including but not limited to one-on-one counseling, safety planning,

housing support, and legal services. Group services included a variety of support programs

including, but not limited to, support groups for adults or children, job-training programs, and

group counseling services.

       We estimate that 48,350 individuals were served in a single 24-hour period, not including

community education sessions or hotline calls. Table 4 reports unduplicated counts of service

usage. This corresponded to a population rate of approximately 16 individuals per 100,000.

There was variation by geographic region. In the U.S. Census Northwest Central region (Iowa,

Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Missouri) 27.04 per 100,000

individuals were served, while approximately 11 individuals per 100,000 were served in the

Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington). Urban domestic violence

programs served approximately 11 individuals per 100,000 while rural and suburban programs

served 24.3 individuals per 100,000.




                                                 9
       Similar to results from emergency room studies regarding domestic violence, the

individuals using domestic violence program services are primarily women (96 percent of adults

served) corresponding to a population rate of 13.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (about 20 women per

100,000 women) in the U.S. Approximately 22.25 per 100,000 children were served by local

domestic violence programs during the 24-hour survey period. This was primarily related to the

number of children accompanying adults seeking service (on average 1 child per adult requesting

emergency shelter and 1.6 children per adult requesting transitional housing).



A. Emergency Shelter

       The link between homelessness and domestic violence is both overwhelming and

undeniable. A staggering 92% of homeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual

abuse at some point in their lives.17 Survey evidence suggests that domestic violence is directly

responsible for homelessness. Fifty percent of homeless women and children are fleeing

domestic violence,18 and 38% of all victims of domestic violence become homeless at some

point in their lives.19 Among cities surveyed by the US Conference of Mayors, 44% identified

domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.20

       Some of this is alleviated by the availability of emergency shelters, which can provide

temporary, safe living quarters for victims of intimate partner violence. 65 percent of programs

provide some form of emergency shelter. We estimate that on a single night 14,518 individuals

required emergency shelter. While a given individual may stay several nights, this means that

over the course of a year, there will be 5 million stays in shelter beds. Moreover, this rate of

service usage requires 4 beds every night for every 100,000 individuals in the community.




                                                 10
Unfortunately, some communities, especially rural and socio-economically disadvantaged

communities, need many more beds and such emergency beds appear to be scarce.



B. Transitional Housing

Longer term housing is also crucial to the ability of a battered woman and her children to escape

an abusive relationship. Victims of domestic violence experience major barriers in obtaining and

maintaining housing, and victims most often return to their abusers because they cannot find

long-term housing.21 In addition, evidence suggests that victims are discriminated against, denied

access to, and even evicted from public, subsidized, and private housing because of their status

as victims of domestic violence or the abuse perpetrated against them.22 Transitional and long-

term housing options are necessary for many women to move from emergency shelter into

permanent housing of their own.

       Despite the importance of longer term housing, 22 percent of programs offer emergency

but no transitional housing. Shelters in counties with no transitional housing report that women

must often return to the shelter because they are unable to secure housing away from their

abusers. Shelters with transitional housing report much lower recidivism rates.23 In fact, the

majority of battered women in transitional housing programs state that had these programs not

existed, they would have returned to their abusers.24 When afforded residential stability,

homeless persons are considerably less likely to return to emergency shelter.25



C. Counseling and Advocacy

       In addition to the safety offered from shelter and transitional housing, domestic violence

programs offer a range of counseling and advocacy services. These services include individual




                                                11
counseling sessions to address the emotional impact of abuse as well as individual advocacy to

help victims safety plan. Group sessions may provide peer-support and strategies from other

survivors on addressing the short and long-term effects of domestic violence. Group sessions

may also provide critical empowerment skills such as economic self-sufficiency and job training.

Local programs also provide services which range from accompaniments to police or medical

setting to legal services to assistance in obtaining other public and social services. Such services

are typically available to the residents of program-provided housing but also are made available

to other non-residential individuals in the community providing a low-cost, safe source of

assistance for victims of domestic violence. The provision of such services account for the

majority of individuals served in most programs. In addition to in-person services, many local

programs offer crisis lines which help individuals in need but unable to access services in person.

       To better measure the distribution of services provided we measure the percent of

individuals served through direct service by residential status, hotline calls and community

education. This count shows the distribution of service, but duplicates counts of individuals who

used more than one service during the survey day (e.g., an individual who used both individual

and group counseling). It also allows a quantification of services, which, by their nature, cannot

be unduplicated (e.g., hotline calls that are not distinguishable between new and return callers).

Service types included: individual services for both residents and non-residents; group services

for both residents and non-residents; hotline calls; and, community trainings. Hotline calls

included crisis intervention, requests for support by victims, requests for support by friends or

family of victims, and other IPV information provided through crisis lines or hotlines.

Community training referred to outreach efforts to specific groups or to the general community




                                                 12
that increased public awareness about IPV or improved system responses to victims (e.g. law

enforcement trainings and volunteer trainings).

       The results presented in Table 5. Residential services comprised 22 percent of all

services provided. Thirty-five percent of the activities conducted (27 percent in urban and 39

percent in non-urban) were to the broader community in the form of community and public

education. There was variation in the distribution of services provided across regions. In some

areas, such as the New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode

Island, and Vermont) and Mid-Atlantic Regions (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania),

most domestic violence programs participating in the study provided between 25 and 30 percent

(32 percent in New England and 26 percent in Mid-Atlantic) non-residential advocacy services.

In other areas, such as the South Atlantic region (Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida,

Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia), half of all

services during this 24-hour period were prevention and awareness focused through public and

community education.

       In addition to in-person services, hotline calls represent an important service by domestic

violence programs to provide crisis and intervention services to individuals who require

information or services but are unable to come to a shelter in-person. In the 24-hour survey

period,16,644 calls were answered—corresponding to more than 11 calls per minute. In addition,

the National Domestic Violence Hotline responded to 1,213 calls. The National Domestic

Violence Hotline, housed in Texas, is a 24-hour, national toll free hotline. The Hotline provides

information, crisis counseling, and referrals in 150 languages. Operators at the Hotline use a

sophisticated system to directly connect victims with service providers in their immediate areas,

wherever they are across the country.




                                                  13
                      III. UNDERSTANDING UNMET REQUESTS FOR SERVICE

       In addition to services, we measure requests for services that went unmet due to lack of

resources. This count might include duplicate counts of individuals because someone may have

contacted more than one local domestic violence program during the survey period to request

assistance. Unmet requests were defined as any request for service that a domestic violence

program was unable to meet due to resource constraints (e.g., inadequate space, staff, or money).

This count included individuals who were referred to other community organizations due to the

initial respondent program’s resource constraints.

       As reported in Table 6, a total of 5,157 requests for service — 1.74 per 100,000

individuals in the U.S. — could not be met due to lack of resources. In the Mountain region,

1.16 individuals per 100,000 requesting emergency shelter had to be turned away or referred

elsewhere due to space constraints. In non-urban areas, 2.17 individuals per 100,000 were

unable to be served, which is in contrast to the national average of 1.75 per 100,000.

       This count is likely to be a serious undercount of unmet requests for several reasons.

First, many programs do not “turn away” any individuals seeking services and may instead spend

time seeking alternative services or arrangements for these individuals. As such, many programs

did not classify individuals that they did not serve as unmet requests. Second, many programs

may not be able to provide the service requested by the individual but will offer another service

instead. For example, if a woman requests shelter but the program does not have any available

beds they may provide her safety-planning and crisis management. In this case, the program

may not count her as an unmet request although she would have preferred shelter and that

request remained unmet. Third, there was a general cultural aversion to classifying any




                                                14
individual as un-served, largely because domestic violence programs are often places of last

resort. As a result, many programs were particularly unwilling to classify requests as unmet and

were displeased about the nature of this question.

       To better understand what factors are associated with higher levels of service requests

and higher rates of unmet requests, we estimate a simple linear regression estimating the relation

between service and turn-away rates on one hand and observable programmatic and geographic

factors. These results presented in Table 7 highlight factors that are correlated with service usage.

The first four columns measure the relationship between total number of individuals served and

the various program and area characteristics. Column (1) of Table 7 presents simple correlation

with information collected in the survey. Predictably, it appears that both staff size and budget

size are positively associated with number of individuals served. The increase in number of

individuals served appears to increase relatively steadily with respect to both budget and staff

size. Column (2) adds controls for median family income, unemployment rate, and male-female

labor force participation ratio. Controlling for these economic factors renders the budgetary

levels insignificant. This is likely because larger budget areas are associated with a host of

program specific variables. Column (3) adds demographic control variables such as percent

black and percent immigrant, which do not have a significant relationship to service levels. The

specification in column (3) also includes the male and female marriage rates which are

significant and are opposite in sign. Male and female marriage rates obviously correlated, but

the correlation coefficient is 0.55. As reported in Table 7, a higher fraction of married men

appears to be negatively associated with service levels while a higher fraction of married women

appears to be positively associated with service levels. Column (4) also includes controls for

poverty levels, none of which are significantly associated with service levels.




                                                 15
       Columns (5) through (8) report similar specifications with the outcome of number if

individuals turned away. Using the specification in column (8), it appears that larger programs

(i.e. those programs with larger staff sizes) have higher turn-away rates. In addition, it appears

that suburban areas have higher turn-away rates than urban areas. This may be due to the limited

availability of outside options although this does not appear to be the case for rural areas. Poor

areas appear to have more unmet requests as do areas that are predominantly black or Native

American. It appears the service provision is substantially more constrained in poor and

minority communities.



                                         IV. CONCLUSIONS

       In 2004, 1,159 women and 385 men were killed by intimate partners.26 While much of

IPV is non-fatal, the frequency and danger to its victims make it an ongoing public health

concern. Because only about one in seven of all domestic assaults come to the attention of the

police, expanding the use of public health tools to measure the extent and response to domestic

violence is crucial to effective intervention.27 While many studies have studied the interaction

between traditional medical settings and domestic violence services, this study represents the

first attempt to highlights the important complementary role that local domestic violence

programs play in the provision of care to victims of domestic violence.

       This study presents results from the National Census on Domestic Violence Services

(NCDVS). Results indicate that 48,350 individuals were served during a single 24-hour period.

These estimates are larger than the numbers of individuals seeking emergency medical care, and

correspond to at least 7 times the number of violence-related injuries treated in US emergency

rooms daily.28 While the NCDVS is advantageous because it is a noninvasive new method of




                                                 16
measuring the magnitude and distribution of emergency and crisis services provided to victims

of IPV, it provides only limited information about the level of intimate partner abuse. Although

little is known about individuals who use crisis services, even less is known about individuals

who do not seek the services of domestic violence programs and the selection parameters that

govern the decision to use services. Thus, the NCVDS presents a measure of domestic violence

service usage that is likely to be correlated with incidence levels, but still provides only limited

insight into the true, potentially higher, incidence of IPV.

       The NCDVS does provide new and important information about the usage and unmet

demand for IPV services. The existing data can be used to determine the demand for specific

types of services and the need to expand capacity in certain types of service provision. Ongoing

data collection in the form of an annual NCDVS will enable a more detailed examination of both

the spatial and temporal correlates of service usage and the relationship between this usage and

other measures of IPV. Future annual estimates generated from additional years of data

collected through the NCDVS may allow researchers and decision-makers to measure the

effectiveness and quantify the social cost of unmet requests.

       This study helps highlight the extensive service network for victims of domestic violence.

Understanding the structure of these programs which are at the intersection of safety services

and social services provides an important source of information on the interventions necessary to

effectively serve victims of domestic violence. The most concerning results from this survey is

that 5,183 requests for service went unfulfilled due to lack of resources in a single day. Given

the dire nature of domestic violence victims’ circumstances as they seek safety, this inability to

provide crisis services may be dangerous if not deadly. It is hoped that this and future surveys

will provide insight into the level and nature of services required by victims of intimate partner




                                                 17
violence and help ensure sufficient resources to effectively respond to the needs of these victims.

  The treatment of non-respondents and construction of weights were conducted by matching non-respondents to
similar programs. Because the NCDVS was a census, computation of the base weight (i.e., the inverse of the
probability of selecting the unit) was unnecessary. Programs were matched on the median income level,
unemployment rates, and racial composition. These variables were the strongest predictors of service usage in
responding programs (results not reported). Using this match, non-responding domestic violence programs were
assigned the responding domestic violence programs service usage levels. Frequency weights were then assigned to
domestic violence programs to account for their representation in the sample.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the state level are reported in parentheses. The dependent variable in columns (1)-(4) is the number of people served in-person, which
includes emergency shelter, transitional housing, and non-residential services. The dependent variable in columns (5)-(8) is the number of requests for service that went
unmet due to lack of resources. All regressions include state fixed effects.
a. Program level controls include a full set of staff size indicator variables (<10, 10-20, 21-40, >40), a full set of volunteers size indicator variables (<10, 10-20, 21-40, >40),
budget size (<$25,000, $25-50,000, $50-100,000, $100-500,000, $500,000).
b. Economic controls include unemployment rate and male-female labor force participation rate, and GDP.
c. Demographic Controls include fraction of the population that is African-American, Native American, Asia, Pacific Island, or other as well as controls for the fraction of
the population that are immigrants, male marriage rate and female marriage rate.
d. Household controls include median family income, family of families with income less than $25,000, $25-50,000, $50-100,000, and greater than $100,000.
