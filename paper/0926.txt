              Effects of U.S. Monetary Restraint on the
              DH-$ Exchange Rate and the German Economy



                               ABSTRACT



     This paper assesses the quantitative effects of a shift to monetary

restraint in the Tjnited States on the DM—$ exchange rate and the German

economy. The results indicate that such effects are large. If Germany

keeps its money growth unchanged, it will tend to experience a sharp and

sustained depreciation of the deutsche mark and a significant increase in

inflation and in unemployment. If it adopts an equivalent policy of monetary

restraint, it will tend to benefit from a marked decline in inflation, but

the cost in terms of lost output is extremely large.

                               Introduction

     This paper assesses the quantitative importance of the effects of a

shift to a policy of monetary restraint in the United States on the DM—$

exchange rate and the German economy. The paper was motivated by events

In 1979—81, when a shift toward monetary restraint in the United States

was accompanied by a sharp rise in U.S. interest rates and in the

exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. This sharp rise is widely viewed as

having placed pressures on other industrial countries, in particular

Germany, to boost their interest rates in order to limit the depreciation

of their currencies. However, there is much uncertainty as to exactly

how much U.S. monetary restraint contributed to the appreciation of the

U.S. dollar. There is also much uncertainty as to the magnitude of the

effects of the depreciation of the other currencies on their corresponding

economies, and, therefore, on the degree of constraint imposed on other

national authorities by the U.S. policy of monetary restraint. Finally,

there is much uncertainty as to the costs and advantages of the decision

made by other countries to largely match the rise in U.S. interest rates

by a rise in their own interest rates. The present paper aims at clari-

fying these issues, at least with respect to Germany.

     Beyond these specific policy issues, the paper also aims at casting

some light on a number of theoretical and empirical issues concerning the

functioning and the interdependence of industrial countries under floating

exchange rates. In the area of wage and price formation, the main issues

considered in the paper concern the formation of price expectations, the

effect of wage and price long—term contracts, and the effect of variations
                                 —2—

in import prices. More specifically, the paper addresses itself to the

following questions. Do private market participants form their price

expectations on the basis of past price developments or do they directly

take into account information that they have on the monetary policy

stance of the authorities? How fast can changes in price expectations be

reflected in actual wages and prices, given the existence of long—term

wage and price contracts? Are changes in import prices reflected in

wages and prices of domestically produced goods, either because of wage

indexation or because of the effect of import prices on price expectations?

     In the area of interest rate and output determination, the main

issue concerns the effect of monetary policy on interest rates. The cru-

cial question here is whether a reduction in money growth rapidly leads

to a decrease in interest rates because of reduced inflationary expecta-

tions, or whether it may in fact lead to an increase in interest rates

for a sustained period of time because of a liquidity squeeze. The

liquidity squeeze could result from the persistence of inflation either

because monetary restraint has no effect on price expectations or because

long—term contracts prevent wages and prices from adjusting rapidly.

Thus, the interest rate issue is closely related to the price formation

issue. It also has direct implications as far as output is concerned,

because an increase in interest rates at a time when inflationary expec-

tations are constant or declining will lead to a reduction in the demand

for investment goods and consumer durables and, ultimately, to a decline

in overall output.
                                   —3—


      These various theoretical and empirical issues have further impli-

 cations as far as the exchange rate determination pràcess is concerned.

 If interest rates rise in real terms, and a fortiori in nominal terms, as

 a result of a reduction in money growth, the exchange rate may initially

 shoot upward as a result of the rise in the uncovered interest—rate dif-

ferentials. If output declines, the current account surplus may gradually

increase, possibly causing a further appreciation of the exchange rate.

The first overshooting effect depends on how persistent the rise in

interest rates is expected to be. The second overshooting effect depends

both on whether the substitution among assets denominated in different

currencies is small and on whether private market participants view new

data on the current account balance as containing new information on

where the real exchange rate will have to be in the longer run to yield a

"reasonable" current balance outturn. The paper examines how large these

overshooting effects are and how they may affect domestic inflation.

     To deal with these issues, the paper uses a model of a monetary

economy developed in Artus (1981). Section I briefly reviews the main

characteristics of this model. Section II presents the results of the

estimation of the parameters of this model for Germany from data through

the second quarter of 1981. One of the main findings, consistent pith

results of a number of previous studies, is that the DM/$ exchange rate

is quite sensitive to changes in uncovered interest—rate differentials

and to inflation rate differentials and current balance developments. A

shift to monetary restraint in the United States will influence all these

variables and, therefore, the DM—$ exchange rate. Nevertheless, only a
                                   —4—

 small part of the depreciation of the deutsche mark vis——vis the U.S.

dollar in the course of 1980 and the first two quarters of 1981 can be

explained by the effects of U.S. monetary restraint. A large residual

remains that is called the "Reagan effect" in the present paper, for

lack of a better name.

     Section III presents the results of five simulations made with the

model. The first three simulations concern the effects of U.S. monetary

restraint on Germany. The first simulation assumes that neither the Ger-

man monetary authorities nor the monetary authorities of other industrial

countries change their policies to counter the tendency toward a depre-

ciation of their exchange rates vis——vis the U.S. dollar. The second

simulation assumes that the German monetary authorities do not change

their policies, while the monetary authorities of other industrial coun-

tries change their policies to offset the effect of U.S. monetary re—

straint on their exchange rates vis—â--vis the U.S. dollar. The third

simulation assumes that both the German monetary authorities and the

monetary authorities of other industrial countries change their monetary

policies. In the next two simulations, the consequences of the Reagan

effect on Germany are simulated under the assumption that neither Germany

nor other industrial countries change their monetary policies, then under

the assumption that they all shift to a policy of monetary restraint to

offset the consequences of the Reagan effect on their exchange rates.

     Finally, Section IV summarizes some of the conclusions that can be

drawn from this study with respect to international economic inter-

dependence under floating exchange rates.

                              I. The Model

     The model developed in Artus (1981) and used in this paper with a

few modifications is composed of three blocks of equations: a price

block, an output block, and an exchange rate block. The equations are

reproduced in Table 1 and described briefly below.

     The price block differentiates between short—run inflationary expec-

tations (for the next quarter) and long—run inflationary expectations

(for the next year and a half). Short—run inflationary expectations are

assumed to be formed on the basis of recent inflationary developments,

while long—run inflationary expectations are assumed to reflect the long—

run expected rate of growth of money (for the next year and a half). The

assumption underlying this specification is that, in the short run, the

relation between money and prices is too tenuous to yield efficient fore-

casts; private market participants can do better by extrapolating recent

inflationary developments. However, in the long run, the amount of money

and the overall price level are clearly related and it makes sense to

accept the view that inflationary expectations reflect the monetary

policy stance of the authorities, as it is perceived by private market
                1
participants.

     It -is the long—run expected rate of inflation that enters the

Phillips curve equation. Furthermore, it does so in the form of a

distributed lag. The assumption is that participants in labor markets

enter into long—run contractual wage arrangements that specify the rate

of increase of money wage rates. In each quarter, the arrangements being

entered into reflect the expected long—run rate of inflation prevailing

at the time.       Therefore, in any given quarter, the increase in the

average money wage rate for the whole economy reflects an average of the

expected long—run rates of inflation prevailing in a number of past quar-

ters. The behavior of the GDP deflator is assumed to follow the behavior

of the average money wage rate. The important consequence of that speci-

fication is that, even if an unexpected policy change is immediately

reflected in a change in money growth expectations, it will only lead to

a gradual change in the actual rate of inflation.

     From an empirical standpoint, the difficulty is to find a proxy for

the long—run expected rate of growth of money. The standard procedure to

derive estimates for the expected rate of growth of money is to assume

that the monetary authorities react with a lag to values taken by certain

target variables, such as the GDP gap. In each period, the parameters of

the policy reaction function can be estimated from the use of past ol?ser—

vations on the relevant target variables. The estimates are then used to

calculate a proxy for the expected rate of growth of money for the next
                                                                              3
period on the basis of past and present values of the target variables.

This method is employed in the present model with two important modifica-

tions. The first modification is that the policy reaction function (equa-

tion (1') in footnote a of Table 1) aims at explaining the average rate

of growth of money over overlapping six—quarter periods. This modifica-

tion is needed because the proxy that is sought is for the long—run rate

of growth of money (over the next year and a half).

     The second modification is that two variables that are concurrent

with the money growth being explained are introduced in the policy reac-

tion function. The first variable (z1) is a dummy     that   identifies the
                                  — 11) —




change in the rate of growth of money that tends to follow the announCe

ment of a major discretionary policy change.    The effect of the

announcement on money growth expectations in equation (1) of Table 1 is

then related to the magnitude of the actual change in the rate of money

growth that tended to follow similar announcements in the past. The

second concurrent variable introduced in the policy reaction function is

the amount of foreign exchange market intervention. In calculating the

expected rate of growth of money, it is then assumed that private market

participants do not anticipate the money growth that results from foreign

exchange market intervention because of the erratic nature of this

intervention so that this latter variable can be ignored. In brief,

variations in money growth related to exchange market intervention are

considered to be unanticipated. The introduction of these two concurrent

variables into the policy reaction function allows for a better identi-

fication of the unanticipated component of money growth and helps to

alleviate some of the identification problems that arise in the estirna—

tion of the model.

     The output block assumes that, given a certain level of potential

output, the long—term real interest rate and the impulse coming from real

government expenditures and foreign trade determine actual output. The

interest—rate effect on output is expected to take place with a substan-

tial lag because investment reacts slowly. It takes time to decide upon

and plan capital projects, and it is costly to stop them before completion.

The effect of the impulse coming from real government expenditures and

foreign trade is expected to take place more rapidly because no similar
                                     — 11 —




lags are involved. At the same time, the model assumes that the effect
of this impulse is temporary. Both real government expenditures and the

ratio of exports over imports (in volume terms) are introduced in the

form of deviations from past tendencies, so that any increase in the rate

of growth of these variables has first a positive impulse effect on output

growth, and then a negative effect of equal magnitude spread over time.

        The long—run expected rate of inflation having already been deter-

mined, the determination of the long—term real interest rate requires only

the specification of an equation for the long—term nominal interest rate.

This is done by inverting a demand for money equation in which the long—

term rate of interest represents the opportunity cost of holding money.

In the resulting equation (7), it is expected that a lower real money

stock leads, by itself, to a higher nominal interest rate, while the sign

of the coefficient of the expected long—run inflation term is indetermi-
         6
nate.        The last term in equation (7) represents an expected liquidity

squeeze or glut, which should have a positive coefficient. As explained

in Artus (1981), when a shift to monetary restraint leads to a downward

shift in the long—run expected rate of growth of money, the slow speed

of price adjustment will lead private market participants to expect that

the real money stock is going to decline. The excess of the short—run

over the long—run expected inflation rate will indicate how severe the

liquidity squeeze is likely to become in forthcoming quarters. If this

excess is large, private market participants will bid up the interest

rate in anticipation of the forthcoming squeeze.

     The exchange rate block is based on the asset—market theory of

exchange rate determination. In the equation that explains the change in

the DM—$ exchange rate, the three explanatory variables are the expected

inflation rate differential, the change in the uncovered short—term

interest rate differential, and the relative current balance position of

Germany and the United States.   A derivation of this equation was

presented in Artus (1981, Appendix I). One of the results of the deri-

vation was that the introduction of the relative current balance position

could be justified on two grounds. First, the substitutability of domes-

tic and foreign securities may be limited. For example, if Germany has

a large current balance deficit, the spot value of the deutsche mark vis—

a—vis foreign currencies may have to decline in comparison with its

expected future value in order to induce private market participants

abroad to increase the share of the deutsche—mark denominated securities

in their portfolios. Second, private market participants may view new

data on the current balance as containing new information as to where the

exchange rate should be in the future and, therefore, because of interest—
                                                     8
rate arbitrage, where it should be in the present.

    To complete the exchange rate block, it remains to determine the

short—term interest rate and the current balance. The short—term inter-

est rate is determined by specifying an equation for the term structure

of interest rate. In this equation, the excess of the short—term inter-

est rate over the long—term interest rate is related to a constant, the

real money stock, the real GDP, and the excess of the short—run expected

rate of inflation over the long—run expected rate of inflation. The
                                       — 13 —




constant measures the liquidity premium and is expected to be negative.
The current balance is determined by relating the ratio of exports over

imports (in volume terms) to relative real GDP levels and relative GDP

deflators in Germany and in the rest of industrial countries. For sim-

plification purposes, the German GD? deflator is taken as a proxy for the

deflator of German exports expressed in deutsche mark, while the deflator

of German imports expressed in U.s. dollars is taken as exogenous.

                              II. Econometric Results

        Table 2 presents the regression results obtained by using quarterly

observations and two—stage—least--squares regression methods to estimate

the parameters of the model.          The estimation period extends from the

third quarter of 1964 to the second quarter of 1981. Two exceptions are

equations (1'), (3') and (4'), which were estimated for each quarter t

using observations on the period extending from the first quarter of 1955
         10
to t,         and equations (7), (11), and (12), which were estimated from

observations on the floating rate period extending from the fourth quar-

ter of 1973 to the second quarter of 1981. On the whole, the results

were similar to those obtained in Artus (1981) for periods with identi-

cal starting points, but ending in the fourth quarter of 1979. However,

there were important differences that will be stressed below.

        In the price block, the results obtained for the equations that are

used to estimate proxies for inflationary expectations remained similar to

those obtained previously. In brief, long—run money growth expectations,

and therefore long—run inflationary expectations, are deemed to adjust

slowly to actual changes in the rate of growth of money, but they also

are deemed to be directly influenced by announcements of major policy

changes. Short—run inflationary expectations are deemed to adjust slowly

to actual changes in inflation rates.

     The results for the Phillips curve equations are also similar to

those obtained previously. In particular, the sum of the coefficients on

the expectation term is not significantly different from one, but a large

part of the effect comes with a significant lag. It takes about five

quarters for the total effect to take place, which is consistent with the

a priori knowledge that most labor contracts in Germany cover a period of

one year. Similarly, it takes a long time for the output gap to affect

the rate of inflation. Furthermore, [a this case, even the final effect

is not large. Ultimately, an increase of 1 percentage point in the gap

between actual and potential GDP reduces the quarterly rate of inflation

by a 0.17 (0.05)    percentage point, or the annual rate by about a 0.68

(0.20) percentage point. As in Artus (1981), variables outside the mone-

tary field had to be introduced into the regression equation to account

for certain developments. The surge of inflation in 1968—71 is still

explained by introducing a dummy variable of the zero—one type. However,

contrary to that previous study, the surge of inflation in 1973—75 is not

explained anymore by the introduction of a dummy variable. Instead, a

variable measuring the average change in import prices during the pre-

ceding six quarters performs that function. The introduction of import

prices had not been successful previously, possibly because, except for

1973—75, import prices in deutsche marks were not increasing rapidly

during the sample period. It is only when introducing 1980 and the first
                                    — 19 —



half   of 1981, which was characterized by rapidly increasing import prices

in deutsche marks, that the coefficient of the import price variable
                                                          12
became relatively large and statistically significant.

       These results suggest that German real wage rates are somewhat

rigid.13 For example, a 10 per cent deterioration in the terms of

trade due to an increase in import prices will lead to a 2.5 per cent

increase in the GDP deflator, presumably because of an increase in nomi-

nal wage rates. Given a constant money growth rate, the growth of real

GDP will start to decline. But, for many years, the resulting rise in

the output gap will fail to bring about the decline in real wage rates

necessary to restore domestic equilibrium at full employment.

       In the output block, the addition of observations for 1980 and the

first half of 1981 allows a better identification of the effects of

changes in the real money stock on the long—term rate of interest. The

coefficient of the real money stock, contrary to previous results, is now

statistically significant and is large in magnitude. A 1 per cent reduc-

tion in the real money stock is found to lead to an increase of a 0.065

percentage point in the long—term interest rate at a quarterly rate, or
                                             14
a 0.26 percentage point at an annual rate.        The other results in the

long—term interest rate equation remained unchanged. In particular, the

coefficient of the long—run expected rate of inflation is small and not

statistically significant. The coefficient of the expected liquidity—

squeeze variable is positive as expected, but also not statistically

significant. Together, the two latter coefficients imply that a
                                          — 20 —



1 percentage point decrease in the long—run expected inflation rate ini-

tially leads to a 0.27 percentage point increase in the long—term nominal

interest rate and, therefore, to a 1.27 percentage point increase in the

long—term real interest rate.

     The results for the output equation were not affected by the updating.

The long—term real interest rate is still found to have a gradual, but

ultimately large, effect on output. After three and one—half years, an

increase in the interest rate of 1 percentage point at a quarterly rate

(or 4 percentage points at an annual rate) is found to result in a 7.2

per cent decline in real GDP. By contrast, the impulse effect of an

additional 1 per cent increase in real government expenditures and in

the ratio of exportsover imports in volume terms leads to a 0.33 (0.05)

per cent increase in real GD? after two quarters, while government expen-

ditures and exports per se account for about 45 per cent of GD?.

     In the exchange rate block, the coefficients of the exchange rate

equation were first estimated without making any attempt to isolate the

effects of major disturbances such as the oil embargo. The results were

as follows:

    While the estimates of the coefficients have the expected signs and

are statistically significant, the regression equation explains only 51

per cent of the variations in the exchange rate. The plot of actual and
                                      — 21 —




estimated values presented in Chart LA clearly shows that the large
residuals are to be found in three periods, which follow the oil embargo

in late 1973, the collapse of the Herstatt bank in mid—1974, and the
                                           15
election of Ronald Reagan in late 1980.         When dummy variables were
                              16
included for these factors,        Table 2 show that the estimates of the

coefficients were not significantly affected, but that their standard

errors were greatly reduced. The explanatory power of the equation

increased sharply, with 73 per cent of the variations in the exchange

rate now accounted for. (See Chart 1.B for the residuals in the new

regression equation.) The results of this latter equation will be used

in the rest of this study; they are roughly similar to those obtained in

Artus (1981) as far as interest rate and current balance effects are

concerned.

     The interesting implication of these results is that about half of the

29 per cent depreciation of the deutsche mark against the U.S. dollar from

the fourth quarter of 1979 to the second quarter of 1981 is due to what

we have called the "Reagan effect" (see Chart 2). The other significant

factor during this period is the worsening of the German current balance

relative to the U.S. current balance. Contrary to what is commonly

thought,-changes in interest rates do not account for much of the net

change in the exchange rate from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the second

quarter of 1981, mainly because, the rise in U.S. real interest rates was

soon offset by an equivalent rise in German interest rates. But the

pattern of quarterly changes in the DM—$ exchange rate was strongly

influenced by changes in interest rates.

     The results for the two remaining regression equations in the

exchange rate block call for only brief comments. The results of the

equation for the short—term interest rate are reasonable. There is a

significant liquidity premium indicated by the negative constant. As

expected, an increase In the real money stock decreases the short—term

rate by comparison with the long—term rate, while an increase in econo-

mic activity Increases the short—term rate by comparison with the long--

term rate. An excess of the short—run expected rate of inflation over

the long—run expected rate of inflation is reflected by an excess of the

short—term interest rate over the long—term interest rate. Finally, the

trade equation remains characterized, as previously, by a sum of the

export and import price elasticities that exceeds one only after a lag

of about three years.

                         III. Policy Simulations

     The model estimated above can be used to investigate various policy

issues. Here, I focus on issues of international interdependence. First,

I Investigate the normal effects of a shift to monetary restraint in the

United States on the DM—$ exchange rate and the German economy, and the

policy alternatives available to the German monetary authorities. Then,

I consider the different case of an exogenous" change in the DM—$

exchange rate, taking as an example the Reagan effect, and again I inves-

tigate the effects on the German economy and the policy alternatives

available to the German monetary authorities.

1.   Effects of monetary restraint in the United States

     The purpose of the first set of simulations is to estimate the

effects of a shift to monetary restraint in the United States on the DM—$

exchange rate and the German economy, when the German monetary authorities
do not change their rate of money growth in response to the change in U.S.

policy. The estimation is made under two polar assumptions as to the

policy response in other industrial countries. Under assumption A, the

other industrial countries keep their real exchange rates vis—a—vis the

deutsche mark constant and, therefore, follow the German monetary policy.

Under assumption B, the other industrial countries keep their real exchange

rates vis—à—vis the U.S. dollar constant and, therefore, follow the U.S.

monetary policy. To make the estimation, I generate a control solution

for the period 1980 to 1984 which, although somewhat arbitrary, is intended

to provide a plausible picture of what would have taken place during this

period if there had not been a shift in U.S. monetary policy and a Reagan

effect. Then, I "shock" the model by changing the exogenous variables

and I calculate the effect of the given shock by subtracting the new

simulation results from those obtained in the control solution.

     The shock that depicts the shift to monetary restraint in the United

States is represented in Chart 3. The short—term interest rate (at a

quarterly rate) is increased by one percentage point in the first quarter,

stajs at its new level for one and a half year, and then declines back to

its initial level in four quarters. The U.S. inflation rate (at a quar-

terly rate) declines gradually, with a total decline of one percentage

point after two and a half years. The rate of growth of real GNP (at a

quarterly rate) is reduced by one percentage point in the first quarter,

stays at its new level for two years, goes back to its initial level for

two quarters, and then increases by one percentage point for two years,

 before finally settling back to its initial level. The U.S. current

 balance (expressed by the ratio of exports of goods and services over

 imports of goods and services) increases gradually during the first two

years for a total gain of 10 per cent, stays at its new level for two

quarters, then gradually goes back to its initial level during the next

two years. The choice of these adjustment paths is arbitrary, but it

would not be unrealistic to view them as representing the effects of

the shift of monetary restraint in the United States in late 1979 in a

schematic form. At least this is true if one neglects the sharp quar-

terly movements in U.S. money growth and U.S. interest rates during 1980.

     Chart 4 depicts the estimates of the effects of the shift in U.S.

monetary policy on the DM—$ exchange rate and the German economy, when

the German monetary authorities do not change their rate of money growth.

The estimates on the left—hand side assume that the rest of the industrial

countries keep their real exchange rates vis—à—vis the deutsche mark

constant (assumption A), while the estimates on the right—hand side assume

that the rest of the industrial countries keep their real exchange vis——

vis the U.S. dollar constant (assumption B).

     Considering assumption A first, the effects on the DM—$ exchange

rate and the German economy are quite pronounced. Three main factors

cause the deutsche mark to depreciate sharply in real terms against the

U.S. dollar for a sustained period. First, the increase in short—term

U.S. interest rates leads to a sharp depreciation of the DM—$ exchange

rate during the first two quarters. Second, this initial depreciation

gives rise to a J—curve effect and a worsening German current balance

during the next few quarters. Third, the decline in economic activity
In the United States gradually leads to an improvement in the U.S. cur-

rent balance and a further worsening of the German current balance.

After three years, the DM—$ exchange rate has declined by 27 per cent in

nominal terms and 20 per cent in real terms. The depreciation of the

DM—$ exchange rate, in turn, causes a rise in the German inflation rate,

as measured both by the CDP deflator and the domestic demand deflator.

After three years, the GDP deflator has increased by 1.2 per cent and

the domestic demand deflator by 2.9 per cent. With an unchanged rate of

money growth, real interest rates increase In Germany, bringing about a

small increase in the GDP gap. All these effects become unwound in the

long run, but it takes a large number of years at some cost in terms of

cumulated lost output in Germany. The cumulated lost output in Germany

accounts for 0.5 per cent of a year's GDP already after three years and

1.5 per cent after five years.

     Not surprisingly, the effects under assumption B are similar as to

their direction, but their magnitude is larger. For example, the rise

in the German inflation rate is much larger as a result of a larger rise

in import prices. After three years, the GDP deflator has risen by

nearly 4.0 per cent and the domestic demand deflator by nearly 9.9 per

cent. This leads to a larger cumulated lost output in Germany; the lost

output amounts to 2.2 per cent of a year's GDP after three years and 5.4

per cent after five years. These results illustrate how much Germany

benefits if other industrial countries keep their real exchange rates

vis—â—vis the deutsche mark constant.

     A possible policy response of the German monetary authorities is to

reduce their rate of money growth in order to offset the effect of U.S.
                                                17
monetary restraint on the DM—$ exchange rate.        The Implications of

this policy response are depicted in Chart 5 for the case where other
                                                18
industrial countries adopt the same response.        The favorable effect of

such a response is that the rate of inflation declines sharply in Cermany.

After a year, the rate of inflation has declined by about one percentage

point (at a quarterly rate), whether the rate of inflation Is measured

by the GDP deflator or the domestic demand deflator. Furthermore, this

decline in the rate of inflation persists in subsequent years as a result

of a permanent decline in the rate of money growth in Germany. How-

ever, the cost of such a policy is extremely large in terms of lost out—

put in Germany. The output gap increases gradually to reach about eight

percentage points after two years, before declining slowly. By the end

of the fifth year, the cumulated lost output accounts for 21.5 per cent

of a year's GDP. This can be compared to the cumulated loss of 1.5 per

cent in the case where neither Germany nor the other industrial countries

respond to the shift in U.S. monetary policy by an equivalent shift in

their own monetary policies.

2.   Changes generated by the Reagan effect

     To estimate the changes in the German economy generated by a

development such as the Reagan effect, I have simulated the model after

introduction of an exogenous shift in the value of the deutsche mark

against the U.S. dollar of —6.5 per cent per quarter from the fifth to

the sixth quarter of the simulation period. For simplification purposes,

it has been assumed that economic activity, inflation and the current
balance in the United States remain as in the control solution. Differ—

ences between the new simulation results and those obtained in the control

solution are presented in Chart 6. The results on the left—hand side of

the chart assume that the German monetary authorities do not change the

rate of money growth, while the results on the right—hand side assume

that the authorities reduce the rate of money growth in order to offset

the Reagan effect on the DM—$ exchange rate. In both cases, the other

industrial countries are assumed to follow monetary policies that keep

their exchange rates vis—à—vis the deutsche mark constant in real
         19
terms.

     The left—hand side results clearly indicate the inflationary impact

of a depreciation of the DM—$ exchange rate on the German economy. The

rate of inflation measured by the domestic demand deflator increases by

more than half a percentage point at a quarterly rate during the first

two quarters. After about two and a half years, the cumulated effect on

the domestic demand deflator reaches 2 1/2 per cent. The rate of infla-

tion measured by the GDP deflator is less affected; the cumulated effect

on the GD? after two years and a half Is about 1 1/2 per cent. In part,

the inflationary consequences of the Reagan effect are enhanced because

the depreciation of the deutsche mark initially leads to a worsening of

the German current balance, which results in a further depreciation.

This mechanism maintains the downward pressure on the deutsche mark even

after the two quarters of the Reagan effect. With an unchanged rate of

money growth, the increase in the domestic demand deflator gradually

brings about a liquidity squeeze and a rise in both short—term and long—

term real interest rates. The recessionary effect on output of the rise

in long—term interest rates is at first offset by the expansionary effect

coming from the increase in the ratio of exports over imports in volume

terms, but, after one year, the recessionary effect starts to dominate.

     These effects become unwound in the long run, but at a cost. Because

of the increase in the output gap, the rate of inflation, measured either

by the GD? deflator or the domestic demand deflator, starts falling in

comparison with the control solution. A gradual improvement in the cur-

rent account, resulting from the lagged relative price effects and the

increase in the GDP gap, stops the depreciation of the deutsche mark in

time, and then leads to a gradual appreciation. However, it takes a long

period of economic slack before the price increases of the first two and

a half years are fully offset by subsequent price declines. Five years

after the initial shock, the cumulated effect on the domestic demand

deflator still amounts to an increase of 2 per cent, which is only 1/2

per cent less than after two and a half years, despite an additional

output gap of about half a percentage point maintained continuously from

the third year onward.

     The alternative strategy for the German monetary authorities and the

monetary authorities of other industrial countries is to shift to a policy

of monetary restraint in order to offset the effect of the exogenous

development that puts downward pressure on their exchange rates. However,
                                   — 29 —



the   results presented on the right—hand side of Chart 6 indicate that, at

times, the cost in terms of economic slack may be so large that this will

not be a realistic alternative. In the case of the Reagan effect, the

model indicates that the German monetary authorities would have had to

reduce the rate of monetary growth by about seven percentage points in

each of the two quarters directly affected to offset the Reagan effect

on the DM—$ exchange rate. Not surprisingly, the model indicates that

this would have led not only to a reduction in inflation in Germany, as

measured by both the domestic demand deflator and the GDP deflator, but

also to a major recession. After two years, the output gap would have

been increased by about 8 1/2 percentage points. Then, the German mone-

tary authorities would have had to carry out a major monetary expansion

to offset the upward pressures on the DM—$ exchange rate that would

have resulted from a sharp increase in the German current balance. This

would, in turn, have lead to a sharp economic recovery.

                              IV. Conclusions

      This paper indicates that a shift to a policy of monetary restraint

in the United States has major effects on Germany. If the German mone-

tary authorities keep their rate of money growth unchanged, they will

experience a sharp and sustained depreciation of the deutsche mark against

the U.S. dollar in real terms. This will lead to a significant increase

in the inflation rate in Germany for a large number of years. The CD?

gap will also increase gradually. The magnitude of these effects is

greatly increased when other industrial countries choose to respond to

the U.S. policy by adopting equivalent policies of monetary restraint.
                                     — 30 —




 In   this latter case, a simulation based on a schematic description of

 the effects of the 1979 shift to monetary restraint in the United States

on U.S. interest rates, prices, output, and current balances, indicates

 the following effects on the German economy. Prices increase substan—

tially in Germany; after three years, the GDP deflator is nearly 4 per

cent higher than in the control solution corresponding to no shift to

monetary restraint in the United States, and the domestic demand deflator

nearly 10 per cent higher. Furthermore, output decreases substantially

in Germany by comparison with the control solution. The cumulated lost

output amounts to 2.2 per cent of a year's GDP after three years and 5.4

per cent after five years. It is true that all these effects become

unwound in the long run, but the long run seems so far away in this case

as to be irrelevant.

       If the German monetary authorities respond to the change in U.S.

policy by adopting an equivalent policy of monetary restraint and other

industrial countries follow suit, Germany benefits from a marked decline

in its inflation rate, but the cost in terms of lost output is extremely

large. After a year, the rate of inflation, in terms of the GDP deflator

or domestic demand deflator has declined by about one percentage point

(at a quarterly rate), and the lower level persists in subsequent years.

The output gap increases gradually to reach about eight percentage points

after two years, before declining slowly. By the end of the fifth year,

the cumulated lost output accounts for 21.5 per cent of a year's GDP.

      An appreciation of the U.S. dollar due to an exogenous development

gives rise to a similar dilemma for the German monetary authorities.
                                  — 31 —




Here again, the dilemma is increased when other industrial countries

choose to change their monetary policies in order to stabilize their

exchange rates vis—à—vis the U.S. dollar.   If the exogenous development

is as large as what is called in the present paper the Reagan effect,

that is, a depreciation of about 13 per cent within two quarters, the

analysis indicates that it would be very costly for the German monetary

authorities to try to offset the impact of this development on their

exchange rate through a policy of monetary restraint. The necessary

reduction In money growth would push the German economy into a major

recession.

     This paper also indicates that the large effects on the German

economy of a U.S. policy of monetary restraint or of an exogenous devel--

opment affecting the DM—$ exchange rate are mainly due to the following

factors: (1) the inflation rate in Germany responds slowly to a change

in the money growth rate or the emergence of a GDP gap, (2) there is a

direct link in Germany between import prices and domestic factor prices,

(3) the DM—$ exchange rate is highly sensitive to variations in uncovered

short—term interest rate differentials and to the level of the relative

current balance position of the two countries, and (4) the volumes of

German foreign trade flows respond slowly to relative price changes.

       If the rate of growth of money on the left—hand side of the equation

covers a period that includes the beginning of the implementatIon of a

major stabilization program, then its value may deviate substantially

from the value that the first two explanatory variables would normally

imply. To take this into account, the dummy variable z1 is given a value

that increases from zero to one in proportion to the number of quarters

covered by the left—hand side variable that are affected by the policy

shift. If the left—hand side variable covers a period that immediately

follows a policy change, only one or two of the lagged money growth rates

included as explanatory variables will be affected by the policy change,

so that the historical series cannot be considered to reflect adequately

the information available to private market participants. To offset

this fact, the value of zi is allowed to decay gradually from one to

zero in eight quarters. In the empirical study, the rate of decay was

chosen to be consistent with the estimates of the values of the lag

coefficients of the variables m_j in equation (1').

      At any point in time, private market participants can look back and

estimate the coefficients of the policy reaction function (1') from past

data. To predict money growth, they must then forecast the discretionary

component of the policy stance. In the present model, it is assumed that

private market participants do not anticipate discretionary policy changes

but that their long—run expectations are revised once a policy change is

announced. The change in their expectations depends on the coefficient

of the variable zl, the magnitude of which depends on the effectiveness

of past policy changes.

      Thus, in equation (1)

which is used to predict money growth, the variable zi enters, but in a

modified form denoted by z2. The variable z2 takes the value of zero up

to the period when the policy change is announced; then, like z1, it

takes a value of one when the policy change is announced, after which z2

decays gradually.

      Eight monetary stabilization programs were identified during the

period 1955—81 (second quarter) with the following initial impact periods:

the second quarter of 1956, the first quarter of 1962, the fourth quarter

of 1965, the second quarter of 1972, the fourth quarter of 1972, the

second quarter of 1973, the third quarter of 1979, and the first quarter

of 1981. The two programs with initial impact in the second quarter of

1972 and the fourth quarter of 1972 were given an intensity that was one

           This view was developed, in particular, by Lucas ((1972), (1975)),

 Sargent and al1ace (1975), and Barro (1978).

          Most of the labor contracts in Germany are for a period of a year

 and require a few months of negotiations so that the six—quarter period

 chosen to evaluate the expected long—run rate of inflation seems adequate.
   3
     Lagged money growth rates are usually included in the policy reac—

 tion function because they may contain information on the normal behavior

 of the authorities that cannot be readily derived from the way they react

 to values assumed by specific target variables.

     See the Appendix for a detailed explanation concerning the use of

 the zj variable in equation (1') and the corresponding z2 variable in

equation (1).

Srivastava (1979) and Buiter (1980).

          See Artus (1981, footnote 12, p. 508), for a discussion of the sign

of the coefficient of the expected long—run inflation term.

      For the sake of convenience, the current balance variables are

expressed as ratios of exports of goods and services over imports of

goods and services in logarithmic form.

    An attempt was made in Artus (1981) to differentiate between these

two effects of the current balance by introducing the change in the cur-

rent balance in the exchange rate equation. This change was viewed as a

proxy for unanticipated current balance develornents on the grounds that

quarterly changes in the current balance are difficult to forecast. The

level of the current balance was then assumed to identify the effect of

the limited asset substitutability. However, in the empirical analysis,

the coefficient of the change in the current balance was found to be small

and not significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent significance

level, while the coefficient of the level of the current balance was found

to be large and significant. This result could be interpreted as suggest-

ing that either the limited—substitutability effect was the important one,

or that even the level of the current balance was difficult to anticipate

and came often as a "surprise." In the present study, the effect of the

change in the current balance was again found to be not significant, and

this variable was dropped from the exchange rate equation.

     The sources of the data are described in Artus (1981, Appendix II).

     The regression results indicated in Table 2 for equations (1'),

(3'), and (4') are those based on the full sample period extending to the

second quarter of 1981.

an abbreviation for "significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent

significance level."

     The implied elasticity of money with respect to the long—term

interest rate is 0.4.

       The first half of 1981 was certainly influenced by many factors

other than the election of Ronald Reagan, including political problems

in Germany and the crisis in Poland.

       The dummy variable for the oil embargo takes the value 0.5 in the

fourth quarter of 1973, 1.5 in the first quarter of 1974, —2 in the second

quarter of 1974, and zero otherwise. The dummy variable for the collapse

of the Herstaff bank takes the value 1 in the third quarter of 1974, —0.5

in the fourth quarter of 1974, —0.5 in the first quarter of 1975, and zero

otherwise. Finally, the dummy variable for the election of Ronald Reagan

takes the value 1 in the first two quarters of 1981 and zero otherwise.
  17
       In the simulation, the reduction in money growth in Germany is accom-

panied by a change in money growth anticipation in the first quarter due

to the effect of the dummy variable z2 (See Appendix for a description

of this variable.) That is the reduction in money growth is defined as

a major policy shift that is viewed as such by private market participants.
  18
       In the model, it is not possible to simulate the case where the

German monetary authorities stabilize the DM/$ exchange rate while other

industrial countries do not adopt any monetary response. In particular,

there is no equation in the model that would determine what would happen

to the exchange rates of other industrial countries in this case.

       In the simulation where the German monetary authorities and the

monetary authorities of other industrial countries reduce the rate of

money growth, the level of economic activity in other industrial coun-

tries is assumed to be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the

German level of economic activity.
