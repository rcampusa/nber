                                              ABSTRACT



        We present a model where policies of free capital mobility can signal governments’       future

policies, but the informativeness    of the signal depends on the path of world interest rates. Capital

flows to “emerging markets” reflect investors’ perception of these markets’ political risk. With low

world interest rates, emerging markets experience a capital inflow and engage in a widespread policy

of free capital mobility; with higher rates, only sufficiently committed countries allow free capital

mobility,   whereas others impose controls to trap capital onshore, thus signaling future policies

affecting capital mobility.   These predictions are consistent with the recent experience of capital

flows and policies affecting capital mobility in developing countries.

      If a country liberalizes capital movements,        it is often viewed as signaling its commitment

to policies favorable to investment;    to the extent it can differentiate    itself from other countries

competing for funds, investors may respond favorably.          What are individual countries’ incentives

to allow free capital mobility, when such policy is widespread?          And what is the information

contained in a single country’s liberal policy, when most countries liberalize in response to

external developments?

      In the late 1980s and early 1990s most Latin American and many other developing

countries significantly   liberalized their economies.     At the same time capital poured in, the inflow

from industrial countries rising from about $45 billion per year in 1985-88, to above $200 billion

in 1993.2 Despite its role in attracting foreign capital, financial liberalization     was not the only

factor responsible for these massive inflows.      Calve, Leiderman,     and Reinhart (1993, 1994), for

instance, provide evidence that external factors--mainly,       the U.S. economic slowdown and fall in

interest rates--could explain perhaps half of the inflow experienced by Latin American countries

in the 1989-1992 period (see also Chuhan, Claessens, and Mamingi,             1993). Hence, both external

and domestic factors--less    attractive investment opportunities     in industrial countries, and stronger

commitment    to free markets in many developing countries--led         investors to search for higher

returns in Latin America and East Asia.

      Beginning in late-1993, the ongoing U.S. expansion and European recovery led to a

reversal of capital flows between industrial and developing countries, while the supposed firm

commitment    of some emerging economies to liberal policies was also suddenly called into

question.   Capital flows to developing countries fell by one-fifth from 1993 to 1994, with the

February 1994 rise in U.S. interest rates often viewed as the turning point.          At the same time,

while some countries stayed the course to liberalization,      others which had earlier liberalized (for

example, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, and Nigeria) resorted to re-imposing          capital controls or to

tightening existing regulations    and delaying announced liberalization    plans.~

       Emerging markets’ experience with capital account policies since the late- 1980s motivates a

search for a more structural link between macroeconomic          developments   in industrial countries

and policies affecting capital mobility in developing countries.       To this end, we compiled data on

capital controls from the IMF’s annual survey of Exchange Arrangements            and Exchange

Restrictions    from 1970 to 1994, following the methodology       of Epstein and Schor (1992) and

Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti    (1995), among others.   We defined three dummy variables, each taking

a value of one when a country was classified in the survey as restricting payments for capital

transactions,    enforcing multiple exchange rates, or restricting repatriation of export proceeds in a

given year, respectively.     Adding up over countries, and normalizing     by (three times) the number

of countries, we constructed      an index of capital controls in developing countries, ranging between

zero and one, roughly capturing the pervasiveness         of the most common restrictions on capital

mobility.      The index takes a value of one in any year if all countries enforce all three types of

restrictions in that year, and a value of zero if no such restriction is imposed anywhere in that

year. Our sample includes 73 developing countries surveyed from 1970 to 1994 (those for which

there is complete data for the period, out of 162 developing countries).        We also constructed a

measure of real (ex post) returns to capital in industrial countries by deflating average long-term




     3 In the event, the previous meteoric rise of many emerging stock markets was matched by
an equally sharp fall. As one wag put it, it was at this point that he learned what “emerging
markets” really meant, when he discovered how difficult it was to emerge unscathed.

interest rates in the G-7 countries with average GDP inflation rates.

       Figure 1 plots the resulting capital controls index against the G-7 and U.S. long-term real

interest rates.    The data underlying the plot is obviously crude, and the dynamics in mid-sample

strongly reflect the debt crisis of the early 1980s. Nevertheless,         the correlation between the

capital controls and rate of return indices is striking.4       A 25-observation,   time-series regression

of the capital controls index on the G-7 interest rate gave an r 2 of .65 and a t-statistic of 7:

industrial countries’ interest rates appear to be important determinants          of developing countries’

liberalization    decisions.5   The data also suggest a more general pattern of widespread       liberaliza-

tions and massive inflows, subsequent policy reversals, and investors’ belated pledge to greater

selectivity the next time around:       massive capital flows to developing countries in the late 1970s

were also associated with extensive liberalization         in these countries;   and the ensuing debt crisis

was also accompanied        by a resurgence of restrictive policies.

       In this paper we present a signaling model of policy choices that rationalizes the observed

link between world interest rates (and external macroeconomic             events, more generally) and

policies affecting capital mobility in small open economies.           When used to interpret the events of

the early-80s and early -90s, our model suggests a different view from the two views most

frequently offered of these episodes.       According to one of these views, the rush of capital into


      4 Among other shortcomings, our capital control index does not measure the intensity or
effectiveness of controls, nor does it distinguish between controls on inflows and outflows (though
restrictions are mainly on outflows). Similarly, nominal interest rates should be deflated by expected
(rather than actual) inflation. To the extent that actual inflation has typically fallen short of expected
inflation in most industrial countries since the early 1990s, the appropriate real rate of return series
would fall in this period below the ex post series plotted in Figure 1. Rapid progress toward liberal
markets in late-sample may also reflect structural changes not captured in our simple empirical
model, such as secular erosion in the effectiveness of capital controls.

     5 Regressions using short-term rates and similarly constructed indices of capital restrictions gave
very similar results. All data are available from the authors upon request.

emerging markets was less than fully rational to begin with, reflecting instead a herd mentality

that led most investors to bet on anything exotic, without bothering to distinguish           sound from

unsound investment opportunities.       From this viewpoint, getting burned ex post was the natural

outcome of investors not being sufficient y discriminating         ex ante.   An alternative view is that the

dissimilar experience in bad times of countries that were similar in good times reflects country-

specific events or policy mistakes (such as Venezuela’s mishandling            of its financial crisis in

1994, or Mexico’s unflinching      exchange rate policy in 1992-93), rather than investors’ irrational

attitudes.   Hence, it was rational to view most emerging markets as similar ex ante, but specific

shocks made them dissimilar ex post, causing some of them to falter on their path to reform.

       Though both these views may contain elements of truth, neither is fully persuasive:                the

first because appeals to irrationality prove satisfying to few economists;         the second because the

evidence presented in Figure 1 (reinforced by that of Calve, Leiderman,            and Reinhart for the

recent Latin American episode) suggests that the “similarity” between many emerging markets

may have been primarily in the external situation they faced,          In this paper we argue that the

supposed indiscriminate      character of periodic inflows into emerging markets, subsequent selective

outflows, and accompanying       policy reversals, may be indicative neither of governments’         or

investors’ irrationality,   nor of (some of the) recipient countries’ bad luck. They may simply

reflect investors’ optimal response to available information:         when a common external shock

causes widespread adoption of 1iberal policies, it also reduces the information          content of the

policy itself.   Lacking information   to discriminate,     investors invest in all markets where policies

favorable to investment have been implemented,            only to discover the weak commitment       of some

countries to such policies, in the face of a subsequent adverse shock.

       Our argument can be applied to structural reform in general.           In deciding on structural


                                                      4
policies, governments      trade off costs and benefits, a trade-off that may depend on external

circumstances.     “Good” times reduce the cost of reforms and cause their widespread                 adoption;

“bad” times induce only sufficiently motivated governments            to reform.     If a favorable

environment      leads many countries to reform, investors may be unable to distinguish               governments

truly committed to reform from those likely to renege on them in less favorable times, and

conversely when the environment            is so adverse that no government    implements    reforms,      Away

from the two extremes, some--but not all--governments            will engage in structural reforms at any

given time, depending on the relevant trade-off between costs and benefits.              The evolution of this

trade-off affects the information     revealed to investors on the likely course of future policies in

different countries, and provides a channel for investment hysteresis.             This channel, the revelation

of “innate” characteristics     due to the changing external environment,         is quite separate from those

of adjustment costs or multiple equilibria emphasized in previous research.

       For concreteness,      we develop this argument in a simple model of capital controls, though

we are well aware that balance of payment reform was only one element in the package of

reforms undertaken in recent years in many developing countries.              In our model, governments’

attitudes toward capital mobility differ across countries and are imperfectly observable by

investors.    Low world interest rates induce investment into emerging markets and promote free

capital mobility, by reducing the cost of this policy,         A sufficiently low interest rate causes all

emerging countries to open their capital account, makes such policy uninformative                of host

governments’      attitudes toward free capital mobility, and causes too much capital to be invested in

countries likely to impose controls in the future.

       While our model shares many features with other signaling models, our analysis displays

the uncommon--and       crucial--feature     that the nature of the equilibrium    (in particular, whether it is

                                                          5
of a pooling or a separating type) varies over time in response to external shocks (an interest rate

shock in our case).     In our model, investors know the process driving interest rates and

incorporate potential changes in the type of equilibrium     in their investment decisions.

      The paper is organized as follows.      A simple signaling model, where investment      and capital

control policies evolve endogenously      in response to world interest rate shocks is presented in

Section 2 and solved in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the equilibrium        and the effect of

interest rate shocks.     Section 6 concludes, while the Appendix contains technical details.


                                              2. The model


      Our model extends the two-period model of capital controls of Bartolini and Drazen (1995)

to a full intertemporal    model, relying on a somewhat more general model of governments’          costs

and utility of controls, and allowing for stochastic interest rates (on which government      and

investors have the same information).       Motivated by the discussion of Section 1, the model

incorporates a link between world interest rates and capital control policies in small open

economies, and differs from previous models of capital controls in a number of respects.           First,

controls evolve endogenously       from a governmen t‘s intertemporal   choice problem in the face of

potential capital flows, rather than being imposed as an exogenous constraint.b       Second, in

contrast with the traditional symmetric modelling of controls on inflows and outflows, our model

recognizes that real-world controls are typically asymmetric:      stricter either on inflows or, more

frequently, on outflows.      By modelling external shocks as outcomes from a stochastic process,

the model allows for endogenous       switches in the type of equilibrium   realized in each period.



      b The implication of exogenous liberalizations for capital flows have, of course, been already
studied in the literature. See, for instance, Obstfeld (1986) and Bacchetta (1992).

                                                      6
The possibility that different equilibria may be realized in each period is recognized by all agents,

and is reflected in equilibria realized earlier on.

       Consider a T-period model of a small open economy, where a homogeneous                good Y, is

produced at time t with onshore capital K, using a concave technology          Y,=~( K,) that satisfies the

standard Inada conditions (other domestic factors that are internationally       immobile are normalized

to unity).   In each period, the supply of capital in the world market is perfectly elastic at the

interest rate rr. In this market, a large number of profit-maximizing,       risk-neutral   investors

allocate capital between onshore and offshore investment.       Absent adjustment costs, and assuming

capital to be liquidated at the end of period T, the returns to physical and financial capital are

equalized and we shall make no distinction between the two.

       The government     derives utility from domestic capital in each period, as described by a

concave function     W( K, ). This utility may reflect interest in residents’ utility from GDP, utility

from public expenditure financed from capital taxation, etc.7 Single-period         utility is discounted

at the rate p and also satisfies the standard Inada regularity conditions.

       Governments     differ in the cost they attach to imposing capital controls.     This heterogeneity

may reflect differences in the value attached to residents’ ability to diversify risk internationally,

different commitment     to free markets, etc. Since our results do not depend on the specific source

of this cost, but only on investors having incomplete information      about them, we model this cost

as simply as possible.    We begin by assuming that the government       assigns a one-time cost

x= (O, ~ ) to imposing controls the first time it imposes controls, and no further cost thereafter,




      7 The government’s welfare may also depend on arguments other than the stock of domestic
capital. Therefore, this welfare function is best interpreted as an indirect utility function, other
variables having been set optimally at each K,.

                                                      7
and refer to x as a government’s          type.     (The cost x does not include the reputational       cost of

controls, which is central to our analysis and is discussed explicitly below.)               The assumption of a

one-time cost can be rationalized by interpreting x as the cost of breaking an international

agreement to allow free capital mobility, the cost of face-loss, or other costs incurred when

reneging on a policy commitment            (as in Rogoff, 1987, for instance, where governments             assign a

one-time cost to breaking a commitment               to zero inflation).   In our model, this assumption plays

the role of making capital controls permanent once imposed, thereby greatly simplifying                     the

exposition, and allowing us to highlight the model’s main insight.                In a later section, however, we

discuss how the solution is modified in a more general setting.

      We model asymmetric             information     about x by assuming that only the government          is

informed about x as of time zero, while investors must infer this characteristic                   based on the

observation of actual policies and their prior cumulative probability              distribution,    G(x), over types.

      Table 1 summarizes         the timing of the model.         The initial stock KO and distribution      G(x)

describe the initial state.     At the beginning of each period, both the government                and investors are

informed of the current world interest rate r(, as drawn (independently,                for simplicity) from the

cumulative distribution       M(r).     After observing      r~, the government   announces the financial

regime prevailing in the current period.             (We use the dummy Ct to denote the regime prevailing

in period t, letting Cf=F and c1=R denote free and restricted mobility, respectively. ) If controls

are imposed at t, the end-of-period         stock of domestic capital, K,, is constrained to be at least as

large as at the beginning of the period:             K,2K,_,.8    After the period t regime has been



      g We focus exclusively on controls on capital ouflows.     Given the government’s taste for
domestic capital, there are no incentives to impose controls on inflows in this model. We also
focus on the case in which capital controls are fully effective. The tendency for capital controls
to lose effectiveness in the long run (see, for instance, Mathieson and Rojas-Su6rez, 1993, for a

                                                              8
announced, investors choose Kt accordingly,     and collect the resulting returns.9

      In the next section we solve this model recursively backward, and derive a unique

equilibrium for each period t given the solution for period t+ 1. Since the solution is somewhat

technical, however, it may be useful to summarize its intuition here.

      Consider investment and capital controls decisions in a single country.         In the final period

T, if the host government   does not impose controls, the marginal product of onshore capital is

equalized to the current world interest rate, yielding K~ =($ ’)-1(r~).   If controls are imposed,

instead, the domestic capital stock equals the larger of the unconstrained    stock and the previous

period’s stock, K~_l. Thus, the actual capital stock depends on the regime chosen by the

government for this period.   To examine this policy, first observe that a standard backward

recursion argument implies that once a government imposes controls in any period, it will

certainly impose controls until period T. 10 On the other hand, the optimal period T policy of



discussion) can be accommodated by re-writing the capital control constraint as K,> ( 1 -5) K,.,,
where 5 captures the rate at which controls can be circumvented in each period. The analysis
then remains qualitatively unchanged, as long as 8<1, i.e., as long as controls are at least
partially effective in the short run. However, a further bias toward liberalization would be
induced by the assumed leakiness of controls. In the limit, as 5 + 1, controls become fully
ineffective, and all incentives to impose them vanish.
     9 For simplicity, we abstract from other policies often undertaken in conjunction with capital
controls, policies that usually include taxation of domestic capital, interest rate ceilings, and other
forms of “financial repression” that penalize foreign investors in addition to capital controls (see
Giovannini and De Melo, 1993, for a discussion, as well as for evidence in support of the joint
use of capital controls and financial repression in developing countries). As in B artolini and
Drazen (1995), these motives could be captured by allowing the host government to levy a tax on
onshore capital, assuming that tax revenues are transformed into public expenditure, and letting
government’s utility be increasing in the supply of public goods.

      10Since a government that has already imposed controls faces no further cost from doing so
again at T, itcertainly imposes controls at T, thereby maximizing K~ at no cost. But this implies
that no cost would be incurred also at T-1, if controls have been already imposed in the past:
neither a direct nor a reputational cost (since the government is already known to use controls for
sure at ~. Then controls are always imposed at T-1, and so on, recursively backward.

controls (yielding     W( K~ IF) ). Hence, i~= W{K~_l) - W( (~’)-]( VT)). Governments      with cost x <i~

impose controls, those with cost X22T allow free mobility of capital, unless they have imposed

controls in a previous period, in which case they impose controls also at T.

          The equilibrium    in periods t<T has similar properties.   In comparing onshore and offshore

returns, however, investors must consider the likelihood that controls may be imposed in the

future.     If controls have been observed in the past, this likelihood is, trivially, equal to one. If,

instead, free capital mobility has prevailed until t, the likelihood of future controls depends on the

residual uncertainty over government types, as summarized by the range of “possible” types,

those that may have carried out a policy of free capital mobility before t. This range evolves, as

specified below, as a function of the external macroeconomic          environment.

          The government’s     optimal policy in period t is also similar to that for period T, and is

summarized by the cut-off type f~ that is indifferent between imposing and not imposing controls

at t,conditional on it not having previously imposed controls.          Types x below the cut-off type

impose controls at t and thereafter;       types above the cut-off type impose controls at t only if they

have already imposed controls in the past.

          In equilibrium,   and focussing on the case where the commitment      to free mobility has not

yet been reneged upon, the set of “possible” types (those who have not yet imposed controls at t)

evolves as a function of world interest rates.       In each period, investors compare the cut-off type

it to the current possible set [~t, ~ ], and update this set based on the observed policy.        If

controls are imposed, they will be in place forever after, and there is no more updating of

information.      If controls are not imposed, then this policy reveals that x >i~, and the posterior


                                                        10
possible set becomes    [x = max {i, ,~f, ~].    Interestingly,   if the cut-off point falls below the
                         —1+1

possible set of types (i(<~,),    then no possible type imposes controls at t : the equilibrium          is of a

pooling type, and a policy of free capital mobility is uninformative.          Similarly in subsequent

periods.

       The evolution of the economy may also be described in terms of the path of interest rates.

Suppose free mobility has prevailed in the host country in all previous periods.           Define by

?l =?t(K,_l ,Zl) the interest rate at which the worst possible type at time t,Z[, is indifferent

between imposing and not imposing controls in this period, given Kt_l and the history of previous

policies (summarized    by z,).   For r,<?,, no possible type would impose controls, and a policy of

free capital mobility is uninformative.     For r,>?,, types x below the cut-off f, impose controls,

while types exceeding this cut-off do not: only interest rates in this range allow investors to use

the observed policy to refine their knowledge of the government faced in the host country.

       We now proceed to derive these properties more precisely in the next section.


                                           3. Technical Solution


       The model can be solved recursively backward, beginning with a closed-form              solution for

period T. We focus directly on market equilibrium conditions,          and obtain a unique equilibrium

for each period t given the solution for period t+ 1. We adopt a standard equilibrium            concept,

that of Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium,      which requires each agent’s choice to be optimal given his

beliefs and other agents’ actions and beliefs, and that beliefs be updated in each period according

to Bayes’ rule, whenever this applies (i.e., whenever the probability of the conditioning          event is

not zero).   (See Persson and Tabellini,    1990, for a detailed discussion,     also in relation to other

equilibrium concepts adopted in the macroeconomic         signaling literature. )

                                                     11
3.1. Period T: Investors’ Policy.         With free capital mobility, profit maximization           equalizes the

marginal returns from offshore and onshore investment at T. These are given by R~= 1+ VT,and

VT=1+~’ ( K~), respectively,     which include principal and scrap value of a unit of capital at the
                                                                  1
end of the period.      Discounting   returns at the rate               the stock of capital invested onshore is
                                                             ~’
K;( r~)s(~’)-l( r~), decreasing in r~ due to the concavity of ~(.).

      If capital controls are in place at T, instead, investors may be unable to attain the profit-

maximizing       solution, as the domestic stock of capital must satisfy the constraint          K~ > K~_l. For

r~ <~’ (K~_l), controls are not binding, and the unconstrained              solution prevails;   for r~ >~’ ( K~_l),

instead, controls are binding, and the corner solution K~ =K~_~ prevails.


3.2. Period T: Government’s           Policy.   The government’s         optimal policy can be studied by

characterizing     the trigger type ~1=~~( K~_,, r~) that is just indifferent between imposing and not

imposing controls at T when VT>~’ (K~_[), conditional on having not previously imposed controls.

i~ is the unique solution for x of the equation



                           PIW’(KTICT=R) ‘x -       W(KTIF)]= 0> ~T>f’(~T_,) ,                                      (1)


where, recall, p is the government’s       discount factor.       Equation ( 1) implies



                                  ~T(~T_l
                                       !~~) = w(~,-,)             -   w((f’)-’(~T))~                                (2)


      The trigger f~ =~~( K~_l,r~) is a continuous and increasing function of K~_, and rT, and

governments       imposing capital controls are those for which x <IT.            These are intuitive properties:

with a sufficient] y high offshore rate, free capital mobility would lead to a capital outflow, thus

tempting the government to impose controls.           This temptation is stronger the larger is the amount



                                                        12
of capital K~_l–K;( r~) that can be potentially trapped onshore, and, therefore, the higher are

either K~_l or r~. Free capital mobility prevails when the cost of imposing controls x is

sufficiently high to outweigh the utility gain from trapping capital onshore.

      The nature of the equilibrium     in period T then depends on policies realized up to time T.

As noted above, if capital controls have been imposed at any time prior to T, they are also

imposed at T, irrespective of the specific value of f~:       there is no further cost in imposing

controls at T, but this policy maximizes the period T capital stock when VT>f’ ( KT_,). (Without

loss of generality, we assume that when indifferent between imposing and not imposing controls,

governments   maintain the policy chosen in the previous period).

      If free capital mobility has prevailed until T, instead, the form of the equilibrium        depends

on the relationship between i~ and the set of types that may have chosen such policy, given the

observed path of world interest rates.    As we shall see shortly, this set has the form of an interval

[~T, ~].   Accordingly,   if i,<~~,   a pooling equilibrium    without controls prevails:   the world

interest rate is not sufficiently high to trigger a capital outflow sufficient to justify controls, even

for the lowest possible type, ~~. If 1~ >~~, instead, then a separating equilibrium         prevails:   types

in the range [~~,~~) impose controls;      types in the range [i~, ~] allow free capital mobility.

      Equilibria in periods t<T will exhibit very similar properties, with the added feature that

separating equilibria allow investors to truncate a set of types from the current possible set.


3.3. Period t equilibrium.     In each period t,investors compute the expected returns from onshore

investment by considering     the likelihood that capital controls may be imposed in the future.        If

controls are in place in period t, they will certainly be in place in the future as well.       If controls

are not in place at t,instead, the likelihood of future controls depends on investors’ current



                                                     13
beliefs over government     types.    These beliefs are fully summarized by the set of types that are

possible at time t,i.e., those types that may have allowed free mobility until t. Our first task,

accomplished   by Proposition       1, is to show that this set is described by a range [x_t, ~], the

convexity of which reflects the trigger nature of government policies in each period.            In order to

prove Proposition     1, we must first set up the government’s      problem in period t.

      Consider type x’s decision at t,and denote its utility from pursuing the policy C[= (F, R }

as
                                                                         T

                w,(~1_,1~t)c,7_f
                          x ,x) = E,~ p“-’+l~(K,, Ic,)             - E1~ p“-’+’~ I(K,, I c,) ,                 (3)
                                     ,y=~                              ,f=f


where I(.) is an indicator function that takes the value of one the first time controls are imposed,

and zero otherwise;     and the expectations     are taken over {rl+l, .,. , r~ } and over the corresponding

contingent strategies chosen by x at every node.

      The choice of a government x that has not previously imposed controls is whether or not to

impose controls in the current period t,given K,_l, i-r, and ~L. Type x’s gain from reneging at

time t on its commitment     to free capital mobility, rather than postponing      any such decision to a

future period, is

                             v,(~(_, ,~,,c, =R,z,,x) - vl(~,_i,
                                                              ~,,ct=F,z,,x)                                    (4)


      Type x imposes controls for the first time, in the first period for which this difference

becomes positive.     Proposition     1 shows that if a type x chooses not to impose controls at t,then

every higher type would do the same:


Proposition    1: If type x‘ does not impose controls at t,neither does any type x” >X’.


      Proposition     1 (whose proof is in Appendix) is intuitive:      if x‘ chooses to postpone the time



                                                        14
it first imposes controls, so would x” , whose cost-saving from such postponement                     is higher, and

direct utility gain is at least as large.    Proposition      1 allows us to summarize governments’           policy

in each period by a trigger rule, whereby types lower than a cut-off il =fl ( K~_l,r[,~[) impose

controls at t, if they have not previously imposed controls, while types exceeding                 i, do not,

unless they have previously        imposed controls.    The cut-off type i, is defined as the lowest type

not to impose controls at t. Being indifferent between imposing and not imposing controls at t,

~, satisfies W1(Kl_l,rl)R,z~,f,)     - VI(K,-l irf,F,zf,~,)     =0, identically.

      To solve investors’ problem, first note that the expected marginal return from investing

offshore at t,denoted by R[, includes the current interest rate rl, as well as the discounted
                                                                        yf+Ef
                                                                           R(+l
                                                                           [1

      Based on the trigger nature of government policies implied by Proposition                   1, we can

formalize investors’ inference problem by means of a conditional                distribution   G (x Ic, ,i, ,3,)

cumulated over types up to the unique cut-off for period t+ 1, i,+l.               The expected marginal return

from investing onshore in period t, V,, can then be expressed as a function of current returns and

a continuation   value function for period t+ 1 returns, as

       In (5), the cumulative distribution         G(f,+[ Icl ,il ,3,) is the probability   of controls in period

t+l conditional on policies observed up to period t. Clearly, if c,= R, then G (i,+, Ic, =R ,if,~t)

equals one: as soon as controls are imposed, the type is revealed to lie in the range [~,, i,),                   and

the likelihood of controls in all subsequent periods becomes unity.

       The case where c, =F is more interesting for our purposes.                 If 1,<~, (that is, if all possible

types allow free capital mobility at t), then the distribution           G (2,+1Ic, =F, i, ,~1) conditional on no

controls before period t,collapses into the distribution            G (f[+, Icl_~=F ,f[_l ,~f_l) conditional on no

controls before period t-1. (For period one, this is the unconditional               distribution    G(.).)

       If f,>~(,   instead, the probability       of Cl+l=R is obtained by Bayes’ rule as

(Recall that viewed from period t, if+, is a random variable that depends on the yet unknown

r,+,.) Furthermore,     since the choice c, =F reveals the true type to lie in the range [if, ~ ], then

x_,+l=21 in (6): the distribution         G(fl+l Ic~,i~,3 ) and the cut-off x evolve as a function of r~, as

investors truncate from the “possible” set, types that could not have chosen the observed policy,

      Now denote by K,*(V,,c, ,i, ,1,) the (unconstrained)            profit-maximizing      capital stock, defined

as the solution for K~ of




       Given either ct=F or CI=R, V, is a continuous function of K( and r,, going from infinity

for Kf+ O to zero for K,+ 00. It is also apparent from (5) and (6) that if i,+, is increasing in K,

(which is true for t= T, and is shown to be true at t,recursively, in Proposition                   2) then R[ -V, is



                                                           16
increasing in Kr. Therefore, (7) yields a unique solution for the unconstrained           profit-maximizing

capital stock, Kt”(r[, ct, fl, ~t), and Proposition   2 holds (proof is in the Appendix):


Proposition     2: f, is increasing in K,_l and in r,.


      Propositions     1 and 2 have an important corollary:      (z,, 2,] may be empty, that is, there may

be interest rates r, so low, that no possible type switches from free mobility to controls at t. To

see this, define by ?,= it( K,.l ,z, ) the interest rate that satisfies Vf(K,_l, ~1,R ,Zf,Zl) -

wf(~[-,l~t> F,~t,~l)   -0   identically. ” At f,, the worst possible type at time t, x—1‘ is indifferent

between imposing and not imposing controls, given K,.l.            At ?, and at lower rates, no

government that had not previously imposed controls would impose controls.                Thus, for r,< ?[,

the policy observed in period t does not help investors refine their knowledge of government

types and, hence, their forecast of future returns to investment.

       Equations (5) and (7) also imply that any rise in G(2,+l ( K,, rt+l) Ic, ,i,,~,)     (that is, any

increase in the conditional probability of low government types) reduces the expected returns to

K, and hence K,* itself (formally, K,”( r,, F ,ff,~,) > K(”(r,, R ,2, ,3,) ). Combined with Proposition       1

and with the effect of capital controls on investors’ ability to withdraw capital from the host

country, this implies that K,= K,. ~ with controls, and Kf = K,*( rf, c1=F ,i[ ,~t) with free capital

mobility.     Indeed, for il > x controls must be binding at t (that is, Kf= K(.l ): no government
                               —f‘

would renege on its commitment        to free capital mobility unless controls are binding.        Imposing

controls implies a direct cost x and, by Proposition        1, (5), and (7), also a reputational   cost of

revealing the government to be of a type lower than ft



     11The properties of V,, noted above, and the assumed regularity of W(. ) assure that ?, is a
well defined interest rate between O and ~.

                                                       17
      Finally, note that as long as the probability of controls at t +1, G(i,+l(K, ,rf+l) Ic, ,f[ ,Z[), is

greater than zero, then Equation (5) incorporates       a “political premium” which compensates

investors for the possibility    of future controls.   This premium arises because with capital controls

and high realizations of rl, the return to investing onshore would fall below the expected return

to investing offshore.    In order to offset this potential loss (i.e., in order to equalize the present

discounted streams of expected returns R, and V,), risk-neutral         investors require the current

return to onshore investment, f‘ ( Kf ), to exceed the current return to offshore investment,         rr,

before investing onshore.       Thus, as long as G(fl+l(K,,r,+l) lc[,ff,~f)>O,   then


J(
r,.,
     R,+l-Vl+l(K1,rf+l,R))d M(rf+l) >0    and Equations (5) and (7) imply that f ‘( K[)>r, for c1=F.

The wedge f‘ ( K,) -r, is our model’s analog of the “political” premium identified empirically by

Dooley and Isard (1980) and subsequent related studies.


           4. Learning from Observed Policies and the Effect of Interest Rate Shocks


      The model’s equilibrium        in period t,illustrated in Figure 2, can be summarized      as follows.

In each period following a history of free capital mobility, world interest rates can take values

over two ranges, which depend on the policy history and on the existing capital stock:             a low

range r,< f[, where all possible Vpes of governments         (i.e., those types whose cost of controls is

consistent with not having imposed controls up to period t) allow unrestricted          capital flows;      and,

a high range rf> ?f, where low x types impose controls (thereby trapping K,.]- K,”( r,, R, 2,,3, )),

while high x types allow free capital mobility.        Only for these interest rates is the observation of

policies informative,    in that it allows investors to refine their perception of government types, and

hence improve their forecast of future policies and returns to investment.          This split of interest

rates into “high” and “low” ranges has interesting implications         for policies and investment in

                                                        18
individual countries, and for the efficiency of capital allocation acrosx countries.       We begin by

discussing the former.

      Figure 2 plots the inherited capital stock, K,.l, and the desired capital stock in period t as a

function of the world interest rate r,, both with free and restricted capital mobility.         The desired

stock conditional on free mobility, Kl*(rf, F, 2[ ,~t), lies above its restricted mobility counterpart,

K,*(r,, R ,if ,~1), for each r, in the range of interest rates [?,, ~ ] that supports a separating

equilibrium,   This wedge reflects the discrete upward revision in investors’ beliefs over

government types, triggered by the observation of free capital mobility in period t (which allows

investors to truncate the set of possible types to the range [fl, ~ ] ), and the associated revision in

expected returns to K,.   Conversely in response to the imposition of controls.

      Note that the existing stock K,_l intersects the free-mobility       curve at rl”, to the left of ?(:

no government imposes controls unless they are strictly binding.        In fact, there are two reasons

why rfo< ;t. First, capital controls entail a cost x> O: prospective       outflows must then exceed a

minimum amount, before a government         decides to incur their cost.     A signaling motive associated

to investors’ incomplete information    over governments     also contributes to r 0<;,:     it is to a

government’s   advantage to tolerate a larger outflow of capital than with common knowledge of

its type, so as to provide to investors more favorable information on future business conditions in

the host country.   Thus, some governments      allow free capital mobility in situations where they

would have imposed controls had their type been known to investors, to mimic better types and

signal their difference from worse types.     Incomplete information       about governments’     attitudes

toward capital controls provides a bias toward liberal capital markets. 12



     12A formal argument for this signaling result could be given. We omit details, however, as
our focus is on the evolution of information on future policies over time, rather than on policy

                                                     19
      Consider now the effects of an interest rate in the “separating” range r,>?,.           If the host

government liberalizes capital flows, an outflow K,.l -Kf”( V,,F ,it,~,)       occurs at t. With capital

controls, instead, an amount K,_l–Kl”(rl, R ,i, ,~~) of capital is trapped onshore, as K, =K1_l. In

this case, however, the separating nature of the equilibrium         allows investors to sharpen their

knowledge of the host government,          by restricting its possible type to the range [~t ,~, ] in the case

of controls, and to the range [if, ~ ] in the case of free mobility.        In the former case, the

probability of future controls conditional      on c1=R rises (to unity, in our simple model) with

respect to its prior probability,     while the probability of future controls conditional   on c,= F falls.

By allowing free capital mobility, governments         in the range [f,, ~ ] can build their reputation for

aversion to capital controls.       This signal is costly in the current period (a capital outflow must be

tolerated), but it raises the desired capital stock in each future period, allowing capital inflows in

states where capital outflows would have otherwise occurred.’s

      What happens, instead, when the interest rate r, is lower than f,? Now all possible types

allow free capital mobility, and capital flows equal Kf*( rf, F ,it, It ) - K1_, (positive when i-l<rt”,

and negative when r~o<rl< ?l). No information on future policies is revealed to investors. ‘q

      This solution has implications        for the pattern of capital flows across countries in response




biases at any given time. Bartolini and Drazen (1995) further discuss these issues, though in the
context of a model with a different information structure,

      ‘3 Specifically, in each period t,K,”(r,,F ,~1,~ ) is higher than it would have been with
controls replacing no controls in any previous peri~d.

     14Viewing the existence of separating and pooling equilibria in terms of high and low values
of r, suggests a formalization of the notion that “tough” (that is, high r[) times may benefit
“tough” (that is, high x) types, by allowing these to separate themselves from weak types. The
idea that information about future policies conveyed by current policies may depend on both the
degree of uncertainty about a policy maker’s type and the circumstances in which he finds himself
was suggested by Drazen and Masson (1994).

to interest rate shocks.      Consider a world with two groups of economies:         a large number of

“emerging markets”, i,e., small economies of the type described in Section 2, and the “rest of the

world”, where the supply of capital is elastic at the rate rf in each period.        Suppose, for the

moment, that all emerging markets are identical at the beginning of period t-1. (That is, let all of

them be characterized       by the same production technology,      same prior distribution   G(x)     for

government types, and same history of policies up to period t-1.) Under these assumptions,                   each

country is exactly described by the model of Section 2, and the critical value of ?f_, is the same

for all countries.     For illustration,   consider the case of a period t (the present) where the world

interest rate is sufficiently low to spur a large inflow of capital into all emerging markets, thereby

supporting a policy of widespread free capital mobility (i.e., rl < ?~). In this period, investors have

the opportunity to allocate capital for maximum returns in period t+ 1 and onward (the ~utuve), in

light of events observed up to period t-1 (the past).

       Consider the impact of past interest rates on current investment,         beginning with the case of

a “low” rate at t-1,which we take as a stylized description of industrial countries’ (mainly the

U. S,’ ) interest rates in the late 1980s and, to an even greater extent, in the late 1970s.         The upper

panel of Figure 3 gives an example of this pattern.           (For simplicity, but with no relevance for our

discussion, the figure displays Fl_l, ?,, and ;,+l as if these were the same),

       If r,_lS ?,_l and r,<?,, then all countries allow free capital mobility at both t-1 and t, and

(since all countries are identical a priori) receive the same investment flow at t,despite the

underlying--but      unobservable--difference     in x and in the likelihood of future controls:     all-round

liberalization    at t-1 has destroyed the information content of the observed policy.        For this

outcome to obtain, investors need not believe the interest rate shock, nor the policy of free

mobility, to be permanent.         They know that a sufficiently high future interest rate will induce

                                                         21
some countries to impose controls.

       What happens if, indeed, the future interest rate, r,+,, rises to above ;,+l ? First, the profit-

maximizing     stock of onshore capital falls, causing a desired outflow of capital from all emerging

markets.    Second, countries whose government           assigns a relatively low cost to abandoning free

capital mobility, impose controls on outflows.           As a result, investors are trapped in some

countries, earning a low rate of return.         In our example, an amount of capital equal to

Kt*(rt, F, f,,~t)-Kf;l(r,+i,     R ,1,+1,~f+l) is trapped in countries with controls at t+l.   Ex post, the

world’s allocation of capital is inefficient.        In fact, this allocation is more inefficient (in the sense

that a larger amount of capital is trapped in countries with controls) than it would be, had a

separating equilibrium         prevailed at t-1, a point that we now illustrate.

       Consider an alternative interest rate path, where the interest rate at t-1, r,_l, exceeds ?,_l,

and the rates at t and t+ 1 remain the same as before (the bottom panel of Figure 3 illustrates this

case) .15 In this case, some governments          impose controls at t-1, thus allowing investors to refine

their prior information        over government types:     investors recognize types imposing controls as

belonging to the range [x_l_l ,~t-l ), and those allowing free capital mobility as belonging to the

range [f,.,, CO]. When interest rates fall at t,high x countries are rewarded with larger

investment at t than they would have been in our previous example, as their type as been

narrowed to a smaller range [~,, ~ ]. Low x countries, their attempt to mimic higher types

having been foiled at t-1, share to a smaller extent (or not at all) in the investment boom. ‘b


     15Strictly speaking, because ?, depends on r,.,, we need r, to be lower than the ?r realized
on both paths, and r,+, to be higher than the ?[+l realized on both paths for our illustrative
discussion to remain valid.

      16The extent of the fall in r, determines whether low-x countries share in the investment
boom. The assumed concavity of the onshore production function ~( Kf), in particular, implies
that it is not optimal to direct all new flows to high-x countries for sufficiently low rates r,.

                                                          22
When interest rates rise at t+ 1, an amount of capital Kl”(rf, R ,i, ,~f) -K,~l(rl+l, R ,fl+l,z[+i) (smaller

than in the previous example, possibly nil), is trapped in low x countries.          More capital

(reflecting the higher cut-off ~,+1 overcome by these types) is invested in high x countries.             Thus,

for a given rl, a period t-1 interest rate above ?(_l, enhances investors’ ability to allocate capital

efficiently at t,by investing less in low x countries and more in high x countries than when

rt_l<i,_l      No adjustment costs are needed for this information-based       hysteresis property,

          Similar results would hold in a more general model where emerging markets differ by

production technology,      prior distribution   of x, or policy history,   Countries endowed with more

productive technologies      would clearly attract more capital.     The world interest rate that supports

free capital mobility by all types would be country-specific,         and the actual interest rate would

have to be below the minimum of these for all countries to allow free capital mobility.               If the

prior distribution    of types or policy history differs across countries, the analysis is similar and

yields the country-specific      triggers i, and ?(. Even if the interest rate in each period is so low

that no country restricts capital movements,        more capital is invested in countries whose prior

distribution    lies, roughly speaking, further to the right, as future controls are less likely in these

countries.     A sufficiently low world interest rate would cause all emerging markets to experience

an inflow, with more capital being attracted to countries perceived as more averse to controls.


                                 5. More general specifications     of the model


          A crucial assumption    of the model that we have discussed is that imposing capital controls

involves a one-time cost, an assumption which implies that controls, once imposed, are never

lifted.    This prediction is similar to that of many monetary games in the literature, where

uncertainty about government        taste for output and inflation causes some governments       to choose

                                                        23
zero inflation up to a certain time, only to revert to positive inflation forever after. Certainly, in

the case of capital controls, this prediction is unrealistic.

       Our motivation for choosing a simple cost structure was tractability and transparency               of

results.   When a cost is incurred whenever controls are in place, the government’s            strategy space

become too rich to permit a simple description of policies and of their response to shocks.

Governments     attaching higher costs to controls, for instance, may (counter-intuitively)        impose

controls earlier than low-cost governments,          for the cost of discouraging   investment early on, is

offset by a reduced frequency of controls in the long run. In general, the properties of policies

and investment become difficult to study, given the scope for complicated             sequences of periods

with and without controls, unless one commits to simple functional forms for W(.), ~(.), G(.), and

M(.) or to other simplifying       assumptions,     One can still show that ve~ low world interest rates

would cause all possible governments         to liberalize at any given time, thereby destroying the

information content of a liberalization.          At the opposite end, and as a more interesting implication

of the more general model, ve~ high interest rates would cause all possible governments               to

impose controls, thereby equally destroying the information content of the observed policy.

Nevertheless,   the more general model becomes almost untractable for intermediate             interest rates,

and multiple equilibria (among other complications)            become possible for this range of rates.

       One approach to addressing the unrealistic policies implied by our model, while retaining

its tractability, is as follows.    In every period up to time T, a government       faces a probability u of

being terminated (like a Blanchard-type           consumer faces a positive probability   of dying in each

period) and of being replaced by another government drawn from the set [~,;].                 A change in

governments     is common knowledge, but the new value of x is not, as in our basic model.              Thus,

when a new government        takes office, its choice problem and investors’ inference problem begin

                                                          24
anew. In particular, a new government faces the same problem faced at time zero in our basic

model, and allows free capital mobility for sufficiently low interest rates or a sufficiently high x.

       The formal structure of the extended model is very similar to that of our basic model.              The

solution for period T remains identical, while the government’s      problem at t< T is modified only

by replacing the discount factor p with (1 -a) p.       Investors’ inference problem becomes only

slightly more difficult:    the set of possible types in power is still truncated to [max {ir,~l },~ ] in

response to a policy of free capital mobility, but a probability    a is attached to a new government

coming to office and to the set of possible types being reset to [~,;].       Thus capital controls need

not last forever, when imposed, but only until the next switch of government. 17 The marginal

return to onshore investment should also reflect the possibility of government turnover, as in


                                      E,[R,+I]

V,(K1, r,, ct,it,~l)   = f’(K1)   +

       Propositions    1 and 2 hold unchanged in the extended model, and its qualitative properties,

conditional    on current governments     remaining in oflice, also remain unchanged.       In fact, the

dependence of investment on the history of world interest rates persists beyond governments’

lifetimes, via the stock of capital bequeathed from one government        to the next. 18




      17In fact, government “changes” might be viewed, more broadly, as credible breaks with old
policies, breaks often pursued by finance ministers at the onset of liberalization programs.
Naturally, this broader interpretation should address the issue of what makes these policy breaks
credible.

     ‘EIn an even more general model, the probability of survival 1-a would be itself endogenous
to policies. In practice, we would expect the imposition of capital controls to have secondary and
ambiguous effects on governments’ survival, as capital controls typically harm the interest of
some constituencies (e.g., investors) while benefiting those of others (e.g,, wage-earners).

                                                       25
       Despite its somewhat ad hoc flavor, this extension does capture some interesting features of

an extended model with government       turn-over.     It also highlights an important requirement for

our model’s insight to emerge:     some amount of persistence in government          types is necessary for

information acquisition to matter at all in our model.       In general, the faster is governments’      turn-

over, the less relevant are observed policies to signal the course of future policies, while

governments become less concerned with the adverse information           impact of imposing capital

controls.   In the limit, if a= 1, then governments    last for only one period;    expected returns to

onshore investment    and the allocation of capital across countries become independent         of past

policies;   and governments’    decision problem collapses into a myopic one-shot problem.

Although lack of a closed-form     solution when u>O prevents explicit comparative         statics analysis,

the vanishing of “bad-signal”    effects as u+   1 (that is, the vanishing of G(~,+l(K,,rf+l ) IC,,f,,3,)

from Equation (8)), suggests that governments         with shorter horizon should be more likely to

abandon free capital mobility than governments         with a longer horizon.

       Another approach to generalizing the basic model and incorporate more realistic costs of

capital controls, would be to simplify drastically the state space for government         types, for

example, to two types, as is common in macroeconomic            signaling models.    Further assuming one

of these two types to be a “hard-nosed”     government irrevocably committed         to free capital

mobility (see B arro, 1986, and Backus and Driffill, 1985, for the equivalent assumption           in the

context of monetary policy games), x can take two values, x= {~, ~ ], with probabilities               G and

1-G, respectively,   instead of all values in the interval [~, m ]. A payoff to this simplification         is

that we can let the cost of controls, x, to be incurred every time controls are imposed, while still

obtaining a tractable model.     Though we omit details, it is clear that until capital controls are

imposed for the first time, investors face essentially the same inference problem as in our basic

                                                       26
model.     Investment still displays information-based     hysteresis and, since low x types always face

a meaningful trade-off between controls and free capital mobility, this model produces a more

realistic pattern of capital controls, with controls imposed and lifted in response to changes in

world interest rates.     The main cost of this simplification   would be reversion to full information

as soon as controls are imposed for the first time (for this policy identifies the government          as a

low x type).     In reality, however, one would not expect a government       to last forever, and a

combination     of this and the previous model is likely to provide a reasonable characterization        of

actual policies.    In spite of the difficulty of obtaining stronger results in a model that is both

general and tractable, the insight that very favorable and very adverse external environments

should make observed policies less informative of future policies (in that all governments            tend to

act uniformly in these circumstances),      seems a robust one.


                                          6. Concluding    Remarks


         Recent developments     in capital flows from industrial to developing countries and in

policies affecting international    capital mobility, confirm a pattern emerged in recent decades,

whereby liberal policies in developing countries have been implemented          mainly during periods of

low interest rates in industrial countries and large capital flows toward developing countries, and

vice versa.    In this paper we have presented a simple model of endogenous         capital account

policies to help rationalize these developments,      and contribute to our understanding   of the link

between liberalizations      and capital flows.

         Analytically,   our main results concern the link between the nature of the model’s

equilibrium     and external shocks, taken here to be a world interest rate shock:     “low” world

interest rates support capital flows toward emerging markets and an equilibrium          where all these

                                                      27
countries allow free capital mobility;     “high” interest rates support an equilibrium     where countries

with governments highly committed to liberal policies distinguish themselves by allowing free

capital mobility, while countries with less committed governments           trap capital onshore by

imposing controls on capital outflows.      In equilibrium,   information   on the likely course of future

policies revealed to investors reflects the path of world interest rates:      a period of low interest

rates in industrial countries supports widespread adoption of free capital mobility, but prevents

investors from discriminating   among different policy environments.          Should interest rates later

rise, investors may find themselves      as having invested too much in countries that were not truly

committed to free capital mobility.      This outcome is consistent with investors’ recognizing the

potential temporariness   of external shocks and policies.

      To sharpen our analysis, we focussed on a specific source of political risk: the imposition

of restrictions on capital mobility in the wake of adverse external shocks.         Though many would

view capital controls as a primary source of political risk for international       investors, we view our

study only as a tackle to a more general issue:      the link between the information content of

structural reform and the macroeconomic        environment.    We feel, in particular, that our model’s

insight should extend beyond the case of capital controls, to situations where governments              can

undertake a variety of reforms, and have access to multiple signals of commitment             to such

reforms.   When governments     have private information      on their utility from reform, and the cost

of reform depends on the external environment,        good times are likely to reduce these costs, lead

to widespread reform, and diminish these policies’ usefulness as signals of future policies;            bad

times are likely to lead to policy reversal, and to investors’ regretting prior investment decisions.

         Now note that K,.l affects v,(R)                -w,(F)    directly (and positively) through K,_l in W[(R),

and indirectly (and ambiguous y) through the effects of K1* on 2,+1 and K[+,,... ,K~ in Vt ( R ) and

and evaluate the results at K~_,. The terms involving                      —     vanish, since _     –—      -0 at

                                                                    ai,

whereas all types would switch to controls when K[_l~~.

          The proof that —>0              is similar.     We need only look at values of rf with binding controls.
