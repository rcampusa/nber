Does Labor Supply Matter During a Recession? Evidence from the Seasonal Cycle

JEL No. C32,E12,E24,E32

                                              ABSTRACT

Every year has large demand and supply shifts associated with the seasons, regardless of the phase
of the business cycle. Based on measures dating back to the 1940s, the seasonal shifts reject the hypotheses
that demand shifts affect employment outcomes significantly more in recession years than in non-recession
years, and that supply shifts matter significantly less (if at all) in the recession years. My results are
consistent with the hypothesis that recessions are characterized by labor market distortions that are
neither alleviated by additional labor demand nor exacerbated by additional labor supply.

           During the recession of 2008-9, the federal government took a number of steps to
help citizens and the economy, including expansion of food stamps and unemployment
insurance, helping financially distressed homeowners refinance their mortgages, and
offering tax credits to poor and middle class persons buying homes. The stimulus
potential from these and other programs is said to derive from their redistribution of
resources to persons with a high propensity to spend, but the same programs also
implicitly raise marginal income tax rates because eligibility for them falls with the
potential recipient’s income.2
           High marginal income tax rates by themselves “normally” reduce economic
activity to some degree, rather than increase it, although there is plenty of room to debate
the magnitude of incentive effects. For the same reason, social safety net programs are
not expected to increase employment in the long run. But a number of economists
believe that recessions are those rare instances when labor supply does not matter, and
might even affect the aggregates in the opposite direction as usual (Eggertsson, 2010a).
Thus, it is possible that government spending programs like unemployment insurance
could stimulate economic activity during a recession, even while they eroded labor
supply incentives, and even while those programs had very different effects in non-
recession years.
           The hypothesis that, as compared to non-recession years, demand matters more
and supply matters less for determining aggregate employment and output at the margin
in a recession is also the intellectual basis for Keynesian models of the business cycle
(Eggertsson, 2010b, p. 2). Yet this hypothesis has not been the subject of much empirical

testing,3 even though it is logically possible that supply matters at the margin just as
much during times of severe labor market distortions as it does “normally.” The purpose
of this paper is to examine the seasonals in the monthly U.S. data dating back to the
1940s to attempt to measure the degree to which labor supply and demand differentially
affect employment and unemployment during recession periods than during non-
recession periods.
         The seasonal cycle has several analytical advantages. As Jeffrey Miron (1996, p.
17) explains, “The seasonal fluctuations are so large and regular that the timing of the
peak or trough for any year is rarely affected by the phase of the business cycle in which
that year happens to fall.” For example, Barksy and Miron (1989, Table 2) found that
GNP falls 8 percent more than normal from Q4 to Q1. In a $14 trillion/year ($3.5
trillion/quarter) economy: that’s a sudden reduction of $280 billion, which is a larger
change than even the largest year-to-year change in government spending created by the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Congressional Budget Office, 2009,
Table 2), and larger than other peacetime government spending shocks (Alesina and
Ardagna, 2009; Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2010; Barro and Redlick, 2009).
         Many economic fluctuations are not easily partitioned into “demand” or “supply,”
but the seasonal cycle features an obvious demand change – Christmas – and an obvious
supply change – the availability of teenagers for work during the summer.4 Moreover,
these two seasonal impulses (measured as percentage changes from the previous and
subsequent seasons – more on this below) react little to the business cycle, and thus
provide the opportunity to measure different effects between recessions and non-
recessions of a similar impulse. Finally, the seasonal cycles have occurred many times:
there have been 12 summers and 12 Christmas’ during U.S. recessions since 1948. Even
during the present recession – arguably different from many of the previous ones –

  Jurajda and Tannery (2003) find that unemployment insurance affects individual behavior to about the
same degree in depressed localities as in less depressed ones, but it is possible that individuals who remain
unemployed as the result of unemployed insurance are replaced by other workers differently in recessions
than in non-recession years (i.e., labor supply may shift the same in recessions and nonrecessions, but the
aggregate employment impact is different). A couple of papers (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2010;
Barro and Redlick, 2009) have examined whether fiscal policy multipliers are greater during recessions,
which are indirectly tests of whether labor demand matters more during recessions (Mulligan, 2010).

                                                                                                            2
Christmas and summer each occurred at least twice (depending on when the recession is
deemed to have ended).
        Previous work on the seasonal cycle has featured quarterly data, which had the
advantage that the Bureau of Economic Analysis used to report seasonally unadjusted
quarterly national accounts. However, unlike the labor market series used in this paper
for which the raw data are seasonally unadjusted, much of the national accounts are built
from seasonally adjusted inputs, and seasonally “unadjusted” national account series
were obtained by attempting to remove the seasonally adjustments that had been
implicitly introduced via the ingredients.5 More important, the supply and demand shifts
of interest here do not coincide exactly with calendar quarters. The seasonal labor supply
surge is seen already in June, which is part of the second quarter, and concludes in
September, which is at the end of the third quarter.                    Obviously, Christmas is in
December, and some of its activity spills into November, both of which are part of the
fourth quarter, but the monthly data permit me to use October as a benchmark for
Christmas, rather than the third quarter which would differ from the fourth not only in
terms of Christmas demand but also in terms of summer labor supply.
        Section I takes for granted that recessions are appropriately characterized as times
of severe labor market malfunctions, and briefly shows that a couple of familiar theories
predict that labor demand matters significantly more at the margin, and labor supply
matters significantly less, during recessions than during non-recession years. However,
other theories of labor market distortions predict that the incidence of supply and demand
shifts would be no different during recessions than they would be during non-recessions,
so these incidence questions must ultimately be answered with empirical evidence.
        Section II presents the evidence on summer seasonals. I find that the summer
seasonals for teen employment, teen unemployment and total employment are large and
in the direction to be expected if labor supply had shifted significantly more than labor
demand.      However, the seasonal cycles for recessions and non-recessions are not
significantly different from each other.

 In other words, seasonally unadjusted national accounts series are more accurately described as “twice
adjusted,” rather than unadjusted.

           Section III presents the evidence on Christmas seasonals, which seem to be
essentially the same in recession years as in non-recession years. Section IV concludes.
Two appendices examine seasonality in the matching framework, and present further
evidence that the summer seasonal is dominated by supply.


I. Economic Theories of Employment Reductions Differ in Terms of the Incidence
of Supply and Demand Shocks


I.A. The Job Shortage Model
           One partial equilibrium “job shortage” perspective on the labor market is that real
wages rates have a floor – perhaps due to minimum wage laws, unions, or nominal
rigidities – which is typically below the market clearing wage during non-recession
periods, but above it during a recession. In this view, employment is determined only by
demand during a recession, but by the combination of supply and demand during non-
recession periods.6 For example, a cut in marginal income tax rates during a recession
would increase labor supply, but that would only add to the excess labor supply rather
than adding to actual employment. On the other hand, a labor demand shift during a
recession would affect labor usage one-for-one without being even partially crowded out
by higher factor rental rates.
           Admittedly, the “job shortage” view is over-simplified because wage rates are not
the only mechanism to help clear the labor market. Suppose, for example, that labor
unions set a floor on wages with the objective of maximizing labor income. There would
be unemployment in the sense that workers would have an individual incentive, but no
opportunity, to work more at the wage floor, but nevertheless the wage floor would adjust
according to supply and demand conditions. In fact, if the wage elasticity of labor
demand were constant, the union wage markup would be a constant proportion and the
sensitivity of employment to supply and demand parameters would be the same as it
would be in a competitive labor market, even while the total amount of employment was

                                                                                            4
less than the competitive level.7 For this reason, the hypothesis that employment is less
than optimal is quite different from the hypothesis that supply has little marginal effect on
aggregate employment.


I.B. A Matching Framework, and a General Equilibrium Effect
         Search frictions can help explain why the supply of labor exceeds demand during
a recession, but those frictions are still consistent with a positive effect of supply on
actual employment, and with a partial crowding out of demand shifts via higher factor
rental rates. Consider, for example, the Mortensen-Pissarides matching framework in
which the flow of new hires in the labor market is a homogeneous function M(U,V) of the
number U of persons looking for a job and V the number of available positions.8
Economists usually find that the number of new hires increases with the number of
persons looking, holding available positions constant. Thus, it would not be surprising if,
say, a marginal income tax rate cut increased employment by increasing the number of
persons looking for a job. By the same logic, an increase in the number of available
positions would increase employment less than one-for-one, even during a recession.
         Nevertheless, the matching-model supply effects are smaller during a recession.
First, the ratio of searchers to available positions is high during a recession, and
∂2M/(∂U∂V) is expected to be positive.                 Second, during a recession wages may be
especially unable to fall to motivate the creation of new positions. Thus, the search
equilibrium view admits the possibility that a labor supply shift during a recession affects
employment, but significantly less than it would outside a recession. By the same logic,
an increase in the number of available positions is expected to have a greater effect on
number of new hires during a recession than outside a recession, even if both effects are
less than one-for-one. Appendix I derives these results, and finds that (a) the percentage
employment effect of a given supply shock dU during a recession should (in theory) be
about 2/3 of what it would be in a nonrecession and (b) the percentage employment effect
of a given demand shock dV during a recession should (in theory) be about twice of what

7
  The more general point is that costs on the supply side can matter at the margin for market outcomes,
even when the market is not operating efficiently.
8
  To highlight the idea that wage rates might not clear the market, I follow the literature and assume that the
number of available positions is given, rather than reacting to employment costs.


                                                                                                             5
it would be in a nonrecession. If real, these effects are large enough to be detected even
with data on a few recessions.
         Macroeconomists sometimes suggest that an increase in labor supply during a
recession might actually reduce employment, even when real wages are flexible
(Woodford, 2010). In that view an increase in labor supply lowers employer costs, but
the lower employment costs do not motivate new hiring because employers do not have
customers to purchase the additional output (and will not attract such customers by
cutting their output price). At the same time, the lower wage rate affects the composition
of demand, potentially reducing it. In this general equilibrium view, labor demand not
only looks less elastic during a recession, but might appear to slope the “wrong way.”


I.C. An Econometric Model to Nest the Supply and Demand Hypotheses
         These economic hypotheses can be formally represented as a single econometric
hypothesis. To see this, suppose for the moment that wages adjust to clear the labor
market, with labor demand and labor supply of the forms (1) and (2), respectively:


                            ln N t = α D (at ) + γ D ( X t ) − β D ( X t )ln wt + ε tD         (1)


                             ln N t = α S (at ) + γ S ( X t ) + β S ( X t )ln wt + ε tS        (2)


where Nt is employees per person (hereafter, “labor usage”) and wt is the real wage rate in
month t. Xt indicates the state of the business cycle (normalized so that is at its highest
during recessions) at month t and at the state of the seasonal cycle (e.g., a dummy
variable indicating the academic year).                 Seasonals, the business cycles, and month-
specific shocks shift both labor supply and labor demand. The model allows for the
possibility that the labor supply and demand elasticities also vary over the business cycle.
The hypotheses that labor demand is less (labor supply is more) wage elastic during a

recession – even if they may still have the usual sign – are represented as β D′ ( X ) < 0

( β S ′ ( X ) > 0 ), respectively.
         The reduced form for the labor market system is:


                                                                                                6

                               ( X t ) + [1 − θ ( X t )]γ D ( X t )} + {θ ( X t )ε tS + [1 − θ ( X t ) ]ε tD }   (3)
                                                              β D (Xt )
                                            θ (Xt ) ≡
                                                         β D (Xt ) + β S (Xt )


                          1−θ (Xt ) D
                ln wt =            ⎡⎣α (at ) − α S (at ) + γ D ( X t ) − γ S ( X t ) + ε tD − ε tS ⎤⎦            (4)

         θ is the familiar incidence index:9 it depends on the relative supply and demand
elasticities and shows the degree to which the amount of labor usage is affected by supply
or demand at the margin. For the purposes of long run analysis, economists generally
agree that labor demand is fairly elastic, but they ultimately disagree about the magnitude
of the incidence parameter because estimates of the wage elasticity of aggregate labor
supply vary from close to zero to greater than one. If the labor supply elasticity were
zero, the incidence index would be one – the amount of labor used would depend only on
the position of the supply curve.
         The hypothesis of interest in this paper is not necessary whether the incidence
index θ is close to zero or one, but whether it varies with the business cycle. The
hypotheses that the labor usage effect of a labor supply shift is smaller, and the labor
usage effect of a labor demand shift is greater, during a recession than outside a recession
are both formally represented as θ′(X) < 0.10 It’s as if workers were more elastically
supplied, or less elastically demanded, during a recession.11

  Fullerton and Metcalf (2002).
10
   The reduced form for labor usage (3) is broken into three terms: a seasonal term, a business cycle term,
and an idiosyncratic term. Note that a common practice in time series analysis is to remove a year-
invariant proportional seasonal factor from labor usage series in order to arrive at a “seasonally adjusted”
series for business cycle analysis. However, under the joint hypothesis that θ′(X) ≠ 0 and that the seasonal
differentially affects supply and demand, the seasonal adjustment factor would vary over the business
cycle. A previous literature Krane and Wascher (1999), Christiano and Todd (2002), and Matas-Mir and
Osborn (2004) look at the cyclical sensitivity of seasonality, but two of the studies do not focus on the labor
market and none of them attempt to isolate series and seasonals that are dominated by supply or demand.
11
   In the “job shortage” view, employers collectively face a more elastic supply of labor during a recession
because employees are supplied not only from out of the labor force, but from the pool of unemployed.
Other models (e.g., Barro and Grossman, 1971; Eggertson, 2010a) predict that aggregate labor demand is
less elastic (in fact, completely inelastic) during a recession because employers are unable to adjust the


                                                                                                                  7
         The effects of the seasonal factor on labor usage and real wages are:


                                 d ln N t
                                          = θ ( X t ) ⎡α S ′ (at ) − α D′ (at ) ⎤                        (5)
                                   dat                ⎣                         ⎦


                              d ln wt   1 − θ ( X t ) ⎡ S′
                                      =− S             α (at ) − α D′ (at ) ⎤                            (6)
                                dat      β (Xt ) ⎣                          ⎦


These effects vary over the business cycle only to the degree that the season differentially
affects supply and demand. A seasonal that was either dominated by supply or demand –
that is, had αS′ - αD′ significantly different from zero – would have log employment
effects that varied over the business cycle to the degree that the incidence index θ(X)
varied over the business cycle. Recession-nonrecession comparisons of such a seasonal
for log employment reveal whether θ′(X) is positive, negative, or zero.


II. The Summer Seasonal for Employment and Unemployment
         I use two basic ideas to identify seasonals dominated by either labor supply or
labor demand shifts: that the academic season significantly affects the willingness and
availability of teenagers to work more than it affects the demand for their services, and
that the Christmas season abruptly affects the aggregate demand for labor more than it
affects the supply.
         I use BLS measures (based on the Census Bureau’s household survey) of monthly
national employment and unemployment by age group, dating back to January 1948, and
calculate the summer seasonal as the deviation of log per capita employment or
unemployment from the average of its May and September values, none of which are
seasonally adjusted.12        The business cycle is measured as a dichotomous variable
indicating whether July of the year in question was part of a recession as defined by the
NBER. The recession-nonrecession comparisons of the seasonal for a labor market


price of their output. Either way, the incidence parameter θ is expected to be closer to zero during a
recession.
12
   Appendix I shows how the matching frameworks suggests a log specification, but results are quite
similar if the regressions are specified in levels instead of logs.


                                                                                                          8
outcome such as employment for a specific age group are made by regressing the time
series for the seasonals on the time series for the recession indicator variables and a
smooth function of calendar time.
         Table 1’s first two rows display constant terms from such regressions: that is, the
average summer seasonal for employment and unemployment by age group for the non-
recession years (from the perspective of the benchmark year in the calendar time
polynomial, 1980). For the younger age groups, the gap between academic-year and
summer is positive and economically significant for both employment and
unemployment, which is to be expected given that so many of the younger people
become available for work when the academic year ends.13 For example, July log
employment per capita for teenagers ages 16-19 exceeds the average for May and
September by an average of 0.296 for the non-recession years and July log
unemployment per capita exceeds the average for May and September by an average of
0.285.
         The top row of the Table also suggests that the size of the summer seasonal shift
likely exceeds the shifts associated with the largest postwar business cycles. Log July
employment per capita for persons aged 16-19 fell “only” 0.114 from 1979 to 1983, and
“only” 0.299 from 2007 to 2010, whereas it falls 0.296 at the end of a typical summer.
         Even without regard for recessions, the summer seasonal varies over time. For
example, minimum wages, activities at school, and other factors can change the
propensity of teens to work during the school year, and therefore the fraction of teens
whose labor supply would shift when summer begins. These factors are considered in
my analysis by its inclusion of a smooth function of calendar time among the independent
variables.14
         Table 1’s middle rows display the estimated coefficients on the recession
indicator variable: that is, the gaps between a summer seasonal during recession years
and the corresponding seasonal for non-recession years. The gaps for employment are
typically in the direction predicted by the various theories – that is, that employment

13
   The unemployment seasonal also confirms our expectation that the summer seasonal in labor supply
exceeds the summer seasonal in labor demand (see also Miron, p. 9).
14
   In separate results (not shown in the Table), I have also replaced the time polynomial with the prior
academic year average employment per capita, or just dropped the time polynomial and limited the sample
to 1980-2009 – in both cases results were quite similar.


                                                                                                       9
would expand less during recession summers – but are not economically significant. For
example, the average recession seasonal for log employment per 16-19-year-old is only
0.0182 smaller than the average of 0.296 for non-recession years, or about 94 percent of
the non-recession seasonal (see the second-to-last row of the table). Recall that the
simple job-shortage view predicts that the recession employment seasonal would be zero,
and the matching function approach predicts that it would be about two-thirds of the non-
recession seasonal. The gaps for unemployment are not always in the direction predicted
by the theory, and are statistically indistinguishable from zero.
        Figures 1 and 2 display the annual time series for the July log employment
(unemployment, respectively) seasonal for the 16-19 age group together with fitted
values from the regression used for the employment (unemployment) rows of Table 1’s
third column. Each of the figures indicates recession year observations with squares and
non-recession year observations with circles. The fitted values follow a smooth curve for
the nonrecession years, and small spikes down in the recession years.15 The employment
data also display small down spikes in many (but not all) of the recession years, which is
why the recession coefficient of -1.82 is statistically significant.
        However, -1.82 is small enough that the matching theory (shown in Figure 1 as
triangles calculated as 2/3 of the predicted value for a non-recession year) and shortage
theory (shown as diamonds in the figure) fail to fit even one of the recession observations
better than the hypothesis that the recession and non-recession seasonals are the same.
Every single recession economy absorbed large numbers of new teen arrivals into the
labor market without a statistically abnormal rise in unemployment: all of the recession
employment seasonal observations are far from zero, and all of the recession
unemployment seasonal observations are within two standard errors of the regression
function for non-recession years.




15
  The recession years appear as spikes because most recessions do not include more than one consecutive
July months, and the spikes are small because the recession coefficient of -1.82 shown in Table 1 is small
compared to the non-recession seasonal of 29.6 (both in 100ths of log points).


                                                                                                        10
III. Christmas Demand in Recessions and Booms
        I use Census Bureau measures of retail sales (from January 1967), employment
(from January 1948), and unemployment (from January 1948). Employment is measured
both from the establishment survey and the household survey.                      The regression
specification is the same as above, except the dependent variable is the Christmas
seasonal – calculated as the deviation of log per capita (retails sales, employment,
unemployment, or labor force) in Nov and December (or December only) from the value
that is linearly interpolated from October and January – and the business cycle indicator
is from the perspective of December (rather than July).
        Under the assumption that the Christmas season shifts labor demand more than it
shifts labor supply, the simple job-shortage theory predicts that a given sized labor
demand increase will increase employment more during a recession. As a result, the
labor demand increase will reduce unemployment more during a recession, and increase
the labor force less (if at all).
        The top part of Table 2 displays the regressions’ constant terms: the average
Christmas seasonal for retail sales, employment, unemployment, and the labor force
(from the perspective of the benchmark year in the calendar time polynomial, 1980). Not
surprisingly, each of them has an economically and statistically significant seasonal. In
non-recession years, log aggregate December employment is 0.010 or 0.016 above its
Oct-Jan trend on average, depending on the data source, which is a deviation only slightly
smaller than measured in the summer. Unlike the summer seasonal, and consistent with
our expectation that Christmas is primarily a demand shift, Christmas unemployment is
below trend.
        The middle part of the table displays regressions’ coefficients on the business
cycle term: the estimated gap between the recession seasonal and the non-recession
seasonal. December log retail sales are slightly less above trend during recessions,
although this tendency is of marginal economic and statistical significance.16 When
combined with the fact that the rest of the economy is less seasonal than retail sales
(Barksy and Miron, 1989), this suggests that the demand shift associated with Christmas


16
  Judging from the Nov-Dec average, November retail sales may be somewhat more above trend in
recessions.


                                                                                                11
is only slightly smaller, if not the same (as a proportion of economic activity before the
season began) in recessions.
          The point estimates for employment’s seasonal recession-nonrecession gap are
not always of the expected sign, and in all cases are statistically and economically
insignificant. The point estimates for unemployment’s seasonal gap have the expected
sign for an unexpected reason.        In the first column, the point estimate for the
unemployment seasonal is economically (although not statistically) significant: the
recession seasonal reduces log unemployment about 29 percent more during a recession
year than it does in other years. With no effect of the recession on the employment
seasonal, this apparently occurs because the labor force seasonal is less during a
recession.     In other words, relative to non-recession years’ Christmas seasonal, a
recession Christmas seasonal moves people at about the same rate from non-employment
to employment, but moves more people from unemployment to out of the labor force.
          Figures 3-6 display the time series used in Table 2 together with fitted values
from the regressions reported in the Table’s first column. As noted above, the recession
coefficient has the “wrong” sign (negative) in the regression for payroll employment.
The matching theory says that the Christmas seasonal would be about twice as large
during a recession: about 0.015 log points larger for payroll employment. Figure 3 shows
how only two of the twelve NBER recession year payroll employment observations lie
above the regression function, and the largest deviation of those is less than .002 log
points.    As shown in Figure 4, CPS employment (otherwise known as employment from
the “household survey”) has a smaller Christmas seasonal. A couple of the recession
seasonals for CPS employment are above the regression function, but none of them is
even close to twice the regression function for non-recession years.
          According to the simple job-shortage theory, Christmas labor demand would be
satisfied from the pool of unemployed, without raising factor prices and thereby without
expanding the labor force. Figures 5 and 6 display the Christmas recession seasonals for
unemployment and the labor force, showing how few recessions fit this pattern. Roughly
consistent with the theory, the 1953-54 recession and the 1973-75 recession had
essentially no labor force seasonal and an unemployment seasonal that was larger than
normal. However, the other ten recession observations do not fit this pattern either



                                                                                       12
because the labor force seasonal is significant, or the unemployment seasonal is not larger
than those from non-recession years, or both.17


IV. Conclusions
        I find that the summer and Christmas seasonals for employment and
unemployment are essentially the same number of log points in recession years and non-
recession years. When school lets out and teens storm into the labor force, even a
recession economy creates summer jobs. When Christmas increases labor demand, many
of the positions are filled by expanding the labor force, even during a recession when
there would seem to be ample unemployed to do the work. Even the 2008 and 2009
summers and Christmas’ looked a lot like summers and Christmas’ in nonrecession years.
        These findings contradict the view – which is the basis for much fiscal policy and
business cycle analysis – that labor supply shifts have little (or even perverse) effects on
aggregate employment during a recession, and contradict the view that demand shifts
encounter significantly fewer supply constraints during a recession than they normally
would. Admittedly, recessions are times when the labor market does not function well,
but nonetheless labor supply and demand seem to operate on the margin during
recessions in much the same way that they do during non-recession years.
        The Christmas cycle is at least as large as the high frequency peacetime
government spending changes that have been observed in U.S. history, so my results
might imply that fiscal demand shocks would have much the same employment effects in
a recession as they would in non-recession years. Of course, the seasonal results by
themselves do not rule out the possibility that a fiscal demand increase significantly
increases employment regardless of whether or not it were a recession (although see
Alesina and Ardagna, 2009 and Barro and Redlick, 2009, on this point).
        It is possible that the labor market has different mechanisms to adapt to various
supply and demand shifts, and that certain types of fiscal policy might be different from

17
  One explanation of my results is that a recession can be model as α labor markets that fit the simple
shortage model, and 1-α labor markets with no shortage, with α << 1. In this case, labor market aggregates
might have responses to the seasonal shifts that look like α times the shortage model and 1-α times the no-
recession-nonrecession gap model. However, in this case it would be incorrect to claim that, from an
aggregate point of view, supply doesn’t matter during a recession – it does in 1-α of the markets – and
incorrect to claim that demand is dramatically more potent in recessions – it is in only α of the markets.


                                                                                                        13
Christmas in this regard. The seasonal cycle is also easily anticipated.18 Either case
raises the question of how, exactly, fiscal policy might be different from Christmas, why
government spending might encounter fewer supply constraints than Christmas does, and
how that information can be used to better design fiscal policy during recessions.




18
  Presumably supply can better adjust to an anticipated demand shock than to an unanticipated one, and
demand can better adjust to an anticipated supply shock than to an unanticipated one. It’s not clear how
this possibility relates to the interaction between the business and seasonal cycles, though.


                                                                                                           14
V. Appendix I: The Constant Elasticity Matching Function and the Interaction
between Recessions and Seasonals


        The simple job-shortage perspective is perhaps too extreme in predicting that
labor supply is essentially irrelevant for determining the quantity of labor used. The
Mortensen-Pissarides matching framework acknowledges that supply shifts would matter
even in a recession, just to a lesser extent (than it would in a non-recession) because
unemployment is greater in recessions and unemployment is assumed to have a positive
but diminishing effect on new hires. This prediction and related predictions can be
quantified by assuming constancy for either the matching function’s unemployment
elasticity or its vacancy elasticity.19
        As in the main text, let N denote employment. Employment evolves according to:
                                          N t = M (U t ,Vt ) − δ t N t                               (7)

where δ denotes the rate of job separations and t indexes calendar time. M is the job
match rate, which depends on the number of job vacancies V and the number of job
searchers U. As in the main text, let X denote the state of the business cycle, and a
denote seasonals. Define the steady state Nss(X) to be the level of employment that is
consistent with constant employment, holding constant the season and the state of the
business cycle:


                                     N ss ( X ) ≡ M (U ss ( X ),Vss ( X ) )                           (8)


Now consider a system that is in the steady state at time t-1, and has unemployment and
vacancies at levels Uss(X) + dU and Vss(X) + dV, respectively, over the time interval
[t-1,t]. Then time t employment will be:


                   Nt           ⎡⎛ ∂M U t −1 ⎞ dU ⎛ ∂M Vt −1 ⎞ dV ⎤                 −δ ( X )
                          − 1 = ⎢⎜            ⎟      +⎜            ⎟      ⎥ ⎡⎣1 − e          ⎤⎦       (9)
                   N t −1       ⎣⎝ ∂ U M t −1 ⎠ t −1
                                                U     ⎝ ∂ V M t −1 ⎠ t −1 ⎦
                                                                     V


19
   The constant elasticity matching function is common in the literature. Anderson and Burgess (2000) use
it when considering seasonal and other variation in unemployment and vacancies.


                                                                                                       15
Define a (short-duration) supply shock to be dU > 0 and dV = 0, and a demand shock to
be dU = 0 and dV > 0. Then the relative employment effects of demand and supply
shocks are:
                                 Nt              ⎛ ∂M      Vt −1 ⎞
                                               −1⎜                ⎟
                                                   ∂V
                                                =⎝
                                 N t −1 dU =0
                                                           M t −1 ⎠ U t −1 dV
                                                                                                      (10)
                                 Nt              ⎛ ∂M      U t −1 ⎞ Vt −1 dU
                                              −1 ⎜                ⎟
                                 N t −1 dV =0    ⎝ ∂U      M t −1 ⎠


The separation terms canceled and the terms in parentheses are elasticities of the
matching function. If those elasticities, the openings created by Christmas (dV), and the
job-searchers created by the conclusion of the academic year (dU) are independent of the
business cycle, then the relative employment effects of supply (summer) and demand
(Christmas) vary with the business cycle only because the ratio of unemployment to
vacancies varies. That ratio is said to be a factor of 2-4 larger in recession years than in
non-recession years (Rampell, 2010).20
        Equation (9) also shows how a supply shock dU has effects that depend on the
business cycle:
                        Nt                     ⎛ ∂M   U t −1 ⎞
                                          −1   ⎜             ⎟
                        N t −1 dV =0, X =1     ⎝ ∂U   M t −1 ⎠ X =1 U t −1 (0) 1 − e−δ (1)
                                             =                                                        (11)
                        Nt                     ⎛ ∂M   U t −1 ⎞      U t −1 (1) 1 − e−δ (0)
                                           −1 ⎜              ⎟
                        N t −1 dV =0, X =0     ⎝ ∂U   M t −1 ⎠ X =0


Assuming that (a) the elasticities in parentheses do not vary over the business cycle and
(b) the separation rates are no greater in a recession (δ(1) ≤ δ(1)),21 this ratio is less than
the ratio of unemployment per capita between non-recession years and recession years,
which is about 0.6 – 0.8. A similar calculation applies for examining the interaction
between demand shock dV and the business cycle: the recession effect exceeds the non-


20
   Alternatively, one might model Christmas demand as dV/V that is constant over the business cycle, rather
than constant dV. In this case, the relative effects of demand and supply would vary by a factor of 1.5-2
over the business cycle, because the number unemployed per capita varies by about that factor.
21
   JOLTS data suggest that job separation rates are somewhat less during recessions.


                                                                                                        16
recession effect according to the ratio of non-recession vacancies to recession vacancies,
or about 1.7.
       The matching function is known to shift during recessions– that is, the number of
hires during a recession is even lower than one would expect based on measured
vacancies and unemployed. One explanation is that the matching function really is
stable, but that the vacancy and unemployment measures are flawed (i.e., either recession
vacancies are over-estimated relative to non-recessions, or unemployment is over-
estimated, or both). In this case the calculations above are in the right direction, but
conservative in magnitude. Another explanation is that the matching function really is
different in a recession, but this does not necessarily affect equations (9), (10) and (11)
because the form of the matching function matters only through its elasticity.




                                                                                        17
VI. Appendix II: The Role of Supply in the Summer Seasonal
       The importance of supply in the summer seasonal can be seen in the
unemployment data and in comparisons between age groups. A pure summer demand
surge would draw teens into the labor market and result in low teen summer
unemployment, high summer real wages, and low summer unemployment among persons
not enrolled in school during the academic year. Figure 7 (taken from Mulligan 2010)
shows that, in fact, teen unemployment spikes in June as the labor market absorbs more
than one million teens. Unemployment of persons aged 25 and older (not shown in the
figures) is high throughout the summer, peaking in July at almost 700,000 persons above
trend. Median nominal and real weekly wages for teens are often at their lowest of the
year in the third quarter (July – September – see Mulligan 2010), and presumably hourly
wages are even lower due to longer teen summer work weeks. These patterns reverse
when the academic year ends.
       The summer job surge is largest for groups with higher school employment rates.
Figure 8 is based on enrollment data from 1980-2007 and shows how the summer
employment spike (measured in the same way it is for Table 1) is a greater percentage for
the younger teens, and those are exactly the age groups for whom school enrollment is
highest. In fact, there is essentially no employment spike for the 25-to-34 age group, and
that group has hardly anyone in school. If summer labor demand were significantly
higher, then summer ought to bring some extra employment for the 25-to-34 group too.
       Figure 9 displays the unemployment spikes for the same age groups.
Unemployment per capita is greater during the summer than during the academic year,
especially for the groups with more school enrollment. Summer unemployment is higher
than normal even for nonstudents, perhaps because many young people out of school
compete in the labor market with students who exit school each summer.




                                                                                       18
