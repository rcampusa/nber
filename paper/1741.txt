     This paper analyzes the relation between exogenous changes in commodity

export prices and the real exchange rate in a monetary economy. The

traditional Dutch—Disease case is extended, and the monetary consequences of

an export boom are explored. It is shown that commodity export booms can

generate, in the short run, either an excess demand or an excess Supply for

money. In a monetary setting the short—run behavior of the real exchange rate

can differ significantly from the more traditional Dutch-Disease case without

money. The model is tested using data for Colombia.

                                 I. INTRODUCTION

         A number of papers have recently analyzed the way in which commodity

export booms affect production in other sectors of the economy. Most of these

studies have focused on the behavior of the real exchange rate as the main

transmission mechanism from the booming sector to the rest of the economy.

This literature, which has come to be known as the Dutch Disease literature,

has postulated that a commodity export boom will generally result in a real

appreciation of the domestic currency, increased production of non—tradable

goods and a decline in production and employment of the rest (i.e., non—boom)

tradable sector. 1   However, commodity export booms can also have important

short—run monetary effects, which will spill over to the real exchange rate.

For example, a resource—based export boom will typically result in a balance

of payments surplus and in the accumulation of international reserves. If

this increase in reserves is not sterilized, the monetary base will increase

and an excess supply of money may develop. If this is the case, the final

effect will be inflation. This increase in the price level will, in general,

be one of the mechanisms through which the real appreciation will actually

take place. 2 It is possible, however, for the short—run increase in the rate

of inflation to exceed what is required to bring about the equilibrium real

appreciation generated by the export boom; in this case, the the real exchange

rate will appreciate in the short run by more than what real factors only

would indicate. These short-run monetary effects of commodity export booms

have recently been important in a number of developing countries, including

Indonesia, Kenya and Colombia.
         In this paper a model of a developing country that relies heavily on

the exports of a particular good (the "commodity export" for short) is fully

worked out. The model emphasizes the effects of changes in commodity export

prices on money creation and inflation. The model also allows for a fairly

general exchange rate policy, ranging from a fixed nominal rate to a crawling

peg based on a PPP rule. The model is empirically tested using data for

Colombia. Experts have generally argued that fluctuatios in Colombia's real

exchange rate have been mainly determined by world coffee price movements,

with most observers emphasizing the consequences of coffee price change on

money creation and inflation.



                                    II. THE MODEL



         In this paper a model that can be used to analyze the way in which

commodity export prices, money creation, inflation and the real exchange rate

interact is presented. 3     The model is developed for the case of a small

developing country, with capital controls and no domestic financial market.

         The model consists of three interrelated main building blocks——a

money market block, an inflation block and an exchange rate block.

The Monetary Block

         The first equation in the monetary block describes the process of

money creation.



       Mt = a     Rt + (1—a) DCRt                                    (1)




As 'usual X denotes the percentage change in variable X. Mt is, then, the rate

of growth of nominal money, DCRt is the rate of growth of domestic credit, and
                                      —3—

 a and (1-a) are base year shares. Domestic credit creation, in tim, is

 assumed to depend on the fiscal deficits as a proportion of high powered money

 (DEF). This assumption captures the fact that in most less developed

countries (LDCs) the creation of money is an important source of financing for

government expenditure.



        DCRt =   DEFt.                                             (2)




           Regarding international reserves behavior through time, it is assumed

that reserves respond to two factors. First an excess flow demand or supply

for money will be reflected in accumulation or decumulation of reserves.

Second, changes in the domestic price of the commodity export in period t will

be translated, in the same period, into corresponding changes in reserves.
These assumptions regarding reserves behavior are captured by equation (3).



            =          —     +                                     (3)


where R are international reserves expressed in domestic currency; Md is the

nominal quantity of money demanded,     is the price of the commodity export

expressed in domestic currency. The world and domestic prices of the

commodity export are linked by the following equation:



            =
                 EtP                                               (14)




where      is the world price of this commodity and where Et is the nominal
                                                   —Li—




exchange rate in period t, expressed as units of domestic currency per unit of

foreign currency.

         The novelty of equation (3)                is   that, contrary to most monetary models

of open economies, it explicitly allows for international reserve shocks to be

a source of money creation in the short run. In the long run, however,
                                                                                  =   0).
    =   0, M = Mt       =
                            Mti,         and reserves will not change (i.e.,

         The monetary side of the model is closed by an equation for the rate

of change of the nominal demand for money. Assuming that the demand for money

function depends only on real income, we have:




        M           +
                            °t                                                        (5)




Combining equations (1) through (5) we can obtain a first order semi—reduced

form that describes the motion of money through times:



             =                   +          +                                         (6)
                 -aM1                a1P        a2;+ a3P aDEF

                                                                          6
Since O<a0<1 the convergence of (6) will be oscillatory.

Inflation Block

            The inflation side of the model is formed by four equations. The

first one is the definition of the price level. Expressed in percentage

changes we have:




        Pt =     1Nt Tt              +                                                (6)
                                                        —5—

 Where          is the rate of change of nontradable prices and Tt is the rate of

 change of the price of tradables other than the commodity export, or "other

 tradables."          The rate of change of the price of these other tradables, in

 turn, is assumed to be equal to the rate of change of the nominal exchange

rate pLis the rate of change of the world price of the other tradables:



         Tt =      Et
                          +
                               Tt

            The rate of change of the price of nontradables will depend on the

change in the price of other tradables, real income and the excess flow supply

for money in period t: 8




         1nt 't t                        +
                                                 Tt                     (8)




            Combining (6), (7) and (8) with equation (5) on the demand for money,

we obtain the following semireduced form for the domestic rate of inflation:



         Pt =   bM+       b1        Tt       -
                                                 b2yt                   (9)




where b + b       =   1
      0     1




     III. THE RATE OF CRAWL AND THE DEFINITION OF THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE



           The model is closed with three equations: the first one defines the

rate of devaluation of the nominal exchange rate, or rate of crawl; the second

equation relates real income to the price of the commodity export; and the

third equation provides the definition of the real exchange rate.
                                              —6--


           The following expression summarizes the rule of the rate of crawl
                                                                                       10
assumed to be followed by the monetary authorities at any moment in time:



                                                                             (10)
      Et LoPt 1Tt


           This is a fairly general equation, that allows for a number of

possible exchange rate policies. For example, t' =                =       0, this country

will have a fixed nominal exchange rate.

           If £-    2     1 and       0 ,   this   country will have a strict PPP nominal

exchange rate rule, where in each period the nominal exchange rate will be

adjusted by the differential between domestic and world inflation. If,

however,            it means that the authorities in this country recognize that

changes in the commodity export price will have an impact on the real exchange

rate, and will try to accommodate this effect through a slowing down of the

rate of devaluation. In the present paper it will be assumed that

           Regarding real income, it is assumed that changes in the real price

of the commodity export (i.e., changes in the terms of trade) generate

deviations of real income from its long—run trend:



            g +   p(p*C                                                      (11)



Where g is the long-term trend rate of growth of output.
           Finally, the real exchange rate (e) is defined as the domestic
relative price of other (i.e., non-commodity export) tradeables to non—
tradable   goods.         tn terms   of rates of change:


           e=        +      — Nt                                             (12)
                                          —7—



                             IV. THE SOLUTION TO THE MODEL



Permanent Monetary Equilibrium

         The model can be further divided into a real and a monetary block.

The real side, which is comprised of equations (8) and (11), can be solved

under the assumption of full and permanent monetary equilibrium. In this case

the mode becomes similar to most models on Dutch Disease which have tradi—

tionally concentrated on real aspects only. Assuming permanent monetary equi-
librium, E = 0   ,   replacing   (11) with (8) and using the definition given by

equation 12, the change in the real exchange rate resulting from changes in

the commodity export world price is:




      e=—               <0                                                (13)




This means that a (permanent) increase in the world price of the cothmodity

export will generate a real appreciation of the domestic currency. In fact,

equation (13) is the spending effect of a commodity export boom emphasized in

the Dutch Disease literature (Corden, 198!t). This real appreciation takes

place because, as a result of the boom, there is an increase in expenditure on

non—tradables. In order to maintain equilibrium in the non-tradable goods

market, its relative price has to increase. Note from equation (13) that the

extent of the real appreciation depends on the value of        ,   the   income

elasticity of demand for non-tradables. If c       = 0 —-that is, if none of the
increased real income is spent on non—tradables—-the commodity export boom

will have no effect on the real exchange rate. This, of course, is a standard

result in the Dutch Disease literature. However, the model derived in this
                                     -8—


paper goes beyond the real effects of a commodity export boom, emphasizing the

monetary and inflationary repercission of changes in commodity export prices.

Short-Run Monetary Disequilibrium

         Allowing for short—run monetary disequilibrium, the cor1lete model

works in the following way. As in the real side model, an increase in the

real world price of the commodity export results in higher real income

(through equation (11)), and in an increased demand for non-tradables. This

higher demand, in turn, affects, through equation (8), the relative price of

non-tradables, generating the already discussed spending effect.

         On the money side, the higher price of the commodity exports with its

resulting higher real income and price of nori-tradables affects both the

demand and the supply for money. From equation (14), a higher demand for

nominal (and real) money will result. The few Dutch Disease models that have

incorporated monetary factors have emphasized this increase of the demand for

money as a result of the export boom.   12 A particularly important effect of

this higher demand for real money is that, if an excess demand for money

results, some deflationary effect the boom can take place. This is because if

after the boom the supply for money does not change, monetary equilibrium can

only be reestablished if Pt decreases or if      goes down (equation (5)).

         However, an excess demand for money is only one of the possible mone-

tary consequences of the export boom. In fact, according to equatIons (3) and

(1), after the boom international reserves will accumulate, and the rate of

growth of money will also be higher. Whether the final result is an excess

demand or an excess supply for money will depend on the relative values of

some of the parameters in the model. In particular, if cY1>(l—Y0)o ,     the
commodity export boom will result In a short—run excess supply for money. In
                                                     —9-

the rest of this section it will be assumed, unless otherwise indicated, that

the export boom will generate an excess sipply for money.

            Under this assumption, the resulting excess supply of money will

impact the nominal price of' non-tradables, further appreciating 'She real

exchange rate. What is the role of the nominal exchange rate policy in our

story? Two things will happen according to equation (10). First, as a result

of the higher commodity export price, the rate of the crawl will be slowed

down in period t, helping to accommodate the real appreciation generated by

the spending effect. Second, there will be a tendency to partially compensate

the nominal exchange rate for the higher rate of inflation, throught c0P.

The final effect will be a real appreciation resulting, partially, from the

slowing down of the rate of the crawl and partially from higher inflation. If

the liquidity or money creation effect generated by the higher price of coffee

is large enough, the real appreciation can be larger in the short run than in

the long run [see Edwards (1984c).

            The model can be formally solved for the rate of change of the real

exchange rate as a function of exogenous variables only. Equations (6), (9)

and (10) are first solved for Et,                   and P.    Then, the definition of the

real exchange rate is used to find e:

where k is a constant which includes the trend rate of real income growth (g)

and,

                                               ))

            A =

                1o

            =


            = (1—c&).


           From this expression we can find how an increase in the world price

of the commodity export affects the real exchange rate in the short run.

Furthermore, from the comparison of equations (1) and (13), it is possible to

find out the extent to which, after the boom, the short-run real exchange rate

diverges from the new long—run equilibrium real exchange rate.

           Let is now foe is on the way in which changes in the commodity export

price affect the short—run real exchange rate. Term A captures the spending

effect of a change in the price of the commodity export on the real exchange

rate. Since stability requires that D>O, the spending effect will, as

expected, generate a real appreciation. Let is now turn to the inflation and

exchange rate effects. These are captured by term B. As can be seen from

this expression, there are three different channels, in addition to the

spending effect, through which changes in the commodity export price will

affect e. Two of these channels indicate that a higher commodity price will

generate a real appreciation. The third channel, however, suggests that—

 e and p     are positively related. Let is first look at the forces that

suggest that there is a negative effect of p      on e   First, a higher world

price of the commodity resilts in an increase in international reserves and

money growth in the same period. Assuming that, as a consequence, an excess

flow supply for money results, this will generate inflation and, with other

things given, a real appreciation. Second, according to equation (10), an
                                     — 11   —




increase in the world price of this commodity slows down the rate of the
crawl. This also works towards generating a real appreciation, with other

things given. The forces that tend to generate a real depreciation as a

consequence of the export boom are of a second order magnitude, -nd work

through the following channel. The higher world commodity export price

reduces the rate of the crawl and consequently, through equation (10), the

domestic price of tradables and inflation. These lower rates of inflation and

devaluation, in turn will tend to result in a lower rate of domestic money

creation, through equation (12), and even lower inflation. This lower infla-

tion, of course, will generate with other things given, a real depreciation.

However, given the second order nature of this effect, the strong presumption

is that under normal circumstances (i.e., under plausible values of the para-

meters involved), the appreciation effects will dominate. This is, however,

an empirical issue, which can be resolved by estimating the model. 13



      V. AN APPLICATION: COFFEE AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE IN COLOMBIA

         In this section the model developed above is applied to the case of

Colombia. The performance of the Colombian economy has been traditionally

linked to the behavior of the world coffee market.     A nimber of aithors

have argued that changes in the world price of coffee have been transmitted

into Colombia mainly through the effect that they have on the real exchange

rate [Weisner (1978), Urrutia (1981), World Bank (1984), Edwards (19814c,

1986)J. Increases (decreases) in the world price of coffee have generated

real appreciations (depreciations) of the Colombian peso. These variations in

the real exchange rate, in turn, have affected the degree of competitiveness

of the non—coffee tradables sectors, with a real appreciation generating loss
                                      - 12   -




of   competitiveness or exchange rate ttdeprotection.tt For example, the coffee

bonanza of 1975—79 resulted in a sharp real appreciation, which negatively

affected the ability of the domestic sector to compete in international

markets. Earlier episodes of sharp increases in the price of c&fee (1950,

1954 and 1956, for example) have also been related to steep appreciations of

the peso [Weisner (1978), World Bank (19814)]. In Table 1, data on real

effective exchange rates, coffee prices, terms of trade, rate of growth of

reserves and high-powered money, inflation, and the nominal rate of

devaluation for 1968—82 are presented.

           In the Colombian case, the monetary and inflationary effects of

coffee price increases have been important. For example, as the data in

Table 1 show, the 1975—79 coffee bonanza generated a steep increase in inter-

national reserve holdings and in money creation. The crucia1 role of the

increase in the rate of money creation after the different coffee booms has

Note: The real price of coffee is defined as the US$ coffee price deflated by the
       US$ import price index. The effective exchange rate was computed using trade
       weights and taking into account Colombia's ten major trade partners. The
       partners (and weights) are: U.S. (0.507); U.K. (0.047); France (0.037);
       Germany (0.163); Italy (0.033); Netherlands (0.0114); Japan (0.058); Sweden
       (0.032); Spain (0.035); and Venezuela (0.0145). According to the definitions
       of real exchange rate used in this paper an increase in the index reflects a
       real depreciation, whereas a decline in the index reflects a real deprecia-
       tion, whereas a decline in the index represents a real appreciation. The raw

   been forcefully pointed out by a number of experts on the colombian economy,

    including Urrutia (1981), Weisner (1978) and Karnes (1985).

            Since World War II, the Colombian authorities have tried to use

   several schemes to reduce the impact of changes in coffee prices on the real

   exchange rate and on the rest of the economy. The main objective of the

   government during this period has been to reduce the undesirable short—run

   effects that temporary changes in coffee prices have on the degree of profita—
                                     - 1L -


bility,   production and employment in the rest of the economy. 15 For many

years returns from coffee exports were subject to a lower net rate of

exchange. Also, in the past, the degree of import protection was altered

depending on the behavior of coffee prices; it was reduced as a 'onsequence of

increases in the price of coffee, and raised when the world price of coffee

declined. In addition, several monetary measures—-including steep increases

in the banking system's reserves requirements--have been implemented when the

price of coffee has risen. 16

          A number of experts have indicated that the adoption of a crawling

peg system in 1967 responded to the need to reduce the dependence of the real

exchange rate on coffee price fluctuations [Weisner (1978), Urrutia (1981),

Ocatnpo (1982)]. However, since the inception of the crawling peg system, the

decision on the rate at which the peso should be devalued has been highly

influenced by coffee prices. For example, according to Weisner (1978) , once

the crawling peg was adopted, one of the main problems was to decide "at what

pace to devalue when coffee prices rise" (p. 203). This problem has been com-

pounded by the existence of a trade-off between the rate of nominal devalia-

tion and inflation, In practice there has been an inverse relationship

between the rate of devaluation of the peg and coffee prices. The high coffee

prices of 1976—79, for example, were accompanied by a significant slowdown of

the rate of devaluation; when the price of coffee began to fall in 1980—82,

the rate of the crawl was rapidly accelerated. This inverse relationship

between world coffee prices and the nominal rate of devaluation constitutes

another mechanism--in addition to the money creation inflationary effect--
                                        — 15   —




through which higher (lower) coffee prices have been translated into a lower
 (higher) real exchange rate.

           In this section annual data for Colombia for 1960-82 are used to

econometrically analyze the extent to which changes in coffee prices have, in

fact, influenced the real exchange rate in that country. This empirical

analysis is carried out in two ways. First, a reduced form equation for the

rate of change of the real exchange rate is estimated. This equation, which

is in some ways similar to equation (1k) above, relates changes in the real

exchange rate in Colombia to changes in the price of coffee and other real
                                                     17
exogenous variables suggested by the theory.              Second, the model developed

in Section II, which incorporates the role of monetary sectors in the short

run, is explicitly developed by estimating simultaneously the money, inflation

and rate of crawl equations from the model of Section II.



     VI. REAL EXCHANGE RATE BEHAVIOR IN COLOMBIA: REDUCED FORM ANALYSIS

           In this sub—section some preliminary econometric evidence on the

behavior of the real exchange rate in Colombia is presented. The analysis is

based on the estimation of reduced form equations and, as in         Barro    (1983),

focuses   on the role of real determinants of       the real exchange rate.

           In   the empirical analysis of   this   section two definitions of the real
exchange rate are used: RER is a bilateral measure of the real exchange rate
computed as the nominal rate with respect to the U.S. dollar (pesos per

dollar), times the U.S. WPI and divided by Colombia's CPI. REER, on the other

hand, is an index of the effective real exchange rate, computed relative to a

basket of ten currencies where a weighted average of the trade partner's WPI's

is used in the numerator and Colombia's CPI is used as a deflator in the
                                                - 16 -


denominator.       According to these definitions of the real exchange rate an

increase in these indexes denotes a real depreciation, whereas a decline

indicates that the domestic currency is appreciating in real terms.

         In addition to investigating the nature of the relatio' between

coffee price (and terms of trade) changes and the real exchange rates, two

other hypotheses are tested. The first is that the rate of growth in income

per capita and the rate of change of the real exchange rate are negatively

related. This hypothesis is derived from the Ricardo—Balassa effect, which

states that countries with a higher rate of productivity gains will experience

a real appreciation in their currency. In the model derived In Section II

this effect of the rate of growth of real income on the real exchange rate was

captured by term K In equation (H). In this study the rate of growth of per

capita income is used as a proxy to measure these productivity gains. The

other hypothesis being tested refers to the relationship between the levels of

import protection and the real exchange rate. 18           Even though in a general

equilibrium setting with exportables, importables and non—tradeable goods the

effect of changes in import tariffs on the real exchange rate cannot be

determined a priori, the presumption is that for most countries higher tariffs

result in a real appreciation (Edwards 1984a). In the regression analysis the

following reduced forms for the real exchange rate were estimated:




      e =                                                                (15)

where:

         e    =   percentage change of either RER or REER

         y    =   percentage change in real GDP per capita
              =   percentage change in the terms of trade,
                  measired as export prices over import prices
              =   change in a dummy variable that measures the level
                  of protection in every period

         p =      percentage change in the real price of coffee, defined as an
                  index of the dollar price of coffee deflated by and index of
                  import prices for Colombia

        u,v =     error   terms.




             It is expected, then, that a1 ,b1 < 0, and that a2,b2,a3,b3 < 0.    In

equation (16), changes in the real price of coffee (p) are used instead of

the change in the terms of trade (r), since changes in coffee prices are the

main determinants of i and because our main interest is to investigate how

changes in the price of the main commodity export affect the real exchange

rate.

             The results obtained from the estimation of equations (15) and (16),

as well as some variants, using OLS, are presented in Table 2. As can be

seen, while all the coefficients have the expected signs, only a few are

significant at conventional levels. On the other hand, the goodness of fit,

as measured by the R2, is rather poor. Nevertheless, these results provide

some preliminary evidence that the hypothesized negative effect of terms of
trade       changes-—and especially coffee's terms of trade changes-—on the real

exchange rate in Colombia is indeed present.

               A problem with these estimates is that by concentrating on reduced

forms, they do not capture most of the action, missing in particular the

mechanisms through which coffee price changes are transmitted into the real

exchange rate. For this reason in the next section the model developed in

Section II is explicitly tested.

     VII.     COFFEE, MONEY, INFLATION AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE IN COLOMBIA

            In the preceding section, results obtained from the estimation of

reduced form equations for changes in the real exchange rate in Colombia were

presented. These regressions indicated that changes in the wor (real) price

of coffee have had a [marginally] significant negative effect on the real

exchange rate in Colombia. However, a problem with these results is that, as

in most analyses based on reduced form regressions, the mechanisms through

which a particular exogenous variable (the price of coffee) affects the

endogenous variable (the real exchange rate) is not explicitly presented. In

the colombian case this is particularly troublesome, since by basing the

analysis on reduced forms the possible monetary effect of higher prices of

coffee is missed. In this section this problem is faced by directly

estimating a version of th model presented in Section II. 19

            In this section the three main equations from the model (eqiations

(6), (9) and (10)) are estimated simultaneously. The estimation was performed

using annual data for 1952—1980, with an explicit distinction made between the

pre—1976 period and the post—1967 period. The following variant of the money

creation equation (6) was estimated (where the v1s are error terms):




    Mt =       + iMt_i   +
                             a2Yt
                                    +    +       + 5DEH   ÷        (17)


            The following version of the inflation equation (9) was estimated,

where DUM is a dummy variable that takes a value of zero up to 1967 and a

value of one from there onward.

            Finally, the exchange rate devaluation equation (10) was the

following:

            The estimation of (16) using two stages least squares yielded the

following result:



    Mt = -0.030 + 0.607 Mt1 +    0.318 y÷ 0.137 Pti 0.095 P + 0.125 DEHt
            (0.883) (14.067)     (0.768)    (1 .373)                  (2.776)        (2.3145)


                                                       D.W. =         2.03          SEE =    0.035


            The most interesting result from the estimation of this equation is

that it confirms the hypothesis that higher (domestic) prices of coffee have

resulted in short-run increases in the rate of money creation. As discussed

above, the mechanism through which this takes place is the accimulation of

international reserves that are monetized by the Central Bank. Also, esti-

mates of the coefficients of the lagged M suggest that the effect of changes

in coffee prices on money growth have some persistence through time. The

estimation of the money growth equation, then, provides statistical support to

the claim made by numerois authors [i.e., Weisner (1978), Urritia (1981)] that

in Colombia the ability to perform monetary policy has been hampered by the

dependence of money creation on the behavior of coffee prices. Also, these

results support the hypothesis that the process of money creation in Colombia

has been critically influenced by the behavior of the fiscal side of the
                                               — 21    -




 economy.    An increase in the fiscal deficit-—measured as a proportion of

 lagged base money--of 10 percentage points has resulted, on average, in an

 increase in the rate of growth of money of approximately 1.8 to 2.2
                                                                                     percentage
 points. This finding points out that the separation of the fisr'l and

 monetary sides in traditional macroeconomic analysis might not be fully

 applicable to LDCs. 20

            The estimation of the inflation equation using two stages least

squares yielded the following results:



        =    -0.006   +   0.705 Mt -   0.00      +    0.311 (Et+P) + 0.010
                                                                           DUMt
            (—0.729) (2.669)        (—0.363)          (2.182)         (0.31L)


                                                                             SEE =   0.060
                                                                            D.W. =   2.23
            With the exception of income growth and the dummy variable, the

coefficients are significant and have the expected signs. The coefficient of

Mt indicates that, with other things given, an increase in the rate of money

creation by 10 percentage points has resulted in an increase of inflation of

approximately 7 percentage points. On the other hand, according to the

coefficient of (E +
                           P)   ,   a higher rate of devaluation and/or higher world

inflation, will be passed on almost one—third to price increases. 21 As the

model indicates, the sum of the coefficients of                 and (Et +
                                                                            P)   is not

significantly different from one. However, the coefficient of real income

growth was, in all runs, insignificant.

           Finally,      the estimation of the crawling peg equation yielded:



       =   -0.006    +   1.333 P - 0.850        DUMt)
                                                        -   0.060    -   0.198      ÷    o.o3      DUMt
           (—0.119) (2.569)       (—1.678)              (—0.063)     (—1.6014)          (0.1469)


                                                              D.W. = 1.728       SEE =    0.108



           These results confirm the hypothesis that the Colombian authorities

have taken into account the behavior of world coffee prices when deciding by

how much to devalue the nominal exchange rate. Lower (higher) world coffee

prices result in higher (lower) rates of devaluation of the crawl. Also,

according to this equation, in the past——1967 period——after the crawling peg

was adopted--and with other things given, the exchange rate tended to be

adjusted by less than the ongoing domestic rate of inflation. On the other

hand, while the coefficient of the world rate of inflation is negative, as

expected, the absolute value of its point estimate is very small and not
                22
significant.



                                 VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

            In this paper, the interaction between changes in commodity export

prices and the real exchange rate has been investigated. tn Section II, a

model that relates coffee price changes to money creation, inflation and the

rate of devaluation was developed. The model was then estimated for

Colombia. A virtue of this model is that it highlights two of the channels

that have been traditionally pointed out in casual discussions on the effect

of commodity price changes on the real exchange rate: money creation and

inflation and the rate of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate (i.e., the

rate of devaluation of the crawling peg).
                                     — 23   -




          The model shows that commodity export booms will generally generate

short—run increases in money creation, inflation and a real appreciation. In

fact it is possible that the real appreciation generated through this channel

exceeds the "equilibrium" real appreciation resulting from the om. If this

boom is perceived as temporary, the real appreciation will be smaller, but

could still be significant.

         The model presented in this chapter was empirically tested for the

case of coffee in Colombia. Two approaches were taken in the empirical

section. First, a reduced form equation that relates changes in the real

exchange rate to changes in the price of coffee, and other exogenous vari-

ables, was estimated. The results obtained provided preliminary evidence

indicating that increases (reductions) in the world price of coffee have

indeed resulted in a real appreciation (depreciation). Second, the model

developed in Section II was explicitly tested using a simultaneous equation

approach. The results obtained indicate that coffee price changes have indeed

been closely related to money creation and inflation. Also, coffee price

changes have been negatively related to the rate of devaluation. These

results indicate that in Colombia, the real appreciation resulting from coffee

price increases has been accommodated, partially by money creation and infla-

tion, and partially by an adjustment in the nominal exchange rate. The model

used in this paper has been deliberately kept small and simple. As a result,

it has been possible to clearly pinpoint the role of coffee in the inflation-

ary and devaluation process. A cost of this approach, however, has been that

some simplifying assumptions had to be made.

5. totice that, for simplicity, the model ignores issues related to the

      demand for international reserves. For an integration of the demand for

      reserves literature with a balance of payments equilibrium analysis, see

      Edwards (19814b).

6.    For exact expressions for the a's in terms of the structural parameters,

      see Edwards (1986).

7. Notice that in defining the price level, we have assumed that the com-

      modity export does not enter into this index. This is a realistic assump-

      tion, since developing countries usually consume very little of their main

      export.

8. This equation is derived from assuming equilibrium in the non-tradables

      sector.

9. For expressions of the b's in terms of the structural parameters, see

      Edwards (1986).

10. In Edwards (1986) a more general rule of crawl is assumed.

11. It is also possible to define the real exchange rate as the PPP real

      rate. See Edwards (1986) for the derivation of a similar model, where the

      real exchange rate is defined in that way.

12. See, for example, Neary and van Wijnbergen (19814).

13. Notice that the model presented here has ignored the distinction between
      permanent and transitory changes in the price of coffee. In Edwards

        (1986) a similar model in developed where this distinction is explicitly

       taken into account.

1'1. On the Colombian economy see, for example, Diaz—AlejaridrO (1976), Ocampo

       (1983), Weisner (1978), Kamas (1983), World Bank (1983a, 198Th). Coffee

       represents approximately 55 percent of Colombia's foreign earnings from

       legal exports. It is important to notice that the presence of important

       illegal exports makes the empirical analysis of Colombia's external sector

       quite difficult. For obvious reasons there are no reliable data on the

       magnitude of these illegal transactions. On the importance of illegal

       exports in Colombia, see Junguito and Caballero (1978).

15. See Weisner (1978).

16. In that regard, the results from this reduced form can be viewed as pre-

       liminary, since they ignore the possible short—run effects of monetary

       variables.

17. The effect of commercial policies changes on the real exchange rate have

       traditionally been explained in the literature. In order to simplify the

       discussion, the model of Section II ignored commercial policy. However,

       the result reported in this section indicate that for the case of Colombia

       the effect of changes in trade taxes have not been very important in

       determining the behavior of the real exchange rate.

18. Some of the results reported in this subsection draw on Edwards (1986).

19. The positive effect of changes in coffee prices on the rate of money

       creation is very robist to changes in the specification in the money

       growth equation. For alternative specifications, see Edwards (1986).

20. These results are consistent with those reported in Hanson (1982).

21 .   See Edwards (1986) for a detailed analysis on alternative specifications

        of a crawling rule equation for Colombia.
