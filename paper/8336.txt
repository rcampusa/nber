Introduction

    The federal disability programs are the largest social transfer programs in the United States directed

towards non-elderly adults. Annual disability expenditures exceed that of welfare (TANF),

Unemployment Insurance, and the Earned Income Taxed Credit combined. In the past two decades, there

have been two important changes to these programs affecting eligibility and generosity. The first,

occurring in 1984, liberalized the disability determination process, reversing a dramatic reduction in the

disability beneficiary population that was underway. The second occurred more gradually. Because

disability benefits are indexed to the mean wage in the economy, the widening dispersion of earnings

throughout the 1980s and 1990s coupled with the progressivity of the disability benefits formula

substantially raised the effective replacement rate – the ratio of disability income to prior earnings – for

low skilled workers. Together, these changes appear to have induced unprecedented growth in disability

recipiency. From 1984 to 2000, the number of non-elderly adults receiving benefits from the Social

Security Disability Insurance (DI) and/or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs more than

doubled from 3.8 to 7.7 million. At present, 5.3 percent of adults ages 25 to 64 receive either SSI, DI or

both. Accompanying this growth, disability recipients became significantly younger and substantially

more likely to suffer from comparatively low mortality maladies such as mental disorders and pain.

    This paper assesses the contribution of program liberalization and rising replacement rates to the

labor market outcomes of low skilled individuals. After describing the recent evolution of the disability

program, we offer a simple dynamic programming model of the decision to apply for disability benefits as

a function of earnings, health, labor market conditions, and program generosity. Our model demonstrates

that because labor force non-participation is a de facto pre-condition for disability application, the

generosity of disability benefits – both replacement rates and screening stringency –have two distinct

effects on labor force participation among potential beneficiaries. The first is a ‘level’ effect. More liberal

program screening and higher benefit levels directly reduce the level of labor force participation among

potential beneficiaries. The second is an interaction effect. Because the unemployed face lower

opportunity costs of applying for disability than the employed – in particular, they do not have to leave

                                                                                                               1
employment – there is a subset of workers who will not apply for disability while employed but will

apply in the event of job loss. We refer to these individuals as ‘conditional applicants.’

    A primary implication of the model is that increasing program generosity and deteriorating labor

market conditions – circumstances facing the low skilled during the period under study – serve to expand

the relative size of this conditional group; and the sum of these two factors is more potent than their

individual components. As the model demonstrates, increasing program generosity and worsening labor

market conditions do not for the most part spur workers to exit employment directly; rather, they increase

the option value of disability application. Consequently, in the event of job loss, a greater fraction of

workers exercises this option by exiting the labor force to seek benefits. Hence, the secular changes in the

disability program since 1984 are likely to have reduced the aggregate unemployment rate by spurring job

losers to withdraw from the labor force.

    We take these predictions to the data in two stages. First, we exploit cross-state variation in the

administrative clampdown on disability awards over the period of 1979 to 1984 to study the effects of

program stringency on the level of labor force participation among low skilled workers, particularly high

school dropouts. Because the disability benefits formula is progressive but not indexed to regional wage

levels, workers in low wage states face significantly higher earnings replacement rates than workers in

high wage states. This gives rise to substantial cross-state variation in disability application and

recipiency rates. As we demonstrate, these cross-sectional differences interacted significantly with

national shifts in the supply of benefits during the retrenchment and reform periods. In particular, the

share of state residents deterred or encouraged to apply for benefits in each era depended significantly

upon effective state replacement rates.

    By exploiting these cross-state shifts in the effective supply of benefits, we estimate the impact of the

disability program on the level of labor force participation. During the retrenchment, the labor force

participation of males with less than a high school degree increased most in states with the largest

reductions in the supply of benefits, and vice versa during the subsequent liberalization. The estimates

indicate that these exogenous supply shifts raised male high school dropout labor force participation by as

                                                                                                            2
much as 5 percentage points over 1979 – 1984, and lowered it by a slightly larger amount thereafter.

Notably, no similar relationship between labor force participation and the supply of disability benefits is

observed for other education groups.

    We next explore the interaction of the disability program with adverse demand shocks. By exploiting

plausibly exogenous cross-state variation in labor demand shocks, we examine whether the sensitivity of

disability application and labor force exit to adverse demand shocks has increased as predicted by the

model. Following disability reform, application and award rates for given demand shocks rose secularly,

reaching two to three times their pre-reform levels by the 1990s. Paralleling this change was a substantial

increase in the rate of labor force exit among displaced high school dropouts. During the pre-reform era of

1978 – 1984, approximately 40 percent of high school dropouts who lost their jobs due to adverse

demand shocks transitioned into unemployment, while the remaining 60 percent exited the labor force.

From 1984 forward, however, the share entering unemployment in response to job loss declined

dramatically. Simple calculations suggest that increased disability application propensity is likely to

account for this behavioral change.

    To gauge the importance of this phenomenon, we calculate the demand contraction experienced by

high school dropouts over 1984 – 1998 to form a counterfactual labor force participation figure net of

disability. Our calculations suggest that the aggregate U.S. unemployment rate would at present be

approximately 0.65 percentage points higher were it not for the liberalization of the disability program in

1984. This estimate will be biased upwards if part of the reduced sensitivity of unemployment to adverse

demand shocks is due to other factors. Given that we consider the impact of the DI program only on the

12 percent of the population that is composed of high school dropouts, however, it seems plausible that

our estimates may potentially underestimate the total effect.1

1. Context: The federal disability programs

       The federal government provides cash and medical benefits to individuals with disabilities through

the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. The

medical eligibility criteria for the two programs are identical, requiring that an individual have a

medically determinable impairment that prevents him or her from engaging in “substantial gainful work.”

SSI benefits are means-tested and do not require any prior work history while DI benefits are an

increasing function of prior earnings and are not means-tested.2 To apply for benefits, an individual must

submit detailed medical, income, and asset information to a federal Social Security Administration (SSA)

office, which makes the disability determination.

a.     Clampdown and liberalization

       Since the founding of the DI program in 1956 and the federalization of SSI in 1973, the number of

individuals receiving disability benefits has risen substantially. During the late 1970s, a rapidly growing

disability recipient pool coupled with declining termination rates raised concerns that many ineligible

individuals were receiving disability benefits. In response, the Social Security Administration tightened

medical eligibility criteria and exercised firmer control over the state boards that interpret SSA’s

eligibility standards. Acceptance rates for both programs fell substantially. The fraction of DI applicants

awarded benefits fell from 45 percent in 1976 to 32 percent in 1980, accompanied by an even more

pronounced 19 percentage point decline in SSI acceptance rates.

       Augmenting this administrative action, Congress passed legislation in 1980 that increased the

frequency of health reassessments (Continuing Disability Reviews) for SSI and especially DI

beneficiaries. In the subsequent three years, more than 380,000 DI beneficiaries were terminated from the

program – more than 40 percent of those who had their cases reviewed (Rupp and Scott, 1998) – for no




labor market impacts of disability programs. Our study is unique in analyzing the interaction of program
liberalization, rising replacement rates, and adverse labor demand conditions in hastening the labor force exit of
less-skilled workers, thereby lowering aggregate unemployment.

    Approximately one-fourth of DI recipients also receive funds from SSI.

                                                                                                                     4
longer meeting medical standards. Additionally, Congress required the Social Security Administration to

tighten the medical eligibility criteria, leading to a further decline in award rates for both programs. These

dramatic reductions in benefits, occurring during the deepest U.S. recession in the post-war period, were

met by intense public criticism. Citing violations of due process, seventeen states officially refused to

comply with the disability review process during 1983 and 1984.

    In response, Congress passed legislation in 1984 that profoundly altered the application process for

both DI and SSI, yielding a more expansive definition of disability and permitting a greater exercise of

voice by applicants and their medical providers.3 SSI awards almost doubled from 1982 to 1986 while the

number of DI awards increased by 38 percent during the same time period. The Continuing Disability

Review process came to an almost complete halt; in the five years from 1985 through 1989, fewer

individuals were terminated for no longer meeting medical eligibility standards than were terminated in

the first five months of 1982.4

    Figure 1 shows the decline in disability beneficiaries accompanying the early 1980s clampdown and

the substantial increase following the 1984 liberalizations. Between 1984 and 1999, the number of adults

receiving disability benefits increased at an average annual rate of 4.6 percent, with 1999 cash benefits

paid out exceeding $70 billion.5 Also noteworthy in the figure is the fluctuating mortality rate of disability

recipients, which appears to inversely track program expansions.

  SSA was required to: 1) relax its strict screening of mental illness by placing less weight on diagnostic and medical
factors and relatively more on functional factors; 2) give highest weight to the source evidence provided by the
applicant’s own health care provider above the SSA’s own consultative exam; 3) give more consideration to pain
and related factors; 4) consider multiple non-severe impairments as constituting a disability (whereas prior to 1984
applicant were required to have at least one severe impairment; 5) desist in terminating benefits for any individual
for whom SSA could not demonstrate compelling evidence of health improvement; 6) provide benefits for those
former recipients whose terminations were under appeal; and 7) suspend Continuing Disability Reviews for mental
impairments and pain until appropriate guidelines could be developed. See Stapleton, et al (1998) for a detailed
discussion.
4
  In the post-1984 period, Congress made two additional changes that expanded the number of beneficiaries: in
1989, Congress directed SSA to conduct outreach to potentially eligible low-income individuals to inform them
about SSI benefits; and in 1991, Congress required SSA to place even more weight on the information provided by
an SSI or DI applicant’s own medical provider. An exception to this expansionary trend was Congress’ 1996
discontinuation of benefits for individuals who qualified for disability on the basis of alcohol and drug addiction,
resulting in the termination of approximately 130,000 beneficiaries (cf., Lewin, 1998).


                                                                                                                       5
b. Changes in the characteristics of DI and SSI recipients

       Accompanying the growth of the disability beneficiary population after 1984 are four demographic

shifts. First, as is visible in Figure 2, DI award rates for those under the age of forty more than doubled

from 1979 to 1993, while the corresponding rate for those aged 55-64 remained virtually unchanged.

Accordingly, the age of new recipients declined and the fraction of new awards accounted for by those

aged 40-54 rose significantly.6

       Second, as documented in Table 1A, new beneficiaries were increasingly likely to suffer from

impairments with comparatively low mortality. The share of DI awardees with a primary diagnosis of

mental disorder or disease of the musculo-skeletal system – the two disorders with the lowest mortality

among SSA’s fourteen major diagnostic categories (Hennessey and Dykacz, 1993) – grew by sixty

percent between 1983 and 1998. The corresponding shares for neoplasms and circulatory system diseases,

both of which have above-average mortality, declined by 40 percent. The overall mortality rate for DI

beneficiaries fell by approximately one-third from 1984 to 1999.7

       Third, while disability recipiency rates rose for all education groups, the increase was most

pronounced among high school dropouts. Data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation

(SIPP) compiled in Table 1B indicate that the share of high school dropouts receiving disability benefits

more than doubled between 1984 and 1999. At present, a 40 – 54 year old high school dropout is more

than four times as likely to receive federal disability benefits as an individual of the same age bracket who

has completed high school. As is shown in Table 1C, despite a decline in male high school dropout labor

force participation of 4 percent between 1984 and 1999, the share of high school dropout non-participants

receiving disability rose sharply, most markedly for males ages 25 – 39.

       Finally, the gender composition of the DI population became substantially more representative of the

 These changes in the age and impairment distribution of disability recipients have also substantially increased the
expected benefit recipiency duration of newer cohorts (Rupp and Scott, 1998).

                                                                                                                       6
overall population during this interval. In 1984, there were 2.06 male DI beneficiaries per female

beneficiary. By 1999, that ratio had fallen to 1.35.

c.    Rising replacement rates

      An overlooked factor that has likely contributed to the growth of the disability population since the

1984 liberalization is the rise in the earnings replacement rate. This rate rose steadily throughout the

1980s and 1990s due to an unforeseen but nonetheless quantitatively important interaction between the

disability benefits formula and the growth of earnings inequality in the U.S. (cf., Katz and Autor, 1999).

      An individual’s DI benefit is a concave function of prior earnings. To determine it, SSA first

calculates an individual’s Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME),
                       T

                       ∑ (earn ) avg. wage
                   1               avg. wageT
(1)       AIME =               t                ,
                   T   t =1                 t



roughly equal to an individual’s average monthly earnings (conditional on employment) indexed by

average wage growth in the U.S. economy. Benefits awarded (the Primary Insurance Amount or PIA)

depend on the AIME as follows:

where the ‘bend points’ ( b1, b2) are rescaled each year by average wage growth in the economy.

      As is clear from the concavity in this piecewise linear formula, low income workers replace a greater

share of their earnings with disability income. More subtly, the indexation of benefits to the mean wage in

the U.S. economy ensures that increases in U.S. earnings inequality benefit workers at the low end of the

earnings distribution. Because the bend points rise each year with the average nominal wage, workers

who experience wage growth below this average have a larger fraction of their wage income replaced on

the steeper sections of the PIA formula. In addition, because each worker’s potential benefits depend

upon his or her entire earnings history, workers whose wages grow more slowly than the national average




                                                                                                              7
will have an AIME in excess of their current earnings.8

     The distributional impacts of these attributes of the benefits formula are seen in Table 2. In 1979,

male workers ages 50 – 54 at the 10th percentile of the (age-specific) earnings distribution were able to

replace 53 percent of their earnings with disability income. By 1998, this number had increased to 63

percent. As the left-hand columns of Panel A demonstrate, approximately half of this increase is due to

the rise in the ‘bend points’ relative to the lower tail of the earnings distribution, with the other half due to

sluggish wage growth at the lower tail (which raises the AIME relative to current earnings). Moreover,

these figures understate the growth in the total replacement rate for low wage workers since they do not

account for the rising value of Medicare benefits provided to all DI recipients. By contrast, workers at the

90th percentile of the earnings distribution saw no increase in their replacement rate (excluding the value

of Medicare) over this time.9

     To summarize, the disability beneficiary population of 1999 is larger, younger, more female, less

likely to suffer from high mortality disorders, and inclusive of a far larger share of the less-skilled

population than the disability population of 1984. Since there is little evidence to suggest that the

prevalence of disabling illness has grown substantially over this time, it is likely that these changes are in

part explained by a more expansive definition of disability, changes in the determination process, and a

rising replacement rate.10



8
  Note that these effects are additive rather than offsetting. The earnings history effect raises the AIME, and the
indexation of the bend points raises the share of the AIME replaced at a more generous rate.
9
  Details of the construction of replacement rates are given in the Data Appendix. The benefits provided to SSI
recipients, though not dependent on prior earnings, have also grown rapidly over 1979 – 1998. For example,
nominal SSI benefits, which are indexed to the Consumer Price Index, increased by 133 percent between 1979 –
1998, relative to wage growth at the 10th percentile of earnings of only 75 percent. We focus on DI replacement rates
because the DI program is by design likely to be far more relevant to labor force participants.
10
   To be clear, this set of facts does not imply that current disability beneficiaries are undeserving. As Bound and
Waidmann stress (1992), the notion that disability is a dichotomous medical state is a false one. While a more
expansive definition of disability will accommodate a greater range of illness, this is a matter of societal choice
rather than medical certainty. Lakdawalla, Bhattacharya and Goldman (2001) present some evidence from health
self-reports that the incidence of asthma among the young has risen since 1984. However, they also note that growth
in self-reported disability is entirely accounted for by less educated individuals who are leaving the labor force at
greater rates; among the employed, there is no difference across education groups in the growth rate of disability.
Hence, we view their findings as consistent with a story that emphasizes changes in the supply of benefits rather

                                                                                                                      8
2. Model

a.    Structure

      To guide our empirical exploration of the labor market impacts of these programmatic changes, we

consider the steady state of a simple dynamic programming model of an individual’s decision to apply for

disability benefits. We assume that an individual has a per-period utility of work equal to u ( w) − e(h)

where the utility of work, assumed separable in health and earnings, is increasing in the wage rate, w , and

the disutility of effort, e(h) , is declining in health, h .11 We initially restrict attention to the case in which

neither w nor h is time varying and normalize the per-period utility of unemployment to zero.

      At the beginning of each period, both employed and unemployed individuals must decide whether to

apply for disability benefits. A disability applicant with health h will qualify for benefits with probability

p = p(h) , and we assume that this person can reapply for benefits if his application is rejected. An

unemployed worker who searches for a job will find one with probability q . Hence the value function for

an unemployed person is:

(3)       VU = max[ βpVD + β (1 − p)VU , qβVE + β (1 − q )VU ] ,

where β is the discount rate and V E and V D represent the value of employment and disability recipiency,

respectively.12 The first term is the expected utility of applying for disability benefits while the second

equals the corresponding value associated with searching for a job.

      Because the parameters in this equation are not time-varying, an individual’s optimal decision rule is

unchanged in the next period if he remains unemployed and thus the preceding equation simplifies to:

                    βPVD             βqV E 
(4)       VU = max               ,               
                   1 − β (1 − p ) 1 − β (1 − q ) 



than shifts in underlying health. Bound and Waidmann (2000) also stress that the incidence of self-reported
disability among males responds markedly to changes in the generosity of the disability program.
11
  In modeling the disability application decision as a function of both health and the disutility of work, we follow
the approach of Diamond and Sheshinski (1995). See also Hausman and Halpern (1986) and Benitez-Silva et al.
(2000) for theoretical and empirical analyses of the application decision.


                                                                                                                       9
All else equal, an unemployed individual will be more likely to apply for disability benefits if her

probability of qualifying is higher, the program is more generous, or the reemployment odds are lower.

       Employed workers will choose between working and applying for disability benefits. Consistent with

the eligibility requirements, we assume that an individual cannot work while applying for the program

and therefore must exit employment (either voluntarily or involuntarily) to apply. If an individual chooses

to remain employed, she receives a net utility of u ( w) − e(h) in the current period and retains her job in

the subsequent period with probability (1 − s ) . If instead she finds it optimal to exit employment to apply

for disability benefits, then she will also find it optimal to re-apply while unemployed if her application is

rejected. Once the application is accepted, she will not voluntarily leave the program. Hence, the asset

value of disability recipiency, V D , simplifies to VD = u (d ) (1 − β ) , with u (d ) representing the per-period

utility of receiving disability benefits, d . The value of applying for disability is therefore equal to V D

discounted by the expected time to an award. The value of employment is thus:

                                                                βPVD 
            VE = max  u ( w) − e(h) + β ((1 − s )VE + sVU ),
                                                              1 − β (1 − p ) 
(5)
                     

Notice that the value of the first term will depend on whether in the event of job loss, an individual

chooses to search for work or to apply for disability benefits.

b. Comparison of steady states

       Using this structure, we compare the steady states of the model under different labor market ( q and

s ) and program generosity conditions ( d and p ). We are particularly interested in two questions: How

do these parameters impact the propensity of workers to leave employment to apply for disability

benefits? And how do they impact the probability that conditional on job loss, workers leave the

unemployment pool to seek benefits? We refer to the first impact as the ‘level effect’ of the disability

program on labor force participation. We refer to the second as the ‘interaction’ between the disability




12
     The constant discount rate implicitly captures both time discounting and a constant mortality risk.

                                                                                                               10
program and labor demand conditions, since this force is only operative when workers experience adverse

employment shocks.

       Given the structure of the disability application process, employed workers will optimally choose one

of three actions in each period: (1) quit employment to apply for disability; (2) remain in employment but

apply for disability conditional on unemployment and (3) remain in the labor force and not seek disability

benefits. We label these groups (a), (c), and (n) respectively (for always apply, conditionally apply, and

never apply). Using equation (4) and the first term in equation (5) to solve for the value of employment

for groups (c) and (n), the resulting expression for VE = max[Vea ,Vec ,Ven ] is:

                      βpVD            v(1 − β (1 − p)) + βpsVD           v(1 − β (1 − p ))       
(6)         VE = max               ,                               ,                             
                     1 − β (1 − p ) (1 − β (1 − s ))(1 − β (1 − p)) (1 − β )(1 − β (1 − q − s )) 

Individuals with a low net utility of work – either because of low wages, ill health, or some combination

of the two – are likely to fall into category (a), while the (n) group will be made up of relatively high

wage earners and/or those in good health. Finally, group (c) consists of “conditional applicants” –

individuals who choose to remain in their job but who optimally apply for disability benefits rather than

search for a job once they become unemployed.

       Figure 3 displays a simulation of the value of these three actions as a function of an individual’s per

period net utility of work.13 As is clear from the figure, the value of employment to the non-applicants (n)

rises more steeply with increases in u ( w) − e(h) than does the corresponding value for conditional

applicants (c). Logically, the value of exiting the labor force to apply for benefits is independent of

u ( w) − e(h) ; once a worker exits the labor force, she will optimally choose not to return. The key point

underscored by this figure is that that the value of employment for individuals at differing levels of

u ( w) − e(h) , is equal to the upper envelope of these three value functions (denoted by the dashed line in

Figure 3). Consequently, the salient question for our analysis is how do the parameters of the disability




13
     Parameter values for the simulation are β = 0.9 , p = 0.5 , u (d ) = 1 , s = 0.1 , and q = 0.5 .


                                                                                                              11
program and the state of the labor market impact the proportion of workers pursuing each action.

       Define u~AC as the net utility of work u ( w) − e(h) at which an individual is indifferent between exiting

the labor force immediately to apply for benefits and applying for benefits only in the event of job loss:

Vea (u~AC ) = Vec (u~AC ) . Similarly, define u~CN as the net utility of work at which an individual is indifferent

between applying in the event of job loss and never applying.14 Solving for u~AC and u~CN yields:

                          βp                              pu (d )   1 − β (1 − q − s ) 
(7)         u~AC =                  u (d ) ,   u~CN =                              .
                     1 − β (1 − p )                       q   1 − β (1 − p ) 

Factors that move u~CN rightward will increase the size of the “conditional applicant” group at the expense

of the “never apply” group. Factors that move u~AC rightward will increase the size of the “always apply”

group at the expense of the “conditional applicant” group. Factors that move both u~CN and u~AC rightward

will increase the size of the total applicant pool and shrink the size of the non-applicant pool, while

leaving the net impact on the size of the “conditional group” ambiguous.

       Initially, we consider how labor market conditions ( q and s ) affect equilibrium behavior.

Observe that u~AC does not depend on either the job loss or reemployment odds. To see the intuition for

this result, consider an individual who is indifferent between immediate and delayed (until job loss)

disability application. Indifference at u~AC implies that the per-period utility of employment is identical to

the expected per-period utility of disability application. Accordingly, changes in the rate of job loss, s ,

that hasten or delay the moment of disability application have no impact on u~AC . Furthermore, as noted

above, once an individual leaves the labor market to apply for benefits, it is never optimal for her to

return, implying that u~AC is also independent of q .

       Hence, comparing across steady states of the model, it is apparent that changes in labor market



14
     Note we are implicitly assuming that p is constant. In reality, p will depend upon h . It is therefore useful to
consider this exercise as applying to a given individual with health h and p(h) > 0 . In this case, Figure 3 depicts
an individual’s optimal decision rule for differing values of w , holding hi constant.


                                                                                                                        12
conditions do not affect the size of the group that directly exits current employment to seek benefits.15

Instead, adverse shifts raise the option value of disability application, thereby increasing the size of the

conditional applicant group. Because increases in s and declines in q reduce the value of job search, it is

straightforward to show that the search/apply utility threshold, u~CN , increases with s and falls with q .

Pictorially, higher s and/or lower q move u~CN in Figure 3 rightward while leaving u~AC unaffected.

Consequently, poorer labor market conditions among the potential applicant population (i.e., p(h) > 0 )

unambiguously increase the share of workers who choose to exercise the option of applying for benefits

in the event of job loss.16

     Now consider an increase in the generosity of the disability program, either through benefit increases

or reductions in screening stringency – both of which are likely to have occurred between 1984 and 1999.

Logically, increases in d and p shift both u~AC and u~CN rightward, increasing the fraction of individuals

who apply for benefits. As the disability program becomes more generous, the share of employed and

unemployed seeking benefits increases unambiguously and the corresponding share that never applies

declines. Hence, increases in program generosity exert a ‘level effect’ on labor force participation by

directly inducing some workers to leave employment to seek benefits. Moreover, it is straightforward to

show that ∂u~CN ∂d > ∂u~AC ∂d and ∂u~CN ∂p > ∂u~AC ∂p . That is, increases in d and p shift the

conditional/never margin, u~CN , farther rightward than they shift the always/conditional margin, u~AC . This




15
   Of course, higher s implies greater flows into the disability applicant pool. Note that the result that u~AC is
independent of s and q derives in part from our assumption that w is fixed – workers keeps their wages until job
loss. More realistically, if w varies with s and q , deterioration in labor market conditions may induce some
individuals to exit employment to apply for benefits. While our assumption that w is constant is clearly too stark, it
is qualitatively consistent with the empirical evidence that wages of incumbent workers are substantially more
sheltered from labor market conditions than are new market entrants (cf., Beaudry and DiNardo, 1991).
16
   The responsiveness of the size of the group in the region u~AC – u~CN to changes in either q or s is likely to be
significant. For the parameter values used in Figure 3, an increase in s from 0.10 to 0.15 increases the width of this
region by more than 23 percent, while a reduction in q from 0.50 to 0.40 increases it by approximately 25 percent.
If, for example, the distribution of net utilities was uniform, these changes would induce correspondingly large
increases in conditional applicants flows.

                                                                                                                    13
suggests that the size of the conditional applicant group will also grow in response to an increase in

program generosity, although this prediction is formally ambiguous without further assumptions on the

distribution of net utilities.17

     Finally, we find that the level of generosity of the disability program interacts positively with adverse

labor market conditions to increase the size of the conditional applicant group. More formally, the cross-

partial derivatives ∂ 2 u~NC ∂d∂s and ∂ 2 u~NC ∂p∂s are strictly positive while ∂ 2 u~NC ∂d∂q and ∂ 2 u~NC ∂p∂q

are strictly negative. By contrast, all four corresponding cross-partial derivatives for the

always/conditional threshold, u~AC , are zero. Hence, the more generous are program benefits or the less

stringent is program screening, the more that adverse labor market conditions increase the size of the

conditional group.18

c.   Time varying wages and health

     While our framework makes the implausible assumption that neither wages nor health are stochastic,

there are three reasons to think that dynamic considerations reinforce our conclusion that increasing

program generosity raises the propensity of the unemployed to exit the labor force. First, it is likely that

the expectation of w for an individual declines with job loss (Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan, 1993),

thereby raising the attractiveness of disability to the unemployed relative to the employed. Second, the

calculation of benefits under the disability program ensures that a worker whose wages are growing more

slowly than the national average who remains in his job will enjoy a substantial gain in annual disability

payments because of the indexation of past wages. Finally, to the extent that health deteriorates over time

for many individuals who consider applying for this program, there is a gain associated with waiting



17
  This implication will hold provided that (1) the density function of net utilities is weakly monotonically increasing
in u ( w) − e(h) below its mean and (2) conditional on p and d , u~AC and u~CN are both below the mean of the net
utility distribution. Many distributions, including the normal and uniform, satisfy (1).
18
  Of course, after sufficient time had elapsed in the model, all “conditional applicants” would have exited the labor
force, at which point the program would exert no further effect on their unemployment propensity. Hence, it is
useful to think of the model as applying to a single cohort of workers, with new cohorts entering the market
continuously. Note that individuals must typically participate in the labor market for several years to qualify for DI
benefits.

                                                                                                                     14
because of an increase in the probability of qualifying for benefits.

      Hence, our model provides ample reason to suspect that liberalization of the disability program – that

is, lower screening stringency and rising replacement rates – coupled with declining labor market

prospects for the low skilled (Juhn, 1992; Juhn, Murhpy and Topel, 1991) are likely to have both

decreased labor force participation and increased the propensity of job losers to exit the labor force to

seek disability benefits.

3. Disability and labor force participation: Level effects

      We begin the empirical analysis by exploiting the disability retrenchment of 1979 – 1984 and

subsequent liberalization over 1984 – 1998 as a quasi-experiment for studying the impact of disability

benefits on the level of labor force participation. The equation we would initially like to estimate is:

(8)       P[ LFPi ] = P[α + β 1 g ( REPi , p (hi )) + β 2Wi + β 3 hi + X i β 4 > −ε i ] ,

where LFPi is a dichotomous variable equal to one if individual (i) is a labor force participant, Wi is the

market wage, hi is individual health, X i is a vector of individual characteristics, ε is a normally

distributed error term, and g ( REPi , p (hi )) is a DI benefits ‘supply function’ which is increasing in an

individual’s replacement rate, REPi , and in her probability of obtaining benefits conditional on

application, p(hi ) . In this equation, we expect that β 1 < 0 and β 2 , β 3 > 0 .

      There are a number of problems in estimating this equation, however. First, we cannot simultaneously

observe REPi and Wi for a given individual. Second, objective measures of hi (and p(hi ) ) are typically

unavailable from survey data sources. And, finally, as stressed by Bound (1989), because individuals with

poor health are likely to command lower wages, omission of hi from (8) will bias estimates of β 2 and to

the degree that REPi and hi are correlated with Wi , β 1 as well.

      To surmount these obstacles, we estimate a state level analog of (8) in first differences,

(9)       ∆LFPjT = α + β1 ∆g (⋅) jT + β 2 ∆W jT + β 3 ∆h jT + ∆X jT β 4 + ε jT ,

where (j) subscripts the 50 U.S. states excluding the District of Columbia and ∆ denotes the first


                                                                                                               15
difference operator. As an empirical analog to ∆g (⋅) , we initially use the observed contemporaneous state

level changes in DI and SSI recipiency ( ∆DI jT , ∆SSI jT ). Subsequently, we apply an instrumentation

strategy to circumvent possible endogeneity in this measure. Estimates of (9) also control for changes in

the age structure by state-education group. Since conditional on age and education average wage and

health changes are likely to be common across states, we do not control for these variables directly but

rather allow them to be absorbed by α .

a.     OLS Estimates

       Table 3 presents initial estimates of (8). We perform separate estimates for high school dropouts and

those who have completed high school. The first specification, which parameterizes disability recipiency

as the sum of the change in DI and SSI recipiency, indicates that changes in disability recipiency from

1979 - 1984 are significantly negatively related to contemporaneous changes in the labor force

participation of high school dropout males. A one percentage point increase in disability recipiency is

predicted to reduce male high school dropout labor force participation by 3.2 percentage points. Since

high school dropouts compose a far larger share of the disability recipient population than their share in

the workforce, this coefficient is of reasonable magnitude.19 Notably, when changes in DI and SSI

recipiency are entered separately into this equation, it is only the change in DI recipiency that is

significantly related to the change in labor force participation.20

       Columns (3) and (4) display analogous estimates for the labor force participation of high school

dropout males during 1984 – 1998. Despite the fact that the disability program was contracting rapidly

during 1979 – 1984 and expanding thereafter, the estimated impacts of disability recipiency levels on

labor force participation are quite similar in the post-reform era. Hence, male high school dropouts were

differentially entering the labor force in states with large reductions in disability recipiency during the



19
  Using CPS data, we calculate that male high school dropouts composed on average 7.9 percent of the labor force
during 1984 to 1998. SIPP data indicate that the male high school dropout share of all disability recipients was
approximately 25 percent in 1999.
20
     This finding is logical since DI recipients must have several years of work experience in covered employment to

                                                                                                                   16
retrenchment and differentially exiting in high disability growth states following the liberalization.

    Columns (5) – (8) of Table 4 display comparable specifications for the labor force participation of

males with a high school education or greater. Consistent with the patterns in Table 1, the estimated

relationships between changes in disability recipiency and changes in male labor force participation are

much weaker for more educated workers and are generally insignificant.

    As noted above, the absolute growth in DI recipiency per population was slightly larger among

females than males over 1984 – 1998. Hence, we provide estimates in Panel B of Table 3 comparable to

those above for the labor force participation of women. Although the point estimates are less precise here

than in the corresponding male estimates, we again find that DI but not SSI recipiency is negatively

related to the labor force participation of high school dropouts during both the retrenchment and reform

periods. No similar relationship is detected for females with a high school education or greater.

b. Instrumental Variables Estimates

    A concern with the Table 3 estimates is that growth in disability benefits at the state level may be

driven by changes in the ‘supply’ of benefits – due to the program retrenchment and reform – and by

changes in the ‘demand’ for benefits due to earnings and health shocks. Depending on the cross-state

correlation between supply and demand shocks, the Table 3 estimates may be biased either upward or

downward. To address this concern, we note that the key intervening variable that potentially links labor

force participation and disability recipiency is disability application: an individual cannot receive

disability without applying for benefits and cannot apply for benefits while employed. Hence, factors that

exogenously impact the supply of disability benefits will induce corresponding changes in the flow of

applications, which can then be used to identify the characteristics of the marginal group of applicants –

in particular the extent to which they are drawn from the labor force.

    Concretely, consider a variant of (8) where the dichotomous outcome variable is an individual’s

decision to apply for disability benefits:



qualify for DI benefits. No work history is required to qualify for SSI.

                                                                                                           17
(10)        P[ Apply i ] = P[α + β 1 REPi + β 2 P (hi ) + β 3 REPi ⋅ P (hi ) + β 3Wi + β 4 hi + X i β 5 > − µ i ] .

In this equation, we have taken a linear approximation to the ‘disability supply function’

g ( REPi , p(hi )) where βˆ1 = g1 (⋅) , βˆ 2 = g 2 (⋅) and βˆ3 = g12 (⋅) . Our expectation is that β 1 , β 2 , β 3 > 0 .

Aggregating (10) to the state level and taking first differences, we obtain:

            ∆Apply jT = α + β 1 ∆REPjT + β 2 ∆P( h jT ) + β 3 [ REPjT PT (h jT ) − REPjt Pt ( h jt )]
(11)
                         + β 4 ∆W jT + β 5 ∆h jT + ∆X jT β 6 + ε jT

where ∆Apply jT is the change in the application flow over two points in time as a function of the supply

and demand for benefits. Note that in this equation, we add a time subscript to the screening function

Pt (h) to indicate that screening stringency differs between the retrenchment and reform periods.

       To obtain exogenous variation in the supply of benefits, we exploit the fact that the DI benefits

formula is progressive but is not indexed to regional wage levels. As a result, workers in low wage states

face significantly higher earnings replacement rates.21 Consistent with this fact, workers in high

replacement rate states have higher rates of disability application and recipiency at a point in time, as is

visible in Panel A of Figure 4. This state level variation in DI replacement rates provides us with two

candidate instruments for identifying plausibly exogenous cross-state shifts in the supply of DI benefits.

First, during the retrenchment of 1979 – 1984, SSA applicant screening stringency rose substantially (i.e.,

∆PT (h j ) < 0 ). Provided that β 3 ≠ 0 – that is, the impact of screening stringency on disability applications

varies with the replacement rate – the interaction of increasing screening stringency with cross-state

variation in replacement rates will induce differential state level reductions in the supply of DI benefits

over 1979 – 1984.22 This relationship is readily detectable in Panels B and C of Figure 4, which plot

simulated state 1979 replacement rates against ensuing state disability population reductions and



21
  A regression of mean log male high school dropouts wages by state in 1984 on the simulated replacement rate
variable and a constant yields a coefficient of –4.31 with t-ratio of 9.0 (R2 = 0.63).
22
     Note that we assume that ∆Pt (h j ) is approximately uniform across states and hence will be absorbed by α in
(11).

                                                                                                                           18
expansions during 1978 – 84 and 1984 – 98.

       Second, as discussed above, rising U.S. earnings dispersion induced substantial increases in effective

DI replacement rates over 1979 – 1998. This effect was not uniform across states, however. Because

workers in low wage states replace a larger fraction of their earnings on the steeper sections of the

progressive earnings replacement formula, effective replacement rates rose by considerably more in low

wage states. This exogenous variation in ∆REPjT will again induce differential state level increases in the

supply of DI benefits over 1984 – 1998 provided that β 1 > 0 .23

       To implement this instrumental variables approach empirically, we estimate a version of (9) where we

replace ∆g (⋅) jT with ∆Apply jT , the change in the state level flow of disability applications, and

instrument this variable using levels and changes in projected state level DI replacement rates. To form an

estimate of the change in the state level flow of applications, ∆Apply jT , we multiply the difference in the

level of DI applications per populations at the start and end years of a time interval (i.e., 1979 – 84, 1984

– 98) by the number of elapsed years. We estimate state level replacement rates and their changes as a

function both of the increasing effective generosity of DI benefits (equations (1) and (2)) and the

changing age distribution in each state. As above, we control for state level changes in the age distribution

of the relevant gender-education group.

       An additional complication for our estimation is that over 1979 – 1984, a large number of disability

beneficiaries – approximately 560 thousand – were terminated during the Continuing Disability Review

process for no longer meeting medical eligibility criteria. Although the fraction of recipients terminated

was likely to be roughly equivalent across states, these reductions may imply proportionately larger

reductions in the fraction of state residents receiving benefits in high replacement rate states (where the

initial recipiency rate was far higher). On the assumption that a share of terminated beneficiaries is likely



23
     In theory, it would also be possible to use cross-state changes in ∆REPjT over 1979 – 1984 to instrument changes
in the supply of benefits. In practice, we are not able to estimate these cross-state shifts with sufficient precision over
this short term interval.

                                                                                                                        19
to have reentered the labor force in these states (cf., Bound, 1989), failing to account for the terminated

beneficiaries would cause us to overestimate the labor force participation propensity of the marginal

applicant.24 To handle this potential bias, we make the conservative assumption that the marginal

terminated beneficiary has one half the labor force participation propensity of the marginal applicant.25

Accordingly, we add to ∆Apply j ,79 −84 one half of the number of estimated state level beneficiaries

terminated per state population during these years.26

     Table 4 presents OLS and instrumental variables estimates of the relationship between DI

applications and labor force participation of high school dropouts and high school completers by gender

for 1979 – 84 and 1984 – 1998. Column (1) of Panel A presents an initial OLS estimate for male high

school dropouts. Over 1979 – 1984, reductions in DI applications are associated with increases in labor

force participation of male high school dropouts: a 1 percentage point increase in the rate of disability

applications per state population is associated with a 1.66 percentage point decline in male high school

dropout labor force participation.

     Because of the concern that this estimate may be biased by the endogeneity of the applications

variable, we instrument the change in applications, ∆Apply j ,79 −84 , by the state level replacement rate in

1979.27 The coefficient of –5.23 on the instrumented application rate variable indicates that a one-half



24
  This follows because the reduction in applicants per population and the share of beneficiaries terminated per
population over 1979 – 1984 were both positively correlated with state level replacement rates. Our data indicate
that applications fell by approximately 7 per thousand state residents over 1979 – 84. During the same period, the
number of beneficiaries terminated was approximately 5 per thousand state residents.
25
  Bound (1989) estimates that approximately 50 percent of rejected disability applicants over 1972 – 1998 re-
entered the labor force. Assuming this estimate applies to the marginal applicants in our sample, our assumption
implies that 25 percent of terminated beneficiaries would re-enter the labor force.
26
  It is important to note that the number of beneficiaries terminated by state is not available from SSA. To impute
this number, we allocate the national count of terminations over 1979 – 1984 to states according to their observed
reduction in DI applications per population over 1979 – 1984. This adjustment does not qualitatively change the sign
or statistical significance of our findings, but does of course reduce (by about 30 percent) the implied impact of
exogenous reductions in DI applications on labor force participation. A variety of alternative allocation schemes –
for example, using changes in recipient count or initial recipiency as allocation weights – lead to near identical
results.
27
  The first stage coefficient is given in the footer of each column of the table. In all cases, the first stage is highly
significant. The magnitude of the first stage coefficient (-0.025) does not have a clear structural interpretation since

                                                                                                                        20
percentage point decrease in applications per population induced by the growing screening stringency

during 1979 – 1984 caused a corresponding increase in high school dropout male labor force participation

of approximately 2.5 percentage points. Note that this impact is of reasonable magnitude: over 1979 –

1984, approximately one-eight of all labor force participants were male high school dropouts, relative to

fifty percent of disability recipients.

    Columns (3) – (5) of Table 4 present similar estimates for 1984 – 1998. These models confirm that an

exogenous increase in the supply of DI benefits increases the flow of DI applications and reduces the

labor force participation of male high school dropouts. The point estimates for these models are

comparable to albeit slightly smaller in magnitude than the instrumental variables estimates for 1979 – 84.

One noteworthy feature of these estimates is that our instruments in the pre-1984 versus post-1984 period

use different sources of variation (levels versus changes of the replacement rate) and have opposite

impacts on the level of DI applications. Yet the implied impact of increases in the supply of benefits on

the labor force participation of high school dropout males is comparable across periods. This enhances

our confidence that the findings are not artifactual or idiosyncratic to a single episode of disability

program reform.

    A reduced form version of these relationships is depicted in Figure 5. This figure plots 1979 state

replacement rates against levels and changes of male high school dropout labor force participation for

1979 to 1998. Consistent with the IV estimates, the figure underscores that the interaction of cross-state

variation in replacement rates with changes in program stringency exerted a noticeable effect on

participation rates of high school dropouts over both 1979 – 84 and 1984 – 98.

    Panel B of Table 4 presents analogous estimates for female high school dropouts. Although the

instrumental variables coefficients are only marginally significant for females, the point estimates again

suggest that exogenous increases in the supply of disability benefits reduce the labor force participation of




it measures the impact on applications of the interaction between the state replacement rate and an unobserved
variable, the national change in screening stringency for marginal applicants.

                                                                                                                 21
less skilled females.28 Consistent with earlier findings, the OLS and IV estimates detect no significant

impact of the changing supply of disability benefits on the labor force participation of males and females

with a high school degree or greater.

     To summarize, the data suggest that the stringency and generosity of the disability regime has an

important direct effect on the labor force participation of low-skilled individuals, particularly high school

dropouts of both genders. The point estimates indicate that the disability retrenchment during 1979 – 84

raised male high school dropout labor force participation by as much as 4.7 percentage points in high

replacement relative to low replacement rate states. And during the ensuing 14 years, liberalization of the

disability program induced a similarly large relative percentage point drop in high school dropout labor

force participation among high replacement states – on the order of 7.2 percentage points.29 Though less

precisely estimated, the point estimates suggest that the labor force impacts on female high school

dropouts were about two-thirds as large.

4. The interaction of disability with adverse employment shocks

     Because the unemployed intrinsically face lower opportunity costs of labor force withdrawal, the

disability program is likely to differentially attract applications from the unemployed. Moreover, as our

model indicates, reductions in disability screening stringency, increases in program generosity, and

deterioration in labor market conditions all serve to increase the relative attractiveness of disability

application for the unemployed relative to the employed – raising the share likely to exit the labor force in




28
  It is not altogether surprising that the simulated replacement rate instrument has essentially no explanatory power
for the labor force participation rate of female high school dropouts since it is calculated for males only. Given the
rapidly shifting patterns of labor force participation among women during this period, calculating comparable
earnings simulations for women presents a significant challenge that we have not undertaken.
29
  For example, the simulated replacement rate was 7.26 percentage points higher in Arkansas than Washington in
1979, which implies a differential decline in applications per population of 0.90 percentage points (100*(.0726)*(-
0.025)*5) over 1979 – 1984. Using the 2SLS coefficient from column (2) of Table 4, this implies a relative increase
in male high school dropout labor force participation of 4.7 percentage points (0.90*5.23) in Arkansas versus
Washington during these five years. Between 1984 and 1998, the simulated replacement rate rose by 1.1 percentage
points more in Arkansas than Washington (4.92 versus 3.82 percentage points), implying a differential increase in
DI applications per population of 2.2 percentage points (100*(0.011*2.005) over 1984 – 1998, and a differential
decline in male high school dropout labor force participation of 7.2 percentage points (0.022*(–3.25)).

                                                                                                                     22
the event of job loss.30

       To explore the whether the disability program has indeed served to induce labor force exit among job

losers, we first ask whether the responsiveness of disability application to plausibly demand exogenous

shocks has risen secularly since the disability reforms of 1984. Next, we measure whether the probability

that a worker exits the labor force conditional on job loss has increased commensurately. We finally

perform simple calculations to explore whether the increase in application propensity could plausibly

explain the change in the conditional probability of labor force exit that we observe in the data. Our

approach in this section is similar in spirit to Black, Daniel and Sanders (1998) who study the impact of

shocks to coal prices on SSI income in mining intensive counties.31

a.     Labor demand shocks

       To implement these tests, we require a measure of plausibly exogenous labor demand shocks.

Following the approach developed by Bartik (1991) and employed by Blanchard and Katz (1991) and

Bound and Holzer (2000), we exploit cross-state differences in industrial composition and national-level

changes in employment to predict individual state employment growth. Specifically, we calculate the

predicted log employment change η̂ jT for each state (j) between years (t) and (T) as:

(12)       η̂ jT = ∑ γ jkt ⋅ η jkT
                    k



where η jkT is the log change in 2-digit industry (k’s) employment share nationally between (t) and (T)

and γ jkt is the share of state employment in industry (k) in state (j) in the initial year (t). The subscript j

in η jkT indicates that each state’s industry (k) employment is excluded when calculating the national

employment share change.32



30
  Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data for 1968 to 1991, Daly (1998) finds that 50 percent of DI recipients
experienced job loss in the 5 years prior to receiving benefits. Her analysis does not explore whether the probability
of applying for benefits conditional on job loss has become more prevalent with time.
31
  See also Lewin-VHI, Inc. (1995), Rupp and Stapleton (1995) and Stapleton et al. (1998) for evidence on the
importance of the economic climate to disability application and recipiency.
32
     In excluding own state employment, our projected employment changes differ from those used by the authors

                                                                                                                    23
       This methodology predicts what each state’s change in employment would be if industry level

employment changes occurred uniformly across states and state-level industrial composition was fixed in

the short term. Accordingly, states with a relatively large share of workers in declining industries will

have predicted employment declines, while those states differentially employing workers in growing

industries will have predicted increases. Provided that national industry growth rates (excluding own state

industry employment) are uncorrelated with state level labor supply shocks, this approach will identify

plausibly exogenous variation in state employment.

b. The impact of labor demand shocks on disability applications and recipiency

       As above, we use state level data to estimate an aggregate version of an individual decision problem:

(13)        P[ Apply i | Job Loss i ] = P[α + β 1 g ( REPi , P (hi )) + B3 β 2Wi + β 4 hi + X i β 5 > −ε i ] ,

where g (⋅) represents the ‘disability supply’ function as above. The coefficient of interest is β 1 , the

impact of the supply of disability benefits on the probability that an individual seeks benefits in the event

of job loss.33

       To implement this equation at the state level, we estimate:

(14)        ( APPS POP) jT = α + γg (⋅)ηˆ jT + β1 ∆WT + β 2 ∆h jT + ∆X jT β 3 + δ T + ε jT ,

where the dependent variable is the cumulative count of unique DI applications per population in state (j)

between the years t and T , η̂ jT is the contemporaneous predicted state log relative demand shock from

(12), δ T is a vector of time dummies, and other variables are defined as above.34 In practice, we do not

observe ∆h jT , but we assume that health shocks are unlikely to be correlated with η̂ jT and hence their




cited earlier. We found that including own-state employment substantially increased the predictive power of the
employment projections, a pattern that left us concerned about a potential mechanical relationship.
33
  Note that implicit in this equation is the condition that individual (i) did not already exit the labor force to apply
for disability prior to job loss (i.e., the ‘main effect’ of disability on labor force participation). Hence, this equation
specifically measures the interaction of disability with job loss in inducing labor force exit.
34
     Note that because ( APPS / POP) jT measures the inflow of new applicants, it is intrinsically a flow variable –
conceptually similar to specifying the change in the DI recipiency rate ( ∆DI jT ) as the dependent variable.


                                                                                                                          24
omission will not bias estimates of γ .35 Since there are conceptual problems in measuring ∆W jT at the

state level, we omit it from the estimates but return to the question of regional variability in wages in

section 5 below. As with the prior estimates, g (⋅) T is not observed directly, but will not bias the estimates

provided that it is approximately constant across states.36 Hence, this approach allows us to identify

γˆ ≈ g (⋅) T ⋅ γ . The key empirical prediction of our model is that because g (⋅) 79−84 < g (⋅) 84−98 , we have

γˆ84−98 > γˆ79−84 , i.e., the demand shock-disability application locus should become steeper with time.

       Before turning to estimates, Figure 6 presents a plot of the unconditional relationship between

projected demand shocks and state level DI application flows during four, five-year sub-intervals of 1979

– 1998.37 These panels reveal two key patterns. First, there is a robustly significant relationship between

plausibly exogenous state level demand shocks and observed disability applications in each period.

Second, the responsiveness of application rates to demand shocks rises secularly in each subsequent five-

year sub-period. In the final panel, the slope has increase five-fold.38

       To explore these relationships more formally, Table 5 presents estimates of equation (14) for 1978 –

84 and 1984 – 98. We estimate this equation using observations spaced at three-year intervals to increase

precision and reduce possible serial correlation in the state level demand shock measure.39 The first



35
  Ruhm (2000) presents evidence that adverse demand shocks may lead to positive health shocks, which would
therefore work against finding that adverse demand shocks increase the number of disabled.
36
     In addition, the main effect of g (⋅) T will be absorbed by time dummies. Although we could also attempt to
estimate gˆ (⋅) by state, the over-time variation in gˆ (⋅) during 1984 – 1998 is substantially more pronounced than
the cross-state variation, and hence the power of this approach in the interacted specification is low. Note that
because η̂ jT is mean zero by construction, it does not exert a main effect.
37
  Because 1998 is the most recent year of DI application data available to us, we use one year of overlapping data in
forming Panels C and D of the figure.
38
  An analogous plot of the relationship between shocks and DI recipiency per state population confirms that
increases in application propensity yielded conformable increase in the population of disability recipients.
39
  For 1978 – 1984 estimates, we use changes for 1978–81 and 1981–84. For 1984 – 1998 estimates, we use changes
for 1984–87, 1987–90, 1990–93, 1993–96, and (imperfectly) 1995–98. All models include year dummies and
controls for the education, gender, and age composition of state populations in each year. So, for example, for the
period 1978 – 1981, the dependent variable is the sum of applications per population over 1979 to 1981, and η̂ jt is
the predicted state level log employment change for 1978 – 1981. We experimented with using observations at one,

                                                                                                                       25
column indicates that during 1978 – 84, a one percentage point log employment shock induced a 0.086

percentage point increase in the share of all non-elderly state residents applying for DI benefits. The

corresponding estimate for 1984 – 98 in column (2) reveals that a one percentage point employment

shock induced more than twice as large an application response in the post-reform era.

       Columns (3) and (4) repeat these estimates while pooling the data for 1978 – 1998 and adding an

interaction between the shock measure, η̂ jT , and a post-1984 dummy variable. The increase in γˆ from

the retrenchment to the reform era is large and precisely estimated in column (3). The addition of state

fixed effects to the model in Column (4) reduces the estimated impact of predicted demand shocks on

application rates in both periods, but the increase in application responsiveness remains large and

significant.40 Panel B repeats the estimates for disability awards per population. Although awards are also

significantly more responsive to demand shocks in the post-reform era, these estimates should be treated

with some care. Since many applications from the mid-1990s onward were still pending at the time our

data were prepared by the Social Security Administration, award rates fall off artificially in later years.41

       We have performed numerous robustness tests to verify these relationships. If we replace the

disability application variable with the change in DI recipients per population, we find qualitatively

similar patterns. Further dividing the estimates into sub-intervals of 1984 – 98 indicates a secularly

increasing pattern of application responsiveness, as would be expected from Figure 6. In addition, we

have utilized county level DI recipiency data to explore the sensitivity of disability recipiency over 1984 –

1998 to within-state variation in local demand shocks generated by variation in county-level industrial

structure. Even within states, we find that those counties experiencing negative predicted employment



two, and five year intervals. The findings were qualitatively similar.
40
   To explore the possibility that given labor demand shocks lead to higher application rates in states with greater
effective replacement rates, we have also performed estimates where we include the state predicted replacement rate
and its interaction with the state level demand shocks. While the coefficients on the shock-generosity interaction
terms are typically only marginally statistically significant, the point estimate suggests that negative employment
shocks of given magnitude have a larger positive impact on disability applications where effective program
generosity is higher, especially in the post-1984 period.
41
     The award rate in a given year refers to the outcome of applications initiated in that year, although many of the

                                                                                                                         26
shocks saw substantially greater growth in disability recipiency over 1984 – 1998.

c.   The impact of demand shocks on labor force exit

     Since effectively all disability applicants are labor force non-participants, there are two potential

explanations for the findings on application responsiveness. One is that, over time, employment shocks

have increasingly spurred labor force non-participants to apply for disability benefits, perhaps in

anticipation of difficulty finding work in the future. A second and not mutually exclusive explanation is

that the share of job losers exiting the labor force to seek disability benefits has risen in response to the

1984 reforms.

     We investigate the latter possibility by estimating a state-level variant of (13) in which we use

projected demand shocks to instrument for employment losses at the state level. Using these instruments,

we ask whether the probability of labor force exit conditional on job loss rose between the retrenchment

and reform eras. The estimating equations are:

(15)     ∆ ( NILF / POP ) jT = α + β1∆ˆ ( EMP / POP) jT + ∆X jT β 2 + δ T + ε jT , and

(16)     ∆ (UNEMP / POP) jT = α + β 3 ∆ˆ ( EMP / POP) jT + ∆X jT β 4 + δ T + ε jT ,

where ∆ˆ ( EMP / POP ) jT is the instrumented change in state level employment.

     Before performing these estimates, we test the relationship between projected demand shocks and

state level employment to population rates over 1978 – 1998. Estimates are found in Table 6. The first

row indicates that a one percentage point projected employment shock raises the employment to

population ratio of high school dropout males by almost exactly one percentage point. For females, the

employment impact is highly significant and about 60 percent as large. Inclusion of state dummies in the

models reinforces these patterns.

surprisingly, adverse demand shocks have a larger impact on the employment of the less skilled.42 Given

these findings and the estimates above demonstrating the differential impact of DI recipiency on labor

force participation for low skilled workers (Tables 3 and 4), we focus our inquiry on high school

dropouts. Two-stage least squares estimates of (15) and (16) are found in Table 7.43

       Panel A presents results for male high school dropouts. During 1979 – 84, a one percentage point

decline in the employment to population ratio of male high school dropouts induced a 0.46 percentage

point increase in non-participation rate and 0.54 percentage point increase in unemployment.44 During the

1984 – 98, however, plausibly exogenous employment losses for high school dropout males appear to

have lead to essentially one-for-one increases in labor force non-participation. Subsequent columns pool

data for 1979 – 98, adding an interaction between the employment loss measure and a post-1984 dummy

variable. These estimates confirm a significant increase in the labor force exit propensity of displaced

high school dropouts males. Adding state fixed effects to the model does not appreciably affect the

results. Panel B tabulates analogous estimates for female high school dropouts. Although the standard

errors are slightly larger, the qualitative pattern of results is identical. Hence, there appears to be have

been a significant increase in the propensity of high school dropouts to exit the labor force after job loss.

       We have performed a variety of checks on the robustness of these results including using observations

spaced at different intervals and performed on different sub-periods of 1984 – 1998. These tests confirm

the finding that labor demand shocks feed significantly more into labor force exit post-1984 than was the

case prior to DI liberalization. It bears emphasis, however, that these estimates do not imply that

beginning in 1984, all high school dropouts who lose jobs exit the labor force. It is almost certainly the

case that some displaced high school dropouts find reemployment immediately and hence are not



42
  It is likely that low-skilled workers are employed in industries and occupations more vulnerable to shocks. In
addition, their skills may be less mobile across sectors.
43
     Corresponding first-stage estimates are given in Appendix Table 1.
44
  All variables are denominated by the state population of male high school dropouts. The growth in the
unemployment rate in conventional usage (i.e., denominated by labor force) would be approximately 30 to 50
percent larger.

                                                                                                                   28
captured by our demand shock instrument. Additionally, it is likely that the shock measure does not

operate exclusively through job displacement. Adverse shocks may encourage some workers to exit the

labor force voluntarily and, perhaps more importantly, slow the prevailing rate of reentry of non-

participants into the labor force. In a similar vein, some share of those exiting may be previously

unemployed workers whose re-employment prospects were harmed by the entry of new unemployed.

Each of these forces will reduce the employment to population ratio and yield corresponding increases in

non-participation. What appears unambiguous, however, is that state unemployment rates have become

significantly less sensitive to adverse demand shocks while labor force non-participation and disability

application rates have become significantly more so.

    A few simple calculations demonstrate that the increased generosity of the DI program could

plausibly account for much of this behavioral change. The coefficient estimates presented in the first three

columns of Table 5 suggest that a one unit shock induced approximately a 0.12 percentage point greater

increase in DI application rates in the post-1984 time period than prior to the 1984 reforms (e.g. 12

additional applications per 10,000 adults ages 25-64). Given that between 1984 and 1998, an average of

16 percent of the adult population aged 25-64 lacked a high school degree, we initially calculate that if all

individuals induced to apply for DI were high school dropouts, then the fraction applying for DI in

response to a one unit shock increased by 0.75 percentage points (0.0012/0.16).

    This number should be compared with the estimates from Table 7, which suggest that the fraction of

high school dropouts leaving the labor force in response to a one unit shock increased by 0.5 percentage

points. Thus, the increased sensitivity of DI applications to adverse labor demand shocks in the post-1984

period could explain 150 percent of the change (0.75 / 0.50). If one makes the more reasonable

assumption that only half of the individuals induced to apply for DI are high school dropouts, then the

increase in DI application propensity can account for 75% of the increase. While this calculation is

admittedly quite rough, it suggests that the DI program may be largely responsible for the increased

propensity of low-skilled individuals to leave the labor force in response to job loss or declining labor

market opportunities.

                                                                                                            29
5. Alternative explanations: falling wages, immigration and incarceration.

     In this section, we briefly explore three plausible alternative interpretations of the cross-state patterns

of labor force withdrawal that are the focus of our study. One is declining real wages. A second is

immigration of low skilled workers. And a third is the growth in the U.S. prison population.

a.   Declining real wages

     As argued by Juhn (1992) and Juhn, Murphy and Topel (1991), a stable elasticity of labor force

participation coupled with declining real wages could explain the substantial decline in labor force

participation of low skilled males over this period. To be clear, we view falling wages as a complement

rather than a substitute to the role for the disability program in reducing labor force participation over

1984 – 1998; indeed, a key reason why disability replacement rates have risen is that wages at the lower

tail of the distribution have fallen. For falling real wages to be the primary explanation for our findings,

however, it would have to be the case that – not implausibly – wages fell by substantially more in states

that experienced the most adverse demand shocks.

     To explore the relevance of this hypothesis, Table 8 presents levels and changes of male high school

dropout labor force participation and log real wages at five-year intervals over 1979 – 98. To facilitate

regional comparisons, we divide the 50 states into three groups according to the magnitude of the demand

shocks they are projected to have experienced over this 19 year interval ( ηˆ79−98 ): the 10 most negative, the

10 least negative, and the remaining 30.45 Consistent with well-known patterns, the data in Table 8



45
  Details of our wage calculations are given in the Data Appendix. We focus on trends in male labor force
participation since they are less likely to be driven by shifting gender norms. Because our demand shock measure,
ηˆ79−98 , is defined in relative terms, we convert it to an absolute measure to facilitate interpretation of the table.
Specifically, we add an estimate of the overall demand shift experienced by high school dropouts in each five year
interval equal to:

         η HSD ,T = ∑φ kt γ kt ⋅ η kT ,
                     k

where φ kt is the share of employees in industry (k) in year (t) who are high school dropouts, γ kt is the industry (k)
share of national employment in (t), and η kT is the log change in the share of national employment between years
(t) and (T). Unlike the relative shock measure in (12), this index need not be approximately mean zero in each
period. Absolute demand shocks against high school dropouts are estimated at –0.048, -0.031, -0.034, and –0.019
log points in 79-84, 84-89, 89-94, and 94-98 respectively. Note that this transformation simply adds a constant to

                                                                                                                          30
indicate that real wages and labor force participation of less-skilled males fell substantially during 1979 –

1998. We estimate that despite four years of strong growth during 1994 – 1998, male high school dropout

wages declined by 22 log points and labor force participation by 5 percentage points over the 1979 – 1998

period.

     Comparing wages and participation among the three groups of states arrayed in Table 8 reveals two

key facts. First, labor force participation of high school dropout males fell by substantially more in the

most adversely relative to the least adversely shocked states over 1979 – 1998: 11.0 percentage points in

the former relative to 1.5 percentage points in the latter. Second, the differential patterns of labor force

exit visible across these groups of states are not mirrored by differential wage declines. In fact, estimated

log wages fell by somewhat less in the most adversely relative to the least adversely shocked states: 19

versus 25 log points. Hence, it is quite unlikely that differential regional wage declines alone can explain

why labor force participation of male high school dropouts fell by substantially more in some regions

than others.

     In this vein, the growing availability and generosity of disability benefits appear a plausible

alternative. Notably, the growth in DI recipiency per population was 1.1 percentage points in the most

adversely shocked states over 1979 – 1998, relative to only 0.14 percentage points in the least adversely

shocked states. Using the OLS estimates of the impact of DI recipiency on male high school dropout labor

force participation found in Table 3, this difference can potentially explain a 5.0 to 7.8 percentage point

relative decline in male high school dropout labor force participation between these two groups of states –

50 and 80 percent of the observed difference.46 Hence, we tentatively conclude that while declining real

wages played a crucial role in inducing labor force exit over 1984 – 1998, the disability system

substantially exacerbated this trend by providing many of the least skilled with a viable alternative to



each demand shock entry in Table 8 and does not impact the substantive results.
46
  The calculations are (1.1 – 0.14)*(–5.18) = 5.0, and (1.1 – 0.14)*(–8.16) = 7.8. Instrumental variables estimates of
these same models that use levels and changes of state level replacement rates to identify exogenous variation in the
change in DI recipiency in each state produce comparable point estimates. Note that the net change in disability per
population over 1979 – 1998 understates the post-1984 growth since it also includes the pre-1984 contraction.

                                                                                                                   31
employment.

b. Cross-state patterns of immigration

     The U.S. high school dropout population is increasingly composed of immigrants. Current Population

survey data indicate that in 1998, 35 percent of non-elderly high school dropouts were foreign born,

relative to only 12 percent of high school completers. Since legal immigrants are ineligible for disability

benefits until five years after arrival, increased immigration flows would not appear to offer an alternative

explanation for our primary findings. However, the flow of immigrants is quite geographically

concentrated, with states such as New York and California receiving a disproportionate share of

immigrants relative to population. If for any reason the high immigration states over 1984 – 1998 were

also the ‘low employment shock’ states, this coincidence would induce a spurious positive cross-state

correlation between state level adverse demand shocks and the labor force exit of high school dropouts.47

     To explore the relevance of this alternative hypothesis, we reanalyzed our main results excluding the

11 states where foreign-born residents compose at least 40 percent of the high school dropout

population.48 Estimates that exclude these states continue to find that the share of male high school

dropouts exiting the labor force in response to an adverse demand shock more than doubled during 1984 –

1998 relative to 1979 – 1984. Moreover, if we re-compute the Table 8 regional wage and employment

comparison while dropping the 11 high immigration states, we again find that wages of high school

dropouts fell roughly proportionately across all U.S. states while disability recipiency and labor force

non-participation increased substantially more in the most adversely shocked states.49 These results



47
  For example, New York and California saw relatively little decline in high school dropout participation and
relatively modest growth in disability recipiency over 1984 to 1999. Our analysis suggests that this is due to
relatively favorable demand conditions prevailing in these states. In contrast, the immigration story implies that both
facts are explained by the comparatively low level of DI eligibility among high school dropouts in these high
immigration states.
48
  These states are AZ, CA, HI, FL, IL, MA, NJ, NV, NY, RI, and TX. In 1998, the foreign born share of high
school dropouts in these states was 58 percent, relative to 11 percent in the remaining 39 states. Because the CPS
does not provide information on country of birth prior to 1994, we are unable to exclude foreign-born high school
dropouts from our sample.
49
  In fact, the regional wage results excluding the high immigrant states indicate a more uniform pattern of wage
declines than is visible in Table 8. It is therefore likely that the relatively larger wage declines in ‘low shock’ states

                                                                                                                         32
suggest that differential cross-state patterns of immigration are not responsible for our main results.

c.   Increased incarceration of high school dropouts

     A third alternative we have considered for the declining participation of high school dropouts is their

growing rates of incarceration (Freeman, 1991; Katz and Krueger, 1999; Western and Pettit, 2000).

Because the incarcerated population is included in neither the numerator nor denominator of our labor

force calculations, it is not intrinsically a source of bias for our participation estimates. It is likely the

case, however, that potential criminals have below average rates of labor force participation relative to

other high school dropouts. If it were also true that the most adversely shocked states experienced

differentially high rates of incarceration growth over 1984 – 1998, this would mechanically raise

measured labor force participation in these states.

     To explore this possibility, we used data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics to measure

incarceration rates of male high school dropouts across the three groups of states in Table 8. We find little

difference in the share of non-elderly male high school dropouts in prison across these groups. For

example, in our most adversely shocked states, the share of male high school dropouts incarcerated rose

from 1.4 to 5.2 percent during 1984 – 98. In the least shocked states, it rose from 2.4 to 6.3 percent. The

fact that we find comparable patterns of labor force exit for female high school dropouts – who have very

low rates of incarceration – also suggests that the rising incarceration rate is not responsible for our

results.

6. Conclusion: Implications for aggregate unemployment

     Because high school dropouts were in 1984 differentially employed in industries that contracted

during the next fourteen years, the reduced sensitivity of their unemployment to adverse labor demand

shocks suggests that the share unemployed at present is substantially lower than it would have been in the

absence of the DI program. Consider that the typical high school dropout in 1984 was employed in an




over 1984 – 1998 are driven in part by a preponderance of immigrant high school dropouts in these states.
Supplemental tables containing these results are available from the authors on request.

                                                                                                                 33
industry that over the next 14 years declined by 8.4 percentage points as a share of aggregate

employment.50 Combining this negative relative demand contraction with the estimated reduction in the

unemployment responsiveness of high school dropouts from Table 7, we calculate that the share of high

school dropouts who are presently unemployed would be 4.2 percentage points higher

(0.84 * 0.50 *100 = 4.20) but for the liberalization of DI that occurred in 1984. Given that high school

dropouts accounted for 12.2 percent of the non-elderly adult population in 1998, this suggests that the

aggregate unemployment rate would have been approximately 0.64 percentage points higher in 1998 were

it not for DI liberalization.51

       To test the plausibility of this counterfactual, we take an entirely different approach to estimating it.

At three-year intervals over 1984 – 1998, we calculate the sum of absolute employment declines in 2-digit

industries nationally and weight these declines by the high school dropout share of employment in each.

Specifically, we estimate:

(17)        δˆHSD ,84−98 = ∑∑ φk ,t min[ Empk ,t − Empk ,t +3 ,0] ,
                          t   k



where min[ Emp k ,t − Emp k ,t +3 ,0] is the absolute employment loss in industry k over 3 years and φk ,t is

the high school dropout employment share in industry k at the start of the interval. Using (17), we

estimate cumulative job losses to high school dropouts totaling 791,000 between 1984 and 1998.

Applying the Table 7 estimate of a 0.50 percentage point reduction over 1984 – 98 in the unemployment

responsiveness of high school dropouts to unit demand shocks, we calculate that aggregate unemployment

would have been approximately 0.30 percentage points higher in 1998.

       This calculation is conservative in two ways. First, since most employment losses do not involve

sustained national industry employment contractions over three years (consider that total U.S.

employment grew by more than one third between 1984 and 1998), this estimate it is likely to detect only



50
     To make this calculation, we estimate η HSD,T for 1984 – 1998. See footnote 45.
51
     Because the unemployment rate is denominated by labor force and not by population, the estimated impact using a


                                                                                                                 34
a minority of all job losses. The estimate would be far higher, for example, if instead we counted all

instances where an industry lost absolute employment at the state level over three years. Second, our

calculation assumes that high school dropouts are no more likely than better-educated workers to lose

work in the face of an employment contraction. In reality, job loss is much more commonplace among the

less educated (Farber, 1997). If we amend (17) to assume that high school dropouts are two to three times

as likely as better educated workers to lose work in a downturn, we estimate high school dropout job

losses of 1.3 to 1.6 million workers, yielding a counterfactual 1998 aggregate unemployment rate that is

0.48 to 0.61 percentage points higher.

       Reinforcing this calculation is the remarkable recent growth in the high school dropout DI recipient

population. In 1999, almost 60 percent of all non-elderly male adult high school dropouts who were labor

force non-participants were receiving disability benefits.52 Given that the population of non-elderly high

school dropouts declined by 30 percent between 1984 and 1998, we would have predicted a contraction

of 550,000 in the high school dropout recipient population in these 14 years (making no allowance for the

simultaneous decline in age and plausibly improved health of high school dropouts overall). Instead, the

number of high school dropout DI recipients rose from 1.93 to 2.70 million. If even half of this

unanticipated growth of 1.3 million high school dropout recipients is accounted for by the interaction of

adverse shocks and increased program generosity, the unemployment rate would presently be one-half of

a percentage point higher in the absence of programmatic changes.

       Of course, some part of the change in the sensitivity of unemployment to adverse labor demand

shocks may be driven by other factors – and thus our estimates could potentially be biased upwards.

However, because the DI program has likely impacted labor force participation for at least some subset of

the 88 percent of the labor force that is not composed of high school dropouts, it seems plausible that our

estimate of the overall impact on the U.S. unemployment rate may understate the total effect.




participation rate of 0.80 is 100*(0.042 * 0.122)/0.80 = 0.64.
52
     For female high school dropouts, the corresponding figure is 29 percent.

Data Appendix

A.1 Employment, Unemployment, and Labor Force Non-Participation

Annual, state-level data on employment, unemployment and labor force non-participation by gender, age,
and education category for individuals between the ages of 25 and 64 were calculated using the complete
Current Population Survey monthly files for years 1978 – 1999. The number of observations ranges from
1.1 to 1.3 million annually. All calculations use CPS sampling weights. To attain comparable educational
categories (high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, college-plus graduate) across the
redefinition of Census’s Bureau’s education variable introduced in the 1992 CPS, we use the method
proposed by Jaeger (1997). In particular, prior to 1992, we define high school dropouts as those with
fewer than 12 years of completed schooling. In 1993 forward, we define high school dropouts as those
without a high school diploma or GED certificate.

A.2. Wage Data from the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Group files

To estimate market wages for high school dropout males by state requires data on potential earnings for
both workers and non-workers. Since our CPS samples do not provide earnings for non-participants, we
impute them as follows using the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Group files for the years 1979 through
1999. For workers employed in the survey reference week, wages were calculated by dividing usual
weekly earnings by usual weekly hours, multiplying top-coded earnings observations by 1.5, and inflating
them to 1999 dollars using the chain weighted PCE deflator. We then estimated a regression in each year
of the real log weekly wages of employed high school dropout males on a quartic in age, a set of state
indicator variables, a dummy equal to one for black race, and a complete set of interactions between the
black race dummy, the state indicators and the age quartic. Employing these regression coefficients, we
assigned each unemployed or non-participant sample member the mean predicted wage of workers with
identical characteristics, adding to their wage the 10th percentile residual from the relevant annual wage
regression. Self-employed workers, who do not report earnings in most CPS samples, were assigned
wages at the 50th percentile of the residual distribution. Averaging over observed and imputed wages, we
calculate the mean earnings potential of high school dropouts in each state and year. In addition, we
experimented with assigning non-participants the 25th and 50th percentile of the residual distribution.
While these choices did affect the level of wages imputed in each year, the cross-state time pattern of
results over 1979 – 1998 found in Table 8 is quite robust to the imputation method.

A.3. Simulated earnings histories from the CPS March annual demographic files

To estimate the deciles of the age-specific earnings profiles used in our replacement rate calculations, we
utilize the Annual Demographic Files of the March Current Population Survey for the years 1964 – 1998
(n~50,000 per year). We include in our sample all males ages 25 – 64 who had positive earnings in the
previous year and had positive hours in wage/salary employment in the survey reference week. Further
details on these samples are provided in Katz and Autor (1999). We multiply weekly earnings deciles by
(52/12) to estimate monthly earnings deciles for the PIA formula. To simulate earnings profiles, we
calculate mean earnings at each percentile of the wage distribution within each state, year, age cell. The
simulated earnings profiles assign to workers in a given state, age, percentile cell the earnings history of a
worker who had mean earnings at the same percentile of the relevant state-age-year earnings distribution
in each of the previous 15 years. Since our data do not allow us to calculate earnings histories beyond 16
years for workers observed in 1979 (the first year of the imputation), we assume that at years beyond this
range, workers experienced wage growth equal to the mean wage of the economy of a whole. This
assumption guarantees that imputed replacement rates neither rise nor fall in these years. We
experimented with imputing longer earnings histories for workers observed later in our sample (e.g, up to
34 years of history for a worker of wage 59 observed in 1998). The level of benefits implied by these

                                                                                                           39
longer earnings histories was typically within 1 or 2 percent of the benefit level implied by our truncated
earnings history simulation method.

Replacement rates based upon current earnings are calculated using the PIA formula in equation (2),
setting the AIME equal to current monthly earnings at age specific percentiles of the monthly earnings
distribution. Replacement rates based upon simulated earnings histories use equations (1) and (2). Data on
the ‘bend points’ in the PIA formula were obtained from the Social Security Administration’s Annual
Statistical Supplement.

To test the plausibility of the increases in simulated replacement rates given in Table 2, we directly
compared DI income and wage data for males by education group from Survey of Income and Program
Participation data for 1984 and 1996. These comparisons, found in Appendix Table 2, indicate that the
ratio of DI income to earnings for male high school dropouts rose from 42 to 54 percent between 1984
and 1996. Since this calculation compares DI income for the disabled to wage income for the currently
employed, it is likely to substantially understate the true replacement rate. As has been documented
elsewhere, disability recipients generally command below average earnings given education and
experience prior to obtaining disability benefits (Bound, 1989).

A.4. DI and SSI Recipient and Benefits Data

Annual, state-level data on DI and SSI recipients, benefit levels, demographics and qualifying
impairments were obtained from various years (1978 – 2000) of the Social Security Administration’s
Annual Statistical Supplement. DI data includes only disabled workers receiving benefits whereas SSI
data includes only disabled adult beneficiaries (thus excluding child and aged beneficiaries).

A.5. DI and SSI Application and Award Data

Administrative data on disability applications and awards by state for years 1979 – 1998 were generously
provided to us by Kalman Rupp and David Stapleton (DI), Charles Scott (SSI), and Alan Shafer of the
Social Security Administration. In our data set, disability awards our dated according to the year of
application rather than the year of decision. Because many applications filed after 1997 are still pending
or under appeal, our final years of data underestimate the ultimate award rate.

A.6. DI and SSI Data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation

Disability recipiency rates by education category, age, and gender were estimated using data from the
1984 and 1996 waves of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. A survey respondent was
coded as a DI recipient if he/she “did receive income from Social Security for himself/herself in this
month” and whose reason for receipt of Social Security was disability. An individual was classified as an
SSI recipient if he/she “did receive any income from Supplemental Security Income for him/her self
during the reference period.”

A.7: Calculating simulated changes in state level DI replacement rates

As an alternative to using the level of the replacement rate in 1984 as an instrument for the subsequent
change in disability recipiency, we also exploit cross-state variation in the change in the replacement rate.
An ideal test of the impact of replacement rates on labor force participation would exploit changes in the
potential replacement earnings for each potential worker as a function of his or her entire earnings history.
This approach requires a measure of the potential earnings of all individuals, including those who are not
working, and is thus infeasible. We take the following alternative approach. We calculate the projected
replacement rate for each employed worker based on his or her age and percentile in the wage distribution

                                                                                                          40
in 1984. Then, we simulate how mean replacement rates in each state are likely to have evolved over
1984 – 1998 as a function both of the increasing effective generosity of DI benefits and the changing age
distribution in each state. This approach assumes that, conditional on age, there is a stable relationship
between a worker’s state of residence and his or her position – or, more precisely, the position of her
potential earnings – in the national earnings distribution. Although this is clearly an approximation, it is
likely to be reasonable assuming that average state earnings do not dramatically diverge over this time.

Define λ84jad as the probability that an individual residing in state (j) of age (a) in the year 1984 is in decile
(d) of the national earnings distribution. Note that since λ84jad is a discrete density function, if follows that
 10

∑λ
d =1
       84
        jad   = 1 . Define Radt ∈ [0,1] as the DI mean replacement rate of a person of given age and earnings

decile in year (t). Define γ tja as the population shares of individuals of given age and state in year (t).
Finally, define φ 84
                  ja as the labor force participation rate of workers in state (j) of age (a) in 1984. Hence,

the mean potential replacement rate of those currently employed in state (j) in 1984 is:
                       A   10
(20)          R j84 = ∑∑ γ 84ja ⋅ φ 84
                                    ja ⋅ λ jad ⋅ Rad .
                                          84      84

                      a =1 d =1



To simulate the expected state level replacement rate in subsequent years, we allow both the age-decile
replacement rate and the age distribution of individuals in each state to vary over time while holding
constant the state level correspondence between age and earnings decile and the baseline participation
rates of each stage-age group. The age categories used for this calculation are 25– 29, 30 – 34, 35 – 39, 40
– 44, 45 – 50, 50 – 54, and 55 – 61. Hence, the simulated change in the mean state replacement rate for
state (j) from 1984 to a later period (T) is equal to:
                            A     10
(21)          ∆ˆ R j84−T = ∑∑ φˆ84
                                ja (γ ja − γ ja ) ⋅ λ jad ( Rad − Rad ) .
                                     ˆ T ˆ 84 ˆ84 ˆ T             ˆ 84
                           a =1 d =1



Note that because labor force participation rates of low wage workers dramatically declined over 1984 –
1998, it would be potentially quite misleading to perform this calculation using the wages of employed
workers in later years. Our approach abstracts from changes in labor force participation by simulating
state replacement rates only as a function of the changing effective generosity of DI benefits and changes
in the age distribution of state populations.

n =50 U.S. states. Standard errors in parentheses. ∆ disability applications per population is constructed as the
change in DI apps/pop between the start and end years of the period multiplied by the number of elapsed years. For
1979 - 1984, we add 1/2 to this number the estimated number of disability beneficiaries terminated per population
for not meeting medical standards in each state over 1979 - 1984. Estimates also control for change in the age
distribution in the state population (ages 25 - 39 and 40 - 54 with 55 - 64 omitted) for each relevant education
group. Estimates are weighted by mean state share of U.S. population in the two years to form the dependent
variable. Instruments are simulated state mean DI replacement rate 1979 (columns 2 & 7), simulated state mean DI
replacement rate 1984 (columns 4 & 9), and change in simulated state mean replacement rate 1984 - 98 (columns 5
