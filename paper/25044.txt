                                         ABSTRACT

This paper examines whether there are complementarities between investments in ICT, R&D and
organizational innovation, and the effects of different investment profiles on total factor
productivity growth on Dutch firm-level data. We estimate an integrated model of investment
profile adoption and total factor productivity growth. We find that the three investment decisions
are complementary, in the sense that investing in one increases the probability of investing in
another one because joint investments lead to higher TFP growth than individual investments.
ICT earns on average an expected rate of return of 9.7%, followed by 6% to 7% on organizational
innovation and a modest 1.4% to 1.8% on R&D in services and manufacturing respectively.

1. Introduction

In the eyes of most historians of science and technology, the information and communication
technology (ICT) can be classified among general purpose technologies (GPT) such as the
wheel, steam power, combustion engine and electricity (Lipsey, Carlaw and Bekhar, 2005;
Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2005; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014). It took some time before
ICT showed up in the productivity statistics, but by now it is common to distinguish between
ICT and non-ICT capital in productivity analysis, and a great deal of economic and labor
productivity growth in the last 30 years has been ascribed to ICT capital deepening (Jorgen-
son et al. 2008). Even skeptics have acknowledged the transformational power of digital
technology, although they claim that the economic benefits are short-lived, and that the im-
pact of ICT does not stand up to that of earlier GPTs (e.g. Gordon, 2016).

Another channel through which ICT affects labour productivity growth is through its poten-
tial impact on total factor productivity (TFP). One explanation for the differential success of
ICT capital in fostering productivity has been the argument of complementarity between ICT
investment and investment in intangible assets, such as organizational capital (Brynjolfsson
and Saunders, 2010; Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2002). Firms need to reorganize their
way of operating to benefit from the digital technology, and vice versa. 1

But beyond its contribution to TFP via organizational change, ICT can also increase the re-
turns to R&D, generating a string of new technological innovations. It can also make R&D
more effective in the sense that it facilitates the gathering, documenting, and sharing of
knowledge and information. Besides the potential to improve research effectiveness, these
characteristics of ICT can also improve the possibility and quality of collaboration between
researchers.

In this paper, we look at the triangle between ICT, technological and non-technological inno-
vation. In particular, we look at R&D as an instance of technological innovation, and organi-
zational change as a non-technological innovation. Parts of this triangle and its relation to
productivity have been covered extensively in the literature. Putting the pieces together in one
framework is a novelty of our analysis. We shall reassess the contribution of ICT to TFP
growth and reexamine the hypothesis of complementarity between organizational innovation
and ICT. In addition, we shall explore whether the returns to ICT and R&D are mutually rein-
forcing, in the sense that innovation is ICT-facilitated and, vice versa, that the returns from
ICT stem in part from the generation of knowledge.

The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we briefly review the literature on the role of
ICT and R&D for productivity, on the complementarity between ICT and organizational in-
novation and on the GPT aspects of ICT. Section 3 is devoted to modeling aspects. In section

and in section 6 we conclude.



2. The literature

A vast literature has documented evidence on different determinants of productivity, both at
the macro- and at the micro-level (see Syverson, 2010). Among the determinants, investment
in information and communication technology (ICT) and the generation of knowledge feature
prominently.

One strand of the literature has estimated the returns (private and social) to R&D and the con-
tribution of R&D to total factor productivity (TFP) or economic growth following the semi-
nal work by Griliches, 1979, and with some recent advances by Doraszelski and Jaumandreu
(2013) (see e.g. Hall, Mairesse and Mohnen, 2010, for a review of the literature). Another
branch has related R&D to innovation, and innovation to productivity, the workhorse model
being the CDM model as proposed by Crépon, Duguet and Mairesse (1998); see Mairesse
and Mohnen (2010) for an overview. Neither line of research considers the complementarity
with ICT, although recently Polder, van Leeuwen, Mohnen and Raymond (2010) and Hall,
Lotti and Mairesse (2013) model R&D and ICT investment as input into innovation, defined
as product, process and organizational innovation.

In parallel, many studies have investigated the effect of the adoption of ICT equipment on
economic performance (see e.g. Stiroh, 2010), without an explicit role for R&D. Some stud-
ies have used aggregate or sectoral data, others have used firm data. The studies that use mac-
ro or sectoral data have mainly analyzed the effect of ICT or R&D on productivity within a
growth accounting framework (see Draca, Sadun and van Reenen 2007, Biagi, 2013 for re-
views of the literature), but not so much the complementarity between ICT and R&D in rais-
ing productivity.

A substantial effort has been made to measure the stocks of intangibles, including R&D but
also software, databases and organizational capital, and to assess their importance in (correct-
ed) cross-country GDP growth (Corrado, Hulten and Sichel, 2009; Corrado, Haskel, Jona-
Lasinio and Iommi, 2013). These industry-level data are beginning to be used to explore
complementarities between different types of assets. Chen, Niebel and Saam (2014) and Cor-
rado, Haskel and Jona-Lasinio (2017) find evidence of a positive direct effect of ICT on TFP,
as well as a significant indirect effect through its interaction with intangibles. Using
EUKLEMS data, Pieri, Vecchi and Venturini (2017) explore complementarities between ICT
and R&D in reducing technical inefficiencies.

The empirical studies that have been conducted on the hypothesis of complementarity be-
tween ICT and organizational change are mainly based on micro data (Bresnahan et al., 2002;
Black and Lynch, 2001; Caroli and Van Reenen, 2001; Crespi et al., 2007; Van Reenen et al.,
2010; Riley and Vahter, 2013). The available econometric evidence shows that a combination


                                                                                           2
of investment in ICT and changes in organization and work practices facilitated by these
technologies contributes to firms’ productivity growth. Case studies reveal that the introduc-
tion of information technology is combined with a transformation of the firm, investment in
intangible assets, and a change in the relation with suppliers and customers. Electronic pro-
curement, for instance, increases the control over inventories and decreases the costs of coor-
dinating with suppliers. In addition, ICT offers the possibility for flexible production: just-in-
time inventory management, enterprise resource planning, et cetera.

Whereas there is a lot of empirical backing at the firm level for the complementarity between
ICT and organizational innovation, there is less evidence of a complementarity between R&D
and ICT or between ICT and technological innovations in the form of new products or pro-
cesses. Hall, Lotti and Mairesse (2013) on Italian data, Rybalka (2015) on Norwegian data
and Aboal and Tacsir (2018) on Uruguyan data find no conclusive evidence in favour of ei-
ther a complementarity or a substitutability between R&D and ICT. Many studies have inves-
tigated the role of ICT in fostering R&D or innovation, however. For German firm data,
Cerquera and Klein (2008) find that ICT is associated with an increase in in the variation of
productivity, and that this process of creative destruction gives incentives for firms to invest
in R&D. Also for Germany, Engelstätter (2012) finds that different types of software have a
positive effect on product and process innovation, and moreover that there is complementari-
ty between software and organizational practices in their effect on innovative performance.
Polder et al. (2010) find that ICT investment is important for all types of innovation in ser-
vices, while it plays a limited role in manufacturing, while Kleis, Chwelos, Ramirez and
Cockburn (2012) find that investments in information technology increase innovation output
measured by patents. Van Leeuwen and Farooqui (2008) show that e-sales and broadband use
affect productivity significantly through their effect on innovation output. Finally, Forman
and van Zeebroeck (2012) find that internet connections increase collaborative research, but
not the productivity of lone researchers or of researchers located close to each other. In con-
trast, Spiezia (2011) concludes from an OECD-led international comparison study on firm
data that ICT usage does not increase the probability to come up with a new innovation de-
veloped in-house.

In addition, a related line of research looks at complementarities between different types of
innovation or different types of ICT. Miravete and Pernías (2006) and Martínez-Ros and
Labeaga (2009) for instance find complementarity between product and process innovation
by looking at the adoption decision. This result is confirmed in Polder et al. (2010) who look
at the production function. This latter study also finds that product and organizational innova-
tion are complements, while process and organizational innovation are found to be substi-
tutes. For ICT, following an approach methodologically close to ours, Kretschmer, Miravete
and Pernías (2012) find that different types of software are substitutes in production. The
results of Bartelsman, van Leeuwen and Polder (2017), however, point to complementarity as
well as substitutability, depending on the types of software considered.




                                                                                             3
In our paper we will address the triangle of complementarity between ICT (hardware), R&D
and organizational change, by looking at the joint firm-level binary investment decisions to-
gether with their productivity effects.



3. Model

While it is true that ICT and R&D can be considered as inputs in the innovation process, ICT
for sure, but even R&D, have also a direct role to play in the production function besides af-
fecting innovation. Therefore, in contrast to Polder et al. (2010), Hall et al. (2012) and Rybal-
ka (2015) we do not resort to a CDM type of model (Crépon, Duguet, and Mairesse, 1998),
with a knowledge production function combined with a usual production function. Instead,
we shall model ICT, R&D and organizational innovation as binary choices with simultaneous
feedback effects. That is, when two strategies are complements in the sense that doing one
increases the returns of doing the other one (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990), the returns from
adoption (and therefore the adoption decisions) are mutually dependent.

In our model, firms choose combinations of investments (c.q. ‘investment profiles’) based on
their (ex-ante) expected returns in terms of productivity growth. When multiple investments
are involved, there is a ‘complementarity bonus’ (or ‘substitutability penalty’) added to the
return on the individual investment. Given the simultaneous modelling of the productivity
equation, the ex-post effects of the investments on productivity growth will be consistent with
the ex-ante expected returns which led to that specific combination of investments. We thus
model complementarities in terms of an objective function (the PROD approach) where the
strategy choices (or investments) are themselves endogenous, as recommended by Athey and
Stern (1998).

Modelling the direct effect of ICT and R&D on productivity, brings our analysis also closer
to the literature on intangibles and growth accounting using industry-level data (Corrado,
Hulten and Sichel, 2009), where R&D and ICT are considered as separate types of capital.
Also in conformity with the introduction of stocks of intangibles in the production function as
in Corrado et al. (2009) we consider it more appropriate that investment affects the growth
rather than the level of total factor productivity. The productivity levels depend on the stocks
of knowledge, organizational capital and ICT capital. The productivity growth rates, instead,
depend on the increases in these stocks. We do not model the choice of the investment levels,
only the binary choices as to whether investments in ICT, R&D and organizational innova-
tions are made. 2




2
 It may be argued that the strategy choices are made on the basis of another objective function than total factor
productivity growth, and that therefore, as well as for reasons of limited managerial foresight or unforeseen
developments, there may be a difference between ex-ante and ex-post complementarity.


                                                                                                           4
3.1. Investment stage

In order to test for the presence of complementarity between innovation strategies, in particu-
lar between investing in ICT, R&D and organizational innovation, we first consider the adop-
tion approach, i.e. the detection of joint use of strategies for reasons other than correlations in
unobserved determinants (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990; Athey and Stern, 1998). This ap-
proach is close to that of Miravete and Pernías (2006), and was also applied in Bartelsman et
al. (2017) and Van Leeuwen and Mohnen (2017).

Consider an objective function that depends on the realization of the combination of strate-
gies, so called states. The contribution to the objective function achieved by the adoption of
                                  𝑗
each individual strategy 𝑂𝑖𝑖 is given by the following expression

    𝑗           𝑗                               𝑗   𝑗
𝑂𝑖𝑖 = �𝛽𝑗′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + ∑𝑘≠𝑗(𝛼𝑗𝑗 /2)𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑘 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑖𝑖 .                                                              (1)

For reasons of identification, 𝛼𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝑘𝑘 . The “return” from the adoption of strategy j depends
                                 𝑗
on exogenous variables 𝑥𝑖𝑖 , which may be strategy specific, the adoption of the other strate-
                                            𝑗
gies 𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑘 and a random error term 𝜀𝑖𝑖 . The error terms are assumed to be jointly normally dis-
tributed with unitary variances (for reasons of identification) but non-zero covariances. The
dependence on the adoption of other strategies makes this a simultaneous model, in which the
choice of strategies is endogenously determined. This allows us to test for potential comple-
mentarity at the investment stage, in the sense that firms adopt a combination of strategies
which they think will be beneficial.

The total level of the objective, which will be left unspecified for now but modelled in sec-
tion 3.2 as the contribution to total factor productivity (TFP) growth, is given by

            𝑗
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑗 𝑂𝑖𝑖 .                                                                                             (2)

As shown by Lewbel (2007), this way of writing the objective function avoids any incoher-
ency and incompleteness problem, i.e. guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the endog-
enous dummy variables for any given realization of the exogenous variables.

Let us illustrate the model by working with two strategies denoted as 𝑦 𝑗 ∈ {0,1}, j = 1, 2. For
example, if state (1,1) is chosen, where the first position refers to strategy 𝑦 1 and the second
position to strategy 𝑦 2 , then the contribution to TFP growth is given by

                  1               2     1
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,1) = 𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼12 + 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 . 3                                                       (3)

The coefficient 𝛼12 captures the complementarity (if positive) or substitutability (if negative)
between the pair of strategies. For every combination of strategies we can compute the value
of the objective function. To estimate the parameters of the model we write down the proba-

3
    Notice that 𝛼12 = 𝛼21 in equation (3) corresponds to 𝛼12 /2 + 𝛼21 /2 in the notation of equation (1).


                                                                                                            5
bility of every possible state. For instance, the probability that strategy 1 and strategy 2 are
chosen, denoted as state (1,1), is derived from the upper and lower bounds of the distribution
of the error terms given that the value of the objective function under (1,1) must be higher
than under any pair of strategies:
                               1               2     1
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,1) > 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (0,0) ⇒ 𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼12 + 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 > 0                           (4.1)

                               2
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,1) > 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,0) ⇒ 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼12 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 > 0                                           (4.2)

                               1           1
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,1) > 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (0,1) ⇒ 𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼12 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 > 0.                                           (4.3)

State (1,1) is therefore associated to the following area of the distribution of the error terms:
 1          1
𝜀𝑖𝑖 > −(𝛽1′𝑥𝑖𝑖 +𝛼12 )                                                                        (5.1)

𝜀𝑖𝑖2 > max(−(𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖
                  2                  1
                     + 𝛼12 ), −(𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖              2
                                        + 𝛼12 + 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖    1
                                                        + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 ))                             (5.2)

where (5.1) follows directly from (4.3), and (5.2) follows from combining (4.1) and (4.2)
                        1
while conditioning on 𝜀𝑖𝑖 . The same reasoning can be applied to derive the adoptions for the
other states.

State (1,0) is adopted when
                               1     1
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,0) > 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (0,0) ⇒ 𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 >0                                                   (6.1)
                               1     1         2
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,0) > 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (0,1) ⇒ 𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 > 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2                                     (6.2)
                               2
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,0) > 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 (1,1) ⇒ 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼12 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 < 0                                           (6.3)
                      1          1
In other words, when 𝜀𝑖𝑖 > −𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 and                                                      (7.1)

As shown in Miravete and Pernías (2006), when 𝛼12 = 0, the subdivision of the space of
  1 2
(𝜀𝑖𝑖 , 𝜀𝑖𝑖 ) is the same as for the bivariate probit. When 𝛼12 > 0, the states (1,1) and (0,0) are
defined over a larger region of that error space, and if 𝛼12 < 0, the states (1,0) and (0,1) are
defined over a smaller region of that error space.

3.2. Productivity growth equation

Going one step further, the return from each investment profile can be measured in terms of
productivity growth. The objective, which was very general and unspecified in equation (2),
is then explicitly specified. In this way we integrate the strategy adoption equations with the
productivity growth equation. This is what Kretschmer, Miravete and Pernías (KMP, 2012)
have done in combining the “adoption approach” and the “productivity approach” of com-
plementarity in the words of Athey and Stern (1998). Like them, we distinguish between ob-
served and unobserved determinants of innovation, hence firms may adopt different strategies
even if the observed determinants are the same. We differ from KMP (2012) in that we do
not use economic profits but productivity growth rates. Instead of combining dichotomous
data on two types of software innovation with continuous variables on scale and profit, which
depend on the innovation choices, we combine three dichotomous innovation indicators (ICT,
R&D and organizational innovation) with productivity growth rates that depend on the choice
of investments. Another difference is that instead of maximizing a likelihood function with
analytical conditional distributions, an expression which becomes more tedious to derive as
the number of equations increases, we work with simulated conditional likelihoods.

To that effect we shall estimate a total factor productivity growth equation, which depends on
the chosen investment profiles. TFP growth is the portion of output growth that is not ex-
plained by the growth rates in the traditional inputs, labor and capital. In the case of two
strategies, TFP growth would be given by the following expression:

  ̇ 𝚤𝚤 = 𝛾𝑡 + 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝑡 + (𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖

                                              + (𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 )𝑦𝑖𝑖2 + 𝛼12 𝑦𝑖𝑖

                                                                                𝑦𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖3            (12)

nants of TFP growth.

In practice the variance-covariance matrix must be imposed to be positive definite. This can
be done by using a Cholesky factorization of Ω. In the appendix we indicate the various steps
taken to calculate the maximum simulated likelihood using the Geweke-Hajivassiliou- Keane
(GHK) procedure (see Train, 2003; Cappellari and Jenkins, 2006).

We measure TFP growth using the index approach, that is, we assume constant returns to
scale, equilibrium factor holdings and perfectly competitive markets, such that the output
elasticities can be measured by the observed factor shares, which we allow to vary over time
and to be industry-specific. We are interested in differences in the contributions to TFP
growth for firms adopting different investment profiles: (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and (1,1). These
                                                          1
differences can be estimated by drawing values for 𝜀𝑖𝑖       and 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 from their respective domains
of definition and then averaging over the different draws. We are also interested in finding
out whether those different investments reinforce each other. This indication of complemen-
tarity (or substitutability) is given by the sign of coefficient 𝛼12 .




                                                                                                         8
The model we have just presented can be generalized to more than two strategies. In the re-
mainder of the paper we shall work with three strategies : investment in ICT, R&D, and or-
ganizational innovation. To determine the optimal investment profile, i.e. combination of
strategies, each combination needs to be compared with seven other combinations. We shall
estimate pairwise complementarities and returns from investing in ICT only, R&D only, or-
ganizational innovation only, pairs of investments, all three of them or none at all.



4. Data

The data used in this exercise are sourced from the Business Register and different surveys at
Statistics Netherlands, which are linked at the firm level. The sample includes firms in the
manufacturing sector (NACE Rev. 2 10 to 33) as well as the services sector (NACE Rev. 2
50 to 93). 4 Production data (value added, capital depreciation costs, and employment) are
taken from the Production Statistics (PS). Capital services are proxied by depreciation costs
(observed at the firm-level).Value added and depreciation cost are deflated using industry-
level price information from the Dutch National Accounts. Information on the age of a firm,
and whether it is foreign-owned, is derived from the Business Register.

Information on R&D and organizational innovation, as well as the export status is sourced
from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS). Organizational innovations include the intro-
duction of new business practices, knowledge management systems, methods of workplace
organization (i.e. system of decision making), and management of external relations. The CIS
provides information on whether a firm stated to have performed such an innovation or not in
the three-year period ending in the year preceding the survey (for example, the CIS 2010 is
carried out in 2011 and concerns the period 2008 to 2010). R&D investment is the sum of
internal and external R&D and, unlike organizational innovation, refers only to the last year
of the survey.

Information on ICT investment comes from the investment survey, and concerns hardware
only. 5 We have decided to treat the three investment types in the same way, and therefore we
work with binary data for ICT and R&D, which is the only type of information we have for
organizational innovation. In our analysis, a firm classifies as investing in ICT and R&D
when the investment is positive, but the investment should also have some substance. This is
to improve the identification of any effects of investment on TFP, where really small invest-
ments can be expected not to make any difference, and we need to distinguish between those
and more substantial investment efforts. By way of threshold, we therefore exploited indus-
try-specific data on depreciation cost by type of investment. The investment dummies then

    The commercial R&D sector, NACE Rev 2 code 72, is excluded from the analysis, as well as Oil and petrole-
um, NACE Rev 2 code 19.

  From 2012 onwards the Dutch Investment Survey includes information on investment in software. Including
software would have substantially reduced the number of observations.


                                                                                                       9
equal 1 when the ratio of the firm’s investment to its value added, exceeds the share of the
depreciation cost for that capital good in value added in the firm’s industry. Table A1 reports
the annual average of these thresholds by industry. Thus, the investment dummies can be
loosely interpreted as capturing whether a firm has expansionary investments or not, over and
above the average industry replacement rate.

Our data span the period from 2008 to 2014. We assume that R&D and ICT in period t and
ORG in period t-2 to t affect TFP growth between year t and year t+1. Because CIS only co-
vers even years, the eventual estimation sample refers to 2008, 2010 and 2012, where TFP
growth concerns growth from 2008 to 2009 et cetera. A sensitivity analysis where the timing
of the ICT and R&D investment dummies refers to t-2 rather than t, gave more or less similar
results as those reported in the results section of this paper.

Table 1 gives the summary statistics by sector for the key variables used in the estimation,
separately for manufacturing and services. Firms in both sectors are on average of a similar
size, whereas manufacturing firms are slightly older than their counterparts in services.
Moreover, manufacturing firms are more often foreign-owned, and are more likely to export.
Overall, the share of exporting firms is relatively high, which is probably due to the fact that
we observe mainly larger firms.

Average TFP growth is negative in both sectors, with a similar magnitude of respectively
minus 5% in manufacturing, and minus 4% in services. The fact that our data period includes
the financial crisis of 2008/2009 explains these substantial negative growth figures, where
average (median) TFP growth was minus 10 (minus 5) percent in these years. In the other
years, TFP growth is roughly around 0. Table 2 also shows that for each investment profile
there are firms reporting negative as well as positive growth, and that the third quartile of the
TFP growth distribution is always positive. Interestingly, the distribution of TFP growth
seems to roughly move to the right with the number of investments. That is, average and me-
dian TFP growth, as well as the first and third quartile of the distribution, are larger for those
profiles where multiple investments are combined. This is an indication of complementarity

                                                                                                             10
between these investments, which will be tested more formally in our econometric model.
Nevertheless, firms do not often combine these investments, witness the frequency distribu-
tion of the profiles (table 2). In manufacturing, about two-thirds of the observations concerns
cases where a firm does not invest at all, or in a single strategy only. In services, this share is
even higher, with about three-quarters of the sample.

   Table 3 reports the summary statistics of the variables that are input to the TFP growth calcu-
   lation. Using a Laspeyres-index, TFP-growth was calculated as the ratio of the volume
   changes in value added and the total of inputs, where the capital and labour changes have
   been weighted by their lagged factor shares at the industry-level. This approach takes into
   differences in the nature of the production process between industries. Clearly, the average
   TFP growth differs across industries, with the pharmaceutical industry being a clear outlier.

   5. Results

   In this section, we report the estimation results of the integrated model with three types of
   investment, the returns for each investment profile, and the individual returns of each invest-
   ment, both on average and as a contribution to the return of each investment profile. Antici-



                                                                                                             12
pating that the patterns differ across industries, we present the estimation results separately
for manufacturing and services.

5.1 Complementarities

In table 4 we report the results for the integrated model with simultaneous discrete-choice
investment equations for ICT, R&D and organizational innovation, mutual dependence
among the three types of investment and controlling for firm size, export status, age, and for-
eign ownership, and for four industry sub-sectors in services. 6 Firm size can be seen to be
positively associated with investing in our sample, except for investments in ICT for firms in
manfacturing and in R&D for firms in services. Exporting firms are more frequently observed
to invest in R&D, less frequently in ICT and not particularly different from non-exporting in
terms of organizational innovation. 7 Age is not found to be significant in any of the three
equations. Foreign ownership is positively correlated to organizational innovation, and nega-
tively, whenever significant, to ICT and R&D investments. As already mentioned before,
TFP growth was negative just after the crisis of 2008, but then recovered in the following
years. The correlations between the error terms are significant, attesting to the existence of
unobservables that are correlated in the adoption and the productivity equations, which justi-
fies our estimation approach.

The three types of investment turn out to be complementary in the sense that they reinforce
each other in increasing TFP growth and hence that the probability of investing in one in-
creases the probability of investing in the other one. It is only for ICT and organizational in-
novation that we do not obtain a positive and significant interaction term. In the logic of our
model, two investments are carried out simultaneously if they yield a larger contribution to
TFP growth than if they are carried out separately or not at all. Three investments are carried
out simultaneously if together they increase TFP growth by more than any pair of invest-
ments, individual investment or no investment at all. The coefficient for the combination of
ICT and organizational innovation is significantly smaller than the other α coeffients, in both
sectors. This is surprising because given the existing evidence in the literature one would
expect this relation to be relatively strong. A possible explanation for this finding is that we
consider investment in hardware only, while the complementarity with organizational innova-
tion could lie more in the use of software and specific types of telecommunication equipment.

By contrast, the R&D and organizational innovation combination is significant and has the
highest coefficient in both sectors. This suggests that firms that invest in R&D believe they
will benefit from a simultaneous organizational change. Such a complementarity could be
related to the introduction of knowledge management systems, or the management of external

6
 To assess more properly the magnitude of the coefficients we would need to calculate the marginal effects,
which can be done by the delta method. We plan to do so in upcoming revisions to this paper. Doing so will,
however, not alter any qualitative conclusion about patterns of significance.

  Clearly, the causality can run both ways here. Including export status is meant to control for the degree of
international activities here.


                                                                                                       13
 relations (such as information flows or coordination of collaborative innovation efforts),
 which are seen as an organizational innovation, and which clearly could improve the effec-
 tiveness of R&D. To our knowledge there is not much evidence in the literature on this rela-
 tion, and our finding suggests that it could be explored in further detail.

 Finally, investing in ICT and R&D are found to be complementary decisions, in the sense
 that investing in one increases the productivity of investing in the other one. This lends sup-
 ports to the idea that ICT is a general purpose technology that facilitates innovation and in-
 creases the output and productivity of R&D (Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2005). Vice versa,
 investing in R&D increases the returns to ICT by generating knowledge that can be shared
 and diffused through new technology.

 In sum, our results suggest that firms consider investment in ICT, R&D, and organizational
 innovation simultaneously, and that they believe that simultaneous investment can be benefi-
 cial. In the next section we shall examine the returns of investing in certain profiles and the
 expected returns from individual investments.

5.2 Returns on investments

In our model, the expected return from a given investment profile is the same as the ex-post
return in terms of TFP growth. If a certain profile is chosen, it is because its realized return is
higher than the return on any other investment profile. In table 5 we present the average and
the standard deviation of the returns earned on the seven investment profiles in manufactur-
ing and in services. 8 In the example of two strategies given above the return to adopting in-
vestment profile (1,1) would be given by

                             1               2     1
                      ((𝛽1′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼12 + 𝛽2′ 𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 )�𝑅(1,1)�𝐹2 (𝜀𝑖𝑖
                                                                           1 2
                                                                              , 𝜀𝑖𝑖 |𝑅(1,1))

                                1
where R(1,1) are all values of 𝜀𝑖𝑖 and 𝜀𝑖𝑖2 defined by restrictions (5.1) and (5.2).

These returns are to be understood as above-normal rates of return, since R&D and ICT are
not subtracted from the traditional inputs (labor and capital) in the calculation of TFP growth.
These returns are random in the sense that they depend on unobservables that lie in a truncat-
ed part of their distribution, which is determined by the observed investment profile, and are
to be understood as the returns conditional on having chosen that investment profile times the
probability of chosing that investment profile. They are calculated via simulation using the
same draws as in the estimation procedure. According to our model, for each observation the
alternative investment profiles yield a return lower than the observed profile. In the case of
pairs or triplets of investment, the joint returns are subdivided in the table, into the returns
earned on the individual investments.

The highest return is earned by firms that invest at the same time in ICT and organizational
innovation, followed by firms that invest in ICT only. Note that we are not comparing the
same firms under alternative investment profiles. In most cases, the alternative (counterfactu-
al) returns (not shown) are negative, although they only need to be lower than the returns
earned on the chosen investment profile. So, it could be that the differences in return are due
to different characteristics of the firms, like size, age or export status. The returns for firms
that invest in all three strategies is, for instance, smaller than the returns for firms that invest
only in ORG, only in ICT or in both ORG and ICT. According to the complementarities, we
would have expected the highest returns for firms that invest in all strategies. But, the thing is
that we are not comparing the same firms under different scenarios. It is remarkable that the
ranking of the returns per investment profile and even the magnitudes of those returns are
very similar for firms in manufacturing and in services.

Now, we turn to table 6, where we present the expected returns to each individual investment.
These returns are calculated as follows. The expected rate of return on R&D, for instance, is
the return a firm gets if it belongs to the set of investment profiles (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1) and
(1,1,1) multipled by the respective probabilities of choosing each of those profiles.. Since a
                                                          1 2 3
firm can be in eight zones of the space spanned by (𝜀𝑖𝑖    , 𝜀𝑖𝑖 , 𝜀𝑖𝑖 ), and since it makes no return

    Note that the returns in the (0,0,0) case, where no investment takes place, is 0 by definition and is not reported.


                                                                                                                15
on a particular strategy if it does not invest in that strategy, this return is truly the expected
return made on a certain type of investment. It is interesting to notice that the returns are
again very similar in manufacturing and in services. Investing in ICT yields on average an
expected rate of return close to 10%, which can go as high as 33.5% in manufacturing and
23.1% in services. R&D earns on average only 1.8% in manufacturing and 1.4% in services,
with at most 8.8% in manufacturing and 4.7% in services. This is definitely lower than the
average rates of return on R&D reported in Hall et al. (2010) and those reported for the Neth-
erlands by Bartelsman, van Leeuwen, Nieuwenhuijsen and Zeelenberg (1989). The expected
rate of return on organizational innovation lies in between the rate on R&D and ICT with an
average of 7.3% in manufacturing and 5.9% in services, which can exceed 20%.

6. Conclusions and further research

This paper has investigated the relation between investments in ICT, R&D and organizational
innovation, and the effects of different investment profiles on TFP growth at the firm-level.
We find that the investment decisions are complementary, in the sense that investing in one
direction increases the probability of investing in another because joint investments lead to
higher TFP growth than individual investments. We find a strong complementarity between
R&D and organizational innovation, which could be related to new ways of managing
knowledge systems and external relations. To our knowledge this relation has not been ex-
plored intensively in the literature. The fact that the magnitude of the complementarity be-
tween ICT and organizational innovation is lower than the other complementarities also mer-
its some further investigation, in particular considering software investments in addition to
hardware. There is clear evidence that ICT and R&D complement each other. This means that
R&D policies stimulate investments in ICT, and conversely policies designed to stimulate
ICT also increase the demand for R&D. ICT earns on average an expected rate of return of
9.7%, followed by 6% to 7% on organizational innovation and a modest 1.4% to 1.8% on
R&D.

Our plans are to extend this paper further in a number of directions. Firstly, we want to ex-
ploit different types of organizational innovation that are available in our data (business prac-
tices, knowledge systems, and external relations), as they could relate differently to ICT and
R&D. Secondly, as mentioned above, it will be good to consider software investment next to
hardware investment even though we only have data from 2012 for this type of asset. Thirdly,
we could estimate the elasticities of labor and capital together with the returns to ICT, R&D
and organizational innovation. A fourth extension would be to use the intensities of R&D and
ICT in the productivity growth equation instead of, or in addition to, just the binary infor-
mation.

Appendix: Calculation of the maximum simulated likelihood

This part is based on Train (2003) and Capellari and Jenkins (2006). For simplicity we take
the case of two strategies and one performance equation. The example can easily be general-
ized to 3 strategies and one performance equation. We start by using a Cholesky factorization
of Ω:
                               1           1                            1

have this Ω matrix, we elements of 𝐶 are as follows: 𝑐11 = 1, 𝑐21 = 𝜌21 , 𝑐31 = 𝜌31 𝜎3 ,

𝑐22 = �(1 − 𝑐21 2 ), 𝑐32 = (𝜌32 𝜎3 − 𝑐31 ∗ 𝑐21 )/𝑐22 , 𝑐33 = �(𝜎32 − 𝑐31 2 − 𝑐32 2 . The 𝜌𝑖𝑖 coef-
ficients are imposed to stay between -1 and 1 by using the following reparameterization:

The first step of the maximum simulated likelihood algorithm consists in drawing for each

In our application the model has four equations, and a step is added between the second and
third step above. The logic is the same but there are 8 inequalities to take into account, and 8
elements in the likelihood function. The steps are repeated 50 times and then an average is



                                                                                                23
taken of the corresponding values of the likelihood function. 9 The parameters of the likeli-
hood function are then estimated using a numerical maximization algorithm, at each iteration
repeating the simulation-based computation of the likelihood function starting from the up-
dated values of the estimated parameters.
