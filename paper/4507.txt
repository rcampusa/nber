       This article derives the optimal award to a winning plaintiff and the optimal penalty on
a losing plaintiff when the probability of prevailing varies among plaintiffs. Optimality is
defined in terms of achieving a specified degree of deterrence of potential injurers with the
lowest litigation cost. Our main result is that the optimal penalty on a losing plaintiff is positive,
in contrast to common practice in the United States. By penalizing losing plaintiffs and raising
the award to winning plaintiffs (relative to what it would be if losing plaintiffs were not
penalized), it is possible to discourage relatively low-probability-of-prevailing plaintiffs from
suing without discouraging relatively high-probability plaintiffs, and thereby to achieve the
desired degree of deterrence with lower litigation costs. This result is developed first in a model
in which all Suits are assumed to go to trial and then in a model in which settlements are
possible.

1. Introduction

      This article derives the optimal award to a winning plaintiff and the

optimal penalty on a losing plaintiff when the probability of prevailing

varies among plaintiffs. Optimality is defined in terms of achieving a

specified degree of deterrence of potential injurers with the lowest

litigation cost. Our main result is that the optimal penalty on a losing

plaintiff is positive, in contrast to common practice in the United States.

This result is developed first in s model in which all suits are assumed to go

to trial (Section 2) and then in a model in which settlements are possible

(Section 3). We conclude with some observations about two related

topics --   the British rule for allocating litigation costs and Becker's theory

of public enforcement (Section 4))

      The essence of our argument is that if losing plaintiffs are not

penalized, then it is possible to impose a penalty and raise the award so as

to reduce the value of suits for relatively low-probability-of-prevailing

plaintiffs while at the same time increase the value of suits for relatively

high-probability-of-prevailing plaintiffs. This is feasible because, by

definition, low-probability plaintiffs have a lower probability of winning at

trial, or equivalently, a higher probability of losing, than high-probability

plaintiffs. As a result, imposing e penalty will dissdvantsge low-probability

plaintiffs more than high-probability plaintiffs, while rsising the award will


       Our article is the first to demonstrate the desirability of a general
policy of imposing a penalty on s plaintiff if he loses. Of related interest,
however, are srticles that evaluate alternative rules for allocating
litigation costs, including making a losing plaintiff psy the defendant's
legal fees. For two recent exsmples, see Grsvelle (1993) and Bebchuk and
Chang (1992).   (We show in Section 4 that the optimal penalty may differ
substantially from the defendant's legal fees.) Also of interest are srticles
that consider the use of penalties to control frivolous suits. See, for
example, Katz (1990, pp. 19-20) and Polinsky and Rubinfeld (1993).

benefit high-probability plaintiffa more than low-probability plaintiffs.

Reducing the value of suits for low-probability plaintiffs will cause fewer of

them to sue, thereby saving litigation costs, while raising the value of suits

for high-probability plaintiffs increases the defendant's expected payment,

thereby allowing deterrence to be maintained.



2. The Basic Analysis

         A risk-neutrsl injurer engages in conduct that causes harm to one of a

number of risk-neutral potential victims.         (We will use the terms "injurer"

and "defendant" interchangeably, and similarly for "victim" and "plaintiff.")

The probability of prevailing at trial varies among potential victims.2 Each

one knows his probability of prevailing, but the injurer knows only the

distribution of the probabilities among potential plaintiffs.

         In the basic analysis, all suits are assumed to go to trial. If the

plaintiff wins, he receives an award from the defendant. If the plaintiff

loses, he pays a penalty to the defendant. Each side hears its own trial

costs.

         The following notation will be used:

             p =   probability   that the plaintiff will prevail at trial;

          f(p) —   density   of p among potential plaintiffs;

             x — award paid to the plsintiff from the defendant if the

                   plaintiff prevails at trial (x    0);




     2 The probability might vary because plaintiffs differ in their ability
to marshall evidence about issues relating to causality or fault. In products
liability cases, for example, some victims may have kept packing material or a
receipt as proof of purchase, while others may not have. In accident cases,
evidence about fault sometimes may be destroyed and sometimes may not be.

             y —   penalty   paid by the plaintiff to the defendant if the

                   plaintiff loses at trial (y             0);

            c, —   plaintiff's   trial coat; and

            td —   defendant's   trial coat.

The population of potential plaintiffs is normalized to be unity.

       A victim will file a suit if the expected value of the trial outcome

exceeds his trial coat. Let

 V(p, x, y) — expected value to a plaintiff of the trial outcome

                   exclusive of hia trial coat, given p, x, and y.

       We assume that x > c. so that if the probability of prevailing ia

sufficiently high, a victim will bring a auit (otherwise a victim would not

sue even if he were certain to win). Alao, if the probability of prevailing

is low enough, a victim will not find it worthwhile to aue. Let

      (x, y) — value of the probability of prevailing below which
                   a victim will not sue and above which he will aue,3

where (x, y) ia defined by:

Solving for        yields

                              (x, y) —   (y +    c)/(x + y)           c 1,    (3)

where the inequality follows from the aaaumption that x > cp. We will refer

to (x, y) as the "critical probability of prevailing."

      In general, social welfare includes the gain to the defendant from

engaging in the harmful conduct, the harm to the plaintiff, and the litigation

costs borne by both parties. For our purposes, however, it is not necessary

to derive the optimal award and penalty from the maximization of social

welfare. We simply want to show that if the award is positive and the penalty

is zero, it always is possible to increase social welfare by raising both the

award and the penalty. We will do this by demonstrating that a higher award

and penalty combination can be choaen that achieves the same degree of

deterrence of the defendant -    - and       therefore the same gain to the defendant

and the same harm to the plaintiff --              but   does so with lower litigation costs.

      To be precise, if x' is any award when the penalty, y, is zero, we will

show that there exists an x" > x' and a y" > 0 such that D(x", y") —                           D(x'   ,   0)
and L(x", y") < L(x', 0).

      As a preliminary matter, let ' be the initial value of the critical

probability of prevailing (the value when x —                x' and y — 0):
                                 —   (x'     ,    0) —   c/x'   .                                         (6)

Now define y(x) to be the value of y that solves 'x -                  (1   -
                                                                                ')y   =   c,   for a

given x; then

                                          y(x) —       ('x c)/(l i').
                                                            -                    -
                                                                                                                          (7)

8y construction, (x, y(x)) ' .                             In   other words, for every combinstion of x

snd y(x), the value of the critical probability of prevailing is the same as

the initial value. Hence, litigation costs are the same with x and y(x) as

with x' and no penalty.

          If x —   c/'     ,
                                   then   from (6), x —          x'    ,   and from (7), y(x)               0; in other

words, starting with x equal to c/' is equivalent to starting with x' and no

penalty. Now substitute y(x) for y in V(p, x, y) to get, using (1),

                V(p, x, y(x)) —                  [(p   -
                                                           ')x   + (1        -
                                                                                     p)c]/(l   -
                                                                                                   i').                   (8)
It is clear from (8) that for all p >                           ',V          is strictly increasing in x.

Thus, if x is raised above c/' , say to some x", and the penalty is set equal

to y(x"), then V(p, x", y(x")) > V(p,                           x' ,       0) for all p >          ' . Since       the

critical probability of prevailing remains at '                                        , it follows from (4) that
deterrence will have risen above the initial level --                                          that   is,

D(x", y(x")) >       D(x'      ,    0).    Note also that y(x") >                      0   since, from (7), y(x) is

strictly increasing in x.

          To restore deterrence to the initial level, keep x equal to C and raise

y above y(x"), to some y", until deterrence falls to D(x' ,                                           0).   That

deterrence declines as the penalty rises is clear since V is strictly

decreasing in y and fi is strictly incressing in y.5 Moreover, as y —

V   -.   - for all   p <       1    and     -,
                                                 1, implying that deterrence must approach zero


       To focus on the logic of the argument, we ignore constraints (such as
the defendant's or the plaintiff's wealth or considerations of fairness) that
might prevent the award or the penalty from being raised to the desired level.

           It is obvious from (1) that V is strictly decreasing in y. From (3)
                        + y)2 > 0.
3/3y — (x      -
                   c)/(x
(essentially no one sues). Thus, assuming continuity, there exists a y" >

y(x") > 0 such that D(x", y") —    D(x'   ,   0).   And since   is strictly increasing

in y, L(x", y") C L(x' ,   0).   This establishes the desired result.6

      The reason it is possible to raise the award and the penalty so as to

discoursge suits without reducing deterrence is, in essence, because potential

plaintiffs whose probability of prevailing is sufficiently high are favorably

affected by these changes, while potential plaintiffs whose probability is

relatively low are adversely affected. The former group benefits because the

expected value of the incresse in the award more than offsets the expected

value of the increase in the penalty; the latter group suffers for the

opposite reason. It is the detrimental effect on the latter group that causes

fewer suits to be brought, while the beneficial effect on the former group

allows deterrence to be maintained.

      To appreciate the advantage of imposing a penalty on losing plaintiffs,

consider the following numerical example. Let there be two potential

plaintiffs, one with a probability of prevailing of 0.3 and the other with a

probability of 0.8. Each is equally likely to be injured. If a suit is

filed, both the plaintiff and the defendant incur $20,000 in trial costs.

Suppose initially that the award to a winning plaintiff is $100,000 and that

there is no penalty imposed on a losing plaintiff. Given these values, both

the low-probability and the high-probability plaintiff will sue if injured,

the level of deterrence achieved against the defendant is $75,000, and




     6 It should be clear from the structure of this argument that social
welfare can be increased by raising the award and the penalty starting from
jj award and penalty combination. We started with a positive award and a
penalty of zero because this most closely reflects the conventional practice
in the United States.

                                          -6-
litigation costs sre $40,000. It is easily shown that raising the award to

a winning plaintiff from $100,000 to $174,000 and imposing a penalty of

$46,000 on a losing plaintiff will lead only the high-probability plaintiff to

sue, will achieve the same level of deterrence against the defendant, and will

reduce litigation costs by half, to $20,000.



3. Settlements

        This section extends the analysis of the previous section to a model in

which settlements are possible.

        The following sequence of events is assumed to occur. First, the victim

decides whether to file a suit. Second, if a suit is filed, the defendant

makes a single take-it-or-leave-it settlement offer (a refusal to settle

corresponds to an offer of zero).9 Third, the plaintiff decides whether to

accept the defendant's offer or to go to trial.

        Let




       The low-probability plaintiff will sue because .3 x $100,000 — $30,000
> $20,000; the high-probability plaintiff has an even stronger motive to sue.
The level of deterrence achieved against the defendant is .5[(.3 x $100,000) +
$20,000] + .5[(.8 x $100,000) + $20,000] — $75,000. Litigation costs are
$40,000 (the sum of the plaintiff's and the defendant's trial costs) because a
suit will result whenever harm occurs.

       The low-probability plaintiff now will be indifferent between suing and
not suing because (.3 x $174,000) - (.7 x $46,000) — $20,000 (the penalty
could be raised by a dollar to make him strictly prefer to not sue). The
high-probability plaintiff obviously then will have a positive motive to sue.
The level of deterrence achieved against the defendant is .5](.8 x $174,000) -
(.2 x $46,000) + $20,000] — $75,000. Litigation costs now are .5 x $40,000 —
$20,000.
       We assume that the defendant (the uninformed party) makes a settlement
offer in order to avoid the "signalling" complications that would arise if the
plaintiff (the informed party) made a settlement demand - - the magnitude of
the demand might convey information to the defendant about the plaintiff's
type.
            s —   settlement   offer of the defendsnt.

For notational simplicity, we will not indicste explicitly thst the

defendant's choice of s depends on x and y. Since a plaintiff whose

probability of prevailing equals unity would obtain s net benefit of x -                         c
from going to trial, and all other plaintiffs would obtain less, this is the

highest settlement offer the defendant would make. Thus,

                                    0    s        x -       cp.                                      (9)

      We assume for simplicity that it is costless to file a suit.

Consequently, a victim will file a suit regardless of his probability of

prevailing at trial since if the defendant offers any positive settlement,

filing a suit and accepting the settlement offer is preferable to not filing

the suit.

      If the plaintiff accepts the defendant's offer, he obtains 5;                      if he
rejects it, his expected payoff at trial is px - (1                -
                                                                       p)y   -

p is low enough, the plaintiff will accept the settlement offer. Let

    (x, y) — value of the probability of prevailing below which

                  a plaintiff will accept the settlement offer and

                  above which he will go to trial,

where (x, y) is defined by:

the inequality follows from (9). We will refer to (x, y) as the "critical

probability of prevailing."0

employed here as well since   plays an analogous role and  will not be
referred to in Section 3.

      Given the defendant's choice of the settlement offer, the level of

deterrence achieved is

                                                            1
                   D(x, y) —      J'sf(p)dp           + f[v(p, x, y) + cdJf(p)dp,              (12)
                                  0

and litigation costs are

                                                       1
                                 L(x, y) —            f(c
                                                      p
                                                          + cd)f(p)dp.                         (13)


      As in Section 2, we will show that if x' is any award when the penalty

is zero, there exists an x" > x' and a y" >0 such that D(x", y") —                  D(x'   ,   0)

and L(x", y") C L(x' ,    0) .    This      result is more difficult to demonstrate here

because deterrence results in part from settlement payments and the

defendant's choice of a changes as x and y change. The structure of the

proof, however, parallels that in Section 2.

      Let a' be the settlement offer chosen by the defendant when the award is

x' and there is no penalty. We assume that

                                             s' C x' -          c;                             (14)

otherwise (if a' —   x'   -
                              cr),    all plaintiffs would accept the settlement offer

initially and it would be impossible to lower litigation costs further.

      Let j'   be the initial value of the critical probability of prevailing:
                          —      (x'   ,   0) —       (s'    + c)/x' C 1,                      (15)

where the inequality follows from (14).

      Define y(x) to be

                           y(x) —          ('x c)/(l i').
                                                  -             -
                                                                                               (16)

It is easy to verify that

               (x, y(x)) —        '+        [(1 - ')/(x - c)}s              '   .              (17)
Thus, for every x and y(x), the value of the critical probability of
prevailing is no less than the initial value.

         We will next show that there exists an x" > x' and a y(x") > 0 such that

D(x", y(x")) > D(x' ,          0).   Starting from x —        c/'   ,   in which     case y(x) — 0, let

x grow without bound. First suppose that (x, y(x)) • 1 as x •                               then it

must be that a -. m as well (otherwise, from (17), it is clear that                           would

approach ' C 1.). Therefore, the first integral in (12) increases without

bound, implying that there exists an C > x' such that D(x", y(x")) >

D(x' ,   0);    and since y(x) is increasing in x, clearly y(x") > 0.

         Alternatively, if           does not approach unity as x -'            , then    there exists

an E     > 0 and some arbitrarily large x, say x*, such that                           y(x)) C 1 -

Since

                      V(p, x, y(x)) —   [(p   -
                                                  ')x + (1 - p)c]/(l        -
                                                                                ')                    (18)

grows without bound in x for all p > '                 , it follows that the second integral
in (12) can be made arbitrarily large." Hence, again there exists an

x" > x' such that D(x", y(x")) > 0(x' ,               0)    and y(x") > 0.

         Next, keeping x equal to x", raise y above y(x") until deterrence falls

to D(x' ,      0) .     To see that this can be done, first note that aa y -,               ,V   -.   -
for    all p C 1 and • 1.            This implies that if y is high enough, the defendant

will chooae a — 0.            For if a positive a is chosen, the defendant's coats are

at least s (everyone will file suit and at a minimum collect the settlement

offer), whereas if s —0, the defendant's costs approach zero as y -,                            (since
the probability of suit goes to zero and the coat to the defendant of being

sued declines with y). Hence, deterrence must approach zero as y •

implying       (assuming continuity) that there exists a y" > y(x") > 0 such that




           That p > ' over the range of integration in the second integral in
(12) follows from (17).

                                                     10 -
D(x", y")     D(x' ,   0).
      Finally, it remains to be ahown that litigation costa fall. First

observe from (11) that (x, y) can be written as

                  (x, y) —      [s/(x   +   y)]    +    [(y   +
                                                                  c)/(x + y)}.                    (19)

By construction, for every x and y(x) combination, the second term in brackets

equals f'    (see (16)). Since this term is strictly increasing in y, when x was
held constant at x" and y was raised from y(x") to y", the second term

increased above ' . Moreover, the first term in brackets is non-negative.

Thus, (x", y") > T'      ,   which implies that L(x", y") < L(x'             ,   0)   and completes

the proof.

      Although the analysis in this section is more complicated because of the

possibility of settlements, the underlying intuition is similar to that

discussed previously. Raising the award and the penalty benefits plaintiffs

whose probability of prevailing is relatively high and disadvantages

plaintiffs whose probability is relatively low. In Section 2 this had the

effect of discouraging individuals in the latter group from filing suit,

whereas here it discourages them from going to trial. In both instances,

litigation costs fall as a consequence. Deterrence can be maintained, in

Section 2 as well as here, because the expected value of the trial outcome is

enhanced for the relatively high-probability-of-prevailing plaintiffs.



4. Concludins Remarks

      Thia section explains how our analysis of optimal awards and penalties

relatea to the British rule for allocating litigation coats and to Becker's

theory of public enforcement.




                                                  -    11 -
      (a) The British rule for allocating litigation costs. We assumed that

each side paid for its own trial costs regardless of the outcome of the

trial -- a practice commonly referred to as the American rule. An alternative

is the British rule, under which the loser pays the winners litigation coats.

      One could view a switch from the American rule to the British rule as a

way of implementing the type of changes suggested in this article. Relative

to the American rule, the British rule in effect increases the award to a

winning plaintiff --   by the amount of the plaintiff's litigation costs - - and
also imposes a penalty on a losing plaintiff -- equal to the defendant's

litigation coats. Thus, if the award otherwise cannot be varied and if the

penalty otherwise would be zero, the British rule might be superior to the

American rule for the reasons we discuss.

      It is important to note, however, that neither the implicit award nor

the implicit penalty under the British rule necessarily correspond closely to

the optimal award and penalty. This can be seen in the numerical example.

Recall that the plaintiff and the defendant each incurred trial costs of

$20,000. The award to a winning plaintiff was assumed to be $100,000 when

there was no penalty imposed on a losing plaintiff. Switching to the British

rule would in effect raise the award to a winning plaintiff to $120,000 and

impose a penalty of $20,000 on a losing plaintiff. Recall, however, that the

optimal award was $174,000 and the optimal penalty was $46,000. Thus, in this

example the optimal increase in the award is nearly four times the plaintiff's

litigation costs and the optimal penalty is more than twice the defendant's

litigation costs.12


      2 Moreover, it is easily shown in this example that the implicit
adjustments to the award and penalty under the British rule would not be
enough to discourage low-probability plaintiffs from suing, whereas the

                                      -   12   -
       (b) Becker's theory of public enforcement. Our analysis of optimal

awards and penalties in private litigation has an obvious parallel to Becker's

(1968) theory of optimal public enforcement. Becker showed that a higher fine

allows the probability of detection to be lowered without sacrificing

deterrence; enforcement costs are ssved as s consequence. In privste

litigation, we have shown that a higher award and penalty can lead to a lower

probability of suit or of trial without compromising deterrence; litigation

costs are saved as a result. In both contexts, therefore, the sanction is

raised, the probability of its imposition falls, and administrative costs are

reduced.

      It is well known that a logical implication of Becker's theory is that

fines should be as high as possible and the probability of detection should be

correspondingly low. Similarly, the logic of our analysis suggesta that the

award and the penalty should be as high as possible so that the probability of

suit or of trial falls substantially.

      Becker's theory has been criticized on the grounds that severe fines,

pdtentially as high as an individual's wealth, hardly ever are imposed. An

analogous criticism could be leveled against the implicationa of our analysis.

In both contexts, however, there are additional considerations -- such as

fairness or risk-bearing costs --   that,      if taken into account, would lead to

the conclusion that the optimal fine or the optimal award or penalty is not as

high as possible.




optimal award and penalty would deter such suits.
