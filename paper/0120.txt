         FROM BISMARCK TO WOODCOCK: THE "IRRATIONAL" PURSUIT
                    OF NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE



"Uniformity of practice seldom continues long without good reason."
                                           ——Samuel Johnson, 1775

"If an economic policy has been adopted by many communities, or if it
is persistently pursued by a society over a long span of time, it is
fruitful to assume that the real effects were known and desired."
                                           ——George Stigler, 1975



        Almost a century ago Prince Otto Edward Leopold von Bismarck,

the principal creator and first Reichschancellor of the new German nation—

state, introduced publicly—financed health insurance to the Western world.

Since then, nation after nation has followed his lead until today almost

every developed country has a full—blown national health insurance plan.

Some significant benchmarks along the way are the Russian system (intro-

duced by Lenin after the Bolshevik Revolution), the British National

Health Service (Beveridge and Bevan, 1945), and the Canadian federal—

provincial plans (hospital care in the late l950s, physicians' services

in the late l960s). In nearly all cases these plans built on previous

systems of medical organization and finance that reflected particular

national traditions, values, and circumstances.'

        In some health plans, such as those in the communist countries,

the government has direct responsibility for providing services. In

others, the production of medical care is still at least partially in

the private sector, but the payment for care is through taxes or compul-

sory insurance premiums which are really ear—marked taxes. Even in the

United States, the last major holdout against the world—wide trend,
                                     2




government funds pay directly for almost half of all health care expendi-

tures and pay indirectly for an appreciable additional share through tax

exemptions and allowances.2 Moreover, most observers believe it is only

a question of when Congress will enact national health insurance, not if

it will.

           Almost as obvious (to many economists) as the rise of public

subsidy of health insurance is the "irrational" aspect of. such programs.

Health insurance, in effect, reduces the price the consumer faces at the

time of purchase of medical care and therefore induces excessive demand.

Because the direct cost to the consumer is less than the true cost to

society of providing that care, he tends to over—consume medical care

relative to other goods and services. This misallocation of resources

results in a significant "welfare loss," which Martin Feldstein has

estimated at a minimum of $5 billion per annum in the United States.3

           Not only does society seem to be irrationally bent on encouraging

people to over—use medical care, but in the free market for health insur-

ance people also tend to buy the "wrong" kind. Most economists agree

that to the extent that health insurance serves a useful purpose it is

to protect consumers against large, unexpected bills for medical care.

All insurance policies are actuarily "unfair," that is, they carry a load

factor for administrative costs, but if consumers are risk averse, it is

worthwhile for them to pay these costs in order to protect themselves

against unpredictable (for the individual) large losses. It follows,

therefore, that consumers should prefer major medical (catastrophe)

insurance, i.e. plans with substantial deductibles or co—payment provi-

sions for moderate expenses but ample coverage for very large expenses.
                                    3




Instead, we observe a strong preference for "first dollar" or shallow

coverage. Of the privately held hospital insurance policies in the United

States, the number covering the first day of hospitalization are several

times greater than the number covering long—term stays.

        Another apparent irrationality with respect to health insurance

was alleged by Milton Friedman in a Newsweek column in April, 1975. He

noted that Leonard Woodcock, President of the United Automobile Workers,

is leading the drive for universal comprehensive national health insur-

ance despite the fact that such a measure is

           against the interest of . . . members of his own union, and
     even of the officials of that union. . . . The UAW is a strong
     union and its members are among the highest paid industrial workers.
     If they wish to receive part of their pay in the form of medical
     care, they can afford, and hence can get, a larger amount than the
     average citizen. But in a governmental program, they are simply
     average citizens. In addition, a union or company plan would be
     far more responsive to their demands and needs than a universal
     national plan, so that they would get more per dollar spent.4

Friedman says that Woodcock is an "intelligent man," and therefore finds

his behavior a "major puzzle."

        From Bismarck to Woodcock, it seems that economists are drowning

in a sea of irrationality. But other economists warn us against jumping

to the "irrationality" conclusion. In particular, George Stigler has

taught us to look beyond the surface appearance of political actions

in search of their actual consequences and of the interests that they

serve. He writes,

     It seems unfruitful . . . to conclude from the studies of the
     effects of various policies that those policies which did not
     achieve their announced goals, or had perverse effects . .
     are simply mistakes of the society.5

In short, when confronted with some consistent and widespread behavior

which we cannot explain, we should not blithely assume that it is
                                   4




attributable to lack of information or bad judgment. We should be wary

of what might be called the "fallacy of misplaced ignorance." It may

be that the behavior we observe is more consistent with the self—interest

of particular individuals or groups than it first appears.

        It is to George Stigler that we are also indebted for the

"survivor principle," one of his many contributions to the study of

industrial organization.6 The basic notion is simple: if we want to learn

something about the relative efficiency of differently sized firms in an

industry, Stigler tells us to look at that industry over time and notice

which size classes seem to flourish and which do not. Can the "survivor

principle" be applied to institutions as well? If so, national health

insurance seems to pass with flying colors. No country that has tried it

has abandoned it, and those that have tried it partially usually expand

it. It may not be unreasonable to infer, therefore, that national health

insurance does serve some general interests. That is, there may be some

welfare gains lying below the surface that more than offset the losses

so apparent to many economists. An exploration of some of the special

or general benefits that might explain the widespread pursuit of national

health insurance follows.



The U.S. Already Has Implicit National Health Insurance

        Some of the observed behavior would seem less irrational if we

assume that the U.S. already has implicit national health insurance,

especially for catastrophic illness. If it is true that most uninsured

people who need care can get it one way or another——through government

hospitals, philanthropy, or bad debts——then it may be rational for people
                                   5




to buy only shallow coverage, or indeed, not to buy any insurance at all.

To suggest that there is implicit insurance in the United States covering

nearly everyone is not at all to suggest that there is equal access to

equal quality care. We know that so—called free care may often have some

stigma attached to it, may be less pleasant and less prompt, and may fail

in other ways as well. But it cannot be denied that a good deal of

medical care is delivered every year in the United States to persons who

do not have explicit insurance or the money to pay for it.

        Those persons without explicit insurance are essentially free—

riders. Those who do carry extensive insurance, such as the automobile

workers, in effect pay twice——once through the premiums for their own insurance

and again through taxes or inflated costs to cover care for those without

explicit insurance. If this is a significant factor, it could be

perfectly rational for the automobile workers to support universal

compulsory insurance. Why society provides implicit or (in most countries)

explicit coverage for all remains to be explained.



An Attempt to Control Providers

        Another reason why the UAW leaders and others may favor a single

national health plan is in the hope of gaining some control over the

providers of medical care——the hospitals and the physicians. In recent

years one of the major frustrations faced by the auto workers and other

groups with extensive insurance coverage is the rapid escalation in the

price of medical care. They may believe that only a single source

national health insurance plan will be in a position to control provider

behavior and stop the escalation in costs. Moreover, there is strong
                                     6



evidence that they are not alone in this view. One of the puzzles for
economists has been to explain the traditional opposition of the medical
profession   to legislation which, at least in the short run, increases

the demand for their services. This opposition probably stems in part

from the belief that national health insurance would ultimately result

in an increase in government control over providers.



Tax Advantages

        Why do people buy shallow coverage——where the administrative

load is high and the risk element relatively small? One reason is that

when the premium is paid by the employer the implicit income is free of

tax. Even health insurance premiums paid by the individual are partially

deductible from taxable income. If the tax laws allowed employers to

provide tax—free "food insurance," we would undoubtedly see a sharp

increase in that type of fringe benefit. But again the explanation is

not very satisfactory. Why do the tax laws encourage the purchase of

medical care but not food, clothing, or other necessities? In an attempt

to answer this question,we should consider some of the characteristics of

medical care and health insurance that are different from conventional

commodities.




Externalities

        One explanation for the popularity of national health insurance

that has great appeal for economists at the theoretical level is that

there are substantial external benefits associated with the consumption

of medical care. If this were true, then governmental subsidy of care
                                     7




need not be irrational; indeed it might be irrational not to provide

that subsidy. The best example of potential externalities is the

prevention or treatment of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis.

In earlier times these diseases constituted a very significant portion of

overall health problems, but are much less important today. Furthermore,

if a concern with externalities were the chief motivation, it would be

logical and feasible to subsidize those services (e.g. venereal disease

clinics) which are clearly addressed to the communicable diseases.

However, even economists who are strong advocates of national health

insurance, such as Lester Thurow, do not rely on the externality argument.

Thurow writes "Once a society gets beyond public health measures and

communicable diseases, medical care does not generate externalities."7

           Mark Pauly has called attention to one special kind of

 externality which probably is operative. It involves the satisfaction

 people get from knowing that someone else who is sick is getting medical

 attention.8 This satisfaction could be purchased by voluntary philan-

 thropy, but the total amount so purchased is likely to be less than

 socially optimal since each individual's giving tends to be based on his

 or her private satisfaction, ignoring the effects on others. The solu-

 tion may be compulsory philanthropy, i.e. tax—supported programs.



 A   Matter of "Life or Death"
          Another explanation for national health   insurance that has great

 appeal at the theoretical level but carries less conviction empirically

 is that "the market should not determine life or death." This theme is

 advanced by Arthur Okun in his new book, Equality and Efficiency, the Big
                                   8




Tradeoff, and is a basic tenet of those who argue that "health care is a

right." There is considerable logic in the argument that society may be

unwilling to accept the consequences of an unequal distribution of income

for certain kinds of allocation decisions such as who serves in the army

during wartime, who gets police protection, and who faces other life—

threatening situations. It may be easier and more efficient to control

such allocations directly than to try to redistribute money income

(possibly only temporarily) to achieve the desired allocation.

        Although this explanation has a certain thoretical appeal, one

problem with it is that the vast majority of health services do not

remotely approach a "life or death" situation. Moreover, the ability

of medical care to make any significant contribution to life expectancy

came long after Bismarck and Lenin advocated national health insurance.

Even today, when some medical care is very effective, it is possible

that housing, nutrition, and occupation have more influence on life

expectancy than does medical care, yet we allow inequality in the

distribution of income to determine allocation decisions in those areas.

According to Peter Townsend, there is no evidence that the British

National Health Service has reduced class differences in infant mortality,

maternal mortality, or overall life expectancy.   If equalizing life

expectancy were society's goal, it is not at all clear that heavy emphasis

on national health insurance is an optimal strategy.

        The emphasis on medical care rather than other programs that

might affect life expectancy is sometimes defended by the statement

that it is more feasible. Although diet or exercise or occupation may

have more effect on life expectancy than does medical care, it may be        S
                                     9



technically simpler to alter people's consumption of medical care rather

than to alter their diet, etc. It has also been argued that it is

politically more feasible to push medical care rather than alternative

strategies. The distinction between technical and political feasibility

is not, of course, clear cut because the former depends in part on what

we are willing to do in the way of permitting government to intrude on

personal decisions——a political question. However, to the extent that

the popularity of national health insurance is said to be attributable

to its political feasibility, we have really not explained much. Its

political popularity is precisely the question we started with.




The Growth of Egalitarianism

           Life expectancy aside, one way of interpreting the growth of

national health insurance is as an expression of the desire for greater

equality in society. British economists John and Sylvia Jewkes have

written,

    The driving force behind the creation of the National Health
    Service was not the search for efficiency or for profitable
    social investment. It was something quite different: it was
    a surging national desire to share something equally.-°


           An American economist, C. M. Lindsay, has developed a theoretical

model which analyzes alternative methods for satisfying the demand for

equality of access to medical care. Among other things, he shows that

if this demand for equality is widespread, there are externalities

similar to those discussed by Pauly in connection with philanthropy.

Thus a free market approach will result in less equality than people

really demand. He also shows that the British National Health Service
                                   10



can perhaps best be understood as an attempt to satisfy this demand for

equality. He concludes, ". .   . the   politician's sensitive ear may read

the preferences of his constituents better than the econometrician with
                ,,11
his computer.

        Why the demand for equality has grown over time and why it should

find expression in medical care more than in other goods and services

are not easy questions to answer. Is there really more altruism in

society now than before? Were Bismarck and Lenin the most altruistic

political leaders of their time? Is it simply the case that equality

is a normal "good", i.e. we buy more of it when our income rises? If

this is the explanation, what are the implications for equality in a

no—growth economy?

        Perhaps there has been no real increase in altruism at all.

Perhaps what we observe is a response to an increase in the ability of

the less well—off to make life miserable for the well—off through strikes,

violence, and other social disruptions. On this view health insurance

is part of an effort to buy domestic stability. It may be that

industrialization and urbanization make us all more interdependent, thus

increasing the power of the "have-nots" to force redistributions of

one kind oranother. Or perhaps there has been a decline in the

willingness of the "haves" to use force to preserve the status quo.

        Such speculations, if they contain some validity, would explain

a general increase in egalitarian legislation, but they would not help

much in explaining why this legislation has focused heavily on medical

care. Indeed, is it not curious that society should choose to emphasize

equality in access to a service that makes little difference at the
                                   11



margin in life expectancy or to economic or political position and power?

A cynic might argue that it is not curious at all since it is precisely

because medical care does not make much difference that those with power

are willing to share it more equally with those with less. Indeed, one

might argue that the more a society has significant, enduring class

distinctions, the more it needs the symbolic equality of national health

Insurance to blunt pressures for changes that alter fundamental class or

power relationships.

        One egalitarian goal that has always had considerable acceptance

in the United States is equality of opportunity. Thus, a popular

argument in favor of national health insurance is that it would help to

equalize access to medical care for children. Some recent theoretical

work on the economics of the family, however, calls into question the

effectiveness of such programs. Gary Becker has argued that the thrust

of programs aimed at increasing investment in disadvantaged children can

be blunted by parents who can decrease their own allocation of time and

money to their children as investment by the state increases. The

increase in the welfare of the children, therefore, may be no greater

than if a cash subsidy equal to the cost of the program were given

directly to the parents. The ability of the "head" to reallocate family

resources may not, however, be as unconstrained as Becker's model assumes.

There may be legal or social constraints, or there may be a desire on the

part of the head to maintain the child's obedience, respect, or affec-

tion. Thus the importance of the reallocation effect is an empirical

question, about which at present we know virtually nothing.

"Papa    Knows Best"2
     -
          An argument advanced by Thurow in favor of transfers in kind—--

such as national health insurance——is that some individuals are not

competent to make their own   decisions.   He writes,

     Increasingly we are coming to recognize that the world is not
     neatly divided into the competent and the incompetent. There
     is a continuum of individuals ranging from those who are competent
     to make any and all decisions to those who are incompetent to make
     any and all decisions.1-3

Thurow argues that if society desires to raise each family up to some

minimum level of real welfare, it may be more efficient to do it through

in—kind transfers than through cash grants. Even if we agree with this

general argument, it does not follow as a matter of logic that subsi-

dizing medical care brings us closer to a social optimum. It may be the

case, for instance, that the "less able" managers tend to overvalue

medical care relative to other goods and services, in which case Thurow

ought to want to constrain their utilization rather than encourage it.

          More generally, there is the question whether government will,

on average, make "better" decisions than individuals. As Arrow has

stated in a slightly different context, "If many individuals, given

proper information, refuse to fasten their seat belts or insist on

smoking themselves into lung cancer or drinking themselves into

incompetence, there is no reason to suppose they will be any more

sensible in their capacity as democratic voters."4 Two arguments have

been suggested to blunt Arrow's critique. The first is that the "less

able" are less likely to vote; therefore the electoral process produces

decisions that reflect the judgment of the more able members of society.

Second, it has been suggested that there is considerable scope for
                                  13



discretionary behavior by elected representatives; they do not simply

follow the dictates of their constituents.15 It may be that their

judgment is generally better than that of the average citizen.



An Offset to an Unjust Tax,,16
               7I




        Suppose the U.S. were defeated by an enemy in war and had to

pay an annual tribute to the enemy of $100 billion. Suppose further

that the enemy collected this tribute by a tax of a random amount on

American citizens chosen at random. The U.S. government might

decide that this tribute tax was unjust and that it would be more

equitable for the federal government to pay the tribute from revenues

raised by normal methods of taxation. If the enemy insisted on collecting

the tribute from individual citizens on a random basis, the government

could choose to reimburse those paying the tribute.

        Some observers believe there is a close parallel between the

tribute example and expenditures for medil care. They see ill health

and the consumption of medical care as largely beyond the control of

the individual citizen——the cost is like an unjust tax——and the purpose

of national health insurance is to prevent medical expenditures from

unjustly changing the distribution of income. There is, of course, the

question whether, or how much, individuals can influence and control the

amount of their medical expenditures. Putting that to one side, however,

and assuming that the analogy is a good one, there are still some

questions that arise.

       One might ask why the government has to intervene to protect

people against the tribute tax? Why    couldn't   citizens in their private
                                   14




lives buy insurance against being taxed for tribute? The total cost and

the probabilities are known; therefore private insurance companies could

easily set appropriate premiums. One answer might be that this is also

inequitable to the extent that some people can afford the insurance more

easily than others. The government could easily remedy this, however,

by some modest changes in the distribution of income.

        Another problem, of course, is that some people might not buy

the insurance. They would be "free riders" because if they were hit

with a big tribute tax they would be unable to pay and others would have

to pay in their place. Furthermore, they would be wiped out financially,

so that society would have to support their families.

        To be sure, the government could both redistribute income to

take care of the premium and make insurance compulsory, but that becomes

almost indistinguishable from a national insurance plan. The only

difference then would be whether there is a single organization, the

government, underwriting the insurance, or whether there are several

private insurance companies.

        In the tribute tax example we have assumed that the probability

of loss would be identical across the population, but this is clearly

not true for health insurance. One argument advanced in support of

national health insurance is that it does not require higher risk individuals

to pay higher premiums. A counter argument is that individuals do have

some discretion concerning behavior that affects health and concerning

the utilization of medical care for given health conditions. National

health insurance, it is alleged, distorts that behavior. A related

argument is that medical care will always have to be rationed in some
                                   15




way and that national health insurance requires the introduction of

rationing devices other than price and income. These devices carry

their own potential for inequity and inefficiency.



The Decline of the Family

        Illness is as old as mankind, and, while frequently in the past

and not infrequently today, there is little that can be done to change

the course of disease, there is much that can be done to provide care,

sympathy, and support. Traditionally most of these functions were provided

within the family. The family was both the mechanism for insuring against

the consequences of disease and disability and the locus of the production

of care. The only rival to the family in this respect until modern times

was the church, a subject to be considered below.

        With industrialization and urbanization, the provision of

insurance and of care tended to move out of the family and into the

market. Thus, much of the observed increase in medical care's share

of total economic activity is an accounting illusion. It is the result

of a shift in the production of care from the home, where it is not

considered part of national output, to hospitals, nursing homes and the

like, where it is counted as part of the GNP. Unlike the production of

bread, however, which also moved from the family to the market (and

stayed there), medical care, or at least medical insurance, increasingly

became a function of the state.

        One possible explanation is that the state is more efficient

 because there are significant economies of scale. With respect to the

 production of medical care, the economies of scale argument can fairly
                                   16



safely be rejected. Except for some exotic tertiary procedures, the

economies of scale in the production of physicians' services and hospital

services are exhausted at the local or small region level. For the insur-

ance function itself, there may be significant economies of scale.

Definitive studies are not available, but the proposition that a single

national health insurance plan would be cheaper to administer than

multiple plans cannot be rejected out of hand.17 To be sure, a single

plan would presumably reduce consumer satisfaction to the extent that

the coverage of the plan would represent a compromise among the variety

of plans different individuals and groups might prefer.

        The relationship between the declining importance of the family

and the growing importance of the state is complex. Not only can the

latter be viewed as a consequence of the former, but the causality can

also run the other way. Every time the state assumes an additional

function such as health insurance, child care, or benefits for the aged,

the need for close family ties becomes weaker. Geographic mobility

probably plays a significant role in this two—way relationship. One of

the reasons why people rely more on the state and less on their family

is that frequently the family is geographically dispersed. The other

side of the coin is that once the state assumes responsibilities that

formerly resided with the family, individuals feel freer to move away

from the family, both literally and figuratively.

        It has often been alleged that these intra—family dependency

relationships are inhibiting and destructive to individual fulfillment.

Whether a dependency relationship with the state will prove less bur-

densome remains to be seen. There is also the question whether the

efficient provision of impersonal "caring" is feasible.
                                     17




The Decline of Religion

        In traditional societies when the family was unable to meet the

needs of the sick, organized religion frequently took over. Indeed,

practically all of the early hospitals in Europe were built and staffed

by the church and served primarily the poor. The development of strong

religious ties, with tithes or contributions frequently indistirguishable

from modern taxes, can be viewed as an alternative mechanism for dealing

with the philanthropic externalities discussed previously. Moreover, at

a time when technical medical care was so ineffective, religion offered

a particular kind of symbolic equality——in the next world if not in this

one. Thus, the decline of organized religion, along with the weakening

of the family, may have created a vacuum which the state is called upon

to fill.




The "Political" Role

           When refugees from the Soviet Union were interviewed in Western

Europe after World War II, they invariably praised the West and disparaged

 life in Russia——with one notable exception. They said they sorely missed

 the comprehensive health insurance provided by the Soviet state.18 It may

be that one of the most effective ways of increasing allegiance to the

 state is through national health insurance. This was undoubtedly a

 prime motive for Bismarck as he tried to weld the diverse German

 principalities into a nation. It is also alleged that he saw national

 health insurance as an instrument to reduce or blur the tension and

 conflicts between social classes.

           We live at a time when many of the traditional symbols and

 institutions that held a nation together have been weakened and have
                                    18



fallen into disrepute. A more sophisticated public requires more

sophisticated symbols, and national health insurance may fit the role

particularly well.



Why Is the U.S. Last?

        One rough test of the various explanations that have been pro-

posed is to see if they help us understand why the U.S. is the last major

developed country without national health insurance. Several reasons for

the lag can be suggested. First, there is a long tradition in the U.S.

of distrust of government. This country was largely settled by immi-

grants who had had unfavorable experiences with governments in Europe

and who had learned to fear government rather than look to it for support

and protection. Second, it is important to note the heterogeneity of

our population compared to some of the more homogeneous populations of

Europe. We are certainly not a single "people" the way, say, the

Japanese are. Brian Abel—Smith has noted, for instance, that the U.S.

poor were often Negroes or new immigrants with whose needs the older

white settlers did not readily identify. 19

        The distrust of government and the heterogeneity of the population

probably account for the much better developed non—governmental voluntary

institutions in the U.S. Close observers of the American scene ever

since de Toqueville have commented on the profusion of private non—profit

organizations to deal with problems which in other countries might be

considered the province of government. These organizations can be viewed

as devices for internalizing the philanthropic externalities discussed

earlier in this paper, but the organizations are frequently limited to
                                  19



individuals of similar ethnic background, religion, region, occupation,

or other shared characteristic.

        Another possible reason for the difference in attitudes between

the U.S. and Europe is the greater equality of opportunity in this

country. In the beginning this was based mostly on free or cheap land,

and later on widespread public education. Moreover, the historic class

barriers have been weaker here than in countries with a strong feudal

heritage. To cite one obvious example, consider the family backgrounds

of university faculties in Sweden and the U.S. Sweden is often hailed

as the outstanding example of a democratic welfare state, but the faculty

members at the leading universities generally come from upper class

backgrounds. By contrast, the faculties at Harvard, Chicago, Stanford,

and other leading American universities include many men and women who

were born in modest circumstances. With greater equality of opportunity

goes a stronger conviction that the distribution of income is related

to effort and ability. Those who succeed in the system have much less
sense of noblesse oblige than do the upper classes In Europe, many of

whom owe their position to the accident of birth. In the U.S., even

those who have not succeeded or only partially succeeded seem more

willing to acquiesce in the results.



Summing Up

        The primary purpose of this inquiry has been to attempt to explain

the popularity of national health insurance around the world. My answer

at this point is that probably no single explanation will suffice.

National health insurance means different things to different people. It
                                   20




always has. Daniel Hirschfield, commenting on the campaign for national

health insurance in the United States at the time of World War I, wrote:

     Some saw health insurance primarily as an educational and
     public health measure, while others argued that it was an
     economic device to precipitate a needed reorganization of
     medical practice. . . . Some saw it as a device to save
     money for all concerned, while others felt sure that it
     would increase expenditures significantly.2°

        Externalities, egalitarianism, the decline of the family and

traditional religion, the need for national symbols——these all may play

a part. In democratic countries with homogeneous populatIons, people seem

to want to take care of one another through programs such as national

health insurance, as members of the same family do, although not to the

same degree. In autocratic countries with heterogeneous populations,

national health insurance is often imposed from above, partly as a device

for strengthening national unity. The relative importance of different

factors undoubtedly varies from country to country and time to time,

but the fact that national health insurance can be viewed as serving so

many diverse interests and needs is probably the best answer to why

Bismarck and Woodcock are not such strange bedfellows after all.
