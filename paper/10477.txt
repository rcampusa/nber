Computable General Equilibrium models, widely used for the analysis of Free Trade Agreements
(FTAs) are often criticized for having poor econometric foundations. This paper improves the
linkage between econometric estimates of key parameters and their usage in CGE analysis in order
to better evaluate the likely outcome of a FTA for the Americas. Our econometric work focuses on
estimation of the elasticity of substitution among imports from different countries, which is
especially critical for evaluating the positive and normative outcomes of FTAs. We match the data
in the econometric exercise to the policy experiment at hand. Then we sample from the distribution
of parameter values given by our econometric estimates in order to generate a distribution of model
results, from which we can construct confidence intervals. We conclude that there is great potential
for combining econometric work with CGE-based policy analysis in order to produce a richer set
of results that are likely to prove more satisfying to the sophisticated policy maker.

       “The econometric cat was set among the pigeons when a second government-commissioned
       modelling study on the FTA was finally released… The second reason for the contradictory
       results is differing assumptions about an arcane economic relationship known as Armington
       elasticity.” (Financial Review, 2003)

    1. Introduction

          With the proliferation of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) over the past decade, demand for

quantitative analysis of their likely impacts has surged. The main quantitative tool for performing such

analysis is Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling. Yet these models have been widely

criticized for performing poorly (Kehoe, 2002) and having weak econometric foundations (McKitrick,

1998; Jorgenson, 1984). FTA results have been shown to be particularly sensitive to assumptions on

the price elasticity of export demand (henceforth, the trade elasticity). As will be demonstrated in

Section 2, small trade elasticities generate large terms of trade effects by reducing the responsiveness

of export demand. On the other hand, small trade elasticities reduce the likelihood of trade diversion,

as import sourcing becomes less sensitive to relative prices. Of course, large trade elasticities lead to

the opposite results. Critics are understandably wary of results being determined largely by the

authors’ choice of trade elasticities. Indeed, the sensitivity of welfare results to the choice of trade

elasticities has even surfaced in the popular press as witnessed in the opening quotation to this paper.1

          Where do these trade elasticities come from? CGE modelers typically draw the elasticities

from econometric work that uses time series price variation to identify an elasticity of substitution

between domestic goods and composite imports (Alaouze, 1977; Alaouze, Marsden, and Zeitsch,

1977; Stern et al., 1976; Gallaway, McDaniel and Rivera, 2003). This approach has three problems:

the use of point estimates as “truth”, downward bias in the magnitude of the point estimates created by

problems in the estimation technique, and a mis-match between the data sample and source of

variation in the econometric exercise and the policy experiment explored in the CGE exercise.

  In this article, two studies of the Australia-USA FTA are discussed, one which reports a gain, and one which
reports a loss. Differing assumptions about the benefits of services liberalization was the first reason identified,
while the second difference for the contradictory results was identified as the assumptions about the Armington
elasticities.
                                                          1
        First, modelers take point estimates drawn from the econometric literature, while ignoring the

precision of these estimates. As we will make clear below, the confidence one has in various CGE

conclusions depends critically on the size of the confidence interval around parameter estimates.

Standard “robustness checks” such as systematically raising or lowering the substitution parameters

fail to properly address this problem because they ignore information about which parameters we

know with some precision and which we do not.

        A second problem with most existing studies derives from the use of import price series to

identify home vs. foreign substitution. This approach tends to systematically understate the true

elasticity because these estimates take price variation as exogenous when estimating the import

demand functions, and ignore quality variation. When quality is high, import demand and prices will

be jointly high. This biases estimated elasticities toward zero. A related point is that the fixed-weight

import price series used by most authors are theoretically inappropriate for estimating the elasticities

of interest. CGE modelers generally examine a nested utility structure, with domestic production

substituting for a CES composite import bundle. The appropriate price series is then the

corresponding CES price index among foreign varieties. Constructing such an index requires

knowledge of the elasticity of substitution among foreign varieties (see below). By using a fixed-

weight import price series, previous estimates place too much weight on high foreign prices, and too

small a weight on low foreign prices. In other words, they overstate the degree of price variation that

exists, relative to a CES price index. Reconciling small trade volume movements with large import

price series movements requires a small elasticity of substitution. This problem, and that of

unmeasured quality variation, helps explain why typical estimated elasticities are very small.

        The third problem with the existing literature is that estimates taken from other researchers’

studies typically employ different levels of aggregation, and exploit different sources of price

variation, from what policy modelers have in mind. Employment of elasticities in experiments ill-

matched to their original estimation can be problematic. For example, estimates may be calculated at
                                                   2
a higher or lower level of aggregation than the level of analysis than the modeler wants to examine.

Estimating substitutability across sources for paddy rice gives one a quite different answer than

estimates that look at agriculture as a whole. In addition, when analyzing Free Trade Agreements, the

principle policy experiment is a change in relative prices among foreign suppliers caused by lowering

tariffs within the FTA. Understanding the substitution this will induce across those suppliers is critical

to gauging the FTA’s real effects. Using home vs. foreign elasticities rather than elasticities of

substitution among imports supplied from different countries may be quite misleading. Moreover,

these “sourcing” elasticities are critical for constructing composite import price series to appropriate

estimate home vs. foreign substitutability.

        In summary, the history of estimating the substitution elasticities governing trade flows in

CGE models has been checkered at best. Yet they are central to the welfare results of such studies.

Clearly there is a need for improved econometric estimation of these trade elasticities that is well-

integrated into the CGE modeling framework. This paper provides such estimation and integration,

and has several significant merits. First, we choose our experiment carefully. Our CGE analysis

focuses on the prospective Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) currently under

negotiation. This is one of the most important FTAs currently “in play” in international negotiations. It

also fits nicely with the source data used to estimate the trade elasticities, which is largely based on

world-wide imports into North and South America. Our assessment is done in a perfectly competitive,

comparative static setting in order to emphasize the role of the trade elasticities in determining the

conventional gains/losses from such an FTA. As highlighted by the quotation at the start of this paper,

this type of model is still widely used by government agencies for the evaluation of such agreements.

In fact, the GTAP model (Hertel 1997) which we employ in this paper is actively used in dozens of

public research institutions around the world. Extensions to incorporate imperfect competition are

straightforward, but involve the introduction of additional parameters (markups, extent of unexploited


                                                     3
scale economies) as well as structural assumptions (entry/no-entry, nature of inter-firm rivalry) that

introduce further uncertainty.

        Since our focus is on the effects of a preferential FTA we estimate elasticities of substitution

across multiple foreign supply sources. We do not use cross-exporter variation in prices or tariffs

alone. Exporter price series exhibit a high degree of multicolinearity, and in any case, would be

subject to unmeasured quality variation as described previously. Similarly, tariff variation by itself is

typically unhelpful because by their very nature, Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs are non-

discriminatory, affecting all suppliers in the same way. Tariff preferences, where they exist, are often

difficult to measure – sometimes being confounded by quantitative barriers, rules of origin, and other

restrictions. Instead we employ a unique data set drawing on not only tariffs, but also bilateral

transportation costs for goods traded internationally (Hummels, 1999). Transportation costs vary much

more widely than do tariffs, allowing more precise estimation of the trade elasticities that are central to

CGE analysis of FTAs. We have highly disaggregated commodity trade flow data, and are therefore

able to provide estimates that precisely match the commodity aggregation scheme employed in the

subsequent CGE model. We follow the GTAP Version 5.0 aggregation scheme which includes 42

merchandise trade commodities covering food products, natural resources and manufactured goods.

With the exception of two primary commodities that are not traded, we are able to estimate trade

elasticities for all merchandise commodities that are significantly different form zero at the 95%

confidence level.

        Rather than producing point estimates of the resulting welfare effects, we report confidence

intervals instead. These are based on repeated solution of the model, drawing from a distribution of

trade elasticity estimates constructed based on the econometrically estimated standard errors. There is

now a long history of CGE studies based on SSA: Systematic Sensitivity Analysis (Harrison and

Vinod, 1992; Wigle, 1991; Pagon and Shannon, 1987) However, to date, all of these studies have

taken their parameter distributions “from the literature”. None of these studies has been accompanied
                                                     4
by an econometric study in which the key parameters and their distributions are estimated using data

samples and variation that closely match the policy experiment considered in the CGE analysis.

           For this paper, we use the Gaussian Quadrature (GQ) approach to SSA, which has proven to

be the most efficient and unbiased approach to systematically assessing the sensitivity of model results

to parametric uncertainty (DeVuyst and Preckel, 1997; Arndt, 1996). We find that many of the results

are qualitatively robust to uncertainty in the trade elasticities. In those cases where our findings are not

robust, we explore the source of underlying uncertainty. In this way, the paper addresses the

fundamental question: How Robust Are CGE Analyses of Free Trade Agreements?



2. Explaining Welfare Changes: The Role of Trade Elasticities

           Due to the centrality of the trade elasticities to our argument, we begin by specifying the

nested CES import demands. Expenditure on each composite commodity i in region s, Eis, is

determined in general equilibrium by a combination of demand for the composite commodity in

private consumption, public consumption, investment demand and intermediate input demand.

Therefore, for purposes of partial equilibrium estimation, we treat this expenditure level as exogenous,

and focus on changes in its composition. The composite commodities are modeled as being a constant

elasticity of substitution (CES) function of domestic and imported goods (1), and, at the second level

of this preference structure, imports from different countries are combined in a CES function (2):

                                                             ϕi

Here, the index s denotes the importing region, QCis is utility of consuming composite commodity i in

this region, while QDis is utility from domestically produced i, and QMis is utility from composite

imports (obtained from equation (2)). The parameters βDis and βMis represent import-specific

preference weights on domestic versus imported goods, and ϕi is the elasticity of substitution between

domestic and imported sources of good i in region s. We assume that this elasticity is equal across

regions. In a similar fashion, the composite demand for imports (2) is a CES function of bilateral

imports of i, sourced from different exporting regions r: QMSirs where the birs is the associated

preference weight and σi is the elasticity of substitution among imports from different exporters.

Again, we assume that this elasticity is identical across regions.

            To determine aggregate demand for imports of commodity i into region s, the importing

region maximizes (1), conditional on aggregate commodity expenditure for each commodity Eis,

giving rise to the following import expenditure equation:

         Changes in welfare in response to an FTA may be decomposed using the method of Huff and

Hertel (1996), who provide an analytical decomposition of the Equivalent Variation (EV) for the

representative household in region s. 2 It is similar in spirit to that of Baldwin and Venables (1995),

however, unlike the latter decomposition, it allows for non-homothetic preferences, domestic taxes

and subsidies, and, most importantly, it assumes products are differentiated by origin (the Armington

assumption). This decomposition is also implemented numerically to decompose non-local welfare

changes. For the sake of brevity, we focus on the case where there are no export taxes, and domestic

taxes are applied only to consumption and production. (This assumption will be relaxed in the

empirical analysis.) As we will show, the elasticity of substitution is a key parameter determining

both positive responses to the FTAA as well as their normative implications.

         The EV decomposition is given by the following equation:

  The Huff-Hertel EV decomposition is obtained by starting with the equation for regional income as a function
of endowment income, plus taxes less subsidies. Into this equation, they substitute the general equilibrium
conditions for zero profits, price linkages, and market clearing for tradeables and non-tradeables. They deflate
income by deducting the appropriate price index from both sides of the equation, thereby obtaining equation (3)

2002).

         The first four summations on the right-hand side (RHS) of (7) measure the changes in

efficiency of resource utilization in region s. These involve the interaction of tax/subsidy distortions

with the change in associated quantities. Consider what happens when we eliminate the bilateral tariff

on imports of commodity i from one of the FTAA partner countries. The relevant term appears in the

first summation:

WQMSirs = (τ Mirs PCIFirs dQMSirs )                                                                           (8)

Here, ( τ Mirs PCIFirs ) is the per unit tariff revenue on imports of good i from r into s, associated with


the ad valorem tariff rate   τ Mirs .   This is multiplied by the change in the volume of imports of i from r

into s: dQMSirs . The “Harberger triangle” that we are measuring with this term may be seen in Figure

1. In order to evaluate the area of this triangle as the tariff is eliminated, we must consider both the

“base” ( τ MirsPCIFirs ) and the “height” ( dQMSirs ). By continually reevaluating the base of this triangle

as we solve the CGE model, we track the diminishing gap between PCIF and PMS. In this way, we

are able to accurately measure its area, which is then added to the aggregate welfare measure.

         In order to properly perform the numerical integration depicted in Figure 1, equation (7) must

be solved in conjunction with the CGE model, using appropriate solution procedures. We use version

8 of the GEMPACK software suite (Harrison and Pearson, 1996; 2002) which is ideally suited to this

problem, as it solves the non-linear CGE model using a linearized version of the behavioral equations,

coupled with updated equations that link the change (e.g., dQMS irs ) and levels (e.g., QMS irs )

variables. Standard extrapolation techniques can be used to obtain arbitrarily accurate solutions to any

well-posed problem (Harrison and Pearson, 1996; 2002).3

         Note from equation (7) we see that, in addition to tariffs, we consider volume interactions with

consumption taxes on household purchases of both domestic goods ( τ CDis ) and imported goods

( τ CMis ). Taxes (or subsidies) on output also play a role. If τ Ois < 0, then the production of commodity

i in region s is subsidized and an expansion of output ( qois > 0) will contribute negatively to efficiency

and hence to EV. The absence of terms associated with intermediate input taxes, as well as primary

factor taxes, mean that we are assuming these taxes are zero in this stylized example. (In the empirical

section below, this assumption will be relaxed.)

         The final two terms on the RHS of (7) refer to the terms of trade (TOT) effects for region s.

These determine how the global efficiency gains are shared amongst regions. If region s’s export-

weighted FOB prices rise, relative to her import -weighted CIF prices, then the TOT will improve.

Since one region’s export prices are another region’s import prices, the improved TOT for region s

translates into a TOT deterioration in the rest of the world (taken as a group).

         In summary, each region’s welfare gains can be decomposed into a terms of trade and an

allocative efficiency component. The essence of the FTAA experiment involves eliminating the trade

taxes within the block, i.e., τ MikA = 0, ∀i and ∀k , A ∈ FTAA . This, in turn, induces a shift in the

sourcing of imports, away from exporters outside the block and towards exporters within the block.

As seen from (5), the extent of this shifting depends on the Armington elasticity of substitution, σ i .

Log differentiating (5) and (6), and converting to percent changes (lower case denotes the percentage

change in the associated upper case levels variables), we obtain the following two equations

describing import sourcing in region s:
3
 For purposes of this paper, we require that 95% of the variables and levels variables are accurate to four digits.
Another useful check is to compare EVs computed from equation (3) with that computed directly from the utility
function. These match, to machine accuracy.

substituting in equations (9) – (10) to obtain the following decomposition of the local change in

where TRirs = (τ Mirs PCIFirs QMS irs ) = tariff revenue on commodity i imported from r into s. Provided

region s is small, relative to supplier markets, it will have little impact on import prices (pcifirs ≅ 0).

However, even a small country can have a substantial impact on its own export prices in this

differentiated product framework, so pfobisr ≠0. The size of the export price changes will be

determined by the export demand elasticity, which approaches -σi for a country that is small in its

export markets (Θisr ≅ 0) (recall equations 9 and 10).




                                                     10
This decomposition makes clear why, in our econometric exercise, we focus so intently on σi , the

elasticity of substitution among imports. The welfare consequences of a single, small economy’s FTA

measures will depend first and foremost on the value of σi , . Large values of σi will cause the elements

of the first term in (11) to become larger in absolute value, as the shift in import sourcing becomes

more pronounced. On the other hand, large values for σi serve to increase the export demand elasticity

facing region s, thereby dampening the change in export price.4

         It is the first term in equation (11) which determines whether or not trade diversion or trade

creation takes place in this FTA. If, for example, σi= 0 , then the pattern of import sourcing will

remain unchanged and the sole effect of lower tariffs will be to lower the cost of composite imports

(equation (10)), thereby leading to an increased demand for imports (qmsirs = qmis > 0) , by equation

                                                       N       R

                                                                     Mirs   PCIFirs QMSirs ) . This is the case of


pure trade creation.

         In practice, we expect the value of σi to be quite large—a point confirmed by the econometric

work reported below. This means that the second part of equation (9) will be dominant in the

determination of qms irs . In this situation, the key issue is how the changes in bilateral imports,

qmsirs , correlate with bilateral tariff revenues. Clearly, if the preferential FTA eliminates tariffs on

flows that are already lightly taxed (lower average tariff revenue), then there will be potential for trade

diversion, as the bilateral import changes will be negatively correlated with tariff revenue (i.e.,

qmsirs > when TRirs ≅ 0 and qmsirs < 0 for TRirs >> 0 ). In the ensuing empirical analysis of the

FTAA, we will examine this trade creation/diversion effect in all participating countries. We will also

explore its sensitivity to the econometrically estimated uncertainty in σi, a topic to which we now turn.

4
  Since in the FTAA one country’s exports represent another country’s imports, and the terms of trade for any
specific country will be determined by the complex interaction between the specific pattern of bilateral tariff cuts
and the existing pattern of bilateral trade flaws.

3. Econometric Specification and Estimation of Trade Elasticities

          Our econometric estimation focuses on the second level of the two-level, Armington structure,

since we will be examining the impact of a proposed preferential FTA, and the key parameter is σi, the

elasticity of substitution among imports from different sources for a given commodity.5 We begin by

introducing the power of the trade cost for an imported commodity, Tirs, which equals one plus the ad

valorem rates for freight, insurance and tariff, which are all commodity- and route-specific:

Tirs = (1 + τ Firs + τ Mirs ) = 1 + freightirs + tariffirs , so the domestic cost of imports is given by

PMS irs = Tirs PFOBirs . Because it is difficult to observe the quantity of demand, we multiply both

sides of (5) by end-user prices TirsPFOBir to get the amount of bilateral trade in value terms, Virs:
                                                          1− σ
                         PFOB                  T irs 
                                                                 i
            σ
V irs = b irs I irs

                                                                                                      (12)
                           PM               is       

which by taking natural logarithm results in an easily estimated equation (13).

ln V irs = ln I irs + (1 − σ i ) ln PFOB ir − (1 − σ i ) ln PM is + (1 − σ ) i ln Tirs + σ i ln birs   (13)

          It is commonly observed that countries with similar languages and cultures trade more with

one another than would be predicted solely on the basis of trade costs. The preference parameters birs

are intended to capture these effects. To reduce the number of unobserved variables in the estimating

equation, we model these preference biases explicitly, treating them as a function of physical distance:

Dist, similarity of language: Lang, and adjacency of the trading countries: Adj. The specific functional

relationship is as follows:

                    β   β 2 ,s Lang ri + β 3 ,s Adjri
birs = Distrs1,s e                                                                   (14)


5
  It is also the case that the data set that we have available only covers imports, and therefore does not lend itself
to estimation of the upper level nest.

                                                                     12
Substituting (14) into (13), we obtain the following:

ln V irs = ln I irs + (1 − σ i ) ln PFOB ir − (1 − σ i ) ln PM is
                                                                                                             (15)
+ (1 − σ i ) ln(1 + freight   irs   + tariff irs ) + β 1,i ln Dist ri + β 2 ,i Lang   rs   + β 3 ,i Adj rs


           Data on prices, the price index, output, and expenditure shares are difficult to obtain, and in

any case, endogenous. All of these variables are therefore omitted in the model and replaced with

importer and exporter of commodity i intercepts a: air = 1 if country r is an exporter of commodity i,

otherwise it is 0; ais = 1 if country s is an importer of commodity i, otherwise it is 0. The final

estimating equation is (16):


      lnVirs = a0 + ais + air + βi ln(1 + freightsri + tariffsri ) + β1,i ln Distrs + β2,i Langrs + β3,i Adjrs + ε irs

(16)

where     βi = 1 − σ i .



4. Data and Elasticity Estimates

           The data used in estimation are taken from Hummels (1999). Given the emphasis in this study

on the FTAA, it is appropriate that these data are a compilation of detailed customs information on

imports into six FTAA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, USA, and Uruguay) and one

non-FTAA economy (New Zealand). In order to estimate equation (16) we also require data on

physical distance among the countries as well as comprehensive tariff data6. The final dataset contains

187,000 observations with the following variables: 5-digit SITC code of the commodity traded, fob

and cif values for each trade flow, applied tariff rates, trade distance and two dummy variables to

indicate common language or countries’ adjacency. In addition, we dropped extreme observations

where trade costs were either non-positive or greater than 4 times the fob value of the product traded.

    For more information see the appendix in Hummels (1999).
                                                                13
        At this point we face an interesting choice. We could aggregate the 5-digit, SITC trade flows

and trade costs according to the 42 GTAP merchandise commodity groups used in our CGE model

(Table 1). The advantage of this aggregation approach is that it exactly matches the data variation

contained in the CGE exercise (i.e. a single value of trade for each bilateral pair in each of the 42

commodity groups). An alternative approach retains the variation across bilateral pairs and 5-digit

level commodities within each of the 42 GTAP categories, constraining the elasticity of substitution to

be equal within each broad sector. The main advantage of the pooling approach is that it provides

greater within-sector variation in tariffs and transport costs which is critical for identifying the relevant
                                                                                                            7
substitution elasticities. We employ the pooling technique in order to yield more precise estimates.

        The results of Ordinary Least Squares estimation of equation (14) are presented in Table 1.

Note that all of these estimates are positive and are significantly different from zero. Based on a

simple t-test, each of the 40 estimated elasticities of substitution allow us to reject the hypothesis that

the estimated elasticity is zero at the 95% confidence level.

        Table 1 also contrasts these estimates with the original elasticities of substitution among

imports from the GTAP database.8 (Note that estimates are not available for two GTAP products

which are non-traded: raw sugar and raw milk. We assign these GTAP commodities the estimated

elasticity of substitution associated with trade in processed sugar and milk, respectively.) As noted

previously, the GTAP parameters are widely used in the analysis of FTAs.9 If we compute the simple

average of the 40 estimates it is 7.0, which is somewhat larger than the average for the 42 GTAP

parameters (5.3). Although these two averages are fairly similar, there is much greater sectoral

variation in the econometrically estimated elasticities. In fact, the most striking thing about the GTAP

parameters is that they show no variability within broad sectors such as food and agriculture, and

  In the results section, we also discuss the results obtained from using the aggregation approach.

  The GTAP parameter file was taken from the SALTER project (Jomini et al., 1994). These trade elasticities are

metal products. This is because the source studies were not conducted at a sufficiently disaggregate

level.10

5. Application to the FTAA

           Background: The recent growth of free trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere began in

the 1980s as Latin American countries initiated significant trade and economic policy reforms. It was

accelerated in the 1990’s with the advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Over the past two decades, more than forty regional or bilateral trade agreements have been

implemented within the hemisphere. In fact, every country except Cuba has been party to at least one

such agreement. With the rapid growth of free trade agreements among countries, the idea for the

FTAA arose as a logical next step in the economic integration of the hemisphere. A more

encompassing agreement also provides a way of simplifying the complex network of existing FTA and

bilateral agreements in place (Diao and Somwaru, 2001). Two of these, the NAFTA and the Common

Market of the South (MERCOSUR) are among the largest FTAs in the world.

           The FTAA effort was initiated in December of 1994 as leaders of the thirty-four democracies

in the Western Hemisphere met in Miami for the “Summit of the Americas”. After a four year

preparatory process, negotiations were launched in April 1998 in Santiago Chile, with the goal of

achieving substantial progress by 2000 and completing the negotiations by 2005. The most recent

ministerial meeting of the FTAA was held in Miami in November 2003, and the deadline of

September 30, 2004 was established for conclusion of the negotiations over market access. This

resulted in ministerial declarations that largely reaffirmed the FTAA and its commitment to be

implemented on time and in a consistent manner with WTO rules (FTAA Tri-Partite Commission

2002; 2003).



10
  It is also striking to observe that the largest elasticity of substitution is for natural gas (34.4) and the lowest is
for other mineral products (1.8), yet for the GTAP model, both of these products are assigned the value of 5.6,
corresponding to the generic estimate for natural resource products.
                                                           15
        Given the focus on merchandise trade in the Americas, and in light of the large dimensions of

the GTAP data base, which we use as the empirical basis for our simulations, we begin by aggregating

the sixty-six regions of the version 5.0 GTAP database to seventeen regions. (See Appendix Table

A.1). Full GTAP country detail is preserved in the Western Hemisphere, while composite regions are

formed for the rest of the world, including: Asia-Oceania (ASOC), the fifteen-member European

Union (EU15), rest of Europe (OEUR), and Middle East and Africa (MEAF). In order to further

reduce the dimensions of this model, services activities are also aggregated into four broad categories.

A fair assessment of the changes that occur due to liberalization under the FTAA requires updating the

GTAP 5.0 database benchmark data to account for the pre-existing applied tariff structure in the

liberalizing regions – in particular taking account of preferential trade agreements in the Western

Hemisphere (see Appendix Table A2).

        Simulation and SSA: The simulation experiment undertaken here is a stylized representation

of an FTAA scenario. It involves reducing all tariffs on intra-regional trade for the forty-two

merchandise trade commodities to zero. While this is not likely to be a politically feasible scenario,

this serves as a useful benchmark that represents an upper bound on the potential gains from

liberalization (Young and Huff, 1998).

        As noted in the introduction, the centerpiece of this study involves the systematic sensitivity

analysis of the results with respect to the estimated trade elasticities. This is most commonly done via

Monte Carlo analysis, where, the model is solved many times using a random sample of substitution

elasticities, drawn from the empirical distribution of estimated trade elasticities. In many cases Monte

Carlo is impractical for a large CGE model owing to the large dimension of a multiregional model and

the large number of solutions required to approximate the distribution of the uncertain parameters

(Arndt, 1996). The recently developed Gaussian Quadrature approach of DeVuyst and Preckel (1997)

provides an attractive alternative. These authors show that an approximate distribution can be obtained

based on known lower order moments of the parameters of a model, and that selectively solving the
                                              16
model based on the moments of this approximate distribution generates sensitivity results consistent

with those of the Monte Carlo approach, with much more efficient use of computing time. The

Gaussian Quadrature technique is employed here for generating sensitivity results to the trade

elasticities.

         We must now invoke some assumptions about the underlying parameter distributions. First,

we assume that they are independently and normally distributed. Secondly, the elasticity of

substitution in the domestic-import substitution nest (recall ϕi in equation 1) is assumed to be tied to

σi via the “rule of two” so that these elasticities vary together and by the same proportion in repeated

solutions of the model.11



6. Results

         The results of our simulation may be reported in a number of ways. First of all, since we use

distributions, rather than point estimates for the trade elasticities, our results also come in the form of

distributions. Therefore, the most natural thing to look at is the mean value for each variable of

interest, along with the associated standard deviation, or the coefficient of variation (standard

deviation/mean). This information, accompanied with an assumption regarding the shape of the

underlying distribution of endogenous variables (we assume normality as with the parameters) allows

formation of confidence intervals for welfare changes as well as other model results, and thus the

ability to address the question at the focus of this paper: How confident can we be in the CGE-based

analyses of Free Trade Agreements?

         Our approach to analyzing the results in this paper will be to investigate the elements of

equation (7) individually, thereafter examining their combined impact on welfare. We begin with the

11
  The “rule of two” links ϕs with the estimated value for σi as follows: σi = 2ϕi. This rule was first proposed by
Jomini et al. (1994) and was retained in the GTAP parameter file. Recently this rule was tested by Liu, Arndt and
Hertel (2002) in a back-casting exercise with a simplified version of the GTAP model. While those authors reject
the validity of the GTAP trade elasticities, they fail to reject the rule of two, thereby lending additional support to
this approach.

tariff-related efficiency effect. Since this is driven by changes in import volume, let us first consider

what happens to imports. Table 2 reports the mean percentage change in regional import volume as a

result of the FTAA experiment. Aggregate import volume increases in all FTAA regions, while falling

in the non-FTAA regions. Furthermore, 95% confidence intervals, constructed based on the

assumption of normality, show that we can be confident in all of these increases. The largest increases

are for Colombia and the Other Central America. Our 95% confidence intervals for these two

countries do not overlap with that of Peru, which shows the third largest increase in total imports.

These large increases in imports may be directly attributed to the relatively larger tariff rates for these

countries. Most of the aggregate import volume changes are between +4% and +9%, with some

exceptions. The US and Canada, which already enjoy free trade with one another, show a smaller

increase in imports. Also, there is a very low import volume increase for Uruguay. This can be

attributed to the relative loss of preferential access that occurs under FTAA when partners in

MERCOSUR liberalize with other regions in the Americas.

        One interesting question that arises in the context of our SSA is whether there is greater

certainty about more aggregate variables than about disaggregate variables produced by this model.

The last two columns in Table 2 address this issue in the case of import volumes. First we report the

coefficient of variation (the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the mean) for the change in

national imports (this is the change reported in column 4 of Table 2). When this ratio is small, we can

infer a relatively higher level of confidence in the result. Note that it is quite small for Chile, whereas

it reaches its maximum value in the case of the rest of the Andean Pact (XAP). The final column in

Table 2 reports the average coefficient of variation for the percentage change in national imports, at

the sector level. This gives an indication of the average degree of precision for the more disaggregate

results. As can be seen by comparing these two entries for each country, the more disaggregate results

are less precise. This is intuitive in that we often expect a certain degree of offset at the aggregate level

(when one sector’s imports are low, another’s may be high).
                                                 18
         Next, turn to the allocative efficiency effects associated with the import volume changes.

These are reported in the first column of Table 3, which gives both the mean and the coefficient of

variation (CV) associated with the tariff-related allocative efficiency component of equation (3).

Recall that this is the (welfare-scaled) summation of the tariff revenue-weighted import quantity

changes. From the mean values of this variable, we see that there is net “trade creation” for 10 of the

13 FTAA partners. In the cases of Venezuela, Chile and the Other South America, this import

efficiency term is negative, despite the fact that aggregate import volume rises (recall Table 2). This is

due to the fact that the welfare contribution of the trade volume change depends on the interaction

between tariff rates and trade flows. As tariffs are eliminated on intra-FTAA flows, the associated

welfare weight is eliminated. If the remaining tariffs on extra-FTAA imports are large, and if the

associated FTAA-driven decline in the trade volume is also large, these negative numbers can

dominate the overall welfare effect, leading to trade diversion.

         Table 4 explores this trade diversion phenomenon in detail for the case of machinery and

equipment imports into Chile. Chile is notable for is its uniform tariff structure (8% across all

sources/products in 2001). This is efficient in that it promotes the sourcing of imports from the least

cost supplies of any given product, as well as discouraging substitution across import categories in

response to differential tariffs by product. Of course, there remains the distortion of import/domestic

choices, as with any tariff regime. We focus the discussion here on other machinery and equipment

imports because this contributes the largest share of the aggregate efficiency loss in column one of

Table 3 (one-third of the total).

         The individual columns in Table 4 correspond to different parts of equation (4). The first

entry reports the non-linear solution value for EVs ( τ Mirs ) for i = ome , s = Chile and r = all regions.12


12
  Note that the non-linear solution to equation (9) requires that we incorporate it individually into the model’s
solution (as apposed to it being a part of equation (3)). This permits us to capture the interaction between
changes in the levels of τM irs and PCIFirs on the one hand, and the volume changes, dQMS irs , on the other.
                                                        19
The driving force behind each of these entries is the underlying change in bilateral import

volume, dQMS irs reported in column two of the table. This is measured in $US 1997, where one unit

of the good is the amount that could be purchased in the source country for $1.00 in the initial (i.e.,

pre-FTAA) equilibrium. Since these goods are differentiated products, the sum of these trade volumes

is not particularly meaningful. But if we did perform this summation, we would find that this crude

estimate of import volume showed an increase of $214 million, with the rises in intra-FTAA imports

of machinery and equipment into Chile more than offsetting the declines in extra-FTAA imports. This

naïve estimate of increased import volume stands in sharp contrast to the negative welfare outcome

share in the first column total.

        The difference between the simple volume summation and the welfare change derives from

the bilateral weights applied to these volume changes: τ Mirs PCIFirs. In this regard, it is instructive to

consider both the initial (0) and ending (1) values for the tariff rate and import price. These are also

reported in Table 4. Note that the proportional PCIFirs changes (typically less than 10%) are an order

of magnitude smaller than the changes in intra-regional tariffs (-100%), so we focus our attention on

the latter. While the initial reductions in the tariff on intra-FTAA imports bring fairly large welfare

gains, (recall Figure 1), the final reductions bring almost nothing. Yet, the final reduction in τ Mirs

continues to lead to substantial displacement of extra-FTAA imports (recall equation (5)). Given the

absence of reductions on the extra-FTAA tariffs, these volume reductions come to dominate the

welfare story. This is why the welfare loss due to reduced imports of machinery and equipment from

the EU is nearly twice as large as the gain due to increased imports from USA, even though the

absolute value of the trade volume change with respect to USA is nearly twice that of the EU.

        Recall from our earlier analysis (e.g., equation 11) that the elasticity of substitution among

imports, by source, is a critical determinant of the allocative efficiency effect associated with tariff

changes. Yet these elasticities are uncertain, and we have characterized this uncertainty in our
                                                     20
systematic sensitivity analysis. So it is of some interest to explore the relationship between uncertainty

in the trade elasticities and uncertainty in these welfare contribution terms themselves. We examine

this issue statistically for the welfare changes associated with FTAA flows in the model. Consider the

welfare term in equation (8), WQMSirs . In a typical CGE analysis, there is but one value of this term

for each commodity i, exporter r, and importer s. However, in our approach, we have a value for this

term for each solution of the model, every time with a different set of trade elasticities. To better

understand the standard error in WQMSirs across model solutions, we regress the standard error in this

variable on the depth of the associated bilateral tariff cut, τ irs , which is the same across model

solutions), and an interaction between the depth of the tariff cut and SEσi , the standard error of the

substitution elasticity among imports by source, for commodity i. We include the depth of the tariff cut

as an explanatory variable to control for differences in relative dispersion in the welfare contribution

variable, because larger tariff cuts will increase variability of the welfare variable for a constant

standard error for the elasticity. Estimates are reported in equation (17)13, along with the associated T-

statistics (in parentheses):

SEWQIMirs = 0.020 τ irs + 0.023 τ irs SEσi                                                         (17)
              ( 6.464 )     ( 6.936 )


         The OLS coefficients in (17) are significant and positive indicating that both the depth of the

tariff reduction and the interaction of the tariff with the variability of the elasticity are important in

explaining variability in the allocative welfare effects. The positive relationship is as we would expect,

since we hypothesize that uncertainty in the model parameter should be carried over to the allocative

welfare component as demonstrated in section 2.

13
   The regression is based on 5,337 non-zero bilateral trade flows in the FTAA region. The R2 for the regression
is 0.040, indicating fairly low explanatory power as we would expect given the large number of omitted
variables (in the regression model) that affect the welfare term in the GE model. Since our primary concern is to
characterize the relationship between uncertainty in the welfare term and the trade elasticity we feel the
regression model is serviceable as it controls for the dominant effect of size of the tariff cut, and shows the
significant positive relationship between the two measures of uncertainty.
                                                       21
        The coefficient levels indicate that we predict a change of 0.043 in the standard error of the

welfare variable when the tariff cut is increased by one percent and the standard error of the

substitution elasticity is increased by one. The mean standard error for the allocative welfare effect is

0.163, so this predicted change represents about twenty-five percent of the mean for the dependent

variable.

        We now return to Table 3 to discuss the remaining elements of the efficiency story. For Chile,

the next most important efficiency change relates to the consumption taxes,14 which apply equally to

consumption of imports and domestic goods. Thus, the increased consumption of imported goods

boosts overall consumption and results in positive contributions to aggregate welfare in all of the

FTAA regions where good consumption taxation data are available.15 Production taxes (subsidies)

also play a big role in the welfare decomposition in some regions. In USA, the strong expansion of

subsidized grains output leads to a negative welfare contribution, whereas in Mexico, the expansion of

taxed manufacturing activity at the expense of untaxed fuel and agriculture improves efficiency in that

country.

        The final column in Table 4 reports the combined efficiency impacts of intermediate import

taxes, primary factor taxes (subsidies), and export taxes (subsidies). (These were suppressed in

equation (7) for the sake of brevity.) The negative efficiency contribution in the US derives from land

and capital subsidies for program crops and dairy export subsidies, whereas agricultural export taxes

in Brazil play a key role in the positive welfare contribution in that country.

        Next, turn to Table 5, which reports the aggregate welfare effects, by country, decomposed

into their efficiency and terms of trade components. The aggregate efficiency effect is simply the

summation of the results reported in Table 3. This permits us to explain the efficiency loss in the USA



14
  This includes the Chilean value-added taxes which are most naturally modeled as a consumption tax.
15
  The negative number for Argentina results from the apparent exemption of imported oil products from
consumption taxation. This appears to be an error in the original data base for that country.
                                                     22
and Venezuela. In Venezuela, this is caused by net trade diversion, whereas in the USA it is due to

expansion of the subsidized agriculture sector.

         We turn next to the terms of trade effects (the second pair of columns in Table 5).16 Ceteris

paribus, expect these effects to be largest (relative to export volume) in those countries where exports

surge the most. Thus it is no surprise that the terms of trade deteriorate for Colombia and Peru, as

these are countries with very high average tariffs that must export more to affect the large increase in

import volume. The terms of trade also deteriorate for Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Other South

America. The TOT deterioration for Mexico and Canada may be understood by the fact that these

countries currently enjoy tariff free access to the largest market in the region for many of their

products. When the FTAA is introduced, other countries obtain the same benefit and they displace

Mexican and Canadian imports. The same general phenomenon explains why Argentina’s terms of

trade decline. Of course, one region’s TOT loss is another’s gain, and Other Central America is one of

the regions showing a strong TOT gain. In this case, it is the strong increase in exports that is driving

the import growth reported in Table 2.

         Another dimension of this analysis of uncertainty in the terms of trade effect can be observed

in Figure 2. In this figure, we show how uncertainty in each FTAA region’s average export demand

elasticity translates into uncertainty in the export price component of their terms of trade (see

McDougall, 1992 for details on the terms of trade decomposition). Countries that rely heavily on

exports of commodities whose substitution elasticities of trade are highly uncertain (e.g., Colombia)

are exposed to a great deal of uncertainty in the size of their average export demand elasticity

(horizontal axis of Figure 2) and tend to experience more uncertainty in the export price component of

their terms of trade (vertical axis). Venezuela is an exception to this rule. It exhibits a high degree of

uncertainty in export demand elasticities due to a heavy reliance on oil and gas exports, which are

16
  For purposes of this table, we have expanded the terms of trade effect to include the effect of changes in the
prices of the savings and investment goods in addition to the traditional changes in the prices of merchandise and
services.
                                                       23
large and rather uncertain (recall Table 1). On the other hand, the variation in the export price

component of its terms of trade is relatively small, due perhaps to the relative homogeneity of this

product and the generally low tariffs on oil.

        We are now in a position to answer the question: Which countries gain from the FTAA? We

see from the final two pairs of columns in Table 5 that ten of the thirteen FTAA countries gain from

this free trade agreement based on the 95% confidence interval. On the other hand, Argentina and

Other South America are shown to lose from the FTAA. In the case of Argentina, this is driven by a

dominant, adverse terms of trade effect. For Other South America, both the terms of trade and

allocative effects are negative.

        The welfare impact of the FTAA on the final country: Colombia is uncertain. This is an

interesting case, since the component parts of their aggregate welfare impacts are “certain” in the

sense that the 95% confidence intervals do not include zero. However, the positive allocative

efficiency component is offset by an equally large negative terms of trade effect. So while the

components of the welfare change are certain, the sign of their summation – the aggregate welfare gain

– is uncertain. This type of uncertainty is not inherited from uncertainty about the model parameters

governing substitution in trade. Rather, it relates to the presence of competing economic forces at

work in the determination of the change in national welfare.

        There are many other variables in addition to the change in aggregate welfare that we could

examine, particularly at the sector level. Here we focus our attention on employment, since the

displacement of unskilled workers is often one of the most sensitive topics surrounding any free trade

agreement. Table 6 summarizes the directional changes in unskilled employment, by sector, for each

region. The first column reports the total number of sectors in which employment of unskilled labor

rises and the second column reports the number in which employment falls. Since total employment

remains unchanged, by assumption, the relative size of these two numbers is not very meaningful.

However, it is interesting to ask how many of these changes are significantly different from zero at the
                                                  24
95% level. This is reported in the next column of Table 5. Here we see that the changes in

employment are generally robust to the estimated variation in trade elasticities. We able to sign the

change in sectoral employment at the 95% confidence level for every region in over 75% of the

sectors.

           Table 7 reports the same employment results as Table 6, with the focus shifted to employment

by sectors across all of the model regions. This allows us to evaluate how the uncertainty in sectoral

trade elasticities translates into uncertainty about the employment effects for a given sector. Here we

see that for all but five of the forty-two sectors, we are confident in the direction of change in

employment for a given sector in seventy percent or more of the regions. The exceptions here are four

primary commodities: paddy rice, wheat, other grains, and coal, as well as for processed rice. Not

surprisingly, these sectors have some of the largest standard deviations relative to the size of the

estimated elasticity (recall Table 1).




                                                    25
7. Summary and Conclusions

        Computable General Equilibrium analysis is often criticized for its lack of econometric

foundations (McKitrick, 1998). The goal of this paper is to show that it is indeed possible to provide

substantial statistical underpinning to policy analyses conducted using the CGE framework. We focus

our attention on analysis of Free Trade Agreements – specifically, the Free Trade Agreement of the

Americas – for which the key behavioral parameter is the elasticity of substitution among imports

from different countries. This governs the extent to which non-FTAA regions will be displaced by the

preferential reduction in tariffs on imports from FTAA countries.

        Historically, estimation of the import substitution elasticity has been difficult, due to

insufficient observed variation in relative prices. In this paper, we capitalize on a unique data set and

approach developed by Hummels (1999), in which variation in bilateral transport costs is combined

with bilateral tariff variation in order to enhance the observed variability of relative prices for imports

from different sources in six FTAA countries and one non-FTAA country. Elasticities are estimated at

the GTAP commodity level to facilitate subsequent incorporation into our CGE model. The resulting

estimates of the elasticity of substitution among imports are all significant at the 95% level. These

estimates, together with their standard errors, are used in the subsequent policy simulations.

        The FTAA analysis takes explicit account of the fact that we do not know the true trade

elasticities with certainty. Rather, we sample from a distribution of parameter values, constructed

based on our econometric results. The outcome of this systematic sensitivity analysis is a distribution

of model results, from which we can construct confidence intervals with which to answer the basic

question posed in the title of this paper. We find that imports increase in all regions of the world as a

result of the FTAA, and this outcome is robust to variation in the trade elasticities. Ten of the thirteen

FTAA regions experience a welfare gain in which we are more than 95% confident. Two regions,

Argentina and rest of South America experience welfare losses as they are displaced from existing

markets in which they currently enjoy preferential access. Finally, the welfare impact of the FTAA on
                                                  26
Colombia is uncertain due to offsetting efficiency and terms of trade effects. We also examine the

robustness of our employment effects. With the exception of several primary products, where the trade

elasticity is relatively uncertain, we can be confident in the sign of the sectoral employment effects in

the majority of regions.

        Of course all of these findings are conditional on the underlying model structure, as well as the

other parameters employed in the CGE analysis. Variations in that structure will change both the

econometric procedures as well as the CGE model itself. Given the uncertainty surrounding the

appropriate structure for international trade modeling, and the diversity of outcomes that such changes

in structure can engender, we must view the confidence intervals in this paper as being on the

conservative side. Future work should focus on discriminating among these alternative model

structures for purposes of establishing a firmer foundation for CGE analysis of trade policies (e.g.,

Hummels and Klenow, 2002).

        In summary, we conclude that there is great potential for combining econometric work with

CGE-based policy analysis in order to produce a richer set of results that are likely to prove more

satisfying to the sophisticated policy maker. In the end, decision makers and their advisors

increasingly ask: How robust are the policy findings? In this paper we have found that some of the

FTAA conclusions are robust, while others are not. This is important information for those seeking to

make key political decisions based in part on results from quantitative economic models.
