The Long-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Unemployment Shock on Life Expectancy and
Mortality Rates

                                          ABSTRACT

We adopt a time series approach to investigate the historical relation between unemployment, life
expectancy, and mortality rates. We fit a Vector-autoregression (VAR) for the overall US
population and for groups identified based on gender and race. We find that shocks to
unemployment are followed by statistically significant increases in mortality rates and declines in
life expectancy. We use our results to assess the long-run effects of the COVID-19 economic
recession on mortality and life expectancy. We estimate the size of the COVID-19-related
unemployment to be between 2 and 5 times larger than the typical unemployment shock,
depending on race/gender, resulting in a 3.0% increase in mortality rate and a 0.5% drop in life
expectancy over the next 15 years for the overall American population. We also predict that the
shock will disproportionately affect African-Americans and women, over a short horizon, while
white men might suffer large consequences over longer horizons. These figures translate in a
staggering 0.89 million additional deaths over the next 15 years.

1     Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogenic agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), see Gorbalenya et al. (2020). Initially reported as an
outbreak in the province of Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, COVID-19 was recognized as
a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, e.g., Guan et al.
(2020). Approximately 74 million cases and 1.6 million deaths have been reported worldwide,
with over 17 million people infected and approximately 0.3 million deceased in the USA alone
(updated December 16, 2020; see WHO (2020) and CDC (2020)).
   SARS-CoV-2 is shed by asymptomatic individuals and persists in the environment for days,
implying that public health measures to halt virus spreading could be effective at reducing
transmission and mortality, see Li et al. (2020) and Pan et al. (2020). Universal masking, social
distancing, contact tracing, and quarantine were later identified as effective tools to contain
SARS-CoV-2 spreading, see Leung et al. (2020) and Moghadas et al. (2020). Mathematical
modeling predicted a catastrophic exhaustion of health care personnel and resources, partic-
ularly ventilators, unless strict containment measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 spreading were
established, see Anderson et al. (2020) and Davies et al. (2020). Between late March-early
April, most U.S. states imposed stay-at-home orders and lockdowns, resulting in widespread
shut down of business. Unemployment rate rose from 3.8% in February 2020 to 14.7% in April
2020 with 23.1 million unemployed Americans. Despite a decline to 6.7% in November 2020,
the average unemployment rate over the year is comparable with the 10% unemployment rate
at the peak of the 2007-2009 Great Recession and it is near the post-World War II histori-
cal maximum reached in the early 1980s (10.8%). Importantly, COVID-19 related job losses
disproportionately affect women, particularly of Hispanic heritage; African Americans; foreign
born individuals; less educated adults and individuals age 16-24. In fact, the unemployment
rate underestimates the extent of the economic contraction as many potential workers have
abandoned the workforce (especially women).
    The impact of the loss of income on psychological and physical health has been well docu-
mented in white males, see McKee-Ryan et al. (2005), Brenner (2005), and Wilson and Walker
(1993). In epidemiological studies, unemployment at the individual level associates with de-
creased health and higher mortality, regardless of aggregate unemployment rate, see Roelfs et
al. (2015). A surge in suicide rates has been clearly observed in unemployed individuals, partic-
ularly men. Cardiovascular diseases peak in face of financial stress and preventive ontological
care declines, thus contributing to excess mortality.
   While the trade-off between containing the COVID-19 pandemic and economic activity
has been analyzed in the short-term, there is currently no analysis regarding the long-term
impact of the COVID-19-related economic recession on public health. What is more, most of


                                               1
the papers interested in the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and economic activity
argue, correctly, that lockdowns can save lives at the cost of reducing economic activity,1 but
they do not consider the possibility that severe economic distress might also have important
consequences on human well-being (Gordon and Sommers (2016) and Ruhm (2015)). This
shortcoming is arguably explained by the fact that current macroeconomic models do not allow
for the possibility that economic activity might affect mortality rates of the agents in the
economy.
    In this paper, we aim at making progress on this gap in the literature by taking a time-
series approach. We use annual data on average life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality
rates collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, which are
paired with the unemployment rates from the St. Louis Fred website. We construct the data set
not just for the overall US population, but also for subgroups of the population categorized by
race (African-American or White) and gender (women or men). We use a vector autoregression
(VAR, Sims (1980)) to model the joint dynamics of the growth rates of life expectancy and
mortality rates together with the unemployment rates. We acknowledge that life expectancy and
mortality rates are likely to present observation errors as the US population is not continuously
and perfectly observed. To address this issue, we allow for observation errors that essentially
wash out the non-persistent idiosyncratic components in life expectancy and mortality rates.
    We rely on a Bayesian method to construct posterior estimates of model unknowns includ-
ing the VAR coefficients and the smoothed growth rates of the life expectancy and mortality
rates. Equipped with posterior estimates for the VAR parameters, we use an impulse response
analysis based on a Cholesky decomposition method to assess the effects of an increase in un-
employment on the life expectancy and mortality rates. The main message arising from our
exercise is that the typical unemployment shock results in a statistically significant decline in
life expectancy and increase in mortality rates for the overall population. In normal times, the
unemployment shock is around 0.84% on an annual basis and it is quite persistent. The effect
of the unemployment shock on the growth rate of life expectancy and the death rate reaches
its peak in the third year and remains elevated for a long time.
   We repeat the exercise with data for different population groups identified based on race and
gender to highlight substantial heterogeneity. We find that the size of the typical unemployment
shock is much larger for African-Americans, with a standard deviation of around 1.31%, than
for the White population (standard deviation around 0.76%). Specifically, African-American
men typically experience the largest unemployment shocks, with a standard deviation of around
1.70%, approximately twice as large as the typical shock experienced by White men. We find
that the typical unemployment shock for White women is the smallest, around 0.58%, which
    1
      This literature is constantly growing. A non-exhaustive list includes Eichenbaum et al. (2020a), Coibion et
al. (2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2020b), Jones et al. (2020), Hall et al. (2020), among others.


                                                       2
is about 65% of the unemployment shock experienced by White men. Similarly, the size of
a one-standard deviation unemployment shock for African-American women (1.00%) is about
59% of the typical shock experienced by African-American men, but its absolute magnitude
is larger than that experienced by White men. In light of this evidence, it is perhaps not
surprising that the effects of the typical unemployment shock on life expectancy and the death
rate are more severe for the African-American population. However, we emphasize that this
is not entirely the consequence of larger shocks, as the pattern largely persists for the case of
life expectancy when controlling for the size of the shock. When controlling for the size of the
shock, we find that women present a relatively larger increase in death rates. This pattern is
especially visible for White women, suggesting that even if they generally suffer smaller shocks,
they are disproportionately more affected by them.
   Based on these results, we examine the long-run effect of the COVID-19 unemployment
shock on life expectancy and the age adjusted death rates across difference races and gender.
Our data for life-expectancy and death rates stop in 2017. However, we have unemployment
data until October 2020. We thus use observations for the unemployment rate to construct
an estimate of the COVID-19 unemployment shock, while treating the corresponding ones
for the life expectancy and mortality rates as missing observations. As before, we adopt an
identification strategy based on a Cholesky decomposition. By comparing the magnitude of the
COVID-19 unemployment shock to those in the normal (non-critical) times, we can infer about
the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly.
    Based on our approach, the COVID-19 unemployment shock is about 3.17 standard devia-
tions larger than the typical shock to the unemployment rate for the overall population (about
2.68% in magnitude). We estimate that this unprecedented unemployment shock will result in
a 3.01% increase in mortality rates and a 0.50% drop in life expectancy over the next 15 years.
Compared to the typical unemployment shock, we find that women (both African-American
and White) are disproportionately affected relative to men. Particularly for White women,
the COVID-19 unemployment shock is about 4.72 standard deviation larger (about 2.74% in
magnitude) than their typical shock to the unemployment rate, by far the largest in relative
magnitude with respect to the typical shock. However, African-American men still suffer the
largest shock in absolute terms (3.65%, 2.13 standard deviations). As a result, the impact of
the COVID-19 unemployment shock on the death rate is large for all groups, but visibly larger
for African-Americans and White women. As explained above, this is in part the result of a
larger shock, but also of a larger response conditional on the size of the shock.
    The long-term effects of the COVID-19 related unemployment surge on the US mortality
rate have not been characterized in the literature. Thus, as a last step, we compute an estimate
of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock. This corresponds
to the difference between the number of deaths predicted by the model with and without the

                                               3
unemployment shock observed in 2020. For the overall population, the increase in the death
rate following the COVID-19 pandemic implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths
over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These numbers correspond to 0.24% and 0.37%
of the projected US population at the 15- and 20-year horizons, respectively. For African-
Americans, we estimate 180 thousand and 270 thousand excess deaths over the next 15 and 20
years, respectively. These numbers correspond to 0.34% and 0.49% of the projected African-
American population at the 15- and 20-year horizons, respectively. For Whites, we estimate
0.82 and 1.21 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These numbers
correspond to 0.30% and 0.44% of the projected White population at the 15- and 20-year
horizons, respectively. These numbers are roughly equally split between men and women.
   Overall, our results indicate that, based on the historical evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic
might have long-lasting consequences on human health through its impact on economic activity.
We interpret these results as a strong indication that policymakers should take into considera-
tion the severe, long-run implications of such a large economic recession on people’s lives when
deliberating on COVID-19 recovery and containment measures. Without any doubt, lockdowns
save lives, but they also contribute to the decline in real activity that can have severe conse-
quences on health. Policy-makers should therefore consider combining lockdowns with policy
interventions meant to reduce economic distress, guarantee access to health care, and facilitate
effective economic reopening under health care policies to limit SARS-CoV-19 spread.
   The idea that economic activity might affect human well-being has been studied before.
Contrary to what might be expected, there is no widespread agreement on the effect of eco-
nomic activity on mortality rates. Ruhm (2000, 2003, 2005, 2012) and Mulas-Granados (2005)
argue for a procyclical relation between macroeconomic activity and mortality, with death rates
increasing during periods of high employment. However, in a more recent contribution, Ruhm
(2015) finds that since 1990 the relationship has become weak or non-existent. This seems to
be due to a change in the composition of the causes of deaths. Specifically, fatalities due to
cardiovascular disease and, to a smaller degree, transport accidents are procyclical, whereas
cancer and some external sources of death (particularly accidental poisonings) have emerged
as strongly countercyclical. Gordon and Sommers (2016) use county-level data to study the
effects of unemployment, poverty rates, and median incomes on mortality rates over the period
1993-2012. They find that higher unemployment has modest negative impacts on mortality,
in contrast with previous studies and in line with our findings. Furthermore, they emphasize
that county-level poverty rates and lower median incomes are better predictors of mortality
rates. In our study, we use unemployment because it is available over a prolonged period of
time. With respect to these studies, our methodological approach is quite different, given that
we take a time series approach, as opposed to panel regressions. This allows for a dynamic
relation between the variables of interest and for a discussion of the effects of the national

                                               4
business cycle that in these studies is absorbed by the time fixed effect (see Ruhm (2015) for
an excellent discussion). We see these two approaches as complementary.
   Our benchmark results are based on an identifying assumption that relies on unemployment
not having any contemporaneous effect on mortality rates and life-expectancy. Our results on
the long-term effects of unemployment on mortality and life-expectancy are qualitatively un-
changed when using a different identification strategy in which shocks to unemployment are
allowed to have a contemporaneous effect on the other two variables. When using this alter-
native identification assumption, an interesting result emerges. An increase in unemployment
leads to a contemporaneous decline in mortality rates and to a contemporaneous increase in
life-expectancy. This effect eventually reverts in two-three years and in the long-run mortality
increases and life expectancy declines. The long-term effect dominates and our key results
on the long-term cumulative effects of unemployment remain unchanged. At the same time,
these results could help reconcile the mixed evidence in the existing literature discussed above.
On impact, unemployment can lead to a reduction in mortality as deaths due to work-related
causes or motor vehicle accidents declined, but over time economic distress takes a toll on
human well-being. We consider this an interesting direction for future research.
   Our results add to the body of literature that analyzes the macroeconomic consequences
of COVID-19. This literature is growing exponentially and we apologize to our colleagues for
being unable to cite all relevant contributions here. A few papers that rely on historical pan-
demic episodes to provide plausible estimates for outcomes due to COVID-19 include Barro et
al. (2020), Ludvigson et al. (2020), and Jorda et al. (2020). Other papers study the interac-
tion between economic decisions (e.g., optimal policy) and epidemics, e.g., Eichenbaum et al.
(2020a), Eichenbaum et al. (2020b), Acemoglu et al. (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), Jones et al.
(2020), Krueger et al. (2020), Glover et al. (2020), and Rampini (2020). Among the existing
papers, our work is more closely related to those that examine the medium- to long-term effects
of pandemics such as Jorda et al. (2020), who argue that significant macroeconomic after-effects
of pandemics can persist for a long time, and Kozlowski et al. (2020), who claim that a persis-
tent change in beliefs about the probability of an extreme, negative shock to the economy could
be an important long-term consequence of COVID-19. Overall, the economic literature has
extensively analyzed the short-run trade-off between economic activity and the containment of
the pandemic. We emphasize that an equally important long-run trade-off exists. It is worth
clarifying that with this claim, we do not want to suggest that policymakers should refrain from
ordering lockdowns, as necessary lifesaving measures, but rather that, if they decide to do so,
they should provide alongside enhanced health and economic support for the most vulnerable
portions of the population.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the method-
ological approach. Section 3 presents the historical relation between shocks to unemployment

                                               5
and life expectancy and mortality rates. Section 4 studies the implications of the historical
results for the COVID-19 unemployment shock. Section 5 concludes.


2     Empirical Approach
In this section, we first describe the data set used in our analysis and then introduce the
statistical model employed to study the dynamic relation between real activity, mortality rates,
and life expectancy. The statistical model is a VAR in which we allow for the possibility that
mortality rates and life expectancy are observed with an error.

2.1    Data
We collect data on average life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality rates from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. CDC data are available to the public
only until 2017. All data are available at annual frequency. The CDC website also provides
age-adjusted life expectancy and mortality rates based on gender and limited race breakdown
(African-American versus White). Race (African-American, White, Asian, etc) and Hispanic
origin (yes/no) are classified independently by the CDC. Thus, Hispanic can be of any race
and within each race group there can be descendants of Hispanic origin. No extended data
series are available for Hispanic/Latinos heritage, Asians, American Indian/Alaska Natives,
Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders or mixed races. CDC data for the African-American
population span a shorter period of time (1972-2017). The series for White population are also
shorter (1954-2017) than the series for the overall population (1950-2017). This is important
when comparing results across races and with respect to the overall population, because the
sample used for the estimation is not homogeneous.
   We obtain the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rates for the overall population
and for each race and gender groups from FRED, the website of the St. Louis Fed. We pair
the CDC series with the corresponding unemployment series to obtain seven groups: Overall
population, African-American population, African-American men, African-American women,
White population, White men, White women. Gordon and Sommers (2016), using county level
data and panel regressions, find that median income and poverty rates are better predictors of
mortality rates than unemployment rates. In our study, we use unemployment rates because
these series are available over a prolonged period of time. Furthermore, the panel regression
approach used in previous studies assumes that the effects of the national business cycle is
absorbed by the time fixed effect (Ruhm (2015)). Thus, our approach is inherently different
and complementary to the previous studies interested in the relation between real activity and
human health.

Notes: This figure presents the average life expectancy (first chart), the age-adjusted death rate (second chart),
and the unemployment rate (third chart) for the overall US population and for the US population classified
according to race and gender. The data span from 1950 to 2017 for the overall population; 1954 to 2017 for
White population; and 1972-2017 for African-American population.


    Figure 1 provides a first look at the raw data series for the overall population and for the six
groups identified based on race and gender. We highlight a series of features in the data that are
noteworthy. First, for all groups considered, the average life expectancy has been increasing over
time. Second, and consistently with the increase in life-expectancy, the age-adjusted death rates
have been falling over time. Third, the African-American population (both men and women)
has historically experienced shorter average life expectancy, higher age-adjusted death rates,
and higher unemployment rates relative to the White population. Fourth, men have shorter
life expectancy and higher death rates, regardless of rave. Finally, these differences have been
declining over time and the conditions for African-American men have improved the most as
they currently experience much longer life expectancy and lower (age adjusted) death rates
relative to the 1970s. However, the differences remain large and visible.
    To further elaborate on these points, we compute percentage changes of life expectancy and
death rates by taking their log differences and multiplying them by 100. Table 1 provides the
summary statistics (i.e., sample average, autocorrelation at first lag, and standard deviation)
of these two transformed variables and the unemployment rate. The summary statistics are
computed for the overall population and for the six groups identified based on race and gender.
In the left part of the table, we report the summary statistics for each group based on the
longest sample available for that group. In the right part of the table we report the same
statistics over the common subsample (1972-2017) for which we have data for all groups. This
approach facilitates the comparison across groups.
    In line with what we outlined above, all groups have experienced an improvement in life-
expectancy and a decline in death rates. However, the table reveals substantial heterogene-
ity across gender and race. Specifically, we find that proportionally the African-American

                                                          7
population has experienced a more significant improvement in these measures of human well-
being. Given that the White population was starting with lower mortality rates and higher
life-expectancy, this difference in growth rates translates into a gap that has been narrowing
over time. At the same time, the variables corresponding to the African-American population
are much more volatile than those of the White or overall populations. Furthermore, the un-
employment rates for the African-American population are also larger and more volatile when
compared to those of the White population. This feature of the data already suggests that
the impact of the business cycle on human well-being could be more relevant for the African-
American population.
  The data also reveal high frequency movements in the growth rates of life-expectancy and
mortality rates. These can be due to measurement error, as the US population is not con-
tinuously observable, or other factors unrelated to the business cycle. The negative sample
autocorrelation of the growth rates speaks to this evidence. Thus, in our empirical analysis
we allow for the possibility that life-expectancy and death-rates are measured with error. We
discuss the details in the next subsection.

2.2    A VAR with observation error
We specify a VAR to describe the joint dynamics of the growth rates of life expectancy, mortality
rates, and the level of unemployment rate for each group i that we are interested in (overall
population and the six groups organized based on race and gender):

                           xi,t = µi + Φi xi,t−1 + ηi,t ,        ηi,t ∼ N (0, Σi ).             (1)

where xi,t is a three-dimensional vector containing three series for group i: the growth rate of
life-expectancy, the growth rate of the age-adjusted death rate, and the unemployment rate; µi
is a vector of constants, the matrix Φi contains the autoregressive coefficients, l is the number
of lags, and ηi,t is a vector of Gaussian innovations. The VAR above is specified with one lag.
This is the number of lags that we use in our empirical analysis and it is chosen based on the
Akaike Information criterion. However, the methodology that we describe below easily allows
for more lags.
    In estimating (1), we want to allow for the possibility that life expectancy and death rates
are observed with an error or have high frequency swings around a central trend. Thus, we
cannot directly run the VAR. To tackle this issue, we specify a state-space model in which the
measurement equation allows for measurement errors in the levels of the observables:

                                 yi,t = zi,t + i,t ,       i,t ∼ N (0, Ωi ),                  (2)

where yi,t includes the log of life expectancy, the log of death rates, and the unemployment
rate for group i. Here, zi,t contains the true log-level series for life expectancy and age-adjusted

Notes: We provide the sample moments (mean, autocorrelation at first lag, and standard deviation) of the three
series used in the estimation: the growth rate of the average life expectancy (panel A), the growth rate of the
age-adjusted death rate (panel B), and the unemployment rate (panel C) for the overall US population and for
distinct groups identified based on race and gender. The available data span from 1950 to 2017 for the overall
population; from 1954 to 2017 for white workers; and from 1972 to 2017 for African-American workers. The
common sample is from 1972 to 2017.


death rates, free from measurement errors. We model the measurement errors as i.i.d. random
variables with a diagonal covariance matrix Ωi . We do not allow for measurement errors in the
unemployment rate, i,3,t = 0, as the measurement issue for the unemployment rate is much

less of a concern at annual frequency.
    As the measurement equation is expressed in log-levels, we express xi,t as linear transfor-
mation of the log-level series for consistency:
                                                                  

                           xi,t = zi,t − M zi,t−1 ,    M =  0 1 0 .                        (3)
                                                             0 0 0

Combining (1) with (3), the state transition equation (1) can be re-expressed in terms of the
true log-level series

                 zi,t = µi + (M + Φi )zi,t−1 − ΦM zi,t−2 + ηi,t ,   ηi,t ∼ N (0, Σi ).       (4)

In sum, the measurement equation (2) and the state transition equation (4) constitute our
state-space representation of the system. Thus, our state-space model enables the estimation
of the VAR parameters, Φi and Σi , which are crucial for the analysis presented below, while at
the same time allowing for measurement errors. The fact that observation errors apply to the
log-levels of the age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy as opposed to their growth rates
implies that the filtered series for life-expectancy and death rates cannot persistently deviate
from the observed ones.
Data exploration. We estimate a total of seven VARs: Overall population (our benchmark
case), African-American, African-American men, African-American women, White, White men,
and White women. All data are available at annual frequency.
Lag order selection. We set the lag order of the VAR in the state transition equation
to one. The choice of a one lag in (1) is guided by the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
when we directly estimate (1) with bandpass filtered series as a first test. Furthermore, it
seems appropriate given the small sample that we have available and the use of data at annual
frequency.
Cholesky decomposition. To quantify the effects of an increase in unemployment on life
expectancy and mortality rates, we need to isolate structural shocks to unemployment, i.e.,
shocks that are exogenous with respect to the mortality rate and life expectancy. To do this, we
orthogonalized the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals using a Cholesky decomposition with
unemployment placed last. This assumption implies that the unemployment shock can affect
the other two series only with a lag of one year. We believe this is a conservative assumption
as the role of unemployment rate shock is depressed in this ordering. For robustness, we also
consider a specification in which the ordering is reverted and unemployment is allowed to affect
the other two variables contemporaneously.

age-adjusted death rate (second chart), and the unemployment rate (third chart) for the overall US population.

3      Results
From the estimation of our state-space model, we obtain posterior estimates of model unknowns
including the VAR parameters in (1) and the smoothed estimates of life expectancy and death
(mortality) rates free from measurement errors. We first discuss the properties of the smoothed
growth rates of the life expectancy and mortality rates, and subsequently, examine how an
increase in unemployment affects the growth rates of the life expectancy and mortality rates
conditional on the posterior estimates of the VAR coefficients.

3.1         Model-implied growth rates of life expectancy and mortality
Figure 2 presents the growth rates of the life expectancy and death rates of the overall pop-
ulation implied by the smoothed estimates and compares them with the corresponding data
series. The smoothed and raw series for the sub-groups are reported in Figure 3. We find that
the smoothed and raw growth rates move very closely. However, a non-negligible portion of
the fluctuations in the raw growth rates is attributable to measurement errors, most notably
so for the growth rate of death rates. One way to clearly see this pattern is by analyzing the
behavior of the autocorrelation and standard deviations of the raw series and of the smoothed
series as reported in the right part of Table 2. For ease of comparison, the left part of Table 1
is reproduced in Table 2. We find that compared to the data moments, the model-implied au-
tocorrelation value is higher and the standard deviation is smaller, as the noise in the original
series is removed.
    At the same time, observation errors only account for the high frequency movements of the

Notes: This figure presents the growth rate of the average life expectancy (first column), the growth rate of
the age-adjusted death rate (second column), and the unemployment rate (third column) for distinct groups
identified based on race and gender. The original series are presented in gray circled lines. For the first two
series, we compare with the smoothed estimates from our model (green lines). The data span from 1954 to 2017
for the White population, and from 1972 to 2017 for the African-American population.

Notes: We provide the sample moments (mean, autocorrelation at first lag, and standard deviation) of the
three series used in the estimation: the growth rate of the average life expectancy (panel A), the growth rate
of the age-adjusted death rate (panel B), and the unemployment rate (panel C) for the overall US population
and for distinct groups identified based on race and gender. We compare with those computed from the
smoothed estimates (without measurement errors) of our model. The data span from 1950 to 2017 for the overall

original variables. The Appendix shows that the log level of the two (actual and smoothed)
series move very closely, implying that the smoothing algorithm does not alter the core dynamics
of the original variables. In sum, our state-space model is able to smooth out fluctuations in the
raw growth rates while preserving the core dynamics of the underlying variables. As a result,
at lower frequencies (i.e., cycles longer than one year), the smoothed growth rates comove
with the raw growth rates. These are arguably the frequencies that we are interested in when
studying the relation between unemployment and human health and they are less likely to be
contaminated by significant observation errors.

3.2        Relationship across unemployment, mortality, and life expectancy
To understand the effects of an increase in unemployment on the mortality rate and life ex-
pectancy, we use an impulse response analysis based on a Cholesky decomposition. We order
unemployment last, implying that all contemporaneous co-movements between the variables of
interest are attributed to structural shocks to the other two variables. In other words, under
this identification assumption, shocks to unemployment can affect mortality rates and life-
expectancy only with a lag. Below, we also discuss results for the case in which unemployment
is ordered first.
   Figure 4 reports the responses of life expectancy and the age-adjusted death rate to a one-
standard deviation shock to the unemployment rate for the overall population. The figure
reports the median response and 68% and 90% credible sets. The shock to unemployment is
quite persistent and is followed by statistically significant changes in the growth rates of life
expectancy and the death rate. These effects are also quite long lasting. Focusing on the

(second row panels) to unemployment, which is identified via a Cholesky decomposition, across the overall US
population and for the US population classified according to race and gender.


median response, we can see that the effect of the unemployment shock on the growth rates of
life expectancy and the death rate reaches its peak in the third year. The median values for
these peaks are around -0.04% and 0.15%, respectively.
   The impulse responses based on race and gender are presented in Figure 5. To facilitate the
comparison across groups, the median impulse responses for each group are reported in Figure 6.
The first row of Figure 6 contains the median impulse responses to a one-standard deviation
unemployment shock (as in Figure 4 and Figure 5). Given that the size of the typical shock
varies across groups, the second row of Figure 6 reports the impulse responses to a normalized
(1%) unemployment shock to keep the size of the shock identical across groups.
   Several important observations can be made. The responses of the growth rates of the
age-adjusted death rates are statistically significant for all groups. For the growth rate of life
expectancy, 90% credible sets exclude zero for four out of six groups, while 68% credible sets
exclude zero for all groups. Thus, we find strong statistical evidence of a dynamic relation


                                                     16
between unemployment shocks and human well-being for all groups. African-Americans expe-
rience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more
persistent. Conditional on the same race, the shocks for women are smaller. The effects on
life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall. This cannot
be entirely explained as a consequence of larger shocks, as in the case of life expectancy, the
pattern largely persists when controlling for the size of the shock. However, it could be the
result of the larger persistence of unemployment following the shocks. Conditional on the size of
the shock, we find that women (both African-American and White) present a relatively larger
increase in death rates and this is particularly visible for White women. Finally, White men
seem to have the larger response of age-adjusted death rates in the long run (10-year horizon).
   In comparing these impulse responses, it is important to keep in mind that the sample is not
homogeneous across groups. The sample of the African-American population is significantly
shorter (1972-2017) than that of the White population (1954-2017). However, most of the
results described below are robust to using the common sample 1972-2017 (see Figure A-4 in
the appendix). The only pattern that changes when using the common sample is the persistent
response of white men death rates at long horizons. When using the shorter sample, this result
does not appear. Thus, we infer that it is mostly driven by the dynamics of the three variables
at the beginning of the sample.
   The Appendix also reports results for an identification strategy based on ordering unem-
ployment first in the Cholesky decomposition. In this case, unemployment shocks are allowed
to have contemporaneous effects on the other variables in the system. As explained in the intro-
duction, there are several reasons explaining why unemployment could have contemporaneous
effects on mortality rates (not commuting to work, no risk of work related deaths, etc.). The
finding that an unemployment shock is eventually followed by an increase in mortality and a
decline in life-expectancy is robust to using this different identification strategy. However, when
using this alternative identification assumption, an interesting result emerges with respect to
the short-run dynamics. An increase in unemployment leads to a contemporaneous decline in
mortality rates and to a contemporaneous increase in life-expectancy. This effect quickly re-
verts in two-three years and in the long-run mortality increases and life expectancy declines, in
line with our benchmark results. In other words, the long-term effect dominates the short-term
dynamics. Thus, the results about the impact of the COVID-19 unemployment shock that we
will describe below are not qualitatively affected by the specific identification strategy. At the
same time, this different identification strategy could be helpful in understanding why previous
studies have often found conflicting results on the effects of unemployment on human health.
On impact, unemployment can lead to a decline in morality as deaths due to motor vehicle or
work-related accidents diminish, but over time economic distress might take a toll on human
well-being.

3.3     Historical importance of unemployment shocks
The previous subsection highlights that unemployment shocks are followed by statistically sig-
nificant changes in the growth rates of the age adjusted death rate and life expectancy. In this
subsection, we are interested in assessing the relative importance of unemployment shocks for
these two variables.
   To assess the historical importance of unemployment shocks, we compute a variance decom-
position by comparing the unconditional variance, as implied by the VAR model, when only
the orthogonalized unemployment shock is active, to the overall variance. Specifically, we com-

Notes: The table provides the COVID-19 unemployment shock implied by our state-space model for overall US
population and for US population classified according to race and gender. To facilitate the interpretation, we
provide the scale of standard deviation as well as the actual magnitude (%) of the shock.


pute the fraction of forecast error variance of the percentage change in life expectancy and the
age-adjusted mortality rate explained by the unemployment shock at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year
horizons. Table 3 summarizes our findings. The first row in each panel of Table 3 reports the
results for the overall population. At 15 years, the fractions of forecast error variance explained
by unemployment shocks are 7.46% and 11.58% for life expectancy and death rate, respectively.
Thus, the contribution of unemployment shocks to these measures of human health is by no
means negligible.
    In line with our previous findings, Table 3 reveals substantial heterogeneity across gender
and race. We find that unemployment shocks account for larger fractions of the variations
in life expectancy and death rates in the case of men relative to women. For example, the
fraction of variance for the growth rate of life expectancy is twice as large (17.90% vs 8.42%)
for African-American men with respect to African-American women and almost three times
as large (13.98% vs 5.41%) for White men with respect to White women (15-year horizon).
A similar pattern emerges for the contribution to the age-adjusted death rate: The fraction
of variance is twice as large (17.78% vs 8.99%) for African-American men with respect to
African-American women and almost three times as large (27.96% vs 8.44%) for White men
with respect to White women (15-year horizon). When comparing the White population to
the African-American population, we find that unemployment shocks are more impactful for
African-Americans. However, the gap across races is smaller than the gap across gender, when
controlling for race.

4     Long-run impact of the COVID-19 unemployment shock
The COVID-19 pandemic is having immediate, substantial consequences on the death rate in
the United States. At the same time, it has led to a severe macroeconomic contraction. Part
of this contraction can be explained in light of the shock itself, as several people autonomously
decided to scale down their consumption, especially for services such as restaurant and enter-
tainment. On top of this, lockdowns have also contributed to further reduce economic activity.
These measures have arguably saved lives, reducing the contagion rate and mitigating the risk
of exhaustion of health care personnel and resources. However, the severe economic contraction
due to the pandemic itself and the measures used to contain it might have long-term conse-
quences on life-expectancy and death rates. In this section, we are interested in using our VAR
to assess the potential impact of the economic contraction in light of the historical relation
between unemployment and human health.

4.1    Effects on life expectancy and age-adjusted death rate
What is the cumulative effect of the COVID-19 unemployment shock on life expectancy and
the age-adjusted death rate at a 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year horizon? To answer this question, we
rely on our state-space model to produce a measure of the unemployment shock experienced
by the US economy. Despite the estimation sample ending in 2017, unemployment data for
2018, 2019, and (partially for) 2020 are available for the overall population and for each group.
At the time of this draft, the historical unemployment rates are available up to October 2020.
We use the ten-month average of the available monthly unemployment rates as a proxy for the
2020 annual unemployment rate. Conditional on the posterior coefficient estimates and the
2018-2020 values of the unemployment rates, we can filter out the reduced-form shocks ηi,t in
(1) based on the state-space model. We can do so by treating the 2018-2020 values of the life
expectancy and death rate as missing observations.
   We then apply a transformation based on the Cholesky decomposition to the inferred
reduced-form shocks to back out the structural unemployment shocks. The implied COVID-19
unemployment shock distributions are provided in Table 4. This empirical approach aims at
distinguishing and isolating the consequences for human health of the economic distress related
to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Obviously, the
original shock that led to the increase in unemployment is a health shock, but our goal here
is to only consider the consequences for human health of the COVID-19-related increase in
unemployment. In this context, unemployment acts as a readily available proxy for the overall
economic distress.
   Based on our approach, the COVID-19 unemployment shock is about 3.17 standard devi-
ations larger (about 2.68% in magnitude) than the typical shock to the unemployment rate.

rate at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. We present the median values and provide the values that correspond to the
90% bands in brackets. Results are presented for the overall US population and subdivided based on race and
gender.


We applied the same method to obtain a measure of the unemployment shock for the groups
sorted by gender and race. The scale of these shocks in terms of standard deviations (or per-
centage points) are: 2.37 (or 3.10%) for the African-American population, 2.13 (or 3.63%) for
African-American men, 3.00 (or 3.02%) for African-American women, 3.53 (or 2.68%) for the
White population, 3.03 (or 2.69%) for White men, and 4.72 (or 2.74%) for White women. Thus,
consistently with previous studies, we find that women (both African-American and White) are
disproportionately affected relative to men.

marginal effect of the shock: they indicate the expected change in life expectancy and death
rates following the COVID-19 unemployment shock keeping fixed other factors that affect these
measures of well-being, like the progress in health care.
   Table 5 also reveals substantial heterogeneity across genders and races. The impact on the
death rate is large for all groups, but visibly larger for African-Americans. As explained above,
this is in part the result of a larger shock, but also of a larger response conditional on the size
of the shock. At a 15-year horizon, we expect a decline in life expectancy of 0.85% for African-
American citizens, 1.15% for African-American men, 0.76% for African-American women, 0.58%
for White citizens, 0.74% for White men, and 0.41% for White women. At a 15-year horizon,
the increases in death rates are 3.86% for African-American s, 3.40% for African-American men,
3.70% for African-American women, 3.48% for Whites, 4.14% for White men, and 3.37% for
White women. As explained before, the higher increase in the age-adjusted death rate observed
in White men is somehow sensitive to the sample used in the VAR.
   To translate these percentage changes in absolute changes of age-adjusted lost lives and
years of life expectancy, we multiply the predicted percentage change in life expectancy and
age adjusted mortality rate at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years provided in Table 5 with the most recent life

Notes: The table provides an estimate of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock
based on the CENSUS projections of the US population adjusted to account for the additional deaths resulting
from the unemployment shock.


age-adjusted deaths every 100,000 citizens are 32.97 for African-Americans, 35.64 for African-
American men, 26.10 for African-American women, 25.53 for White, 35.71 for White men, 21.03
for White women.
    Overall, these results suggest that the COVID-19 economic distress will be followed by
significant changes in mortality rates and life expectancy. Our evidence shows that excess deaths
will disproportionately affect African Americans, consistent with previously published work on
the impact of race on recovery post disasters and all-cause mortality, see Fothergill et al. (1999),
FitzGerald and Hurst (2017), and Schroeder (2020). These figures might be a conservative
projection once we recognize that the pandemic has led many workers, especially women, to
exit the labor force, with the result that the measured unemployment might underestimate the
real dimension of the shock to the labor market.

4.2     Excess deaths
The long-term effects of the COVID-19 related unemployment surge on the US mortality rate
have not been characterized in the literature. Thus, as a last step, we compute an estimate
of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock. This corresponds
to the difference between the number of deaths predicted by the model with and without the
unemployment shock observed in 2020.
   Here, we briefly explain how we compute the excess deaths and refer the reader to Ap-
pendix C for details. In essence, our state-space model provides an estimate for the change in

                                                         24
the age-adjusted death rate following the COVID-19 unemployment shock. Using the latest
death rate as an initial value, we can construct projections for the age adjusted death rates
with, Rtu , and without, Rt , unemployment shock observed in 2020. We can do this for any
horizon t > 2020. Here, we omit the group identifier i for ease of exposition. Note that we
use a superscript u to indicate that the variable is impacted by the COVID-19 unemployment
shock. We then need to convert Rtu and Rt into a prediction for the crude death rates with
                                     u
and without the unemployment shock, Rc,t and Rc,t , respectively. For this step, we model the
historical relations between the crude and age adjusted death rates and use this historical rela-
tion to convert projections of the age-adjusted death rate into projections for the crude death
rate. Specifically, we run an OLS regressions of the crude death rate on an intercept and the
age-adjusted death rates. Through linear transformation via the OLS coefficients, we obtain
 u
Rc,t and Rc,t , respectively.
   Finally, we require long-run projection of the US population. We treat the Census Bureau
projection as the projection consistent with the model absent the unemployment shock. We
then reconstruct the alternative projection based on the change in the death rate as predicted
by the model. In sum, we compute the excess deaths EDtu as:

                                    EDtu = Rc,t
                                            u
                                                Ptu − Rc,t Pt ,                               (5)

       u
where Rc,t is the predicted crude death rate with the unemployment shock, Rc,t is the predicted
crude death rate without the unemployment shock, Ptu is the population projection with the un-
employment shock, Pt is the population projection without the unemployment shock (available
from the Census Bureau).
   Table 8 provides the respective numbers for the overall population and the different groups
identified based on race and gender. For the overall population, the increase in the death rate
following the COVID-19 pandemic implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths
over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. For African-Americans, we estimate 180 thousand
and 270 thousand excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. For White, we
estimate 0.82 and 1.21 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These
numbers are roughly equally split between men and women. These numbers indicate that the
consequences of the pandemic might go well beyond the deaths directly caused by the disease.
   While the extent of the long-term excess mortality related to coronavirus crisis is staggering,
several considerations are in order. First, the additional number of lives that would have been
lost secondary to COVID-19 acute illness and health care resources exhaustion if lockdowns
had not been implemented is estimated to be over 100,000 in the US alone, Fothergill et al.
(1999), Stone (2020), and Emanuel et al. (2020). Second, our analysis makes a number of
implicit assumptions based on historical data regarding the time and severity of the recession.
It is important to keep in mind the significant amount of uncertainty around this variable.

                                                25
It is possible that the economy will recover faster than in the past. Furthermore, a shift in
economic and social politics can drastically affect the duration and severity of the recession,
and consequently modify our excess mortality estimates, Bianchi and Melosi (2017). Third,
based on emerging data, it is likely that the limited access to health care during the lockdown,
temporary discontinuation of preventive care interventions, massive loss of employer-provided
health insurance coverage, and the lingering concern of the population about seeking medical
care out to fear of contracting COVID-19 will impact mortality rate and life expectancy even
more severely, Garfield et al. (2020) and Sharpless (2020). Fourth, this is the first recession
with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in place, a critical resource to mitigate the effects of
unemployment on citizens well-being, see Gruber and Sommers (2020).
    Our results have three important policy implications. First, it would be desirable to study
and implement health policy measures to guarantee activities remain open with minimal risks
to workers and public, whenever possible. For instance, implementation of universal masking
and social distancing policies at a large health care system in the Northeastern US resulted in
a decline of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across health care workers, despite the high-risk setting
(see Wang et al. (2020)). Second, it is of utmost importance to facilitate routine preventive care
and health care access for the whole US population, including the over 20 million Americans who
lost employer-provided health care coverage, Garfield et al. (2020) and Gruber and Sommers
(2020). Third, policy interventions meant to reduce the economic impact of the recession are
likely to also contribute to save lives.


5     Conclusion
We examine the historical relation between life-expectancy, death-rates, and unemployment for
the overall US population and groups organized based on race and gender. We use a VAR
that allows for observation errors and we find that increases in unemployment are followed
by statistically significant increases in death rates and declines in life-expectancy. A sizable
fraction of the variation of these two variables can be accounted by unemployment shocks.
    We then use this historical relation to form predictions about the potential impact of the
recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on human health. Our results suggest that the
toll of lives claimed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus far exceeds those immediately related to the
acute COVID-19 critical illness and that the recession caused by the pandemic can jeopardize
population health for the next two decades. Based on our findings, African American citizens
and women will be suffering more profoundly from the coronavirus-driven recession, adding
on to their disproportionate adverse outcome in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,
Garg et al. (2020). Based on our findings, large, sustained and swift government maneuvers to
support the currently unemployed labor force and to abate unemployment will be as equally


                                               26
important as the massive efforts focused on limiting and eventually eradicating transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 with effective vaccination strategies that are finally into place.

A       State-space representation
We denote the “log average life expectancy,” “log age-adjusted mortality rate,” and the “un-
employment rate” as y1,t , y2,t , y3,t , respectively. We allow for (potentially serially correlated but
mutually uncorrelated) measurement errors i,t in the level series. The joint dynamics of the
growth rates of z1,t and z2,t and the level of z3,t follow a VAR(1). Put together,

Note that we can re-express (A-1) by

                              yt = zt + t                                                        (A-2)
                              zt = µ + (M + Φ)zt−1 − ΦM zt−2 + ηt

B       Estimation algorithm
We assume that the measurement error on the unemployment rate is zero, i.e., 3,t = 0 or
σ32 = 0. Denote Θ = {ρ1 , ρ2 , σ12 , σ22 } and Θz = {Φ, Σ}. We use the Gibbs sampler to estimate
the model unknowns. We rely on the state-space representation of (A-4). For the jth iteration,

                                       j
    • Run Kalman smoother to generate Z1:T and j1:T conditional on Θj , Θjz .

                                                  A-1
    • Obtain posterior estimates of Θj+1  j+1
                                      , Θz   via direct sampling from MNIW conditional on
       j        j
      Z1:T and 1:T .

                      j         j         j        j
        – Re-arrange Z1:T to [∆z1,t−1 , ∆z2,t−1 , z3,t−1 ]0 and compute posterior distributions as-
             sociated with the VAR parameters Φ, Σ. Similarly for j1:T .
        – Draw posteriors (direct sampling) based on uninformative conjugate priors.

    We iterate for a large number of iterations.


C      Computing Excess Deaths
We omit the group identifier i to ease exposition. The law of motion of the state vector is

                                       Xt = µ + ΦXt−1 + ηt .                                              (A-5)

We define an indicator vector e∆r that selects the mortality growth rate ∆rt = e0∆r Xt from the
state vector. Denote the cumulative sum as
             t
             X            t+1
                          X
    X0,t ≡         Xj =       (I − Φj ) (I − Φ)−1 µ +(I − Φt+1 )(I − Φ)−1 η0 ,                            (A-6)
             j=0          j=1

                                           E(Xt )
                                                                     
                                                                 −1
                     =        I(t + 1) − Φ(I − Φ    t+1

C.1     Mortality rate
Let η0u be the vector containing the contemporaneous impact of the COVID-19 unemployment
shock. Then, the cumulative effect of the shock is then driving the difference between the case
with the COVID-19 unemployment shock and the counterfactual scenario
                                                 
          u       0                    t+1
        ∆r0,t = e∆r I(t + 1) − Φ(I − Φ )(I − Φ)−1
                                                    E(Xt ) + e0t+1 )(I − Φ)−1 η0u .                       (A-7)
                                                             |∆r       {z       }
                |                   {z                  }             cirtu
                                         ∆r0,t


Conditional on R−1 , we can construct the level of deaths

                                        Rtu = exp(∆r0,t
                                                    u
                                                        )R−1                                              (A-8)
                                        Rt = exp(∆r0,t )R−1

                                            u
based on the cumulative growth rates of ∆r0,t and ∆r0,t in (A-7), respectively. Note that (A-8)
are the age adjusted death rates implied from the VAR estimates.

Notes: Data source: The World Bank. We regress the crude death rates on the age adjusted death rates
and obtain the following OLS coefficients: the constant coefficient is β̂0 = 651.9 and the slope coefficient is
β̂1 = 0.2255. We plot the fitted crude death rates based on the age adjusted death rates in red line.


C.2      Converting from the age adjusted- to crude death rates
Currently, Rtu and Rt are defined as the age adjusted death rates. We want to convert to the
crude death rates based on Figure A-1, which is to regress the crude death rates on the age
adjusted death rates and construct the fitted crude death rates based on the OLS coefficients.
Let β̂0 be the constant OLS coefficient and β̂1 be the slope coefficient. Then, we construct

                                             Rc,t = β̂0 + β̂1 Rt                                        (A-9)
                                              u
                                             Rc,t = β̂0 + β̂1 Rtu .

For each race and gender group, we use β̂0 , β̂1 (based on the overall population) for conversion
as we do not have the access to historical crude death rates for different race and gender groups.
In sum, the excess death rate caused by the COVID-19 unemployment shock is defined as

                                            ERtu = Rc,t
                                                    u

                                                             t−1

                                              t−1 Pt−1   =         GC
                                                                    j P0 .                             (A-11)
                                                             j=0

For measures of (A-11), we take the population projections for the United States provided
by the United States Census Bureau. As we find that the population numbers provided by

                                                      A-3
the CDC, i.e., (E) of Table 6, and Census Bureau are somewhat different, we adjust the 2017
population numbers in the Census Bureau projections to be consistent with (E) of Table 6.
   Because the COVID-19 unemployment shock causes a change in the expected path for the
death rate, we adjust the projection as
                                                     t−1
                                                     Y
                                      u
                      Ptu = (Gt−1 − ERt−1    u
                                          )Pt−1 =        (GC     u   u
                                                           j − ERj )P0 .            (A-12)
                                                     j=0


Note that we initialize by P0 = P0u .

C.4     Excess deaths
The excess deaths caused by the COVID-19 unemployment shock is defined as

                                  EDtu = Rc,t
                                          u
                                              Ptu − Rc,t Pt ,                       (A-13)

which can be computed from (A-8), (A-9), (A-10), (A-11), and (A-12).

Notes: We compare median impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation (first panel) or a unit shock (second
panel) to unemployment, which is identified via a Cholesky decomposition, across the overall US population
and for the US population classified according to race and gender. Results are based on an identical estimation
sample which spans from 1972 to 2017 for all workers.

Notes: We apply a Cholesky decomposition to obtain the structural COVID-19 shocks. We set the structural
COVID-19 shocks to zero except for the one corresponding to unemployment rate and multiply the lower
triangular matrix from the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. The table provides the ratio of
this transformed unemployment rate shock over the reduced-form COVID-19 unemployment shock. We present
the median values and provide the values that correspond to the 90% bands in brackets.

Notes: The table provides the COVID-19 unemployment shock implied by our state-space model for overall
US population and for US population classified according to race and gender. We consider an alternative
identification strategy based on ordering unemployment first in the Cholesky decomposition. In this case,
unemployment shocks are allowed to have contemporaneous effects on the other variables in the system. To
facilitate the interpretation, we provide the scale of standard deviation as well as the actual magnitude (%) of
the shock.

Notes: The table shows the predicted cumulative percentage change in life expectancy and age adjusted mortality
rate at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. We present the median values and provide the values that correspond to the
90% bands in brackets. Results are presented for the overall US population and subdivided based on race and
gender. The results are based on an alternative identification strategy based on ordering unemployment first in
the Cholesky decomposition. In this case, unemployment shocks are allowed to have contemporaneous effects
on the other variables in the system.

Notes: The table shows the predicted cumulative absolute change in life expectancy and age adjusted deaths

adjusted deaths data provided in Table 6. The results are based on an alternative identification strategy based
on ordering unemployment first in the Cholesky decomposition. In this case, unemployment shocks are allowed
to have contemporaneous effects on the other variables in the system.
