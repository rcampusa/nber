                  BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO REDUCE HOUSING EQUITY

                                    ABSTRACT

      The majority of the wealth of most elderly is in the form of
                                                                   housing
 equity.  It is often claimed that many elderly would transfer wealth from

 housing to finance current consumption expenditure, were it not for the large
 transaction costs associated with changes in housing equity.     This is the
 rationale for a market in reverse annuity mortgages.  This paper considers
 whether transaction costs, understood to include the psychic costs associated
 with leaving friends, family surroundings, and the like, prevent the elderly
 from making choices that would improve their financial circumstances.     The

 analysis considers jointly the probability that an elderly family will move
 and the housing equity that is chosen when a move occurs. The results are
 based on the decisions of the Retirement History Survey sample between 1969
 and 1919. Relative to the potential gains from a reallocation of wealth
 between housing equity and other assets, transaction costs are very
                                                                     large.
 Nonetheless,   the effect on the housing equity of the elderly is very small.

 On balance, were all elderly to move and choose optimum levels of housing

 equity, the amount of housing equity would be increased slightly.  Most
 elderly are not liquidity constrained.  And contrary to standard formulations
 of the life cycle hypothesis, the typical elderly family has no desire to
 reduce housing equity.   The desired reduction of housing equity is largest

 among families with low income and high housing wealth, but even in this case

 the desired reductions are rather small.    And these desired reductions are
more than offset by the desired increases of other families, especially those
with high income and low housing wealth. Thus, consistent with the previous

 findings of Venti and Wise and of Feinstein and McFadden,    limited demand may
 explain the absence of a market for reverse annuity mortgages.

                        Steven F.   Venti.   and David A. Wise*



     The majority of the wealth of most elderly is in the form of housing

equity.    This housing wealth, it is claimed,      is a potential source of support

for the elderly as they age.    It is further claimed that many elderly would

choose to transfer wealth from housing to finance current consumption

expenditure,   were it not for the large transaction costs associated with

changes in housing equity.     In the past, it has typically been necessary for

such families to move to withdraw wealth from housing.            Indeed,    the rational

for a market in reverse annuity mortgages has been that the elderly would like

to withdraw wealth from housing were it possible to do so without incurring

the large transaction costs associated with moving.         This paper considers

whether these claims are correct.       Two related questions      are addressed:

     •
          Given the predetermined financial and other circumstances of families
          as they approach retirement ages, would the typical elderly family like
          to withdraw wealth from housing?

     •    Are the transaction costs of moving large, and do they constrain
          adjustments in the housing wealth of the elderly as they age?

     The paper provides a clear answer to the first question.               Jere all

elderly to choose optimal housing equity, given their existing circumstances,

there would be little change in housing wealth on average.            In particular,     the


typical elderly family would not choose to reduce housing equity.               The answer

to   the second question is less evident.       Assuming that the elderly could gain

from a reallocation of wealth between housing equity and other assets, the

relative gain, in these tens, necessary to justify moving is typically very

large.     Our evidence suggests a strong preference for remaining in existing

housing as the elderly grow older.      On the other hand, that the housing equity

of the elderly is not typically reduced as they age is not explained by the

                                        The elderly like it that way.
high transaction costs of moving.

       In a predecessor to this paper [1987]     ,   we considered the change in

                                            The primary conclusion of that analysis
housing equity when the elderly move.

was that the elderly who move were about as likely to increase as to decrease

housing equity.     But, families with low income relative to housing wealth were

more likely to move and to reduce housing equity when they did.            The latter

                                                                  the choices
finding raises the possibility that transaction costs constrained

of some elderly who otherwise would have chosen to transfer wealth out of

housing.1

         The current paper is a more   fonal    treatment    of moving and the choice of

model:     one is that an elderly family moves if the gain from changing housing

outweighs the transaction costs of moving.          Transaction costs are understood

to include,      and are likely to be dominated by, the psychic costs associated

with leaving friends, familiar surroundings,         and the like.   The other is that

the housing equity chosen after a move represents the optimal level of
                                                                       housing

equity,    given current circumstances.     Based on the second assumption,        the

model is used to simulate the changes in housing equity that the elderly would

choose to make, were they to overcome the transaction costs of moving and

choose optimal levels of housing equity.          The analysis is based on the

Retirement History Survey (RHS)         Families are followed over the six RHS

surveys,   conducted every two years between 1969 and 1979.

       The model is described in the first section.        Parameter estimates are

discussed in section two and the results of simulations are reported in the

third section.       Section four contains concluding remarks.



I.     The ModeL



       The goal of the analysis is to estimate the housing equity that the

elderly would prefer.      With this goal in mind, we consider the allocation of

bequeathable wealth between housing and other assets, conditional, on current

income and other circumstances.        Suppose that the value of housing equity

versus other wealth can be captured by the simple function


(l,)         V   -



where H is housing equity,      W   is total bequeathable wealth, and $   is   a

preference parameter depending on income and other individual characteristics.

Then preferred housing equity is

for moving.          It is clear that families could move for many reasons other than

to change housing equity and that the value of the house to the family

reflects much more than its asset value.                     It is also clear that many family

the possibility that preferences                                  change with age.                The terms in income    Y   are

      tIt is clear from equation (10) that the specificationmay be interpreted
 as a disequilibrium model, where d(Z) represents the extent of disequilibrium

 income, and total wealth, without incorporating the term             The use

 otherwise it would be concentrated to a greater extent in the disturbance

 values of desired housing equity, given the right-hand variables in equation
 (10), more accurate predictions can be had by using the procedure that is
 followed here.

       The data consist of five surveys conducted at 2-year intervals.                        There

are two possible outcomes for each family:                    1.    The family does not move

during the entire 10-year survey period.                 2.        The family moves in period r and

chooses a level of housing equity H1.               The probability of the first outcome is

given by

the probability that the family moves, the terms                         lnV* and lnVo must be

the RBS    panel   survey ended).    It is assumed that the optimal level of housing

equity H*t is chosen when the family moves, up to an error component

represented by u.       The family moves if the gain from moving outweighs the

transaction costs of moving.         The predicted level of H*t is used to determine

the value of preferred housing equity in period t; the value of current

values of H*7, since not all families have the same preferences and even if
they did, the optimal housing level may not be available at any point in time.
Integration would be over the random term xi, when V, is evaluated. This is
the procedure followed in Venti and Wise [1984]                It

the method used to predict desired Ht already incorporates substantial
heterogeneity in housing preferences; the remaining residual variance is

wealth in housing equity, and the observed choices H + W, are graphed against

of housing and the wealth allocation that it represents.

      It is informative first to report the results from a two-stage estimation

procedure:     the housing equity equation (11) is estimated by non-linear least

           in the first stage, using data for movers only.               The prediction of

 of moving, as expected.8 But             lnV   explains only a small part of moving

 behavior.     With no change in retirement, marital, or health status, the

 transaction costs parameter lnM, which is the constant term in the probit

              is large, say on the order of 1.5.             Because lnV explains so little

 variance is in fact estimated by the coefficient on lnV.

of moving behavior,     the constant term must be large to yield the small

probability of moving that the data exhibit.           Thus the results from this

procedure indicate that the value associated with housing equity, and the

wealth allocation that it represents, must be increased substantially--about

50 percent--for a family to move.        Indeed, without a change in family status

or retirement,     the "transaction costs" of moving are apparently prohibitive

for many families,     the family is simply not going to move.          This is consistent

with the small moving probability in any two year interval, about .08 on

average.

        Now consider the maximum likelihood estimates reported in table          1.   Three

key parameters determine the estimated transaction costs:              m0, estimated to be

2.00,    o   estimated at 0.77, and cx   with   an estimated value of 0.62.       The mean

of the estimated values of lnN is 1.56.           Thus the estimates    suggest a mean

transaction costs parameter of 1.56, with a standard deviation in any time

interval of 1.39.      For a few, then, the resistance to moving is very small if

the estimates are taken lUerally; for many more the resistance is quite

large.       On average, the value associated with the allocation of total wealth

would have to be increased by over 50 percent to induce the family to move.

        Much more important than a potential reallocation of wealth--AlnV--in the

decision to move are changes in retirement, marital, or health status.                The

probability of moving in the base        case     is .075.   If the family head retires



     9These estimated values are sensitive to errors in reported housing
equity.  If instead of the median of the several housing values reported by
each family in the biannual surveys before a move (see the appendix), the
actual recorded values are used, all of these estimates are considerably
larger.

stayers.        The difference apparently reflects the fact that, on average,

families who move have more to gain from wealth reallocation than families who

don't move.        That is, to the extent that a reallocation of housing equity is a

motivation for moving, the difference should be greater for those who have

chosen to move than for those who have not.           As emphasized above, however, it

is clear that this is not the major reason for moving.           The difference

increases       with both income and housing wealth quartile,    especially the latter.

The mean difference among movers with high incomes and high housing equity is

$20,069;    the median is $10,189.      Among those with low income and low housing

equity the mean is only $3,744, with a median of only $2,233.

        Table    2b is analogous   to table 2a but the disturbance term in the housing

equation is assumed to reflect desired housing choice, instead of a
maximization error or deviation from the optimal level.            To incorporate   the

disturbance term, a random draw is made from the estimated error

distribution--normalwith mean 0 and variance 0.2008•W--each time that desired

housing is predicted.        Although this does not affect the expected value of

housing equity, since the expected value of v is zero, it does affect the

absolute values of the deviation.          This can be seen by comparing the values in

table    2b with those in table 2a.       For example, the average of the absolute

values of the desired change over all families is $5,377 when the disturbance

 term is not accounted for and $12,766 when it is.

        The values in tables 2a and 2b indicate the change in housing equity that

would occur if transaction cost were zero.            On average, the desired change in

housing equity may be substantial.

        But, also on average, the desire is not to reduce, but rather to increase

housing equity, as shown in table         3.    This table shows the mean (and median)

difference between desired and existing housing equity, again by housing

equity and income, and for movers and for stayers.       This table indicates the

housing choices that families would make were there no moving transaction

costs and all families chose housing equity to optimize the allocation of

wealth between housing and other assets.       The average difference is $1,010 and

the median difference is $106.     Families with low income and high housing

wealth would like to reduce housing equity, but those with high income and low

housing equity would like to allocate more wealth to housing.

        The predicted mean increase for movers is $3,258; the median is $854.

Like the predictions for all households together,      those for movers show some

reallocations that increase housing equity and others that reduce it.       On

average,    the increases outweigh the reductions.   The results   in the second

panel of the table are very similar in pattern to the findings reported in

Venti and Wise [1987], although the magnitudes are smaller     herej2 The mean

predicted change in the housing equity of stayers, were they to move,      is $975,

with a median of $89.     Comparison of the panels for movers and for stayers

shows    that the predicted changes within the cells are typically greater for

movers than for stayers.

        The average of predicted percentage differences between actual and

desired housing equity are shown in table 4.       Two features of the table stand




     12The earlier results were actual changes in housing equity among movers
by housing equity and income quartile, after controlling for age, calendar
year, children, and changes in retirement, health, or marital status.    A
correction was also made for reporting errors. The predictions here may
provide more accurate informationbecause the continuous functional form does
not allow measurement error- -which would be most prevalent among families who
enter the upper right and the lower left portions of the table--to exert as
large a force ott the results as the thunmy variable specification used in our
earlier paper. It could also be that the specification used here does not fit
the data as well as flexible form used there.

out.   The desired changes are positive on average and are greater for movers

than for stayers.     And,   the desired increases   are much greater for families

with high income and low housing wealth than for families with low income and

high housing equity.     This pattern is especially evident among movers.     On

average movers with high income and low housing equity would like to increase

housing equity by 72 percent; the average mover with low income and high

housing equity would like to reduce housing equity by only 3.5 percent.        Were

there no moving transaction costs, and all families moved to optimize the

allocation of wealth between housing and other assets, housing equity would

increase by 4.9 percent on average; the typical family would not change

housing equity, as indicated by the median percent change of 0.6 percent.



IV.    Stmrnary and Conclusions



       Mobility among elderly families is very low.      Approximately 8 percent of
RHS homeowners move during a two-year period.        The percent increases very

substantially,   to about 15 percent, at the time of precipitating shocks like

change in marital status or retirement.       Thus most elderly are apparently

reluctant to move.     In our analysis this is reflected in large transaction

costs of moving.     The analysis emphasizes the potential gain in utility to be

had by moving and the resulting opportunity to reallocate wealth between

housing and other assets, under the presumption that many elderly would like

to withdraw wealth from housing to finance current consumption of other types.

This potential gain is very small, however, for most elderly.        Thus relative

to the potential gain from a reallocation of wealth, the transaction costs of

moving are large.

new housing, some would choose to add to housing wealth and others

     Apyendix:      Selection of estimation sample and variable definitions.


     The estimates are based on data from the Retirement History Survey (RHS).

The survey covered families headed by persons between ages 58 and 63 in 1969.

The families were interviewed every two years between 1969 and 1979; there

were six waves altogether.    The initial sample contained slightly over 11,000

families.     Over 8000 families were interviewed in the last survey in 1979.

     To obtain the sample for this paper we began with all families who owned

homes in 1969.      A family was omitted from the sample if the first move was to

a rental unit,     or if data used in the analysis (other than housing wealth)

were missing in any year prior to the first move.          The remaining sample

consisted of 4106 families.      In addition, housing equity was sometimes missing

or rnisreported.     In some cases housing equity was not reported in one or more

years; in other cases     it was apparently either incorrectly reported or

incorrectly    coded in one or more years.      This latter problem is clearly

evident in the tremendous    year to year variation in housing equity.       In our

model a large error in reported housing equity for a family that doesn't move

in a given interval means that the family must be dropped from the sample.

This is because a family, at each point in time, must choose between its

current level of housing equity (inherited from the previous period)         and the

optimal allocation of housing wealth.        If housing equity is incorrectly

reported to be unusually high in period       t,   then in some cases housing equity

in period t will exceed total wealth in period        ti-l.   Unless nonhousing wealth

is negative or housing values dropped sharply between periods t and t+l, such

cases reflect error in year to year reported housing equity.          Instead of

deleting all such cases from the sample, the median of housing equity (in          1.979

dollars) over all periods prior to a move is used as the measure of housing
