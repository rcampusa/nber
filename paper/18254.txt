                                            ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates one of the first implemented provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (ACA) which permits young adults up to age 26 to enroll as dependents on a parent‚Äôs private
health plan. The paper also considers how the interaction between prior state laws expanding dependent
coverage to young adults and the ACA affected young adult coverage. Using data from the Current
Population Survey for calendar years 2004-2010, we apply a difference-in-differences framework
to estimate how these provisions affected coverage of eligible young adults compared to slightly older
adults. Our findings indicate that controlling for state laws, early implementation of the ACA increased
young adult dependent coverage by 5.3 percentage points and resulted in a 3.5 percentage point decline
in their uninsured rate. The interaction between state laws and the ACA suggests that the increase
in dependent coverage and decline in the uninsured rate may have been greater among young adults
who were targeted by both the ACA and state laws.

Introduction

One of the first implemented provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

(ACA) permits young adults up to age 26 to obtain health insurance as dependents on a parent‚Äôs

private health plan. This provision recognized that young adults are the age group most likely to

lack health insurance. In 2009, the year before the ACA dependent coverage expansion, 31.4%

of adults in the targeted age range, 19 to 25 years old, lacked coverage, nearly double the

national rate (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2011). This high likelihood of being without

coverage has compromised young adults‚Äô access to health services, their financial protection

against incurring substantial medical debt, and the ability to address their frequently observed

obesity and alcohol and tobacco use that lead to health and economic problems in later adulthood

(Nicholson et al. 2009; Callahan and Cooper 2005; Merluzzi and Nairn 1999).

       The ACA dependent coverage provision builds upon laws enacted by the nearly two-

thirds of states that sought to expand young adult coverage (Cantor et al. 2012). Two evaluations

of the state-level expansions found increases in young adult dependent coverage that were offset

by reductions in other sources of coverage (Monheit et al. 2011; Levine, McKnight, and Heep

2011). One of these studies tested the impact of these state policies on the number of uninsured

young adults and found no net impact (Monheit et al. 2011). ACA dependent coverage rules

promise to improve upon prior state expansions, since the federal law includes more liberal

eligibility requirements and it extends to young adults whose parents are enrolled in large self-

insured group plans that are exempt from state laws.

       A variety of early descriptive analyses suggest a substantial impact of the ACA‚Äôs

dependent coverage provision (Fronstin 2012; Mendes 2011; Martinez and Cohen 2011). One

analysis estimated that the number of young adults (ages 19 to 25) with health insurance

                                                 3
increased by 2.5 million between the September 2010 and June 2011 without a corresponding

coverage increase for those aged 26 to 35 (Sommers and Schwartz 2011). These trends are

consistent with a 2011 study that estimated large numbers of employers enrolling young adult

dependents under the ACA rules (Claxton et al. 2011).

        Most prior analyses of the ACA young adult provision have not specifically examined its

direct impact on dependent coverage and none have rigorously identified the early impact of the

federal law apart from the contribution of prior state laws and prevailing economic conditions.

Although Sommers and Kronick (2012) found a statistically significant increase in private

coverage of young adults eligible to enroll as dependents under the ACA (ages 19 to 25) relative

to a slightly older age group (ages 26 to 34) between 2005-2009 and 2010, their study did not

control for possible differences between ACA-targeted young adults and their control group in

demographic characteristics, eligibility for state dependent coverage expansions, or for economic

trends. As regards the latter, the weak economy over this period made it more difficult for young

adults to find jobs that offer coverage, and encouraged them to retain student status or live with

their parents, possibly contributing to increased enrollment through a parent‚Äôs plan.

        Most recently, Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2012) have applied an econometric

framework to examine the impact of the ACA dependent coverage provision using data from the

Survey of Income and Program Participation from August 2008 to November 2011. Consistent

with our findings from the Current Population Survey, they find that early implementation of this

ACA provision resulted in an increase in young adult dependent coverage and a decline in their

uninsured rate. While the authors consider the impact of state laws on dependent coverage, they

do so indirectly, applying models with state fixed effects, state linear time trends, and fitting

separate model for states with and without the reform provisions. Their results do not indicate


                                                  4
that state laws differentially affected the impact of the ACA on young adult coverage. By

contrast, our econometric analysis explicitly includes variables for the presence of state laws and

for young adults targeted by the state laws. Our findings suggest that the increase in dependent

coverage and the decline in uninsured rates may have been greater among young adults who

were targeted by both the state laws and the ACA.

       The goal of our study is to provide a rigorous analysis of this ACA coverage provision,

which controls for the inter-relationship between the ACA young adult provisions and prior

state-level reforms, young adult characteristics, and economic trends.


The ACA Young Adult Dependent Coverage Provision and Prior State Laws

       Beginning with the first plan renewal as of September 23, 2010, the ACA requires health

insurers and employer group plans, including self-insured plans, to provide coverage to

dependents under age 26 (P.L. 111-152 ¬ß2301). This requirement applies to all adult children

under age 26 regardless of marital status, residency, financial dependency, or other

characteristics. Plans held prior to the ACA, known as ‚Äúgrandfathered plans,‚Äù are not required to

enroll young adult dependents who are offered employer-sponsored coverage. However,

beginning in 2014 even grandfathered plans will be required to cover young adult dependents

regardless of whether they are offered a plan. Plans covering young adult dependents may not

treat them differently than other dependents in determining benefits or premiums. The ACA also

extended the same favorable tax treatment afforded other employer-sponsored insurance

premiums to the coverage of young adult dependents through the end of the tax year of their 26th

birthday.




                                                 5
       State laws effective prior to implementation of the ACA‚Äôs dependent coverage provision

are displayed in Table 1 and reveal variation in both timing and eligibility requirements. As

noted, these prior state laws were more limited than the ACA young adult expansion, applying

only to state regulated plans but not large employer self-funded plans (except for public

employee plans in some states). Moreover, of the states implementing dependent coverage

expansions by early 2011, all but a few were limited to unmarried young adults (Cantor, et al.

2012). Most of the reform states also imposed state residency requirements, at least for non-

students; and some (nine states) required or explicitly permitted insurers to charge added

premiums for enrolled young adults beyond standard family premiums. The federal law does not

include any of these limitations, and effectively preempts these state restrictions for young adults

under age 26. On the other hand, nine states laws authorize young adult dependent coverage

above the federal limit of age 26, including five states that allow enrollment up to age 30 or 31

and two other states have no upper age limit for full-time students. These state provisions for

older young adults are unaffected by the ACA.




Data and Methods

Data Sources and Study Population

       Data are drawn from the 2005 to 2011 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the

Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures coverage status for calendar years 2004 to

2010 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2011). To adjust for potentially confounding trends in

state economic conditions and health insurance markets, we link CPS records to annual state-

level data on unemployment rates (BLS n.d.), employer health insurance offer rates (MEPS

2010b), and the extent of employer self-insurance (MEPS 2010a). We exclude Hawaii and


                                                 6
Massachusetts from the analysis because coverage in those states is likely to be influenced by

their respective employer and individual coverage mandates.1

       Two age groups are included in our analysis. First, we define the young adult population

targeted for dependent coverage by the ACA as persons ages 19 to 23 who are not full-time

students and all young adults ages 24 or 25 regardless of student status. Prior to the ACA, full-

time students up to age 23 were generally eligible to remain on a parent‚Äôs plan. Second, we use

persons ages 27 to 30 who are not eligible for dependent coverage under the ACA as a

comparison group. Individuals reported as age 26 are excluded from the analysis because the

CPS does not provide sufficient information to determine their age-eligibility during the portion

of 2010 when the ACA dependent coverage rules were in effect. Our analysis sample includes

85,158 ACA-targeted young adults and 71,203 non-target comparison group observations.

Analytic Approach and Econometric Model

       After describing changes in sources of coverage between ACA-targeted and comparison

groups from 2004 to 2010 and evaluating differences in characteristics of these groups over the

study period, we treat implementation of the ACA‚Äôs dependent coverage expansion as a ‚Äúnatural

experiment‚Äù and consider how young adult coverage changed after implementation. To do so,

we use a ‚Äúdifference-in-differences‚Äù (DD) framework to examine changes in health insurance

status of the group targeted by the ACA from the pre- to post-implementation period relative to

the change in the non-targeted group. This contrast is made through a series of multivariate

linear probability models that adjust for non-policy related factors that may affect coverage as

well as eligibility for state dependent coverage expansions.

       Trends in four health insurance outcomes are examined over the study period: (1) private

dependent coverage other than as a dependent of a spouse living in the same household; (2)


                                                 7
private coverage as a policyholder or dependent of a spouse living in the same household; (3)

public coverage, including Medicaid or Medicare; and (4) no coverage during the year (i.e.,

uninsured). Study subjects with more than one type of coverage during the year are recorded in

each applicable category, thus the categories other than ‚Äúno coverage‚Äù are not mutually

exclusive. For example, 18.1% and 35.2%, respectively, of the ACA-targeted and comparison

groups with non-spousal dependent coverage had some other form of coverage reported in 2010.

These percentages did not change significantly with ACA implementation between 2009-2010.

        Regression models for each coverage outcome are specified as follows, with COVist

representing the respective dichotomous coverage outcome variable for individual i, living in

state s, and in year t:

    COVist = a1 + a2FED_TARGETi + a3ST_TARGETis + a4ST_POLICYst + a5TRENDt + ‚àëtbtYEARt +
        c1(ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst) + c2(ST_TARGETis*FED_TARGETi) +
        c3(ST_POLICYst*FED_TARGETi) + c4(ST_POLICYst*YEAR2010) +
        c5(FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010) + c6(ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst*FED_TARGETi) +
        c7(ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst*YEAR2010) + c8(ST_POLICYst*FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010) +
        c9(ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst*FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010) + ‚àëkdkXkit + ‚àërfrZrst +
        ‚àësgsSTATEs + ‚àëshs(STATEs*TRENDt) + eist

Two dichotomous variables, FED_TARGETi and ST_TARGETis, indicate whether young adults

would have met the eligibility requirements for expanded dependent coverage, respectively

under the ACA or a state law, regardless of whether these laws were actually in effect at the time

of the CPS interview. Thus, these target variables are time-invariant in our models and control

for underlying propensity of these individuals to have or not have specific types of coverage

throughout the study period. Eligibility for the ACA is based solely on age. Reflecting the

provisions of individual state laws, ST_TARGETis is assigned based on the young adults‚Äô state

of residence, age, marital status, whether they have their own dependents, whether they live with

                                                8
a parent, and their student status. The CPS lacks information about the insurance status of the

parents of young adults not living with them, for example whether parents are covered by a state

regulated plan. Thus, ST_TARGETis does not take parental insurance status into account. (As

discussed below, our models include state-level variables to adjust for likelihood that parents are

enrolled in state-regulated plans.)

       ST_POLICYst is a state policy implementation flag which is set to 1 for all individuals

living in a state with a dependent coverage expansion during the years in which the expansion

was in effect. This variable equals 0 for all individuals living in an expansion state during the

pre-expansion years and for individuals in non-expansion states during all study years. The

models also include a linear trend variable (TRENDt) as well as annual indicator variables

(YEARt). Implementation of the federal reform began September 23, 2010, but the CPS does

not provide information on the timing of health insurance coverage during the calendar year.

Thus we use the 2010 year indicator variable to flag federal policy implementation, which

provides a conservative estimate of policy impact, since it includes a long period of time when

the federal policy was not in effect. The YEAR2010 and ST_POLICYst indicator variables are

used only to mark the time at which state and federal policies went into effect, and therefore, do

not vary by any individual characteristics including whether the individual meets the criteria for

federal or state coverage expansion.

       Next, the models include a series of interaction terms among the target population and

policy implementation indicator variables. We use alternative specifications of these terms to

identify the policy impact of ACA young adult dependent rules. All of the specifications include

the interaction of FED_TARGETi and YEAR2010. The coefficient on this interaction term is the

DD estimate of the impact of the ACA dependent coverage expansion. The first specification



                                                 9
(referred to as Model 1) also includes the interaction of ST_TARGETis and ST_POLICYst,

effectively controlling for individuals‚Äô eligibility for state dependent coverage expansions prior

to the ACA.

       The second model specification (Model 2) includes all possible two-way, three-way and

the four-way interactions among these state and federal target and implementation variables (i.e.,

FED_TARGETi, YEAR2010, ST_TARGETis, and ST_POLICYst), with redundant terms omitted

to avoid perfect co-linearity.2 In these models, two of the cj coefficients are used to generate DD

estimators identifying ACA policy impact. First, the coefficient on the interaction of the

variables indicating federal eligibility and implementation (i.e., FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010) is

the DD estimator measuring the policy impact on young adults eligible for dependent coverage

under federal rules but not eligible under any state law. Next, the coefficient on the four-way

interaction between federal and state eligibility and policy indicators (i.e.,

FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010*ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst) measures how the ACA‚Äôs policy

impact differs for young adults who were eligible both under prior state expansions and the

federal expansion relative to those eligible under the federal expansion only. The sum of these

two coefficients represents the incremental effect of the ACA‚Äôs dependent coverage expansion

on those who are jointly targeted by federal and prior state policies simultaneously.

       As a robustness check, we estimate a third set of models (Model 3) that is limited to

residents of 18 states and the District of Columbia that did not enact dependent coverage reforms

prior to the ACA. These models test the impact of the ACA without the potential complicating

influence of state reforms. Although similar to the Model 1 described above, this specification

avoids the need for state target population and policy implementation variables and associated

interaction terms. In addition, because the availability of dependent coverage might affect young



                                                  10
adults‚Äô decisions about whether to enroll as full-time students, we conducted tests of the

sensitivity of our Model 1 results to the inclusion of student variables and the exclusion of full-

time students ages 19-23 from our models (Models 4 and 5, respectively). Finally, we confirm

our results by estimating a ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù model without data for coverage year 2010 that falsely

assumes that the ACA was implemented in 2009 (Model 6).

        All regression models control for non-policy factors that could affect coverage trends.

Specifically, the models include individual-level variables Xkit (indexed by variable k for person

i in year t) in order to adjust for age, sex, race and ethnicity, student status, marital status, living

with a parent, household income as a percentage of the federal poverty line, and perceived health

status. For each state and year, the models also include state-level variables Zrst (indexed by

variable r for state s in year t) that include the unemployment rate (to adjust for state trends in

economic conditions), the percentage of private sector employees working in establishments that

offer health insurance coverage (to adjust for the likelihood that parents of young adults have

employer group coverage), and the proportion of all enrollees in private group coverage that are

in employer self-insured plans (to adjust for the extent to which self-insured plans are subject to

the ACA but not state laws).

        The models also include state and year fixed effects (represented by summations of

respective state and year variables with their associated coefficients in the regression equation

above) as well as overall and state-specific linear time trends to adjust for unobserved factors

that vary by time and within states over time. Finally, eist represents a stochastic error term.


Estimation

        All analyses employ population weights provided by the Census Bureau and adjust

standard errors for the CPS complex sample design following Davern et al. (2007). Linear


                                                   11
probability models are fit to produce coefficients that are direct estimates of the relevant policy

impacts and are easily interpreted as percentage point changes in coverage outcomes. This

approach has been applied in earlier evaluations of insurance market reforms (Monheit et al.

2011; Levine, McKnight, and Heep 2011; Monheit and Steinberg Schone 2004; Buchmueller and

DiNardo 2002). It also avoids complications associated with estimation and interpretation of

multiple interaction terms and their standard errors in logit or probit models (Ai and Norton

2003).

         All models account for the complex survey design of the CPS using ‚Äúsvy‚Äù procedures in

STATA 12MP. In Model 2, the overall incremental effect of the ACA‚Äôs dependent coverage

expansion on individuals jointly eligible for state and federal expansions is calculated as the sum

of two regression coefficients. The standard error for this estimated sum is based on a Wald

statistic for complex survey regression (Korn and Graubard, 1990). This Wald statistic is

calculated using the ‚Äúlincom‚Äù procedure in Stata.

         Although coefficient estimates in the linear probability model are unbiased and

consistent, this model is often subject to the problem of heteroskedasticity, which leads to

downward biased estimates of standard errors and can overstate the statistical significance of

estimated coefficients (Pindyck and Rubinfeld, 1998). Although tests of heteroskedasticity are

not available in the context of regression analysis with complex survey data, we tested the

robustness of our findings by using ordinary regression models with ‚Äúrobust‚Äù standard errors that

are insensitive to heteroskedasticity (Huber 1967; White 1980). (However, these ordinary

regression models do include weights to account for differential probability of selection into the

CPS.) We find that these heteroskedasticity-robust models produce results that are nearly

identical to those reported in the main text and shown in detail below.


                                                 12
Results

       The unadjusted percentage of young adults in the ACA target population with non-

spousal dependent coverage rose by six percentage points between 2009 and 2010 (Table 2).

This nearly one-third increase is statistically significant (p<0.01) and represents a growth of 1.2

million young adults with non-spousal dependent coverage. The non-targeted control group

showed virtually no growth in non-spousal dependent coverage over this period. We also

observe a significant but smaller decline (decrease of 2.4 percentage points) in the number of

uninsured young adults in the ACA target group in 2010. This decline reverses the trend

between 2008 and 2009, when the number of uninsured targeted young adults increased by a

significant 3.0 percentage points. The share of the non-targeted comparison group that was

uninsured also increased significantly between 2008 and 2009 but remained flat in 2010. The

percentage of individuals in both the targeted and comparison groups with private coverage in

their own name or that of a spouse fell during the recession of 2008 to 2009. This rate also

declined in 2010 for targeted young adults, although at a slower rate than in the prior year, while

the corresponding rate for the comparison population remained fairly steady.

       These simple tabulations do not adjust for possible shifts in the characteristics of the

study population during the study period, the circumstances in which they live, or underlying

economic forces. The Great Recession may have had differential impacts on the targeted young

adults and the older comparison group. For example, according to the CPS, the share of targeted

young adults living with their parents rose by 17.8% between 2005 and 2010 (from 37.1% to

43.7%), while the share of our comparison group living at home was lower but grew more

sharply, by nearly a third (from 13.3% to 17.2%). Since the likelihood of being covered on a




                                                 13
parent‚Äôs plan is higher for those living with parents (data not shown), this shift underscores the

importance of adjusting for underlying trends in analysis of ACA impact.

        Table 3 compares characteristics of the ACA-eligible to the older comparison group. All

of the differences in this table are statistically significant, although few are of substantial

magnitude. Notably, but not surprisingly, comparison group members are more likely to be

married, to have completed a bachelors or advanced degree, and to have higher income as a

percentage of the federal poverty level. The young adults in the ACA target population, on the

other hand, are more likely to live with a parent and to be eligible for dependent coverage under

a state law than their older counterparts.

Econometric Results

        Like the descriptive findings, our econometric models show a large and statistically

significant impact of the ACA dependent coverage reform. Difference-in-differences estimates

from the Models 1 and 2 are shown in Table 4 (detailed results available from the authors).

Percentage point changes in the first column of results in the table (Model 1) represent the

overall change in young adult coverage in 2010. While eligibility for state reforms are controlled

for in Model 1, this model does not distinguish the effect of the ACA from possible contributions

of prior state laws for young adults eligible for both. This model shows a statistically significant

5.3 percentage point increase in non-spousal dependent coverage accompanied by a significant

3.5 percentage point decline in the uninsured rate among young adults eligible for expanded

dependent coverage under the ACA. In this specification, we also find a statistically significant

decline of 2.1 percentage points in own-name or spousal coverage among targeted young adults.

This decline may indicate that some individuals substituted dependent coverage for other forms




                                                   14
of private insurance, although the decline in the share of the population uninsured indicates that

many of those gaining dependent coverage did not switch from other sources.3

       The second and third columns of results in Table 4 provide DD estimates from models

with full sets of interactions between state and federal reforms allowing us to separate federal

and state policy effects (Model 2). The DD estimators in the second column measure changes in

coverage in the population of young adults targeted for dependent coverage under both the ACA

and prior state reforms (i.e., the sum of coefficients described above), and estimates in the third

column show the impact of the ACA on the population targeted by the federal expansion alone.

The estimate of growth in non-spousal dependent coverage for the latter group (4.5 percentage

points) is consistent with, but lower than, the estimate from the Model 1 that does not include

state and federal policy interactions (5.3 percentage points). The estimates of impact on the

uninsured rate in these two models differ little (declines of 3.8 and 3.5 percentage points,

respectively), both showing that the policy is linked to a significant drop in uninsured young

adults. The estimate of private coverage crowd out among those targeted for dependent coverage

under the ACA but not state reforms shown in the third column (2.0 percentage points) is about

the same as the estimate in Model 1 (2.1 percentage points), but does not reach statistical

significance. Our estimate of private insurance crowd out in the population targeted by both

expanded dependent coverage under the ACA and prior state reforms shown in the second

column (1.2 percentage points) is also not statistically significant. None of the models find

crowd out of public coverage.

       The impact of the ACA on young adults who were also targeted under prior state reforms

is shown in the second column of Table 4 (8.7 percentage points) appears to be about twice as

great as the estimated impact in the population eligible under only the ACA in column three (4.5



                                                 15
percentage points). While the magnitude of estimates of the incremental impact on dependent

coverage and the likelihood of being uninsured for those targeted under both federal and state

reforms is large, the difference between these estimates shown in the second and third columns

under Model 2 does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (p=0.068 and

p=0.173, respectively).

Sensitivity Analysis

       Results of sensitivity tests are presented in Table 5. The first set of results (Model 3) is

limited to residents of states that did not enact dependent coverage expansions. The DD

coefficients from these models, and their levels of statistical significance, are nearly identical to

those estimated for the state-ineligible population in Model 2 shown in Table 4. This test

confirms that the ACA increased dependent coverage and reduced the number of uninsured

among targeted young adults apart from any potentially confounding state expansion effects.

       To test whether our models are sensitive to inclusion of student variables, we examined

an alternative specification of Model 1 that excluded these variables (Model 4) and another that

included full-time students ages 19 to 23 in the target population (Model 5). In both cases, our

findings of policy impact did not change (Table 5). We did find a somewhat smaller, but still

statistically significant, increase in non-spousal dependent coverage in the model including full-

time students, although this was expected as this group is unaffected by the policy change.

Finally, we also tested the robustness of our model by conducting a ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù regression without

2010 data and assuming that the ACA was implemented in 2009 (Model 6, Table 5). If our

finding of policy impact was an artifact of our model specification, this model would likely show

a false significant policy impact. It did not, reinforcing our confidence in the validity of our

model specification.

Discussion

       Our analysis shows that the ACA dependent coverage expansion led to a rapid and

substantial increase in the share of young adults with dependent coverage and a reduction in their

uninsured rate in the early months of implementation. Although the requirement to offer

coverage to young adults was effective with the first plan renewal starting in late September

2010, favorable tax treatment of premiums was extended to young adults up to age 26 starting in

March, encouraging early adoption. In fact, some employers and insurers were reported to have

begun enrollment of dependents shortly after ACA enactment in March 2010 (USDOL, EBSA

n.d.). In models controlling for prior state expansions, but without interactions between state and

federal reforms (Model 1), we attribute to the ACA dependent coverage rules a more than 25%

rise in the share of targeted young adults with non-spousal dependent coverage (a 5.3 percentage

point increase) and a nearly 10% drop in their uninsured rate (a 3.5 percentage point decline)

between 2009 and 2010. This decline in the uninsured translates to about 716,000 young adults

gaining coverage as a result of the ACA in 2010.

       Our findings indicate that response to the ACA dependent coverage rule change was very

rapid following its implementation date of September 23, 2010. Rapid enrollment may have

been encouraged by high public awareness of the ACA dependent coverage rules. As early as

April 2010, fully 70% of the public reported knowing about these rules (KFF 2010). The weak

economy may also have spurred dependent coverage take up by disproportionately limiting

young adults‚Äô access to coverage through their own jobs.

       In contrast to studies of earlier state young adult reforms (Monheit et al. 2011; Levine,

McKnight, and Heep 2011), our results do not suggest that the increase in coverage of young



                                                17
adults as dependents occurred at the cost of a decline in other forms of private coverage. If prior

state laws had effectively led to more young adults in dependent coverage, then we would have

expected a more modest policy impact of the ACA on that group in 2010. To the contrary,

findings from our models including interactions between federal and prior state reforms suggest

(without achieving conventional levels of statistical significance) that take-up of dependent

coverage in 2010 may have been greater among those who were targeted by a state expansion. It

may be that the state reforms ‚Äúprimed the pump‚Äù for rapid take-up under the federal rules. We

note that our measure of eligibility for state reforms does not account for parental coverage status

and thus overstates actual young adult eligibility. Nevertheless, the state laws may have raised

awareness of the possibility of dependent coverage even among young adults ineligible under

restrictive state laws. This possibility is corroborated by reports of state regulators hearing

frequently from frustrated consumers who were ineligible for state expansions due to employer

self-insurance or other eligibility limitations prior to the ACA (Cantor et al. 2012). If the

‚Äúpriming‚Äù hypothesis is correct, take-up among ACA-targeted young adults who were not

eligible under prior state laws will likely grow substantially over time.

       Information available in the CPS places some limitations on our analysis. We were not

able to directly observe the timing of insurance changes because the CPS employs an annual

reference period for coverage questions. Moreover, CPS respondents are asked about coverage

in March following each calendar year reference period, making its recall period as long as 15

months, raising the possibility of recall bias. Analysts have suggested that some respondents

may report coverage status after the close of the reporting year (i.e., between January and March)

(Pascale 2007). If this occurred, we may have overstated the impact of the dependent coverage




                                                 18
reform in 2010 especially if the high salience of the new ACA rules led to reporting differences

between eligible young adults and comparison group members.

       The CPS also does not provide information about parents‚Äô insurance coverage or other

characteristics except when young adults live with their parents, so we could not systematically

adjust for the availability of parental coverage. We compensate for this gap by controlling at the

state level for the rate of employer-sponsored coverage and employer self-insurance. Moreover,

our models adjust for unmeasured differences among states and over time by including state and

time fixed effects and controls for state-specific time trends.



Conclusions

       We find that the ACA dependent coverage rules led to a rapid and large reduction in the

number of uninsured young adults. Thus, coverage of young adults on parents‚Äô health plans is

likely to be an important feature of the health insurance landscape well into the future. The

benefits of this new reality to young adults and their families are clear, but this trend is not

without costs. In particular, family premiums will increase as more young adults are enrolled.

Further, in 2014 when the ACA individual coverage mandate takes effect and the limited anti-

crowd out provisions in the ACA will end, the availability of dependent coverage may attract

comparatively healthy young adults, leaving non-group plans with higher average risk and

premiums. Such a shift may also increase the cost of health insurance tax credits available

through health benefit exchanges. In addition, businesses that employ primarily young adults

may become less likely to offer coverage as fewer young workers seek their own health benefits.

Still, the ACA young adult dependent coverage expansion represents a rare public policy success

in the effort to cover the uninsured.

1
    We treat 30 states as having implemented reforms for the purpose of this analysis. We exclude

several states listed by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL 2010) as having

dependent coverage legislation (Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Tennessee, and Wyoming) because

these reforms either established dependent age thresholds at conventional levels (e.g., age 23 for

full-time students) or are limited to dependents with work-related disabilities. We also exclude

Nebraska because its 2010 expansion was limited to children ‚Äúaging out‚Äù of standard dependent

coverage, thus few would be eligible during our study period and we could not precisely

determine their eligibility.

2
    Specifically, the term ST_TARGETis*FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010 is not included in Model 2

because it is perfectly co-linear with ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst*FED_TARGETi*YEAR2010,

and the term ST_TARGETis*YEAR2010 is not included because it is perfectly co-linear with

ST_TARGETis*ST_POLICYst*YEAR2010.

3
    The CPS asks about coverage for the entire prior calendar year, thus, if properly answered, the

negative coefficient on own-name and spousal coverage following ACA implementation should

not be interpreted as indicating substitution of dependent for other sources of coverage.

However, as discussed below, many analysts believe that respondents may not accurately recall

coverage over the course of the full year. If this is the case, the negative coefficient on non-

dependent private coverage may indicate partial substitution.
