                                              ABSTRACT

The ongoing fragmentation of work has resulted in a narrowing of tasks into smaller pieces that can
be sent outside the organization and, in many instances, around the world. This trend is shifting the
boundaries of organizations and leading to increased outsourcing. Though the consolidation of volume
may lead to productivity improvement, little is known about how this shift toward outsourcing influences
learning by providers of outsourced services. When producing output, the content of the knowledge
gained can vary from one unit to the next. One dimension along which output can vary —a dimension
with particular relevance in outsourcing—is the end customer for whom it is produced. The performance
benefits of such customer experience remain largely unexamined. We explore this dimension of volume-based
learning in a setting where doctors at an outsourcing firm complete radiological reads for hospital
customers. We examine more than 2.7 million cases read by 97 radiologists for 1,431 customers and
find evidence supporting the benefits of customer-specific experience accumulated by individual radiologists.
Additionally, we find that variety in an individual’s customer experience may increase the rate of individual
learning from customer-specific experience for a focal task. Finally, we find that the level of experience
with a customer for the entire outsourcing firm also yields learning and that the degree of customer
depth moderates the impact of customer-specific experience at the individual level. We discuss the
implications of our results for the study of learning as well as for providers and consumers of outsourced
services.

Abstract
The ongoing fragmentation of work has resulted in a narrowing of tasks into smaller pieces that can be
sent outside the organization and, in many instances, around the world. This trend is shifting the
boundaries of organizations and leading to increased outsourcing. Though the consolidation of volume
may lead to productivity improvement, little is known about how this shift toward outsourcing influences
learning by providers of outsourced services. When producing output, the content of the knowledge
gained can vary from one unit to the next. One dimension along which output can vary —a dimension
with particular relevance in outsourcing—is the end customer for whom it is produced. The performance
benefits of such customer experience remain largely unexamined. We explore this dimension of volume-
based learning in a setting where doctors at an outsourcing firm complete radiological reads for hospital
customers. We examine more than 2.7 million cases read by 97 radiologists for 1,431 customers and find
evidence supporting the benefits of customer-specific experience accumulated by individual radiologists.
Additionally, we find that variety in an individual’s customer experience may increase the rate of
individual learning from customer-specific experience for a focal task. Finally, we find that the level of
experience with a customer for the entire outsourcing firm also yields learning and that the degree of
customer depth moderates the impact of customer-specific experience at the individual level. We discuss
the implications of our results for the study of learning as well as for providers and consumers of
outsourced services.

Key Words: Customer specificity, Experience, Healthcare, Learning, Outsourcing

1. Introduction

      The division of labour, by reducing every man's business to some one simple operation, and by
      making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much the dexterity
      of the workman — Adam Smith (1776: Section I.1.6).

        As noted by Adam Smith (1776) the division of labor has served as a central driver of economic

progress. Through increased specialization, individuals and organizations gain knowledge, enabling

performance improvement and innovation (Skinner 1974; Newell and Rosenbloom 1981; Argote 1999).

The trend toward specialization has been bolstered by institutional and technological change. With respect

to the former, the opening of previously closed economies such as Brazil, China, and India have flooded

the global labor markets with low-cost talent (e.g., Arora et al. 2001). In terms of the latter, innovations in

information and communication technologies have created the opportunity to divide work into smaller

pieces and send it around the world to be completed (Zuboff 1988; Autor, Levy and Murnane 2002).

        This increasing atomization of work has also reshaped the boundaries of the firm (Levy and

Murnane 2004; Levy 2008; Malone, Laubacher and Johns 2011). In a wide variety of settings, from

manufacturing to call centers and software services to healthcare services a number of tasks that were


                                                      2
Learning from Customers

once done within a focal firm are now contracted out to external service providers. Work may be

outsourced for many reasons, but one of the key rationales is to take advantage of the expertise that

outsourcers build through volume-based learning (Huckman, Staats and Upton 2009; Narayanan,

Balasubramanian and Swaminathan 2009). This idea draws on the concept of the learning curve (Yelle

1979; Argote 1999; Lapré and Nembhard 2010), as outsourcers can combine volume from multiple

customers to build experience and thus improve their productivity.

           Not only is outsourcing increasing, in part due to the opportunities for volume-based learning, but

outsourcing is also changing the industrial landscape in ways that affect how we conceptualize the study

of learning. Prior studies of organizational learning highlight that the knowledge gained can vary

dramatically from one unit of output to the next based on the characteristics of the work being done

(Mishina 1999; Lapré, Mukherjee and Wassenhove 2000; Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011). This tradition

of work has highlighted the important, but largely distinct, roles of intraorganizational learning (e.g.,

Argote and Ophir 2002) and interorganizational learning (e.g., Ingram 2002). While intraorganizational

learning has focused on “internal” dimensions that are independent of things outside the firm (e.g.,

number of units the organization produced, how teams are organized, etc.), interorganizational learning

has centered on “external” dimensions (e.g., competitors’ experience).

           Outsourcing provides a context in which internal and external distinctions are increasingly

blurred. For example, as noted previously, outsourcing offers the promise of combining experience from

multiple customers to increase aggregate volume. Therefore, a key dimension upon which a unit of output

can vary is the end customer to whom it is delivered. However, customer experience—the experience

gained with a focal customer—is both an internal dimension (e.g., individual or firm experience gained)

and an external dimension (e.g., exposure to a variety of customers).1 Though the increased use of

outsourcing has led to a rise in the number of customer-supplier interactions, the learning benefits of

customer experience remain largely unexamined. An important exception is Ethiraj et al. (2005), which

1
 We emphasize that our use of the term “customer experience” refers to experience that a service provider (either an individual or an
organization) gains with a focal customer rather than experience that has been accumulated by that customer outside of its relationship with the
service provider.

                                                                        3
Learning from Customers

theorizes about, but finds limited evidence of, learning from customer experience in outsourced software

projects.

        Why might customer experience be an important determinant of learning in service contexts? Due

to the interdependent nature of services, the customer and outsourced provider must interact to

“coproduce” service output (Larsson and Bowen 1989). By repeatedly interacting with the same customer

an individual may learn the customer’s standard operating procedures (March and Simon 1993; Boone,

Ganeshan and Hicks 2008), improve her communication and mutual adaptation with the customer (Arrow

1974; Weber and Camerer 2003; Ko, Kirsch and King 2005), and learn or transfer new knowledge from

the customer (Simonin 1997; Inkpen and Tsang 2007). Therefore, our first area of exploration examines

customer learning at the level of individual workers.

        In addition to examining the overall effect of individual customer learning, we also consider a key

factor that may affect the rate at which individuals learn from focal customer experience – an individual’s

variety of experience across customers. Drawing on recent work examining learning from varied

experience (i.e., related, but different from the focal task, Schilling et al. 2003; Narayanan et al. 2009;

Staats and Gino 2012), we consider how experience with other customers may affect an individual’s rate

of learning with respect to a focal customer. In particular, while prior work does not examine customer

experience, its underlying theory suggests that varied experience may have a complementary effect

whereby individuals use knowledge gained across areas (in this case, customers) to learn at a faster rate

(Hargadon and Sutton 1997; Haunschild and Sullivan 2002; Clark and Huckman 2012). Thus, we ask

whether greater variety in the customers with whom an individual works increases her rate of learning

from customer-specific experience.

        In addition to examining customer learning at the individual level, it is necessary to account for

the fact that learning can occur at the level of either the individual or organization (Walsh and Ungson

1991; Kim 1993; Argote and Ingram 2000; Reagans, Argote and Brooks 2005). Therefore, we add to our

analysis an examination of the effect of organizational customer experience. Finally, although individual

and organizational customer experience may each have independent effects on individual performance, it

                                                        4
Learning from Customers

is not clear whether and how they interact to affect performance. This question is important because prior

theory suggests that the two types of experience could have a complementary or a substitutive effect on

individual performance – in other words, the total effect from individual and organizational customer

experience could be greater (a complementary effect) or less (a substitutive effect) than the sum of its

individual effects. A complementary effect is possible as individual customer experience could build

absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Lubatkin, Florin and Lane 2001; Inkpen and Tsang 2007)

that helps an individual make better use of the organization’s knowledge. Further, greater organizational

knowledge may increase the learning an individual gleans from each unit of customer experience as she

becomes better able to connect different pieces of information to gain a causal understanding of a

situation (Bohn 2005; Bohn and Lapré 2011). Alternatively, the effect may be substitutive to the extent

that individual and organizational experience both capture the same underlying knowledge about a

customer (Walsh and Ungson 1991; Argote and Ingram 2000) or an individual with more experience

becomes more likely to ignore or not use the knowledge of others (Weiss, Suckow and Rakestraw Jr

1999; Schwab 2007). Therefore, our final area of exploration considers whether and how customer

experience at the individual level interacts with that at the organizational level to affect individual

performance. That is, are these two types of customer experience complements or substitutes?

        Likely one of the reasons that customer experience has received little attention in the academic

literature is that finding an appropriate research setting is quite difficult. An ideal setting includes not only

individuals working for many customers, outcome measures that can be tied clearly to individuals, and a

panel of sufficient length to exhibit learning, but also an unbiased data-generation process for matching

employees with customers (e.g., a process that does not assign better or faster workers to repeat

customers). The setting for this paper, outsourced teleradiology, permits us to address each of these

issues. Our data include information from July 2005 through December 2007 on 2,766,209 cases for

1,431 customers read by 97 radiologists working at OutsourceCo (a pseudonym), one of the largest

teleradiology firms in the US. Further, as we detail later, OutsourceCo’s computer-based algorithm for

assigning work reduces concerns about non-random assignment biasing our empirical estimates.

                                                       5
Learning from Customers

        In the next section, we motivate our hypotheses. We then describe the details of our empirical

setting, introduce our data, and discuss our empirical results. Finally, we offer concluding remarks.

2. Customer Experience and Learning

        That greater cumulative experience leads to improved performance – the learning curve – is one

of the more robust phenomena in the study of organizations (Yelle 1979; Argote 1999; Lapré 2011). This

relationship has been identified at several levels of analysis – individuals, teams, and firms (e.g., Newell

and Rosenbloom 1981; Argote, Beckman and Epple 1990; Pisano, Bohmer and Edmondson 2001).

Despite the importance of the volume of cumulative experience, recent work suggests that the specific

traits of individual units of experience need to be considered in determining their contribution to learning

(Mishina 1999; Lapré et al. 2000; Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011). In the next section we explore why

one of these traits—the customer to whom a service is provided—may prove important in determining

learning and performance in a focal task.

2.1. Customer Experience for Individual Providers

        In settings such as outsourced services, where tasks are completed for many different customers,

working with a specific customer may lead to better performance due to improved coordination and

knowledge transfer. With respect to coordination, due to the interdependent nature of services, the

customer and outsourced provider must interact to “coproduce” many services (Larsson and Bowen

1989). For example, in outsourced radiology, a technician at a hospital takes the image while a doctor at

the hospital requests that the outsourced radiologist read the image (and may provide specific, written

instructions with the read request) and the actions of both of these individuals at the customer affect the

outsourced radiologist’s ability to complete her work.

        Generalizing this example from our setting, one finds several reasons why repeated interaction

with a given customer may improve an individual’s ability to provide outsourced services to that

customer. First, repeated experience with a customer may provide an outsourcer with insight into that

customer’s standard operating procedures and may allow more efficient execution of work (March and


                                                     6
Learning from Customers

Simon 1993; Boone et al. 2008). Second, different organizations often use varying language to describe

similar phenomena (Arrow 1974; Weber and Camerer 2003; Ko et al. 2005). As an individual provider

gains experience with a specific customer, she may be better able to communicate with employees at that

customer (in addition to any specific individuals with whom she may work repeatedly), aiding in the

transfer of knowledge (Szulanski 1996; 2000). In our empirical setting such improved communication is

likely to manifest itself in written messages, rather than verbal ones. Prior work highlights the challenge

in successfully coding and decoding written messages (Arrow 1974). Third, given that customers are

often reticent to share information with an outsourced provider (Metiu 2006), repeated interaction may

increase trust and build relationship-specific capital (Uzzi 1997; Lubatkin et al. 2001; McEvily, Perrone

and Zaheer 2003). Again, this effect could occur between an individual at the outsourced provider and an

individual at the customer as they work together; or more generally when an individual at the outsourced

provider works with multiple people at a customer. For example, with repeated experience a referring

physician may be more likely to include additional information in the request that is sent to the radiologist

(such as guidance on the specific anatomy to examine). These latter two points—communication and

information sharing—are particularly salient in outsourced radiology where the coordination between

parties may not be sequential, but rather reciprocal (i.e., requiring ongoing, mutual adjustments,

Thompson 1967; Argote 1982), across multiple reads.

        While theory suggests that prior experience with a customer may improve coordination and

knowledge transfer, it is not clear if this theory will translate to the teleradiology context we study, and to

outsourcing more generally. A common claim is that activities that are ideal candidates for outsourcing

are “commoditized”, thus suggesting that aspects such as customer characteristics, should not impact the

relationship between experience and performance. Commoditized activities tend to be well-specified, or

codified, which allows clear contracts to be written between outsourcers and customers and allows

process and product specifications to be transferred easily between those parties. For example, clear

standards can be set for the formulation of chemical compounds or the assembly of cellular phones, both

of which are activities that are often outsourced.

                                                      7
Learning from Customers

        In contrast to this view, Steinbrook (2007) suggests that experience with a customer may play a

significant role in determining teleradiology performance, noting:

        Physicians may be less likely to know the radiologists who read their patients’ studies,
        and there may be more opportunities for miscommunication and misunderstandings. A
        teleradiologist will often have no information about the patient beyond that contained in
        the study requisition.

Wachter (2006) in quoting the CEO of one of the largest teleradiology firms, echoes this perspective in

describing how even in teleradiology, as compared to on-site interpretation, the radiologist and doctor

interaction is maintained: “‘You can’t reach over and slap [the radiologist] on the back, but every other

aspect of the interaction is preserved.’”

        The claim that radiological interpretation benefits from familiarity with referring physicians (i.e.,

customers) suggests that there may be significant benefits derived from customer experience in a

teleradiology setting. To examine fully the customer specificity of individual experience, however, it is

necessary to consider an additional dimension of experience. Namely, just as it is possible to gain

customer experience, it is also possible to gain experience specific to a given knowledge domain. Prior

work studying software development finds evidence for such domain specificity (Boh, Slaughter and

Espinosa 2007; Kang and Hahn 2009). In some cases, the choice of domain may limit activity to a

specialized population of workers. For instance, an individual suffering from cancer in the brain is likely

to visit a neurologist or neurosurgeon, while an individual suffering from prostate cancer will visit a

urologist. In many other contexts, however, the same worker may complete the activity regardless of the

domain examined. For example, in this study a unit of output is a radiological read, which many

radiologists can perform regardless of whether the study was conducted on different body parts such as

the head, pelvis, or abdomen.

        Customer-domain experience may have a greater effect on individual performance than does

customer experience in other domains (though we expect both to have a greater effect on performance

than the final category of experience with other customers). Different domains have domain-specific

terminology and practices. These practices may vary across hospitals making the customer-domain


                                                     8
Learning from Customers

experience most relevant for performance for a focal task. Further, given the need for domain

specialization most hospitals are divided according to domain. For example, the department of cardiology

has primary responsibility for heart conditions, and the department of orthopedics is tasked with

musculoskeletal issues. Therefore, when executing tasks for a given customer-domain combination, an

individual radiologist in our sample is likely to work with the same sub-group of referring physicians

within a hospital and build the important ties mentioned above. Given all of these factors, we offer the

following related hypotheses:

        HYPOTHESIS 1a:             An individual’s customer, domain experience has a more positive effect
                                   on performance of a focal task than experience gained from the same
                                   customer in different domains.

        HYPOTHESIS 1b:             An individual’s customer, domain experience has a more positive effect
                                   on performance of a focal task than experience gained from all other
                                   customers.2

2.2 Variety in Individual Customer Experience

        Hypothesis 1 details why we expect customer-specific experience to have a greater effect on

individual performance than all other experience. In addition to understanding the main effect of customer

experience on individual performance, related work on specialization and variety in task experience (Boh

et al. 2007; Narayanan et al. 2009) suggests that it is important to examine also the interaction effects of

different types of experience (Clark and Huckman 2012; Staats and Gino 2012). In other words, although

specialized experience (in our case, customer experience) may have a greater direct effect than varied

experience on individual performance of a focal task, varied experience may prove useful in increasing

the learning derived from specialized experience (Lapré and Nembhard 2010).

        There are several reasons why varied experience (in this case, the distribution of experience

across other customers) may increase an individual’s rate of learning from customer experience in the

focal task. When working for different customers, an individual may identify best practices from one

customer that can be transferred to another (Hargadon and Sutton 1997; Bohn 2005; Huckman and Staats

2
 For simplicity and clarity, in the remainder of the paper we refer to an individual’s customer-domain experience
and customer experience interchangeably.

                                                         9
Learning from Customers

2011) or may recognize higher-order principles that affect multiple customers (Schilling et al. 2003; KC

and Staats 2012). Literature on varied experience also suggests, that by working across multiple areas, an

individual may change her learning process by reconsidering underlying assumptions, processing data in

new ways, and searching for deeper, more-causal explanations – all of which may lead to learning at a

faster rate (Piaget 1963; Ellis 1965; Haunschild and Sullivan 2002).

        Alternatively, individual variety in experience may slow individual learning within a focal

customer. For example, greater variety in experience could prove cognitively distracting (cf, Monsell

2003) making it harder for an individual to learn from her present experience. However, prior work

suggests that over time the distraction effects of variety are likely outweighed by its benefits (Staats and

Gino 2012). We therefore hypothesize:

        HYPOTHESIS 2:            Individual variety in customer experience will have a positive,
                                 moderating effect on the relationship between individual customer
                                 experience and the performance of a focal task.

2.3 Customer Experience throughout the Organization

        Although individuals complete tasks in an organization, individuals may also learn from the

experience that the organization accrues (Argote 1999; Reagans et al. 2005; Lapré and Nembhard 2010).

Organizational experience can improve individual performance in multiple ways. With repeated

experience, an organization may develop operating procedures and routines for completing work (Nelson

and Winter 1982). These routines may be captured explicitly in standardized work practices (Staats,

Brunner and Upton 2011) or enterprise information technology systems (Brunner 2009) or, alternatively,

may be captured tacitly in the norms and culture of an organization (Nonaka 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi

1995). Over time the organization may build a capability, defined as the consistent ability to do that

which is intended, out of these routines (Dosi, Nelson and Winter 2000; Hayes et al. 2005).

        Organizational experience may also improve individual performance through better problem

solving. Depending on the setting, an individual may learn by watching others complete the same task

(Bandura 1977; Gino et al. 2010; KC and Staats 2012). Additionally, organizational experience creates a


                                                    10
Learning from Customers

reservoir of knowledge (Walsh and Ungson 1991; Argote and Ingram 2000) and individual members may

be able to draw on that knowledge by seeking the help of others when they encounter difficulties (Lee

1997; Hofmann, Lei and Grant 2009).

        In this study we focus on organizational experience gained with a specific customer. There are

several reasons why this type of experience may aid individual performance. The organization may use

the knowledge gained from its experience to develop focused practices to serve a customer. For example,

in one context, Indian software services, outsourcers often set up offshore delivery centers (ODC) to

execute work for customers (Arora et al. 2001). One objective of an ODC is to capture customer learning

across projects. Also, in contexts where customers are involved in the production of a service (Larsson

and Bowen 1989), for example, healthcare or software, the customer may also learn from its experience

with the outsourcer, changing its own practices to work more effectively. This mutual adaptation may

lead to organizational-level learning from customer experience. Overall, we hypothesize:

        HYPOTHESIS 3:           An organization’s customer experience has a positive effect on individual
                                performance of a focal task.

2.4 Individual and Organizational Customer Experience: Complements or Substitutes?

        As outlined in Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 3, both individual customer experience and organizational

customer experience are likely to have independent beneficial effects on individual learning and

performance. An important and unexamined question is how these two types of experience interact with

one another to affect individual performance. The answer to this question has meaningful theoretical

consequences, in part because theory suggests that individual- and organizational-level customer

experience could be either complements or substitutes.

        The argument in favor of complements rests on the theoretical idea of absorptive capacity – it

often takes one’s own knowledge to utilize fully the knowledge held by others (Cohen and Levinthal

1990). This is because an individual’s existing knowledge helps her not only to identify, acquire, and

understand external knowledge, but also allows her to transform and exploit that knowledge (Mowery and

Oxley 1995; Zahra and George 2002). Through identifying, acquiring and understanding external

                                                   11
Learning from Customers

knowledge, an individual is likely to see a direct effect of organizational experience on individual

performance (Hypothesis 3).

        It is in the transformation and exploitation of external knowledge that the potential

complementarity between individual and organizational customer experience arises. The literature on

alliances finds that absorptive capacity may not be just a general characteristic but also a dyadic one

between two partners (Lane and Lubatkin 1998; Mowery, Oxley and Silverman 2002). Similarly, if an

individual’s customer experience builds absorptive capacity in understanding a customer, that individual

may be better positioned to transform and use the knowledge arising from her organization’s experience

with that same customer (Lubatkin et al. 2001). When an individual completes a task for a customer, she

has an opportunity to learn about that customer. However, learning requires making connections between

different pieces of information to gain a causal understanding of a situation (Bohn 2005; Bohn and Lapré

2011). When completing a task, an individual typically does not have complete knowledge and

understanding of the situation. Therefore, organizational experience with a customer might help fill in

missing information. Further, learning and innovative solutions often arise from combining existing

knowledge in new ways (Fleming and Sorenson 2004). Together, these conditions suggest that individual

and organizational experience with a particular customer can be mutually reinforcing.

        Alternatively, individual- and organizational-level customer experience may act as substitutes. In

other words the joint benefit of individual and organizational experience may be less than the sum of the

two individual effects (Schwab 2007). First, it is possible that the knowledge gained from either

individual or organizational experience may capture the same underlying information. If information is at

least partially redundant, then either type of experience, by itself, could be sufficient to improve

performance (Walsh and Ungson 1991; Argote and Ingram 2000). Second, if adaptation by the customer

is the key driver of learning and improved performance (Lubatkin et al. 2001; Inkpen and Tsang 2007)

then either individual or organizational customer experience could trigger such change, causing individual

and organizational experience to have similar effects on learning. Finally, the salience or increased

understanding from individual knowledge may affect an individual’s use of knowledge held at the

                                                   12
Learning from Customers

organizational level (Levinthal and March 1993). Namely, prior research shows that as an individual has

increased experience, she may be more likely to ignore the knowledge of others (Weiss et al. 1999;

Schwab 2007). Together, these factors suggest that individual and organizational customer experience

may have a substitutive effect on individual performance.

         Given the compelling motivation for either a complementary or substitutive interaction, we

specify competing hypotheses as follows:


         HYPOTHESIS 4A:             Organizational customer experience will have a positive, moderating
                                    effect (complementary interaction) on the relationship between
                                    individual customer experience and the performance of a focal task.

         HYPOTHESIS 4B:             Organizational customer experience will have a negative, moderating
                                    effect (substitutive interaction) on the relationship between individual
                                    customer experience and the performance of a focal task.



3. Setting – Outsourced Teleradiology Services

         Radiology is a medical specialty that involves performing and interpreting imaging studies (e.g.,

x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and nuclear

medicine) to diagnose and treat disease. Historically, both the performance and interpretation of

radiological studies occurred within the boundaries of a single provider organization, such as a hospital or

radiology group practice. During the past decade, however, provider organizations have experienced a

dramatic increase in the volume of radiological studies they perform and, therefore, need to interpret.

Between 1999 and 2004, cumulative growth in the volume of all physician services per Medicare 3

beneficiary was 31%; analogous figures for radiological services, however, were much larger at 62%

across all radiological services, 112% for nuclear medicine, and 140% for non-brain MRI (Steinbrook

2007). This growth is potentially due to several factors, the most prominent being technological

advancements in imaging (Levy and Goelman 2005; Steinbrook 2007) and the practice of “defensive

medicine” to avoid the threat of malpractice liability (Studdert et al. 2005).

        The rapid growth in imaging studies has outpaced growth in the supply of radiologists to read

them. In addition, hospitals, particularly smaller community facilities, are not able to find or afford

employed radiologists to provide “off-hours” coverage for the interpretation of the growing number of

studies performed on an emergency basis. This dual need for additional capacity and 24-hour coverage

has fueled demand for teleradiology—the computerized transmission and interpretation of radiological

studies outside the physical locations in which those studies are conducted. Teleradiology services can be

provided either by a hospital or practice’s employed radiologists (e.g., from their homes outside of

traditional business hours) or by an outsourcer either in the United States or abroad.4 Surveys of over

1,900 radiologist practices indicate that between 2003 and 2007, the percentage of practices outsourcing

some portion of their radiology services nearly tripled from 15% to 44% (Lewis, Sunshine and Bhargavan

2009). It is reasonable to expect that this percentage has grown in recent years due to continued increases

in volume and technological advances in imaging.

        The data for our study were obtained from OutsourceCo, one of the largest U.S.-based providers

of outsourced teleradiology services. OutsourceCo employs radiologists who are board-certified and

licensed to practice radiology in the United States. Approximately 55% of its radiologists are based in the

United States, working from either their homes or one of several reading centers owned by OutsourceCo.

The remainder is based overseas, again working either from home or a reading center. OutsourceCo has

more than 1,400 client sites—mostly hospitals and group radiology practices—across the United States.

        Most of the studies interpreted by outsourced teleradiology providers can be categorized based on

the technology used to generate them. The most common technologies used in these studies are:

  Some of the leading providers of outsourced teleradiology services are NightHawk Radiology, Teleradiology
Solutions, and Virtual Radiologic. All of these companies have radiologists in the United States and most also have
radiologists based in other countries who are able to work during their standard business hours to interpret “off-
hours” studies from the United States. For further discussion of these outsourced models, see Wachter (2006).

   X-ray: The oldest radiologic technology, X-ray involves the use of ionizing electromagnetic radiation

    to view various parts of the human anatomy. X-ray accounts for 4% of OutsourceCo’s case volume.

   Computed tomography (CT): Introduced in the 1970s, CT allows for the generation of three-

    dimensional images of various anatomical regions by combining a series of two-dimensional images

    taken around an axis of rotation. CT accounts for 84% of OutsourceCo’s case volume.

   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): In contrast to X-ray and CT, MRI relies on a magnetic field

    rather than ionizing radiation to generate images of various anatomical regions. In addition to

    reducing exposure to radiation, MRI also provides greater contrast between various soft tissues in the

    body than can be obtained with either X-ray or CT. MRI accounts for 1% of OutsourceCo’s case

    volume.

   Ultrasound: Ultrasound involves the use of high-frequency acoustics to obtain real-time images of

    various parts of the body. It does not involve the use of ionizing radiation and tends to be cheaper and

    more portable than both CT and MRI. One of the most common uses of ultrasound is for routine

    obstetric diagnosis and monitoring. Ultrasound accounts for 10% of OutsourceCo’s case volume.

   Nuclear medicine: Nuclear medicine involves combining radioactive isotopes with other

    pharmaceutical compounds to examine cellular function and physiology. Nuclear medicine accounts

    for 1% of OutsourceCo’s case volume.

    Customers upload studies performed at their hospitals or offices to OutsourceCo’s proprietary system.

Each study is initially processed by an administrative assistant, who assigns it to the queue of an eligible

radiologist who is on duty at that time. For any given study, an eligible radiologist is one who is trained in

the relevant anatomical area (e.g., head, spine, and abdomen) and technology (e.g., CT, MRI, nuclear

medicine). In addition, an eligible radiologist must be licensed to practice medicine in the state—and be a

member of the medical staff of the hospital—where the image was generated. Given these requirements,

the typical radiologist at OutcourceCo is eligible to practice in over 35 states and at more than 400

hospitals. During our study period, more than 90% of OutsourceCo’s radiologists performed reads using

each of the technologies described above. In terms of anatomical specialties, all but one of OutsourceCo’s

                                                     15
Learning from Customers

radiologists performed reads in at least 7 of the 11 possible anatomical areas and 94% performed reads in

at least 10 such areas.5

    Conditional on a radiologist being on duty and appropriately trained and licensed, the assignment of

cases to radiologists is random. A radiologist completing tasks more quickly will have the opportunity to

complete more tasks, but the OutsourceCo system does not assign “more-important” tasks to specific

doctors. Once a case has been read, the radiologist completes a report that is checked for clerical and

administrative completeness by the assistant before being forwarded to the customer.


4. Data and Empirical Strategy

4.1 Data

         Images arriving at OutsourceCo’s central image distribution system are assigned primarily on a

reading radiologist’s current workload relative to her capacity. We note that, within the universe of

customers, domains, and technologies for which a radiologist is eligible to provide services, the customer,

domain, and technology characteristics of an image are not factored into the assignment algorithm. Our

data include information on every radiological image assigned to OutsourceCo radiologists between July

2005 and December 2007. Data include unique identifiers for each radiologist and each ordering

customer; the body part imaged (i.e., domain); the technology used to take the image; and time stamps for

when a case was received and when the radiologist finished reading it. The raw data contains an

observation for each image, though a single case (i.e., one patient) may consist of multiple images. Time

stamps are case specific and not image specific. Accordingly, we are only able to calculate estimated read

times at the case level. To do so, we collapse the image-level observations to case-level observations,

retaining indicators for body location, technology, and number of images in addition to unique identifiers

for the reading radiologist and customer. The resulting data set includes 2,766,209 cases read by 97

radiologists for 1,431 customers over the 30-month period covered by the data.

 Anatomical specialties observed in our dataset include: abdomen, body, brain, breast, cardiovascular, chest,
gastrointestinal/genitourinary, head and neck, musculoskeletal, obstetrics, spine and other.

Learning from Customers

4.2 Dependent Variable

        Our outcome of interest is the length of time it takes a radiologist to read a case (READTIME).

Time to completion is not only a commonly used performance measure in the learning literature (Pisano

et al. 2001; Reagans et al. 2005), but it is also an important measure for operational performance in this

context for both OutsourceCo (which garners greater productivity from its radiologist labor) and its

customers (who receive more timely response for what are often emergency cases). In theory, an

additional performance variable is performance quality; however, only 0.3% of our cases are

characterized by a “discrepancy”. Given this low rate and the fact that many of these discrepancies result

from a need for clarification rather than deficient performance, we are not able to examine quality

performance in this study.

        To calculate READTIME, we rely on information about when each case is received (time in) and

when the radiologist completes the read (time out). Time-in, however, does not necessarily represent

when the radiologist begins reading a case. For example, when a case is assigned to a reading radiologist,

it enters his queue. The radiologist may read his queue in the order received or may choose to rearrange

images to better suit his workflow. Therefore, we make two key assumptions, derived from our

discussions with personnel at OutsourceCo, to calculate READTIME. First, we assume that during a

radiologist’s work shift, time out for the prior case is a reasonable approximation for the start time of the

current case. Radiologists work on cases sequentially and do not start a new case until they have finished

the prior case. Second, we assume that any elapsed time between the time out of the current case and the

time out of the prior case greater than 30 minutes represents a “break” between a radiologist’s shifts. The

30-minute break window was determined based on the data. Specifically, we examined the average and

standard deviation of the difference between the time out of a radiologist’s current read and the time out

of the prior read. The 30-minute cutoff is approximately equivalent to the average plus four standard

deviations. Nevertheless, we examine the robustness of our results to shorter and longer break windows.




                                                     17
Learning from Customers

        Using these assumptions, we partition each radiologist’s list of cases into shifts using the break

window described above. For each radiologist and each shift, cases are ordered by time out and

READTIME is calculated as follows:

    (1) First case of a shift: read time equals time out minus time in

    (2) All subsequent shift cases: read time equals time out for the current case minus time out for the

        prior case

4.3 Independent Variables

        To examine our hypotheses we split the prior experience of individual radiologists into segments

that enable us to estimate the learning benefit of customer-domain experience relative to all other types of

experience. As a baseline model, we divide a radiologist’s prior experience into two categories.

IndvlCustomer represents what we term individual customer experience, the cumulative number of prior

cases read by a radiologist for the customer of the current case. IndvlOtherCustomer represents the

cumulative number of prior cases read by a radiologist for all customers other than the customer of the

current case. We next divided experience within each of the two customer categories by domain to create

four categories of experience. These measures consist of components that are unique to the customer and

the domain, customer but not the domain, domain but not the customer, or neither category. Domains are

defined based on the body-part imaged and are categorized consistent with the subspecialties recognized

by the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America and with the way

radiology departments are organized in typical academic medical centers in the United States. These

categories include: Abdomen, Body (combination images), Brain, Breast, Cardiovascular, Chest,

Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary, Head and Neck, Musculoskeletal, Obstetrical, and Spine.

        Based on these categories, IndvlCustomerDomain represents the cumulative number of prior

cases read by a radiologist in the domain, and for the customer, of the current case; IndvlCustomerOther

Domain represents the cumulative number of prior cases (outside the domain of the current case) read by

a radiologist for the customer, of the current case; IndvlOtherCustomerDomain represents the total

cumulative number of prior cases for a given radiologist that match the domain (e.g., Body, Chest, Spine,

                                                     18
Learning from Customers

etc.), but not the customer, of the current case; and IndvlOtherCustomerOtherDomain represents the

cumulative number of prior cases read by a given radiologist in all domains and for all customers other

than those of the current case. Figure 1 provides an illustration of how these measures relate to one

another. Having constructed these four, collectively exhaustive combinations of customer and domain

experience, we use them to test Hypotheses 1a and 1b.

*********************************[Insert Figure 1] ******************************

        To test Hypothesis 2, we examine the extent to which the experience of a reading radiologist is

distributed across a variety of customers. Specifically, we measure the degree to which a radiologist’s

cumulative volume prior to the current case is concentrated by customer. To do so, we use a Herfindahl-

style index of customer concentration. Thus IndvlCustomerFocus is produced by first measuring, for each

case, the share of that radiologist’s prior volume devoted to each customer. These volume shares are then

squared and summed, producing a measure for which higher values indicate a greater degree of customer

concentration (i.e., less variety). The interaction of this measure with IndvlCustomerDomain allows a test

of Hypothesis 2.

        To test Hypothesis 3, we create a variable, OrgCustomer, which captures the depth of

OutsourceCo’s experience with a particular customer. Specifically, OrgCustomer is the total number of

prior cases a customer has sent to OutsourceCo. To distinguish this variable from the customer experience

of the current reading radiologist (and to facilitate the interactions necessary to test Hypothesis 4), we

subtract the current reading radiologist’s experience with the current customer. Thus, OrgCustomer is the

cumulative number of prior cases the current customer has sent to OutsourceCo, less the current

radiologist’s cumulative experience (across all domains) with that customer. In our models, we examine

this variable in both a linear and discrete form. The discrete form consists of three categories representing

the linear variable split into thirds: OrgCustomer1, OrgCustomer2, and OrgCustomer3. This categorical

version is intended to facilitate the interpretation of the interactions with radiologist experience and to

reduce the correlation present between OrgCustomer and IndvlCustomerDomain (correlation = 0.64).

Specifically, the correlation between IndvlCustomerDomain and OrgCustomer2 and OrgCustomer3 is

                                                     19
Learning from Customers

0.26 and 0.46, respectively. These notably lower levels of correlation increase our confidence that the

thirds of OrgCustomer and the continuous IndvlCustomerDomain are in fact capturing different

characteristics when we interact them to test Hypothesis 4. Table 1 contains summary statistics and

correlations for our key variables of interest.

      *********************************[Insert Table 1] ******************************


4.4 Empirical Models

        To examine the impact of various types of experience on individual performance, we use ordinary

least squares regression to estimate a series of exponential learning curve models. We rely on the

exponential form of the learning curve to examine our hypotheses because as Lapre and Tsikriktsis (2006)

have demonstrated, “for the exponential form, accounting for prior experience is a nonissue—omission of

prior experience will not bias learning-rate estimates.” Given that our data only includes the experience

of radiologists with OutsourceCo between July 2005 and December 2007—and no experience

accumulated prior to that window—the exponential form avoids the bias problem that would arise with

the power form.

Individual Customer Experience

        To test for customer specificity at the individual level (Hypotheses 1a and 1b), we estimate the
following:



                                                                                                        (1)

where        and    are fixed effects for customer h-radiologist i pairings and year t, respectively. The

former captures time-invariant characteristics of customer-radiologist pairs that may influence

READTIMEhijt; the latter captures changes in the average value of READTIMEhijt for the sample over time.

Backlogij represents the number of cases in the queue of radiologist i when reading case j. Xj represents a

vector of characteristics for individual case j, including binary indicators for the technology employed and

the knowledge domain addressed to control for differences in the average read time across these


                                                    20
Learning from Customers

dimensions. The model also includes the number of images for case j to capture the amount of

information     a   reading     radiologist    must    consider     to     complete   the   current   case.

IndvlCustomerOtherDomainhij,              IndvlCustomerDomainhij,              IndvlOtherCustomerDomainij,

IndvlOtherCustomerOtherDomainij and IndvlCustomerFocusij are as described previously, with

IndvlCustomerDomainhij the key variable of interest. Given that negative values of β1, β2, β3 and β4 are

associated with better performance (i.e., shorter read times), Hypothesis 1a predicts that β2 will be less

than β1 and Hypothesis 1b predicts that β2 will be less than β3, and β4.

Organizational Customer Experience

        To test Hypothesis 3 related to the benefits of an organization’s depth of experience with a

particular customer, we examine the following models:


                                                                                                       (2)

                                                                                                       (3)


Where      ,     and Xj are as previously described. In (2), OrgCustomer enters in linear form; in (3), it

enters in discrete thirds (with OrgCustomer1 omitted).

Customer Experience Interactions

        To examine Hypotheses 2 and 4, we interact each segment of the radiologist’s prior customer

experience with either an individuals’ variety of customer experience (IndvlCustomerFocus) or the

customer’s depth of interaction with OutsourceCo (OrgCustomer). This involves merging the variables

from (3) with those from (1) above and creating the appropriate interactions as follows:




                                                                                                             (4)




                                                      21
Learning from Customers

Where      ,    , Xj, Backlogij and each of the key independent variables are as previously described.

Hypothesis 2 predicts that the interactions with focus (the opposite of variety) will have a negative effect

on performance (θ2 > 0, given that positive estimates indicate longer completion time). Hypothesis 4A

predicts that the interactions with the organization’s customer experience will have a positive effect on

performance (θ6 < θ5 < 0), while Hypothesis 4B predicts that these interactions will have a negative effect

on performance (θ6 > θ5 > 0).


5. Results

        Table 2 contains estimates from models testing our four hypotheses. We present baseline

estimates related to overall customer-specific volume in Column 1. The estimate on IndvlCustomer in

Column 1 is in the expected direction and larger in magnitude than the estimate on IndvlOtherCustomer.

However, this estimate is not significant at conventional levels.

        With respect to Hypotheses 1a and 1b, the estimate on IndvlCustomerDomain in Column 2 is

larger in absolute magnitude than any of the other three estimates, and the estimate on

IndvlCustomerDomain is significantly different from each of the other three estimates at conventional

levels (p-values from F-tests are each less than 0.03). This result supports Hypotheses 1a and 1b,

suggesting that individual customer-domain experience is more beneficial, on average, than other types of

experience. Relative to the mean level of customer-domain experience of 43.51, an additional 1,000

cases6 of experience yields a reduction in READTIME of approximately 13.83 seconds. This reduction in

READTIME would result in approximately 54 additional cases read during a typical 40-hour work week, a

7.4% increase in the average weekly volume for a radiologist. This compares to a reduction of

approximately 0.98 seconds from 1,000 additional units of domain experience, and 0.64 seconds from the

same amount of other experience. Consistent with Hypotheses 1a and 1b, these findings suggest that there

is substantial customer-domain specificity in learning at the level of the individual radiologist.

6
 Though this represents a substantial increase from the mean, it is well within the relevant range of customer-
domain experience found in our data. The maximum number of reads in our data set that are customer and domain
specific is 1,430. Moreover, this level of increase makes for a more meaningful comparison to other types of
experience (e.g., IndvlOtherCustomerDomain) for which mean levels are much higher (e.g., 7,579).

*************************************[Insert Table 2]***********************************

        We      also    note      that      the      estimates      on     IndvlOtherCustomerDomain     and

IndvlOtherCustomerOtherDomain suggest that, although increases in both measures significantly

improve individual performance, domain-specific experience is more beneficial than experience with

other domains and other customers (Column 2). An F-test of the difference between these two estimates is

statistically significant (p <0.001). This result empirically supports why subspecialties in radiology are

organized according to specific domains.

        Columns 3 and 4 present models testing Hypothesis 3. Column 3 shows the results of the model

in which OrgCustomer is entered in linear form. The estimate is negative and significant at conventional

levels suggesting that productivity improves across all radiologists the more experience OutsourceCo has

with a particular customer. Specifically, relative to mean levels of OrgCustomer, a customer sending an

additional 1,000 cases to OutsourceCo yields a reduction in READTIME of approximately 3.67 seconds.

Similarly, the estimates in Column 4 suggest that, relative to customers in OrgCustomer1, customers in

OrgCustomer2 and OrgCustomer3 have values of READTIME that are 10.81 and 16.72 seconds faster,

respectively. We note that the estimates for customers in OrgCustomer2 and OrgCustomer3 are

significantly different from each other at conventional levels (p < 0.001). These findings support the

predictions of Hypothesis 3.

        Columns 5 and 7 include estimates testing Hypothesis 2. Specifically, in these models

IndvlCustomerFocus      is     interacted     with     our       customer-specific   experience   variables—

IndvlCustomerDomain and IndvlCustomerOtherDomain—with the IndvlCustomerDomain interaction

constituting the key test of our hypothesis. In Column 5, the OrgCustomer interactions are excluded. We

note that the estimates on the main effect of IndvlCustomerFocus in Columns 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 provide

consistent and significant evidence that variety is beneficial for individual performance, as higher levels

of IndvlCustomerFocus indicate less variety. With respect to the interaction effects, the results in Column

5 suggest that variety has a complementary impact on the effect of customer-specific experience. In other

words, the more variety in a radiologist’s previous experience (lower levels of the focus variable) the

                                                       23
Learning from Customers

stronger is the effect of customer-specific experience on read times. However, while this estimated effect

is significant with respect to the interaction with IndvlCustomerOtherDomain, the interaction with

IndvlCustomerDomain is not significant at conventional levels. Thus, the results in Column 5 do not

provide strong support in favor of Hypothesis 2. We note, however, that in the fully specified model (4) in

Column 7, both interaction estimates that include IndvlCustomerFocus are in the expected direction and

significant at conventional levels. Nevertheless, though the magnitude and significance of the interaction

with IndvlCustomerDomain in Column 7 support Hypothesis 2, the lack of a consistent finding in Column

5 suggests only partial support for Hypothesis 2.

        Finally, Columns 6 and 7 present the results for interactions between individual and

organizational customer experience. In Column 6, the IndvlCustomerFocus interactions are excluded. We

note that the estimates on the radiologist experience variables demonstrate the same pattern seen in

Column 2, with statistically significant differences suggesting strong evidence of radiologist domain

specificity across the full sample and customer-domain-specificity among customers in the first third of

OrgCustomer. We also note that the estimates on IndvlCustomerOtherDomain in Columns 6 and 7 are

significant at conventional levels. The estimates on the main effects of OrgCustomer2 and OrgCustomer3

in Columns 6 and 7 are similar to, though slightly lower in magnitude, than the results presented in

Column 4. Collectively these findings on the main effects in Columns 6 and 7 are consistent with

Hypotheses 1 and 3, suggesting that customer learning takes place at the individual (among relatively new

OutsourceCo customers) and organization levels.

        The key question with respect to Hypothesis 4, however, is whether individual and organizational

customer experience are complements or substitutes. The estimated interactions in Columns 6 and 7

suggest a substitutive effect. Note that the estimated interactions of OrgCustomer with

IndvlCustomerDomain and IndvlCustomerOtherDomain, respectively, in both columns are positive and

follow a moderating pattern. Specifically, these estimates run in the opposite direction of the main effects,

suggesting that the benefit of individual customer experience is diminishing with increasing

organizational customer experience. In the fully specified model in Column 7 the absolute magnitude of

                                                     24
Learning from Customers

the relevant OrgCustomer3 interaction term equals 63 percent of the IndvlCustomerOtherDomain main

effect and 90 percent of the IndvlCustomerDomain main effect. A similar pattern, though slightly smaller

in magnitude, is observed in the interaction with OrgCustomer2. These interaction effects for

IndvlCustomerDomain and IndvlCustomerOtherDomain are significant at conventional levels and support

Hypothesis 4B (over Hypothesis 4A), suggesting that individual customer specificity diminishes as

OutsourceCo gains more experience with a particular customer.

5.1 Robustness

        As with other studies of this nature, our results may be sensitive to the choices we have made in

constructing our variables and selecting our methods. First, as described previously, measuring

READTIME required us to define radiologist shifts by estimating breakpoints based on the elapsed time

between the time out of the prior read and the time out of the current read. We use 30 minutes as the

breakpoint threshold for our base models but also examine the sensitivity of our results to using 20-

minute and 40-minute breakpoints. These results, reported in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3, are similar in

direction, magnitude, and statistical significance to those appearing in Column 7 of Table 2. Further, test

statistics comparing the various estimates in each column in Table 3 for customer specificity are

consistent with those reported above for Table 2. Specifically, the main effect for IndvlCustomerDomain

is   greater    in   absolute    magnitude      than        those   for   IndvlOtherCustomerDomain       and

IndvlOtherCustomerOtherDomain, and both of these differences are significant at the 1% level. In

addition, the main effects for OrgCustomer2 and OrgCustomer3 are consistent in direction, magnitude

and significance with the estimates in Table 2. Finally, the results in Table 3 suggest that customer

specificity is diminishing in the level of OrgCustomer. Collectively, the results in Table 3 suggest that our

base findings are robust to changes in how breaks between shifts are defined.

        Second, our base model includes OrgCustomer entered categorically in thirds. As noted earlier,

this was done in part to reduce the correlation between OrgCustomer and IndvlCustomerDomain. A

second reason for this choice relates to the interpretation of interaction effects. By dividing a linear

variable into categories, or levels, interpretation of its moderating influence on another linear variable is

                                                       25
Learning from Customers

substantially simplified. Nevertheless, our choice to categorize OrgCustomer in thirds may seem

arbitrary. Accordingly, we also examine our base model with OrgCustomer categorized in halves (above

and below median) and quartiles. These results (not shown, but available from the authors) are consistent

with the results from our base model and suggest that our findings are robust to how OrgCustomer is

divided into discrete categories.


6. Discussion and Conclusion

        Though many markets have traditionally been restricted by geography (Baumgardner 1988),

innovations in information and communication technologies have reduced these barriers (Zuboff 1988;

Autor et al. 2002). Given the ability to convert the information on a piece of paper or an image into bits

(e.g., through scanning technology or digital imaging) and send those bits around the world (e.g., via the

internet), the potential market size for certain service providers is increasing; offering the opportunity for

greater specialization. In turn, these effects are leading to more outsourcing (Levy and Murnane 2004;

Levy 2008; Malone et al. 2011) and an increase in arms-length interactions between customers and

suppliers. The experience that arises from these interactions, however, remains understudied.

        Our results highlight the importance of learning curves in interdependent, knowledge-based work.

Further, they suggest that the established relationship between volume and performance that underpins the

learning curve needs to account for the multiple dimensions of experience that can be accumulated (Lapré

and Nembhard 2010; Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011). In particular, we find that both individual and

organizational customer experience aid individual performance. Moreover, we find that experience across

a wider variety of customers may aid the rate at which individuals learn from their own customer-specific

experience. Finally, we find that individual customer specificity is moderated by the depth of the

organization’s experience with a customer, suggesting that individual and organizational customer

experience are substitutes.

        Our findings have important theoretical and managerial implications. At the individual level, we

find that both customer-specific experience and variety across customers have positive effects on


                                                     26
Learning from Customers

individual performance, with the magnitude of the former being significantly greater than that of the

latter. We also find that variety in experience across customers can aid the rate of learning from

customer-specific experience. The caveat is that increasing variety across customers leads to a

simultaneous limiting of the degree to which one can gain customer-specific experience. The question

thus arises as to how one should combine the seemingly contradictory approaches of increasing customer-

specific experience and increasing variety across customers served. Our findings provide insight into this

issue by highlighting that customer specialization and variety may be mutually reinforcing strategies

(Narayanan et al. 2009; Clark and Huckman 2012; Staats and Gino 2012). The implication is that there

may be limits to the benefits of both customer-specific volume and variety across customers, suggesting

the need for an optimal mix of both types of experience. Future work should build on this finding through

the use of field or laboratory experiments to examine the nature of this optimal mix.

        Our findings in an outsourcing context offer important insights into the study of organizational

and individual learning. Prior work on organizational learning highlights the important, but largely

separate roles of interorganizational (e.g., Ingram 2002) and intraorganizational learning (e.g., Argote and

Ophir 2002). The shifting boundaries of firms, however, suggest the need for theory that bridges the

traditional interorganizational-intraorganizational distinction. Beyond the customer-specificity of

individual learning, repetitive interactions with a customer may also lead to knowledge transfer across

firm boundaries that could lead to changes in organizational processes. There is a need for detailed studies

to understand how such learning and knowledge transfer does (or does not) occur and whether these

knowledge transactions can be structured in a way that produces performance benefits comparable to (or

even exceeding) what is possible within a single firm (Nickerson and Zenger 2004). While studies such as

Hansen (1999) and Szulanski (1996) examine the factors that help or hinder knowledge transfer within

the firm, the shifting boundaries of firms offer the opportunity to examine both the cross-firm factors that

lead to knowledge transfer and how those compare to and interact with within-firm factors.

        Our findings also inform the strategic management literature concerning the microfoundations of

organizational capability (Ethiraj et al. 2005; Felin and Foss 2005), where an important question is

                                                    27
Learning from Customers

whether capabilities reside at the level of individuals or the organization as a whole (Staats 2012).

Individuals are the actors who complete most of the work for an organization (Argote and Ingram 2000),

and a large body of work highlights the key role that individual human capital plays in organizational

success (Hatch and Dyer 2004; Hitt et al. 2006). Through norms, systems, and routines, however,

capability may also reside at the level of the organization. This question is not simply important in the

abstract. From a strategic perspective, if customer specificity resides mainly at the level of the individual,

the organization may face difficulty in leveraging its human capital to build a sustainable competitive

advantage (Hatch and Dyer 2004). Instead, employees may capture rents through either salary increases

or moving to a competitor.

        Our results, however, show that capability resides at both levels, as organizational and individual

experience act as substitutes in their effects on performance. Thus although individuals certainly play a

key role in successfully delivering a service—particularly early in a customer’s relationship with the

organization—customer capability may also be built at the level of the organization over time. Future

work should examine the applicability of our framework in other contexts and seek to identify other

dimensions along which experience might meaningfully vary.

        Determining whether customer experience at the individual level is a complement to or substitute

for the same at the organizational level also has meaningful implications for the management of

outsourcing firms. Operationally, minimizing individual customer specificity is preferable because, if

individual workers must be dedicated to a customer, outsourcers lose flexibility in task allocation and face

lower labor utilization. Dedicating particular staff to a small number of customers also might limit variety

in the work of those individuals, which could lead to employee dissatisfaction and eventual turnover

(Fried and Ferris 1987). Our findings suggest that, for new customers, an outsourcing firm may wish to

keep individual providers relatively more focused on serving a specific customer. As organizational

experience accrues with a specific customer, however, such dedication becomes less critical.


6.1. Limitations and Future Research


                                                     28
Learning from Customers

        Despite the robustness of our results, our study faces several limitations. First, we cannot assume

that our findings generalize to other settings. We note, however, that our results are likely relevant for a

wide range of settings that are characterized by an individual performing a varied set of related and

roughly repetitive activities for a range of customers. Similar contexts might include settings in

manufacturing or professional services (e.g., software development, legal, or consulting services).

        Second, despite our efforts to control for time-invariant factors such as individual talent and the

“match” between individual providers and customers, our results may still be subject to concerns of bias

due to remaining sources of endogeneity. Nonetheless, we reiterate that—within pre-defined bounds

based on the range of technologies for which an individual has been trained and the hospitals at which an

individual is able to practice—the assignment of individual cases does not depend on the unobserved

characteristics of cases, customers, or individual radiologists.

        Third, the realities of our data require us to analyze individual and organizational experience

differently. For individual experience, we are able to test for learning from customer experience, as well

as customer specificity. We examine the latter concept by including all types of experience for each

radiologist in the model and testing whether customer-domain experience has a greater effect on learning

than other types of experience. We find that this is the case. For organizational experience, our data only

allow us to test whether learning occurs at the organizational level. Including a variable that captures all

other OutsourceCo experience—which would be required to test for customer specificity at the

organizational level—is not feasible as this variable is highly correlated with other experience variables in

the model and would be akin to adding a variable for calendar time, which is already in our models.

Future work should thus examine whether customer specificity also occurs at the organizational level. In

addition, future work should explore the effect that other employees’ experience with different customers

has on an individual’s performance with a focal customer.

        Fourth, though our study provides accurate measurement of the number of interactions between

an individual radiologist and a customer, we do not observe what takes place during each interaction.

Future work should seek to examine how these interactions can be structured more effectively to improve

                                                      29
Learning from Customers

coordination. For example, Huckman and Pisano (2006) find that an individual’s experience with the

specific assets of his or her employer is important to improving performance (i.e., experience is firm-

specific). They suggest that one source of this firm-specificity may be the familiarity that emerges

between workers within a given firm (Huckman et al. 2009; Staats 2012). Research that examines both

how a radiologist interacts with a customer, as well as how radiologists at a firm interact with each other

could provide valuable additional insight.

        Finally, our results only measure performance in terms of speed rather than clinical outcome or

some other measure of performance quality. This is due to the fact that our data reveal that only 0.3% of

our cases are characterized by a quality “discrepancy” and that many of these discrepancies are simply the

result of a need for clarification rather than deficient performance. This low level of quality problems is

beneficial not only for patients but also for our empirical identification strategy. Specifically, to the extent

that quality is almost uniformly acceptable across all providers in our sample, we are able to use read time

as a measure of performance effectiveness. Future work should explore the effect of customer experience

on quality. For example, outsourcing may lead to unexpected quality challenges, in some settings, as

complex information must often be transmitted and translated across the boundaries of multiple

organizations. While we expect hat our results would hold with quality as a dependent variable, it is an

important topic for further study.

        Even with these potential limitations, our results have significant implications for both the

suppliers and users of outsourced services. For firms that provide outsourced services, we emphasize that

the observed nature of learning implies that staffing decisions should account for multiple dimensions of

experience, such as prior experience with a specific customer, that are often overlooked in settings where

activities are assumed to be “commoditized”. For firms that use outsourced services, our findings suggest

that performance may be improved by efforts to leverage customer experience, particularly early in their

relationship with an outsourcing firm. Such firms, however, should realize that just as such individual

specificity improves performance; it also increases the potential for an outsourcer to “hold up” a customer



                                                      30
Learning from Customers

that becomes reliant on its expertise. Overall, our findings point to the need for future research that

examines the long-term costs and benefits of leveraging the specific nature of experience.


6.2 Conclusion

        Our study follows calls in the academy to go “behind” the learning curve (Adler and Clark 1991;

Argote 1999; Lapré 2011). In particular, we are able to examine how experience accumulation across

multiple-levels in the firm affects individual performance (Hackman 2003) and, in so doing, makes six

contributions. First, we study a type of experience – customer experience – that is both underexamined

and of growing importance. Our setting not only provides us with detailed data to examine multiple

interactions between providers and customers but also provides the “clean” assignment of tasks to

individuals required for us to draw causal inferences from our results. Second, we find evidence of

customer specificity in individual performance. Further, our results also support the concept of domain

specificity in healthcare. Given that not all experience has an equal impact on future performance, it is

important to understand the incremental impact of these various types of experience on performance. Our

results show that specialization in customer experience offers performance benefits for individuals. Future

work should not only examine where experience comes from (e.g., customer) but also the heterogeneity

of the knowledge gained within a particular type of experience (e.g., heterogeneity within a given

customer, Haunschild & Sullivan 2002).

        Third, we find that organizational customer experience leads to improved individual

performance. Because the work of an organization is conducted by individuals, it is important to identify

the distinct impact of customer experience at each of these two levels. Our result at the organizational-

level also offers insight for research on strategic alliances. Prior work on learning in strategic alliances

emphasizes the need to learn about a partner to build a successful alliance (Doz 1996; Arino and Torre

1998) and also highlights the possibility of knowledge transfer and learning from the alliance partner (see

Inkpen and Tsang 2007, for a literature review). Though learning may be possible, it often requires

significant effort on the part of both parties (Teece 1977; Inkpen and Pien 2006). Further, learning from


                                                    31
Learning from Customers

other parties requires that the parties internalize their experience together to convert it into know-how

(Simonin 1997). As noted by Inkpen and Tsang (2007, p. 504), the above stream of research has not

directly examined repeated interactions between partners – the focus of our study.

        Fourth, we find that increasing the variety of customer experience at the individual level may be

related to faster customer-specific learning. Thus, we find that specialization and variety may be

optimally used as mutually reinforcing rather than mutually exclusive strategies (Narayanan et al. 2009;

Clark and Huckman 2012; Staats and Gino 2012; KC and Staats 2012). Fifth, our work speaks to a recent

suggestion that “…[u]nderstanding when different types of experience are complements or substitutes for

one other is an important topic for future research (Argote and Miron-Spektor, 2011, p. 1127).” In

examining customer experience, we find that individual and organizational customer experience are

substitutes in terms of their effects on individual performance—greater organizational experience with a

given customer reduces the importance of customer experience at the individual level. We recognize,

however, that various circumstances (e.g., technology, work practices, structure, culture) might moderate

the relationship between individual and organizational experience. Future work should seek to understand

these factors and how they lead to either a complementary or substitutive relationship.

        Finally, our work offers guidance for both providers and customers in service settings. Namely,

each should be cognizant of the detailed experience profiles of the individuals completing the work.

Increasingly, managers looking to improve performance must focus on the portfolio of experiences gained

not only by their employees, but also by their service providers. Our hope is that unpacking experience

along these lines will help build more accurate theory and generate additional insights for managers.
