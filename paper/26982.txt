Social Distancing, Internet Access and Inequality

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper measures the role of the diffusion of high-speed Internet on an individual's ability to
self-isolate during a global pandemic. We use data that tracks 20 million mobile devices and their
movements across physical locations, and whether the mobile devices leave their homes that day.
We show that while income is correlated with differences in the ability to stay at home, the
unequal diffusion of high-speed Internet in homes across regions drives much of this observed
income effect. We examine compliance with state-level directives to avoid leaving your home.
Devices in regions with either high-income or high-speed Internet are less likely to leave their
homes after such a directive. However, the combination of having both high income and high-
speed Internet appears to be the biggest driver of propensity to stay at home. Our results suggest
that the digital divide---or the fact that income and home Internet access are correlated---appears
to explain much inequality we observe in people's ability to self-isolate.

1        Introduction

Countries across the world are experiencing unparalleled disruption due to the coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic. In order to avoid overburdening the health system, many countries
and regions decided to announce directives that encourage individuals to remain in their
homes. The idea is that policies of social distancing will help stem the spread of a viral
pandemic (Glass et al., 2006). However, as with many forms of governmental interventions,
questions about equity arise. Various commentators in the press speculated that in practice,
remaining at home as a policy is only accessible to those with high income. For example
The New York Times published an article entitled, “White-Collar Quarantine Over Virus
Spotlights Class Divide.”1 This paper highlights that while the debate is focused on income,
much of the observed inequality is explained by differences in the diffusion of high-speed
Internet to homes.
        To investigate this question, we use data from a panel of 20 million mobile devices
provided by a company named Safegraph. Safegraph tracks the location of these devices
after people provide consent for mobile apps to track their precise location over time. This
data allow us to observe when people leave their homes, and when they stay at home for the
entire day. We combine this with data on income levels and Internet use by region from the
Census American Community Survey.
        We show that in February 2020, when the effects of the coronavirus pandemic were not
clear to most people in the US, devices located in high-income regions were more likely
to leave the home. However, in March 2020 this pattern reversed, and remaining at home
became strongly and positively correlated with household income by region. This correlation
disappears when we control for access to high-speed internet. It appears that access to high
speed Internet—and the fact that Internet access at home is correlated with income—explains

                                                 2
much of the observed disparity between high-income and low-income regions.
   We then show that when states enacted directives encouraging people to stay at home,
people living in high-income or high-Internet areas were more likely to increase their propen-
sity to stay at home. We find also that the particular combination of a region having high-
income and having more access to high-speed Internet, leads people to be far more likely to
stay at home. In other words, the combination of high-income and high-Internet diffusion
appears to be a large driver in observed inequality.
   This paper contributes to what we believe will be a large literature that tries to under-
stand the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are already multiple
papers that try to calibrate the likely effect of social distancing measures on the spread of
coronavirus within the US (Greenstone and Nigam, 2020; Stock, 2020; Berger et al., 2020).
Other papers examine recent data from China to try to measure the effect of self-isolation
on the spread of the virus (Fang et al., 2020). By contrast, we investigate the underlying
economic factors that drive an individual’s ability to self-isolate and protect themselves and
the community from the spread of coronavirus.
   Our paper also builds on a literature in digital economics that tries to measure the
relationship between access to the Internet and inequality. Since the early days of the
Internet, concerns existed that access to the Internet might echo or even reinforce existing
sources of inequality (Keller, 1995; Servon, 2008). Early research documented the digital
divide in electronic commerce (Hoffman et al., 2000) and Internet usage (Goldfarb and
Prince, 2008). Since then, there have been some efforts to try to quantify the effects of
certain digital technologies on the rich relative to the poor (Miller and Tucker, 2011; Tucker
and Yu, 2019). We contribute to this literature by being the first paper to our knowledge
that examines whether the relationship between access to the Internet and income affects a
community’s ability to enforce self-distancing. We present evidence that in general, high-
speed Internet penetration helps regions comply with social distancing. However, regions

with both high-speed Internet and high-income are far more likely to stay at home after a
state directive, suggesting that it is the particular combination of high-speed Internet access
and high-income that can exacerbate inequality. This is an unexpected spillover from the
diffusion of the Internet.
        Our paper also helps to inform policy and public debate about the likely consequences
of self-distancing measures. Community spread may be most severe in regions with low
broadband Internet penetration. In regions where there is a greater degree of broadband
Internet penetration and high-income level, it appears that there is an increased ability to
stay at home after a state directive. This suggests that from a policy perspective, the digital
divide may a be more relevant policy issue than ever.

2        Data

We use data provided by Safegraph for the purposes of studying the spread of coronavirus
for February and March 2020. This data is built on a panel of 20 million devices that collect
anonymous location data.2 Each of the users of these devices has given permission for their
location to be tracked by a variety of mobile apps. Safegraph matches the location of these
devices to a variety of locations of branded physical retail locations within the US, and its
main business is focused on providing data on retail traffic to firms and analysts. However,
Safegraph also shared data with researchers who are working on measuring the effects of
the spread of coronavirus. For this purpose, it released data which tracks whether a device
appears to leave its home or whether the device stayed at home the entire day.
        Safegraph describes its data collection process as follows: “The data was generated using
a panel of GPS pings from anonymous mobile devices. We determine the common nighttime
location of each mobile device over a 6 week period to a Geohash-7 granularity (∼153m × ∼
153m). For ease of reference, we call this common nighttime location, the device’s ‘home.’

                                                  4
We then aggregate the devices by home census block group and provide the metrics set out
below for each census block group.” While this is a reasonable procedure for determining a
device’s natural home, it may lead to some misleading results for a variety of circumstances
(e.g., if someone works at night, or regularly sleeps at a romantic partner’s house.) However,
given the need to ensure that the data is anonymized and not related to any one individual,
there is no easy way of correcting such issues. Another issue is that someone may leave
the house without taking their device, though that would be unusual. Given that we focus
on changes over time, we believe that any measurement error introduced by these types of
errors will not affect the direction of our results. We aggregate these measures up from the
census block level to the census tract level.
      This dataset is focused on the US. Two avenues exist whereby the data is potentially not
representative. First, it does not represent behavior of people who do not have smartphones.
The 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) suggested that 66% of the US population
have a smartphone. Another source of bias is that the people who opt-in to allow their
location to be tracked may not be representative of the population. Goldfarb and Tucker
(2012) show that willingness to divulge personal information decreases with age. Athey et al.
(2017) suggests that to some extent the decision to divulge information is highly contextual
and can be easily shifted through small incentives and changes in interfaces, implying that
at least potentially some randomness in the decision to divulge may exist. Though some
selection bias appears likely, Safegraph performs a variety of analyses that suggest their data
does line-up with Census data.3
      We combine the Safegraph data with data from the 2018 American Community Survey
(ACS).4 We use the ACS data to construct estimates of household income, local demographic

composition, and access to the Internet. The American Community Survey “Public Use
Microdata Sample” (PUMS) is released at the geographic level of the “Public Use Microdata
Areas” (PUMA). PUMAs are the smallest geography available. They are designed to have
a population of roughly 100,000 or more people. We were able to match 98.70% of the
census tracts in our Safegraph data to the appropriate PUMA. To measure the diffusion
of the Internet, we use the measure of whether “Broadband (high-speed) Internet service
such as cable, fiber optic, or DSL service” is available in the household. For income, we use
household income—which is total household income reported for the last 12 months.
      In addition, we collected data from the National Governors’ Association about when each
state had (if at all) issued an order which required only “essential businesses” to stay open.5
In each case, we verified what date the order went into place and used that date. These
directives differed in the extent to which they were framed as a “shelter in place” order, or
a “safety at home” order. However, the policies did share a similar intention of minimizing
social interactions by closing down the physical manifestations of most businesses. For the
purposes of our paper, we measure the average effect of these orders and do not try and
distinguish between their different features or what they defined as an essential business.
      Last, we also collected data on the spread of coronavirus itself at the county level. We
collected this data from The New York Times data repository.6 In our specifications, we
focus on using the spread of cases as our focal measure of the spread of coronavirus in the
local county. This data is less granular than our data on whether devices stay at home, which
is on the census tract level. However, it is the most granular data we can obtain. We also
recognize that this is an imperfect measure of actual coronavirus spread due to unavailability
of testing. However, it seems reasonable to think that reported cases are correlated with the
real number of cases, and also that the reported number of cases may in itself have been a

        Our key dependent variable is 26.9%. In other words, on average throughout our time
period, nearly 27% of devices did not leave their house on a given day. The average region had
61% of households reporting access to high-speed Internet. The proportion of unemployed
people appears low at 0.5%, but that is because the ACS defines this category as people
who have been without a job for 5 years. Average penetration of high-speed Internet is 61%
of households. The average household income is around $63,000. On average, there were
43 reported cases of coronavirus at the county level in our dataset, but this is skewed in
particular by Seattle in the earlier period and New York in the latter period.7

3        Empirical Analysis

We begin by presenting some raw evidence of the two main results in the paper. Figure
1 shows that prior to the state directives, areas with above median income typically had
more devices leave their homes than areas with below median income. However, after state
directives were issued, this pattern reversed, and people living in high-income areas were less
    7
        We ran specifications with cases per capita and also the log of cases with similar results.


                                                          7
likely to leave their homes than people living in low-income areas. It also shows that after a
state directive was issued, people were indeed more likely to stay in their homes. It is also
useful to understand the geographical spread of high-income regions in the US. We map this
in Figure A1. It suggests that though there is a concentration of high-income counties on
the coasts, there is a reasonable spread of high-income counties geographically across the
US.
   Figure 2 shows the same plot for whether the region had high or low Internet penetration.
It shows that in areas with high Internet, people were more likely to comply with a state
directive. What is striking though is how similar Figures 1 and 2 are in magnitude and
pattern. This reflects the fact that having a high income in a region and high broadband
penetration is highly correlated. Indeed, the correlation is 0.65 for the indicator variables,
and 0.74 for the raw variables. This paper tries to tease apart the extent to which much of
the inequality in self-isolation that has been attributed to disparities in income can actually
be explained by disparities in Internet access. One immediate question is whether or not
the spread of high speed Internet is focused in certain regions and whether that might be
correlated in a systematic way with the spread of the coronavirus. Figure A2 in the Appendix
indicates that regions with high Internet penetration have reasonably broad coverage across
the country and not are concentrated in one region.
   It is also worth discussing in the context of Figure 2 why it is that broadband Internet
might still play a large role in behavior, even if people have access to their Internet through
their mobile devices. Evidently all individuals in the sample have access to the Internet, as
they are being tracked through their mobile devices. We highlight three potential avenues.
First, in general cellular plans have data limits which mean that using mobile phones for
data-intensive uses, such as watching movies or conducting video calls, may be prohibitively
expensive. Second, most cellular plans have limits on whether their users can “tether”

them—that is, use them as a general Internet modem for a house.8 Mobile phones may also
be a less than ideal substitute for an Internet-powered desktop or laptop for many work or
recreational purposes.
      Figure 3 expands this result by allowing for whether or not the region had above- or
below- median Internet. It shows that in general after the directive, having access to high
speed Internet led more people to stay at home in both high and low income regions.

   Though the results of Figures 1 and 2 are useful, they also do not control for many other
shifts that were taking place during the time period. Neither do they control for underlying
differences in regions. To address this, we turn to an econometric specification. Initially, we
focus on a correlational analysis between regional demographic and economic characteristics
and whether devices stay at home.
   Table 2 presents some simple correlations about how the decision to stay home varies
with various regional social, economic and demographic characteristics. In this specification,
we use state fixed effects. This means that we are only looking at variation in income and
Internet within a state rather than state-to-state variation. This also means that we are not
picking up differences across states due to different timing of the outbreak.



                                                      12
   The first three columns of Table 2 present results for February 2020, and the second three
columns present results for March 2020. In general, during February people were more likely
to leave their house if they lived in an area with a higher income. Column (4) shows that
this pattern reverses in March, and high-income regions are more likely to stay at home.
However, in Column (5) we show that this reversal was driven by the presence of high-speed
Internet. In other words, the reason it appears as though high-income regions were more
likely to stay at home, is that they also had access to high-speed Internet.
   A comparison of Columns (2) and (5) illustrates that broadband penetration enables
individuals to not leave their homes. Comparing February with March suggests that broad-
band penetration has a large and positive significant effect on whether people leave their
homes during the pandemic.
   Looking at the results for incremental demographics in Columns (3) and (6) also offer in-
sights. In general, high levels of prolonged unemployment (more than 5 years) affect whether
people leave their homes, but this is more pronounced in March, reflecting potentially the
fact that those without jobs are more able to avoid leaving their house.
   The additional demographic variables included in Table 2 also offer interesting results. It
appears that areas where there are a higher fraction of individuals who are African-American,
fewer devices leave the home. This trend only shifts slightly in March after the likely effects
of the pandemic were more transparent. The largest shift we see in behavior is in areas with
a high proportion of individuals who are Asian. These regions show a far higher increase of
instances where the device did not leave the home in March.
   One potentially troubling effect that we measure is the behavior of regions which have
a larger proportion of people over the age of 60. In general, this group is more likely to
be vulnerable to coronavirus complications. We do not observe in March any negative and
significant relationship with this measure of the elderly in a local region, as might be ideal
from a public health standpoint. However, we do observe that this compares favorably to the


                                              13
positive and significant coefficient we see in February. In addition, across all specifications,
it is clear that the number of reported coronavirus cases in the local region have a significant
effect at encouraging people to stay at home.
          Though the results of Table 2 are useful from a policy perspective, they are correlational.
We next turn to a more rigorous specification which exploits the precise timing of the state
directives in our data.
          Equation (1) presents our base econometric specification, where the proportion of devices
located on services located in census tract i in county c in state s on date t are a function
of:




                %StayHomeit = β1 HighIncomei × StateDirectivest                                      (1)

                                + β1 HighInterneti × StateDirectivest

                                + β3 StateDirectivest + β4 ReportedCasesct + γi + δt + i


          We estimate this specification using ordinary least squares (OLS).9 The focal policy
effect studied in this paper is captured by β1 and β2 , which capture the relationship between
the enactment of a state directive and above median household income and Internet. The
coefficient β2 , which captures the level effect of the state directive, is also of policy interest.
          The coefficient γi is a vector of census-level fixed effects intended to capture baseline
regional differences in how much people leave their house. In Table 2, a specification where
we have fixed effects at the state level, allows us to see the direct effects of demographics
on people’s likelihood of staying home. However, since these demographics are of course
collinear with the census-tract-level fixed effects, they are not present in this specification.
      9
    Since our dependent variable is naturally bounded between 0 and 100, we also estimated an aggre-
gate logit model that directly accounted for this. The results were similar, so we report OLS for ease of
interpretation.

For example, due to the census-tract fixed effects, the main effect of household income drops
out of our specification. The coefficient δt is a vector of date fixed effects for each date in
the sample period.
   In general, these estimates can be interpreted causally—in the same manner as a re-
gression discontinuity design, due to the combination of date and census-block fixed effects
and the sharp timing differences across states of when these directives were imposed. How-
ever, we caution that it is appropriate to think of these estimates as reflecting everything
that happened on that day in the state which led to the directive being issued, rather than
necessarily the causal effect of the directive alone.
   Table 3 presents results exploring the effect of state directives for the combined sample
of February and March. We report similar results for the March-only subsample in Table A1
of the appendix. Column (1) shows the raw effect of the state directive that only essential
businesses could stay open. It suggests that there is a 4.2 percentage point increase in

                                                   15
devices remaining at home after the order. This is a relatively small effect relative to an
average of 26.9% of devices not leaving the house suggested by Table 1. Perhaps this is
unsurprising though, given the nationwide trend in people distancing themselves regardless
of state directives.
   Column (2) looks at how the effect of the state ban was moderated by income. The results
are striking. In general, they suggest that state directives were far more effective at ensuring
people stayed at home in high-income regions. Columns (3) suggests that there is a very
similar pattern positive effect for the state having a high degree of broadband penetration. In
general, these results suggest that in both high-speed Internet and high-income regions, state
directives are more effective at encouraging people and their associated devices to remain at
home. In Column (4), we look at the effect of including interactions for both income and
Internet. In both cases, the individual effect is attenuated, but still positive and significant.
The apparent negative effect of the state directive in column (4) may be an artifact of the
combination of census tract and date fixed effects and the implied baseline. However, it does
suggest that without either high-income or high-Internet being present, state directives did
not have a large effect on people’ staying at home.
   A natural question given the strong correlation between high-income areas and the dif-
fusion of high-speed Internet, is whether it is income or the diffusion of the Internet which
is driving these results. This is especially the case given the correlations in Table 2 which
suggested collinearity was driving the apparent effect of high-income on getting people to
stay home.
   We turn to examine this in Table 4. In this table we try and exploit variation across
regions and examine regions which have high-Internet, but low-income, or low-Internet but
high-income. These are of course potentially non-representative. For example, high-Internet
but low-income regions are disproportionately found in states such as North Carolina. There,
it appears that there have been spillovers of provision of high-speed Internet for the “triangle”

to poorer areas nearby. Some high-income but low Internet areas are driven by states such as
Wyoming where presumably topography and density interfere with the provision of Internet.
However, we also see other states such as Florida where lack of spread of high speed Internet
does not seem to be driven by topography or density. Therefore, though it seems likely
that there are unobserved characteristics of regions which drive whether or not they deviate
from the usual correlation between high-income and high-Internet, they do not seem entirely
systematic. In the Appendix we report a series of charts which maps out counties by whether
they are above or below the median income or level of broadband diffusion. Figures A3 and
A4 in the Appendix, suggest that these unusual regions were not concentrated in one area,
but instead were spread out geographically.
   We report in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4 a specification which divides up the sample
by whether it is high or low income (above or below median income), or high or low Internet
(above or below median broadband penetration). These specifications give us similar insights.
Columns (1) suggests that in general in regions where there is high-Internet, that a state-level
directive only induces people to stay home if they live in the subset of high-Internet regions
with high-incomes. Column (2) suggests that in low Internet regions the state directive
positively affects both high-income and low income regions within this subset. Column (3)
suggests that in regions with high-income, it is only when there is a high-Internet presence
that the directive encourages people to stay at home. Column (4) suggests that in regions
with low income, then the presence of high-Internet encourages people to stay at home in
that subset of regions, but in general there is still a positive effect of the state directive.
   One slightly jarring result presented in Table 4 is that in Columns (1) and (3) there
is a negative coefficient on the state directive. At face value, this suggests that the state
directive led regions that were not displaying the natural correlation between income and
Internet penetration, to leave the house more after a state directive. However, it should
be remembered that this measured effect is from a baseline which is determined by the


                                                18
combination of census tract fixed effects and date effects. Instead, it should be placed in the
context of Columns (3) and (4)) which suggests that either the presence of high-income in
a low Internet region, or the presence of high-Internet in a low-income region, does have a
small positive effect.
   In the Appendix in Table A2 we also present results for a version of Table 4 where we
just examine data for March. Though the size of the coefficients are generally smaller, the
relative size and direction are similar.

4    Conclusions

This paper is a first attempt at understanding the role of income inequality in moderating
the effectiveness of social distancing measures taken in wake of the spread of coronavirus.
Our results suggest that people who live in high-income areas are in general more likely to
engage in activities outside the home. However, since March 2020, and in particular since
the enactment of state directives defining what essential businesses were allowed to stay
open, people living in high-income areas have in general have self-isolated more and not
left their home. But this seems to be driven by the fact that high-income areas are also
likely to have higher broadband diffusion. We present evidence that the presence of above
average high-speed Internet in a region increases the ability of all residents to self-distance.
However, it also exacerbates the difference between high-income and low-income regions,
further cementing the digital divide.
    This paper aims to guide policy. The sheer scale of state executive orders encouraging
people to stay at home, is unparalleled in recent US history. Therefore, it is useful to
measure whether they are effective and in what contexts they are likely to be less effective.
Our results suggest that policymakers should worry about the likely lack of success of self-
isolation policies in regions where there is low Internet penetration and where people have
low incomes. The results also highlight unforeseen consequences of the scale (or lack of scale)
of deployment of high speed Internet across the US in potentially exacerbating the effects of
income inequality in the ability to self-isolate.
    There are of course limitations to this research. First, this paper is written using data
for February and March 2020, and it is uncertain how the pandemic will evolve, how policies
to tackle it will evolve, and how the trends documented in this paper will evolve. Second,
the paper is descriptive. Though our combination of date fixed effects combined with the
exact timing of a state-wide stay at home order provides a sharp discontinuity to measure



                                               20
the effect of the state-wide order, we do not have exogenous variation that allows us to
attribute causality to income or high speed Internet as moderating variables. Third, this is a
paper focused on the US, and it is not clear how it applies to other countries during a global
pandemic. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe this paper represents a useful first
contribution to the policy debate about the role of income inequality in moderating outcomes
in the wake of national emergencies.
