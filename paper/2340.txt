            Interest-Only/Principal-Only Mortgage-Backed Strips:

                        A Valuation and Risk Analysis



                                  ABSTRACT



    We examine the risk characteristics of each portion of 10/PO mortgage

strips, present results of a valuation model of these securities, and examine

market prices of both the interest—only and principal—only portions of

mortgage pools. We show that 10/PC securities are highly sensitive to the

prepayment behavior of the underlying mortgage pool. Because that behavior

varies systematically with the interest rate, and because prepayments affect

the values of 10 and P0 components in opposite ways, the interest—rate risk of

strip securities can differ substantially from that of the underlying mortgage

pool. The P0 component has much longer duration than the underlying mortgage

pool. In contrast, the 10 component typically will have a negative duration,

at least In ranges for which interest—rate movements induce meaningful changes

in mortgage prepayment behavior. We also show how market prices of

partially—stripped MBSs that are actively traded on secondary markets can be

used to infer market values of pure 10/PC strips. Recent market data is fully

consistent with the theoretical insights offered by our valuation model. When

interest rates spiked last April, P0 values fell far more dramatically than

those of the underlying mortgage pooi while 10 values actually rose.

    The huge trading losses of Merrill Lynch and other investment bankers

recently focused considerable attention on interest—only/principal—only

(lO/PO) mortgage—backed securities. These securities are formed by separating

interest payments on mortgage pools from principal repayments and selling

claims to each income stream separately. The 10 security receives all the

interest payments made on the mortgages in the pool. These payments cease

when mortgages are prepaid. PC securityholders, in contrast, benefit from

early payment of principal. Neither the risk characteristics nor the

appropriate pricing of these new securities are yet well understood. Equally

important, it is not widely recognized that in some cases market data is

available that can be used by issuers to price these securities precisely. In

this paper, we examine the risk characteristics of each portion of lO/PO

strips, present results of a valuation model of these securities, and show how

market prices of traded securities can be used to infer the values of both the

interest—only and principal—only portions of mortgage poois.



1. Interest—Rate Risk in lO/PO Securities



    The major difficulty in analyzing all mortgage—backed securities lies in

the analysis of prepayments. A 30—year 10% conventional mortgage selling at

par would have a duration of about 8.4 years if prepayments were

disallowed.1 In practice, of course, prepayments shorten durations of

mortgage pools considerably. For example, a prepayment rate of 5 percent of

outstanding mortgages per year would reduce duration to 6.2 years. The

peculiarity of IC/PC securities is that the risk of interest—rate increases is

borne overwhelmingly by the owner of the principal—only security. The
 duration of the P0 portion greatly exceeds that of the underlying mortgage

 pool, while the duration of the 10 portion is correspondingly smaller. In

 fact the IC portion is likely to have negative duration, and thus potentially

may   serve   as a hedging asset for fixed—income portfolios.

      This disparity in interest—rate exposure derives primarily from the

interaction of prepayment behavior with interest—rate movements. When

interest     rates increase, the value of the P0 security falls for two reasons.

First, future repayments of principal are worth less as the discount factor

for the time value of money increases. Second, mortgage prepayment rates fall

when interest rates rise, thereby increasing the average time until repayment

of principal. The increase in the time until receipt of principal payments in

conjunction with the increase in the discount rate results in a substantial

decrease in the present value of those payments. These factors lend the P0

security a duration substantially longer than that of the underlying pool of

mortgages.        -




      In   contrast, the 10 portion of the mortgage is affected in offsetting ways

by interest rate movements. A decline in interest rates increases the present

value of scheduled interest payments, but simultaneously increases the

incidence of prepayments of principal. Since these prepayments terminate the

stream of interest payments made on the mortgage pooi, they lower the value of

the 10 security. The net effect on the value of the 10 security may be either

positive or negative. However, for interest rates near the coupon rate of the

mortgage pool, prepayments tend to increase enough in response to a fall in

the interest rate that the 10 security loses value. In this empirically

relevant region, the termination of interest payments dominates the effect of

lower discount rates, resulting in a negative duration for the IC security.




                                        —2—
    To illustrate these points, consider a 30—year l00,0O0 mortgage with a

10% coupon rate. If prepayments were disallowed, then 84.2% of the present

value of the total cash flows on the loan would derive from the interest

component of payments while only 15.8% would derive from principal

repayments. At the other extreme, if the mortgage were prepaid immediately,

an Interest—only claim would become worthless while the value of the principal

claim would jump from 15,80O to the principal balance of l00,00O.

    The effect of prepayment behavior is examined in Table 1 where prepayment

per year is assumed to be a constant fraction of outstanding mortgages. The

effect of prepayment experience is evident. An unanticipated increase in the

prepayment rate from 5% to 7.5% would, even without coincident interest—rate

movements, reduce the value of interest payments from 6l to 53.2 per 100

principal balance, inducing a capital loss to an 10 security holder of 12.8%.

The corresponding gain on the P0 security would be from 39 to 46.8, for a

capital gain of 20%. These calculations are incomplete, of course, because

they ignore the interaction between prepayment behavior and changes in

interest rates, but they do illustrate the wide swings in the relative shares

of the mortgage value that accrue to interest versus principal claimants when

prepayment rates change. Market values in practice should be even more

volatile than suggested by Table 1 since prepayment rates in fact vary in

response to interest—rate swings.

    The weighted average of the durations of the 10 and P0 securities must

equal the duration of the underlying pooi of mortgages. Thus, the great

disparity in durations of the component securities are necessary

counterparts: the short or negative duration of the 10 security must be

matched by correspondingly long durations of the P0 security.

2.   Contingent—Claims Analysis

     The right to prepay a mortgage is in essence a call option that gives the

homeowner the right to call back the loan from the lender at a price equal to

the scheduled balance remaining on the loan. Thus, mortgage—backed securities

may be valued using the same techniques that have been developed for other

option—valuation problems. In fact, option—pricing techniques have been

applied to GNMA mortgage—backed security valuation by Dunn and McConnell

(1981a, 198lb), Brennan and Schwartz (1985), and others. Here, we apply

similar techniques to the valuation of the IC and P0 components of a

mortgage—backed pool. Following their lead, we assume that there are two

types of mortgage prepayments: economically—motivated prepayments (and

refinancings) that exploit interest rate declines, and "autonomous"

prepayments that arise when homeowners change their residences. We will

assume that 5% of all outstanding mortgages prepay for autonomous reasons in

each year. Such a simplistic specification is arbitrary, but does little harm

to the analysis of the interest—rate dependence of these securities, which
                                                       2
depends primarily on economically—motivated prepayment.

     Economically—motivated prepayment will occur when the interest rate

reaches a critical point at which refinancing is optimal for the homeowner.

This critical point will be determined by the process under which interest

rates evolve over time. We will assume that the interest rate is expected

to increase when it is below 10% and to fall when above 10%. Hence, 10% is

the natural or long—run equilibrium value of the interest rate. The épeed

with which rates are impelled toward that long—run value is assumed to be

proportional to the difference between the interest rate and its long run
                     3
equilibrium value.




                                     —5—
     In addition to the expected drift in the interest rate, there are

continuous shocks to rates due to unanticipated economic events. We model

interest rate uncertainty as increasing with the level of rates, specifically

that the variance of the interest rate is proportional to the level of the

rate.4 In our numerical simulations, we set the proportionality constant

equal to .25. At a 10 percent interest rate, this results in a standard

deviation of the interest rate of 1.6 percent annually.

     Using this particular set of assumptions, we can use a valuation model to

examine the response of 10, P0, and mortgage—pool values to interest rate

changes. Our mathematical approach is modelled after Brennan and Schwartz

(1977), which provides a full discussion of the techniques used to value

interest—rate—dependent option—like securities.

     In brief, the valuation methodology uses the dynamics for interest rate

movements given in footnotes 2 and 3 to derive the corresponding dynamics for

the value-of interest—rate dependent securities. These, together with

'boundary conditions" for the values of the security at extreme values of the

interest rate orat optimal prepayment dates, uniquely determine both the

value of the security at all points and the optimal prepayment schedule. In

our model, we employ a version of the liquidity preference theory, and assume

that the expected risk premium earned by each security is proportional to the

instantaneous standard deviation of that security's rate of return, with a

proportionality constant of 0.1.   Such a specification generates a liquidity

premium of about 1.5% for an 8—year duration asset.

    Figure 1 is a graph of the value of the 3 securities (10, P0, and the

mortgage pool itself) backed by a mortgage pool with a coupon rate equal to

the long—run equilibrium interest rate, 10%, as a function of the current




                                     —6—
market interest rate. The mortgage pool is assumed to have been issued 10

years ago with an original life of 30 years. The current principal value is

90.78 per l00 original principal. Notice that, as anticipated, the value of

the PC security falls most dramatically with interest rate increases,

especially at interest rates near the optimal prepayment point of about 8

percent. As economically—motivated prepayment becomes more likely at lower

interest rates, the value of the P0 security rises dramatically. In contrast,

the 10 security falls in value with interest rate decreases, even at rates as

high as 14%. Like the PC, the value of the IC security is most sensitive to

the interest rate near the optimal economic—prepayment point.

     These interest—rate sensitivities are even more evident in Figure 2,

which depicts the durations of the securities as functions of the interest

rate. The duration of the mortgage pool is nearly 3 years at high interest

rates. Without prepayment, it would be about 6 years. The seemingly—large

difference in duration is due both to the incidence of autonomous prepayments

and to the threat of economic prepayment. Even at an interest rate of 147.,

such a threat is not trivial since the interest rate at that point is drifting

downward to its long—run equilibrium value of 10%. The duration of the

mortgage is even shorter at lower interest rates since economic prepayment is

that much more imminent.

    The duration of the P0 security is far larger. For larger values of the

interest rate, it is roughly double that of the mortgage pool. At an interest

rate of 10%, the duration of the PC is 13 years, roughly 5 times that of the

mortgage. From there, duration rises dramatically to 60 years at an interest

rate just above the prepayment point.




                                        —7—
     The duration of the IC security is, in contrast, negative and of quite

large magnitude at interest rates below 1OZ. At an interest rate of 11

percent, duration Is 52 years; at 10 percent it is 58 years. From there

duration spikes downward even more dramatically. At the optimal economic

prepayment point duration is essentially infinitely negative.5

     These values are more extreme than one would expect to observe in reality

since the valuation model assumes that all outstanding mortgages are prepaid

at the optimal moment, when in practice some homeowners will defer prepayment

for reasons not captured by the model. While the model allows for suboptimal

(autonomous) prepayment, It does not allow for suboptimal non—prepayment.

Nevertheless, the qualitative pattern of strip values Illustrated In Figures 1

and 2 will be observed in practice, and 10/PC strips do empirically exhibit

large durations. Indeed, Figure 5, which traces out estimates of actual 10

and P0 strip values during a period of rising interest rates is remarkably

similar to Figure 1.

     Other (nonreported) simulations replicate the analysis of Figures 1 and 2

for mortgage coupon rates of 8 and 12 percent, thus bracketing the long—run

equilibrium interest rate. While the optimal economic—prepayment points

differed from the analysis of Figures 1 and 2, the qualitative patterns that

emerged were otherwise identical.



3.   Investment Implications



     The peculiar interest rate exposures of the 10/PC securIties create both

opportunities and risks for their investors. The interest—rate exposure of

the P0 security is apparent. Nevertheless, such securities may be useful




                                     —8—
portfolio tools for investors seeking very—high—duration assets. For example,

pension funds with long—duration liabilities might find PC securities useful

for immunization purposes.

     10 securities offer hedging opportunities for investors holding more

conventional fixed—income securities. For example, a thrift institution with

holdings of conventional mortgages could offset some of its interest rate

exposure by holding part of its portfolio in mortgage—backed 10 securities

with negative duration.



4.   Empirical Evidence



     While the valuation model presented above is useful for analyzing the

properties of 10/PC securities, the particular values derived are dependent on

assumed autonomous prepayment rates and on the posited process for the

evolution of interest rates. One would like a valuation procedure that is

consistent with market information as reflected in prices of other traded

assets. Fortunately, such data do exist, and market assessments of the values

of the lO/PO components of some mortgage poois can be computed directly from

these data. Hence, the "proper" market prices for the lO/PO components of at

least some mortgage poois can be inferred.

     Completely stripped mortgage—backed securities tend to be privately

placed, and to date have been traded only erratically on the secondary

market. Consequently, investment bankers cannot easily rely on market values

of outstanding strips to price newly issued securities. However, FNNA has

issued partially stripped securities that are actively traded that can be used

to infer the market values of IC/PO securities. This inference is made




                                     —9—
possible because the partial strips allocate principal and interest in

different proportions to different—class securites.

     To illustrate, consider the issues of "B" and "C" series securities by

FtThIA in the letter half of 1986, in which two 9 percent coupon mortgage—backed

securities (MBSs) were divided up so that the premium classes received 2/3 of

the interest and 1/2 of the principal payments, while the discount classes

received 1/3 of the interest and 1/2 of the principal. The premium class,

therefore effectively became a 12% security (   9% x 2/3    1/2) while the

discount class was effectively a 6% security C = 9% x 1/3    1/2). (However,

these synthetic securities would not behave precisely like original—issue 12

or 6 percent coupon mortgage pools since the prepayment behavior of the

"synthetic" securities would be tied to the 9% coupon rate of the underlying

mortgage pools.

     If one were to take a long position in the premium—class security and a

short position -in the discount—class security, the principal payments would

net out to zero, and one would be left with a three percent 10 strip on the

underlying 9% coupon mortgage pools. Therefore, three times the value of the

price difference between the premium and discount securities equals the value

of a pure 9% 10 strip. Substracting the value of that 10 strip from the sum

of the values of the discount and premium securities then gives the value of a

"synthetic" P0 position on the 9% mortgage pooi. The key to this procedure is

that the premium and discount securities are written on the same underlying

MBS and so have identical prepayment exposure. Long and short positions on

different—coupon passthroughs would create Interest and principal—only

securities only until the prepayment behavior of the two passthroughs diverged.

    Goldman Sachs supplied us with price data f or 3 types of partial strips:




                                     —10—
the B" and "C" series just discussed In which 9% pools were split into 6 and

12 percent securities, the "D" series, in which an 8.5% coupon MBS was split

into 11% and 6% securities, and the "F", "G", "H", and "I" series, in which 9%

coupon MBSs were split into 11.5% and 6.5% securities. Using these data we

created three synthetic 10 strips and three synthetic P0 strips. The inferred

prices of the 10 and P0 strips over time are presented in Figures 3 and 4.

The three 10 and P0 prices all tended to move together over time, which is

gratifying, given that the underlying mortgage coupons are similar and thus

should have similar prepayment behavior.

     The most dramatic price movements took place in April 1987, when the bond

market fell sharply. Prices of mortgage passthroughs (obtained by adding

together the prices of the premium and discount securities) fell as well.

Figure 5 shows that the value of the P0 component fell far more dramatically

than the value of the overall MBS, confirming the extremely long duration of

this asset predicted by the previous sections. In contrast, the value of the

10 security actually rose, also confirming the theoretical prediction of a

negative duration, and indicating that prepayment activity was expected to

decline sufficiently to more than offset the increase In the discount factor

applied to 10 payments.



5. Summary



     We have shown that lO/PO securities are highly sensitive to the

prepayment behavior of the underlying mortgage pooi. Because that behavior

varies systematically with the interest rate, and because prepayments affect

the values of 10 and P0 components in opposite ways, the Interest—rate riàk of




                                     —11—
strip securities can differ substantially from that of the underlying mortgage

pooi. The P0 component has much longer duratlonthan the underlying mortgage

pool. In contrast, the 10 component typically will have a negative duration,

at least in ranges for which interest—rate movements induce meaningful changes

in mortgage prepayment behavior. The distinct durations of these securities

make them interesting candidates for immunization of long—term obligations or

for hedging the value of fixed income portfolios.

    We've shown how market prices of partially—stripped MBSs that are actively

traded on secondary markets can be used to infer market values of pure lO/PO

strips. This inference method is potentially of value to issuers and

purchasers of such strips. Recent market data is fully consistent with the

theoretical insights offered by our valuation model. When interest rates

spiked last April, P0 values fell far more dramatically than those of the

underlying mortgage pooi while 10 values actually rose.

1. Duration is, strictly speaking, the weighted average of the times until

    receipt of each payment from a security, with weights proportional to the

   present value of each payment. For mortgages with possible prepayments,

    such a definition is problematic since the cash flow stream will vary with

   prepayment experience. Throughout this paper, I will use duration in a

   looser, but more common, context as the interest—rate elasticity of a

    security's value, that is, as the proportional change in the security's

   price due to a 1 percent change in its yield to maturity.



2. This simple rule is probably reasonably realistic. Although prepayment

   rates generally are lower in early years of mortgage lives, before they

   ultimately level off, mortgage defaults are generally higher in the early

   years. Because these mortgages are insured, a default is essentially

   equivalent to an autonomous prepayment from the perspective of the lender,

   and the sum of the two sources of autonomous prepayments might be

    relatively stable.



3. This specification can be written formally as,

        E(dr/dt) =   k(.lO—r),
   where dr/dt is the time derivative of the interest rate, E is the

    expectation operator, and k is the proportionality constant, which we set

   equal to .2 in our illustrative examples below.

5.   The value of the 10 srip is zero if the pool is repaid. Hence, a small

     increase in the interest rate from the prepayment point to a value just

     above it, Increases the value of the 10 strip from zero to a positive

     value, which is an infinite percentage increase.
