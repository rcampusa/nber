Knowledge Elites and Modernization: Evidence from Revolutionary France

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper examines the role of knowledge elites in modernization. At the eve of the French
Revolution, in the spring of 1789, King Louis XVI solicited lists of grievances (Cahiers de
Doléances), in which the public could express complaints and suggestions for reforms of the
Ancien Regime. We show that the demand for mass education and democratization was
particularly high in regions that had a thick knowledge elite, measured by subscribers to the
famous Encyclopédie in the 1770s. Historical evidence suggests that this pattern is driven by the
spirit of enlightenment of French knowledge elites. Pre-revolution literacy, in contrast, is not
correlated with demand for mass education or with the density of knowledge elites. After the
French Revolution, knowledge elites played a key role in implementing schooling reforms at the
local level. We show that by the mid-19th century, schooling rates were significantly higher in
regions with thicker knowledge elites. The same is true of other proxies for modernization, such
as association membership, Republican votes, and the share of French-speaking pupils. Our
results highlight an important interaction between local culture (the spirit of enlightenment) and
nation-wide institutions in economic development: the French Revolution opened a window of
opportunity for local elites to pursue their agenda of modernization.

1 Introduction
A large literature has documented that democratization and education are crucial factors in eco-
nomic development. However, the historical roots for this process of modernization are subject
to debate (Acemoglu, Gallego, and Robinson, 2014). Following North and Thomas (1973), Ace-
moglu and Robinson (2012) argue that institutional change is the deep cause of development, with
mass education as a by-product. In this context, a prominent explanation for democratization is
that, under the threat of revolution, ruling elites introduced democracy as a commitment for re-
distribution (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000). Alternative explanations argue that democratization
can also occur absent such threats, because it stimulates public goods provision (such as public
health or mass education), which may favor elites indirectly (Galor and Moav, 2002; Lizzeri and
Persico, 2004). On the other hand, the ‘modernization hypothesis’ following Lipset (1959) holds
that institutional change was a by-product of a broader process of economic development. Ac-
cording to this explanation, mass education (which in turn was triggered by economic growth)
‘prepared’ people for democracy and thus created the basis for institutional change. These ex-
planations have in common that they implicitly assume a latent demand for democratization by
the disenfranchised, either already before economic development took off, or as a consequence
thereof. However, there is no systematic empirical work that examines this ‘demand side’ during
the period of modernization in the Western world.1 Instead, the literature has largely focused on
the ‘supply’ of democratization and education.
    In this paper, we examine the interplay of demand for societal change and subsequent modern-
ization at a critical juncture of history – the French Revolution in 1789. In light of rising tensions
in French society, King Louis XVI requested the Cahiers de Doléances (“letters of grievances”) in
1788 from each of the three estates – clergy, nobility, and third estate (all others). These contained
complaints, but also suggestions and demands for changes in the organization of French soci-
ety. Thus, the Cahiers provide a unique source for the analysis of the ‘demand side’ for societal
change in an autocratic regime. Using detailed data for more than 233 districts, we first docu-
ment that demand for modernization was small among the lower social classes. For example, only
24% of third-estate Cahiers mentioned a national education system, and 29% had a distinguished
democratic character. However, we also find a strong relationship between the local presence of
knowledge elites and demand for modernization.2 This is in line with historical accounts that en-
lightened elites promoted institutional change and the expansion of education. In contrast, initial

      We use the local density of subscribers to the famous Encyclopédie in 1777-80 as a proxy for knowledge elites,
following Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015).

literacy of the population in 1786 is not associated with demand for mass education, although it
does predict demands for democratization.
   We then study the relationship between pre-Revolution knowledge elites and post-Revolution
modernization, exploiting the rich variation in numerous socio-economic outcomes across France.
We document a strong correlation between knowledge elites and the expansion of education at the
local level. This relationship was particularly strong during periods in which the central govern-
ment pursued schooling policies. Thus, our results point to an interesting interaction between the
local demand for societal change and aggregate institutions that seek to promote modernization.
This complements a nascent literature that emphasizes the interaction between nation-wide insti-
tutions and local culture (Tabellini, 2008; Alesina and Giuliano, 2015; Bisin and Verdier, 2015).
We also show that the presence of knowledge elites is strongly associated with other indicators
of modernization and state-building in the mid-19th century: the share of French-speaking school
children, the density of mutual aid societies (as a proxy for the strength of civic society – corner-
stone of democracy), and votes for progressive political parties.
    What explains the strong relationship between knowledge elites and modernization in France?
We discuss a rich historical literature that emphasizes the role of enlightened elites in implementing
nation-wide reforms at the local level – especially those that sought to foster mass education. For
example, Anderson (1975, p.31) observes that the school reform of 1833 – a milestone in French
education policy – “relied on the voluntary effort of local notables to organize and develop educa-
tion, both in the communes and through committees set up to supervise schools over a wider area.”
In turn, our results suggest that the relationship between knowledge elites and later indicators for
modernization in the mid-19th century is driven by the increase in schooling. This supports an
interpretation whereby knowledge elites promoted the spread of education, which in turn fostered
modernization among dimensions such as state building or social capital. There is potentially also
an indirect channel because knowledge elites fostered economic development (Squicciarini and
Voigtländer, 2015), which in turn promoted modernization as in Lipset (1959). Economic devel-
opment gave rise to demands for the socialization of workers, instilling morale and discipline.
However, it is unlikely that this mechanism alone explains our findings – our results hold also after
controlling for development indicators such as income per capita and urbanization. Similarly, eco-
nomic development – fostered by knowledge elites – may have raised skill demand, thus creating
incentives for schooling expansion (Galor and Moav, 2006). This is also relatively unlikely: the
main schooling expansion occurred during the July Monarchy between 1833 and 1848, and thus
during the ‘first industrial revolution’, which saw stagnant or even declining skill premia (Clark,
2005).3 Finally, our results may be driven by unobserved variables (such as local economic poten-
   3
       We use detailed district-level wage data to confirm this pattern: the skill premium in 1839-47 was actually lower

                                                            2
tial) that are correlated with both modernization outcomes and knowledge elites. This is unlikely
for two reasons: first, pre-Revolution literacy is uncorrelated with the presence of knowledge elites;
this relationship only emerged after the schooling reforms in the 1830s. Second, knowledge elites
are not associated with economic development in France before 1750 (Squicciarini and Voigtlän-
der, 2015). Consequently, the relationship between knowledge elites and modernization likely
emerged after the French Revolution. In sum, the most likely interpretation for our findings is that
knowledge elites fostered the implementation of education policies at the local level – especially
during periods when nation-wide institutions allowed for a role of elites. Education, in turn, fos-
tered other dimensions of modernization such as state building, progressive political views, and
social capital.
    Our paper relates to a large literature that examines the role of institutions versus human capital
as drivers of economic growth and development. Lipset (1959, 1960) brought the modernization
hypothesis into prominence (crediting it in turn to Aristotle), arguing that economic development
is accompanied by improvements in education, which in turn provides the basis for institutional
change and a transition to democracy. This view has received empirical support in cross-country
and panel regressions (Easterlin, 1981; Barro, 1999; Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and
Shleifer, 2004; Barro, 2015).4 On the other hand, a prominent literature has opposed this view,
arguing that country-level unobservables – in particular, institutional quality – are the fundamental
drivers of development (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012).5 On the theory side, Bourguignon and
Verdier (2000) provide a model where education raises citizen’s political participation. When elites
decide to extend education to the masses, they thus face a trade-off between economic development
and loss of political control. Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer (2007) make a related point, providing
a model where schooling fosters social interaction, facilitating the transition to a democratic regime
with a broad base in the population. Overall, the previous literature has mostly studied democratic
transitions and development over the past decades, when rich data are available. In the historical

in areas with dense knowledge elites.
    4
      Castelló–Climent (2008) provides evidence that mass education is a more robust predictor than average years of
schooling for democratization after WWII. While average years of schooling may reflect a small group of highly edu-
cated individuals, accounting for the distribution of education captures whether a large mass has moderate education,
enabling the citizens to participate in the democratic process.
    5
      The debate has largely involved country level panel regressions, and whether or not the inclusion of fixed effects
is required. Glaeser et al. (2004) find that human capital coefficients dominate those on institutions in cross-country
growth regressions, while Acemoglu et al. (2014) argue that this is due to omitted variable bias and the “bad control”
problem (Angrist and Pischke, 2009, pp.64–68). Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2009) show that once
country fixed effects are included, income does not predict transitions to democracy. Hauk and Wacziarg (2009) show
that fixed effects estimators bias the coefficient on human capital towards zero, while purely cross-sectional estimates
bias it upward. On balance, their Monte Carlo simulations advise against the use of fixed effects in panel regressions:
while they reduce omitted variable bias, they exacerbate downward bias due to measurement error in variables that
change little over time, such as educational attainment.

context, the literature has focused mainly on whether colonizers brought institutions or human
capital to colonies. Empirically, the development of the first democracies in Europe has been
largely unexplored. We fill this gap by examining detailed cross-sectional variation within France
during the period of the French Revolution.
   We also relate to a literature that has studied the role of elites in the expansion of education
and democratization. Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) argue that inequality can hamper economic
opportunities for the majority of the population if it leads to the emergence of institutions that favor
elites. Easterly (2007) uses cross-country data and finds that land inequality is negatively correlated
with income, institutions, and schooling. Galor, Moav, and Vollrath (2009) show in a theoretical
framework, then tested in the context of 20th-century US, that landownership inequality has a
negative effect on the emergence of public schooling and human capital promoting institutions.
(Cinnirella and Hornung, 2016) take a slightly different approach and show that in the case of
Prussia, landownership inequality had a negative effect on mass education not through the political
power of the elites, but through the serfdom system diminishing private demand for education.
   Relative to the existing literature, we make several contributions. First, we examine the de-
mand for societal change before one of the turning points in history – the French Revolution – and
show that enlightened elites were an important driving force in seeking to expand education and
democratize the country. Second, in contrast to the previous literature, we examine the spread of
modernization within a country, exploiting substantial variation across French departments. Our
findings expand on the argument by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) that “critical junctures” in
history can lead to very different long-run outcomes, depending on initial conditions. We argue
that changes in central institutions opened a window of opportunity for local elites to implement
modernization – and that the presence of knowledge elites can thus explain (at least in part) the
substantial cross-sectional variation over the century after the French Revolution. Third, we doc-
ument a pattern of ‘modernization with a twist.’ While the literature following Lipset (1959) has
emphasized the importance of mass education for democratization, our results go one step further,
suggesting that enlightened knowledge elites played an important role in both the initial demand
for societal change and its later implementation at the local level. Finally, we contribute to the
literature on the role of elites in economic development. In this context, we emphasize the impor-
tance of distinguishing between enlightened elites and landowning elites, showing that the former
are in fact positively related with demand for and implementation of mass education and democra-
tization. This suggests that the type of elites is crucial for whether they hamper or foster economic
development.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the historical background of
the French Revolution and the subsequent modernization of the country. Section 3 presents our

2 Historical Background
2.1 The Cahiers des Doléances
At the eve of the Revolution, Louis XVI, confronted with a general discontent of the population,
decided to call the Estates General (the French representative assembly) for the first time since
1614. Each Estate (clergy, nobility, and third estate) in every baillage (electoral district) organized
an assembly and endorsed a cahier. This was a list of grievances and suggestions on several aspects
of the social, economic, and political situation of the country. Each assembly elected representa-
tives who carried the cahier to the Estates General in Versailles.6 Importantly, the cahiers did not
have a legislative function, but simply represented a channel of communication.
   The convocation rules varied by estate: while all members of the clergy and the nobility were
called to participate, there were stricter regulations for the members of the third estate. For in-
stance, only male citizens who were on the tax roles and older than 25 could participate. In
addition, some cities such as Paris imposed a minimum tax requirement, which further reduced the
size of the electorate from the third estate. Moreover, given the large number of individuals in the
third estate7 , a sequence of elections was required, where cities and rural communities followed
different procedures. Importantly, despite these differences among estates, “the cahiers embodied
the will of the community that endorsed it” (Shapiro, Tackett, Dawson, and Markoff, 1998, p.105),
and “the elections of 1789 allowed a very wide suffrage, unprecedented for France if not for Eu-
rope and far more inclusive than the British parliamentary model of the time” (Shapiro et al., 1998,
p. 108).
2.2 The French Revolution
The French Revolution represents one of the “critical junctures” in European history (Acemoglu
and Robinson, 2012) and its causes, characters, and consequences have been object of a long debate
by historians and economists. It is widely accepted that the French Revolution was associated
with a drastic institutional change in France that also had consequences in Europe as a whole.
This included the abolition of the feudal system, as well as the simplification of the legal system
(Franck and Michalopoulos, 2016, p.1). The objective of the revolutionary movement was to free
the population from tyranny, and enlightened elites were at the forefront. They represented a

   6
      These representatives were tied to the constituents in their bailliage not by future election, but only by the cahier
itself.
    7
      In 1789, France had about 23 to 26 millions inhabitants. The nobility represented between 150,000 and 300,000
members, the clergy around 100,000 members, and the Third Estate the rest of the population (Franck and Michalopou-
los, 2016).

progressive group in society, identifying themselves more with the Nation than with the king, and
even promoting the renunciation of some of their most substantial real privileges (Chaussinand-
Nogaret, 1985). Our findings highlight the role of knowledge elites in the process of modernization
after the French Revolution.
2.3 The French Schooling System in the 18th and 19th Century
Before the French Revolution, primary education was mainly under the control of the Catholic
Church and was focusing on “the principal mysteries of the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman reli-
gion” (Stone, 1922, p.165). While some reading was included in the school curriculum, very little
emphasis was given to writing; the quality of teaching was very poor and school rates extremely
low. At the eve of the French Revolution, “the instruction of the mass of the poor remained very
nearly what it had been in the middle ages” (Arnold, 1961, p. 21).
    The revolutionary government, inspired by the principles of the Enlightenment, attempted to
reform the backward primary education system. The idea was that children of all classes were
to receive free education in “those traits of virtue which most honor freemen ... to elevate the
soul and to render men worthy of liberty and equality” (Arnold, 1961, p. 25). This had to be
implemented and organized at the local level by a “commission of enlightened patriots and moral
persons” who would decide where to locate schools and choose the future teachers. However, the
turmoil during the Reign of Terror (1793-94), as well as the shortage of funding needed to promote
the educational reforms, led to the Law of the 3rd Brumaire (1795) – and to the moment when the
Revolution “had to renounce almost all its illusions” (Arnold, 1961, p.29). The State now would
only provide a schoolhouse, but did not guarantee free schooling, while letting the parents decide
on their children’s education.
    The suppression of religious teaching during the revolutionary period led to disorders and com-
plaints, with the consequence that Napoleon, allowed the Church to reestablish its hegemony in
primary education in 1799-1815. Moreover, while Napoleon recognized the importance of primary
education, he gave priority to secondary education and Universities (Arnold, 1961; Jacob, 2014).
After Napoleon, during the period of the Bourbon Restoration (1815-1830), the Church became
even more influential in primary education, with local priests taking full control of the curriculum
and certifying the morality of primary school teachers. As a consequence, in 1830, primary “edu-
cation was in a deplorable state” (Arnold, 1961, p.46) with only 20,000 out of 37,000 communes
having schools at all.
    The turning point came with the July Monarchy (1830-1848). Primary schooling finally be-
came a priority for the French government and an important law – aimed at a serious reformation
of the education system – was enacted by François Guizot in 1833. Overall, the 1833 law was


                                                 6
extremely successful, and it resulted in “the root of the present system of primary education”
(Arnold, 1961, p.46).8 Importantly for our argument, the 1833 law largely relied on the implemen-
tation by local authorities: two committees (a parish and a district committee) were established to
inspect and superintend schools, as well as to nominate and dismiss teachers. The ability of these
committees largely varied at the local level and despite the fact that Guizot made several efforts
to “stimulate and enlighten them” (Arnold, 1961, p. 46), the inadequacy of the local authorities
often represented the main defect of the system. Anecdotal evidence suggests that often there was
widespread local resistance toward the adoption of mass education.9 This local heterogeneity was
also reflected in the funding to schools. Until 1855, the commune contributed about 75% of the
total expenditures. Only, in the early 1860s, there was a shift of financing from the local to the na-
tional level and, thus, less scope for local elites to affect the implementation of education reforms
(Grew and Harrigan, 1991).
   With the 1851 Falloux Law10 and, even more, with the advent of the Third Republic11 the ed-
ucation system became increasingly centralized and professional, with less scope for local author-
ities to affect the provision and quality of primary education. Thus, the period between 1830 and
1850 offered the most opportunities for local knowledge elites to affect the expansion of schooling.

3 Data
In this section we describe our data.12 We begin with the description of our proxy for the presence
of knowledge elites. Next, we turn to our outcome variables: we first describe the demand for local
change in the pre-1789 cahiers des doléances and then we look at our measures of schooling and
modernization in the post-1789 period. Finally, we describe our control variables.
Subscriber Density
Following Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015), we use the local density of subscribers to the 1777-
79 Encyclopédie of Diderot and d’Alembert as our proxy for the presence of knowledge elites.
Since larger cities tend to have more subscribers mechanically, we normalize subscriptions by

   8
      For instance, within only 4 years, the number of schools increased by 50% , and doubled until 1850. Similarly,
the number of communes without schools fell to 2,500 in 1850.
    9
      For instance, Arnold (1961, p.48) talks about a national school inspector, arriving in a village and promising the
construction of a school. The local mayor welcomed him with: “You would have done a great deal better, Sir, if you
had brought us money to mend our roads; as for schools, we don’t want them.”
   10
      The 1851 Falloux Law encouraged Catholic education also in public schools and, at the same time, it established
clearer national standards and regulations.
   11
      The Republicans passed several education laws, aimed at expanding and improving the quality of primary school-
ing while weakening the role of the Catholic Church. Among them, the 1881-1882 Ferry Laws, promoting free,
secular, and mandatory education until age 13, represent the most important one.

population in 1750.13 To reduce the influence of extreme values, we use log-subscriber density as
our baseline variable: lnSubDens = ln(Subs/pop1750 + 1), where pop1750 is city population in
1750.14
Cahiers des Doleances
As mentioned earlier, the cahiers were a list of grievances and suggestions on several aspects of
the social, economic, and political situation of the country. Hyslop (1934) grouped the cahiers’
contents in 49 categories. Cahiers were submitted by each estate from each French bailliage
(county). Altogether, Hyslop coded these for 332 bailliages.15 For each of the 49 categories, she
includes a dummy on whether the cahier of each of the three estates in a given bailliage discussed
the respective category. For example, the third estate in 86% of all bailliages demanded equal tax
liability, while only 4% asked for restrictions of the press.

mand for a national education system and democratization (see Table 1). Regarding the former,

      Subscriptions per capita (among cities with above-zero entries) varied substantially, from 0.5 per 1,000 in Stras-
bourg to 16.3 in Valence; Paris belonged to the lower tercile of this distribution, with 0.85 subscriptions per 1,000.
   14
      Adding a positive number ensures that the measure is also defined for cities with zero subscriptions, and more
precisely, adding the number 1 yields lnSubDens = 0 in these cases. This reflects a normalization, so that in cities
with Subs = 0, there is no relationship between subscriptions and growth.
   15
      Using the Atlas des Bailliages (1905), we identify the exact bailliage where the 319 cities in Bairoch, Batou, and
Chèvre (1988) database are located. When more than one city is located in the same bailliage we use the bailliage’
s cahiers for all the cities located in that bailliage. With this methodology we obtain 169 1-to-1 matches and the
remaining 150 cities are located in 52 bailliages. However, data on lnSubDens are available only for 193 cities.
Merging these with those cities that have data for the cahiers of the nobility and third estate, we end up with 149
observations.

we use “cahiers that propose some measure of national education” or ask for “etatisme (govern-
ment involvement) in education.” Regarding demand for democratization, the cahiers include the
following categories: 1) “approving vote by head,” 2) “most strongly democratic,” 3) “demanding
the same law for all classes,” 4) “asking for publicity of governmental action,” and 5) “asking for
freedom of the press.” Based on these variables shown in Table 1, we construct several proxies for
demand for education and democratization. As a baseline, we use demands expressed by the no-
bility (2nd estate) and by the 3rd estate. We treat the demands by the clergy separately because this
subset of the population was i) very small and ii) their views were largely conservative, represent-
ing those of the Catholic Church – for instance, the clergy was strongly against the renunciation
of privileges, more than the nobility (Hyslop, 1934)) ). For example, while the clergy was in favor
of expanding education, this referred mostly to religious education. This is apparent in Table 1,
showing that only 21% of the clergy is in favor of government involvement in education. Similarly,
only 11% of the clergy cahiers was demanding the same law for all classes and only 2% of them
shows a strongly democratic attitude.
   Regarding our proxies for demand for mass education, we use categories E1 and E2 from
Table 1. These are expressed in terms of dummies in Hyslop’s (1934) data, with the value one
indicating that in the cahier from the bailliage around city c, estate e expressed issues E1 or E2.
Our main education variable includes both the nobility and the third estate, and it is computed
as the first principal component of E1ce and E2ce with e = {nobility, 3rd estate} across all cities
c in our sample. Similarly, our main democratization variable is computed as the first principal
component using topics D1-D5 from Table 1 for nobility and 3rd estate. For robustness checks,
we also compute the principal components only for nobility (e = nobility) and only for the third
estate (e = 3rd estate) – and as a placebo for the clergy.
Schooling and modernization post-1789
Our outcome variables in the post 1789 period are measured at the French departement level (after
the Napoleonic period, there were 86 departements). First, we use several schooling outcomes in
the post-revolutionary period. These include school rates in 1837 and 1876, literacy in 1876, the
number of schools per 10,000 inhabitants in 1829, 1850 and 1876, and school growth in 1829-50
and in 1850-76. All these data are from the Statistique Générale de la France.
    We use several proxies for modernization in the post-revolutionary period. First, we use infor-
mation on mutual aid societies in 1878. These have their origins in the confraternities and trade
guilds of the 18th early 19th century. They aimed at protecting their members when not able to
work both because of unexpected risks or because of life-cycles (Baker, 2004).16 Data on mutual

  16
       Before 1848, all associations in France were considered illegal. Then, a few were tolerated. Among them, the

                                                          9
aid societies are from Annuaire Statistique de la France. To account for the possibility that the
financial means (and need) for worker insurance were stronger in more developed regions, we nor-
malize the number of mutual aid societies per capita by average disposable income in 1864 (from
Delefortrie and Morice, 1959). As a second outcome variable that is related to modernization (and
in particular, to state building), we look at the share of people and the share of children that spoke
French in 1863. This information is from Weber (1976). Finally, we use data on the share of votes
for progressive parties in 1876 from the Annuaire Statistique de la France.17
Control variables
Data on literacy in 1786 are from the Statistique Générale de la France and represent the percent-
age of men and women able to sign their wedding certificate. Other controls include department
level urban population in 1750, dummies for cities with ports on the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediter-
ranean Sea, and cities located on a navigable river (Dittmar, 2011), a dummy for cities that hosted a
University before 1750 (Jedin, Latourette, and Martin, 1970; Darby and Fullard, 1970), a dummy
for cities where a printing press was established before 1500 (Febvre and Martin, 1958; Clair,
1976), the (log) number of noble families per capita in each French department (Squicciarini and
Voigtländer, 2015), and a dummy for Paris. Then, we include a measure of land inequality com-
puted as the hectares of land owned by those having at least 40 hectares over the total hectares of
land.

4 Empirical Results
In this section, we present our empirical results. First, we show that the presence of knowledge
elites is positively associated with demand for expansion of mass education and democratization
in the Cahiers des Doléances. Then, we show that the local density of knowledge elites in 1777-79
predicts the expansion of schooling and other proxies for modernization in the post-revolutionary
period.
4.1 Knowledge Elites and Pre-Revolutionary Demands in the Cahiers de Doléance
In this subsection, we investigate the relationship between the presence of knowledge elites and
demand for mass education and democratization at the eve of the French Revolution. We estimate
equations of the form:
                                           Dc = β · Sc + γXc + εc ,                                               (1)



mutual aid societies were considered promoters of social order and even supported by the State. Only after the passage
of the Law on Associations in 1901 could associations be freely created.

      We are grateful to Tommy E. Murphy for kindly sharing these data with us.

                                                         10
where Dc denotes demands expressed in cahiers in city c, Sc is the density of knowledge elites, Xc
is a vector of control variables, and εc is the error term. We use several categories for Dc , derived
from the various topics discussed in the cahiers as described in Section 3.
    Table 2 shows that the presence of knowledge elites is positively associated with the demand
for national education in the Cahiers des Doléances. We first show this relationship when consid-
ering the cahiers of the nobility and third estate combined (cols 1-2). In column 1, we do not use
any controls. Our main explanatory variable lnSubDens alone explains 13% of the variation in
demand for mass education across cities in France. To asses the magnitude of the relationship, we
report the standardized beta coefficient at the bottom of Table 2. We find that a one-standard de-
viation increase in lnSubDens is associated with 0.35 standard deviations increase in the demand
for expansion of mass education among the nobles and the third estate. When adding our full set
of controls in column 2, the coefficient of lnSubDens becomes even stronger, and all variables
together now explain 31% of the variation in demand for mass education. Table 2 also reports co-
efficients for our main control variables. Literacy in 1786 – as a measure for average human capital
– is not significantly related to demand for mass education.18 The same is true for our proxies for
the presence of rich land-owning nobility: the number of noble families relative to population and
land inequality, measured as the share of land owned by those with at least 40 hectares over the
total hectares of land.19
    The fact that we do not find a relationship between land inequality and demand for educa-
tion deserves further discussion. The existing literature suggests that landowning elites, in order
to protect their privileges, oppose the spreading of human capital promoting institutions, such as
expansion of mass education (Sokoloff and Engerman, 2000; Easterly, 2007; Galor et al., 2009).
However, historically, this mechanism was likely less important in the French context. First, redis-
tribution during the French Revolution solidified small-scale landholding.20 Second, French land
owners had little influence on the rural community.21 Finally, feudalism in French agriculture was
abolished already in the late 18th century. Thus, the Prussian channel, where landownership in-

  18
      Literacy and subscriber density are uncorrelated (see Squicciarini and Voigtländer, 2015). On average, fewer than
0.6 per 1,000 inhabitants were Encyclopédie subscribers (and 1.3 per 1,000 if we consider only cities with positive
subscriptions) – too little to mechanically elevate literacy rates.
   19
      Land inequality and noble density are correlated with a coefficient of 0.17. Including the two variables separately
does not change our results, and each individual variable remains insignificant.
   20
      Land redistribution during the French Revolution “reinforced the small-scale character of landholding in France
and, by extension, the tenacious, ideologically informed sense of property ownership that would hinder attempts to
achieve remembrement [land consolidation] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries” (?, p.113)
   21
      As explained by Forster (1967, p.84-85) “Surely there was less contact between the rural community and the
noble rentier or the noble owner...and less contact meant less local influence for the nobility.” Moreover, he also
argues that “the bonds of subordination ...throughout the entire society had been loosened [and].. by 1825 the erosion
of the hierarchical society upon which hereditary aristocracy rested was far advanced.”

                                                          11
equality had a negative effect on mass education because the serfdom system diminished private
demand for education (Cinnirella and Hornung, 2016) is unlikely to be at play in France.

     All regressions are run at the city level and are weighted by population in 1750. Columns 1 and 2 use
     two categories from cahiers related to the expansion of education: cahiers “proposing some measure of
     national education” and cahiers on “etatisme (government involvement) in education.” The dependent
     variable is constructed as the principal component of these two categories for the nobility and the third
     estate, i.e., altogether four categories coded in the form of dummies by Hyslop (1934). Section 3 provides
     further detail on the construction of this variable. Column 3 uses the same cahiers, but only for the nobility,
     and column 4, only for the third estate. Columns 5 and 6 perform a placebo exercise and use the same
     cahiers for the clergy.
     ‡
       Additional Controls include department level urban population in 1750, dummies for cities with ports
     on the Atlantic Ocean or located on a navigable river, a dummy for cities that hosted a University before
     1750, a dummy for cities where a printing press was established before 1500, and a dummy for Paris.


   Next, in columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, we examine cahiers from the second and third estates
separately. We find statistically significant coefficients on lnSubDens for both the nobility and
the third estate, but results are somewhat stronger for the latter. This may be due to the fact that
knowledge elites from the third estate (such as lawyers, doctors, and merchants) were in close
contact with commoners and thus wanted to spread education to the lower social classes. Finally,

                                                            12
columns 5 and 6 use the cahiers of the clergy as a placebo and show that the coefficients are much
smaller in magnitude and not significant. The clergy indeed represented a very small part of the
population and had largely conservative views. Members of the clergy were strongly opposed to
the renunciation of their privileges – even more than the nobility (Hyslop, 1934)).
    Could our results merely be driven by knowledge elites making more demands in any cate-
gory in the cahiers? To assess this possibility, we construct the demands for education relative
to all other categories mentioned in each city’s cahiers.22 Table 3 replicates our analysis from Ta-
ble 2, using this alternative dependent variable. We find statistically and quantitatively very similar
results and confirm the stark difference between knowledge elites and average literacy – in fact, lit-
eracy has a negative coefficient in some specifications. Figure 1 shows that the positive relationship
between knowledge elites and demand for education is not driven by outliers, using a binscatter
plot that groups the x-axis into 20 equal-sized bins. The figure shows the partial correlation (after
including all controls) corresponding to column 2 in Table 3

     Using the notation from Section 3, the demand for education by the nobility and the third estate is thus given by
adding, for each city c, the dummies E1c,nobility , E1c,3rd estate , E2c,nobility , and E2c,3rd estate , and dividing this by the sum
of all cahiers dummies for city c (i.e., across all topics) for nobility and third estate.

Notes: All regressions are run at the city level and are weighted by population in 1750. Columns 1 and 2 use cahiers
“proposing some measure of national education” and cahiers on “etatisme (government involvment) in education” for
the nobility and the third estate. Column 3 uses the same cahiers, but only for the nobility, and column 4 only for
the third estate. Columns 5 and 6 perform a placebo exercise and use the same cahiers for the clergy. The dependent
variable is the shares of the indicated categories over the overall topics covered in the cahiers of the bailliage (county)
corresponding to a city, as coded by Hyslop (1934). Controls include all control variables (including additional ones)
listed in Table 2. Standard errors (clustered at the department level) in parentheses. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

       Next, we turn to demand for democratization in the cahiers. Table 4 shows that the presence of
knowledge elites is a significant predictor of democratic demands. This relationship is particularly
strong in the cahiers of the nobility (col 3) and weaker for the third estate (col 4). The bottom
of the Table reports the standardized beta coefficients, showing that a one standard deviation in-
crease in lnSubDens is associated with an increase by 0.3 standard deviations in the demand for
democratization among the nobility, and by only 0.08 s.d. increase among the third estate. This
difference between our results for nobility and third estate can be explained by the historical con-
text. The nobility in France was – in contrast to other European countries – relatively little involved
in the political process before the Revolution.23 At the same time, for the enlightened subset of
the nobility political participation was a key issue (Chaussinand-Nogaret, 1985). Consequently,
seeking political participation was at least as important for the nobility as it was for the lower so-
cial ranks.24 In addition, the progressive nobility was strongly in favor of merit-based, rather than
hereditary, appointment to public offices: “Breaking here again with the dogma of prescriptive
rights, privileges of birth and innate dignities, the nobility demanded that senior ranks should only
in future be awarded for merit and that officers risen themselves from ranks (whose condescending
title of ‘officers of fortune’ should be replaced by ‘officers of merit’) should be able to aspire to
any rank and dignity” Chaussinand-Nogaret (1985, p.160).
   In columns 5-6 we use the cahiers of the clergy as a placebo and find no relationship with the
presence of knowledge elites. As discussed above, the clergy represented a very small subset of
the population, and embraced the conservative view of the Catholic Church.
    Finally, Table 5 looks at cahiers related to economic demands to check whether economic
self-interest may be driving our results. The dependent variable is constructed as the principal
component based on cahiers expressing demand for liberalism (cols 1-2) and cahiers expressing
demand for mercantilism (cols 3-4), in both cases for the nobility and the third estate.25 The
coefficients on lnSubDens are not significantly associated neither with demand for liberalism
nor with demand for mercantilism. They are also quantitatively small, as indicated by the beta

      During late medieval and early modern times, the French king had a weaker standing relative to noble lords than
the English monarch. However, after the religious wars that divided Europe in the 16th and 17th century, the power
of the French monarchy increased continuously, until the king reached an absolutist status under Louis XIV (Roland,
2004).
   24
      In the words of Chaussinand-Nogaret (1985, p.22): “It is impossible to discern two opposed social currents in
Enlightenment thought, one bourgeois and the other noble. In cultural development and in the political and social
thought of the Enlightenment, nobles played a role as important as the representatives of the third estate. In fact, they
defined together a single and selfsame culture: one which culminated in the self-realization of a Nation individualistic,
egalitarian, free to choose, and keen to take control of its destiny.”
   25
      More precisely, cahiers for liberalism include those proposing “the suppression of the guilds” and cahiers “show-
ing only liberal economic demand.” Cahiers demanding mercantilism include those proposing “the maintenance of
the guilds” and cahiers “showing only mercantilist demand.”

– at least those related to the design of the economic system – are not a confounding factor in our
analysis.

4.2 Knowledge Elites and Changes in Education after the French Revolution
In this subsection we turn to the post-revolutionary period and relate the presence of knowledge
elites to the expansion of mass education. We estimate equations of the form:

                                            yc = β · Sc + γXc + εc ,                                               (2)

where Sc represents the density of knowledge elites in city c; Xc is a vector of control variables,
and εc is the error term. We use several outcome variables yc as proxies for schooling expansion.

                                                         17
      The first two columns in Table 6 show that Encyclopedia subscriber density in 1777-79 is a
strong predictor of school rates in 1837 and in 1876. Figure 2 shows the binscatter plot for the
partial correlation corresponding to column 2 in Table 6. The figure illustrates that the strong
relationship between subscriber density and schooling is not driven by outliers. Subscriber density
also predicts literacy in 1876 (col 3). These results hold after controlling for initial literacy in
1786, and thus reflect the growth in mass education relative to the pre-revolutionary period. Next,
columns 4-6 examine the supply of schooling before and after the July Monarchy, using the (log)
number of schools per 10,000 inhabitants as dependent variable. We find that the relationship
between subscriber density and schools per capita is particularly strong after the 1830s. Finally,
columns 7 and 8 examine the growth in the number of schools over the periods 1829-1850 and
1850-1876. Importantly, the coefficient on lnSubDens is positive and significant in column 7,
while it becomes much smaller in magnitude and insignificant in column 8.

    The findings in Table 6 are in line with the hypothesis that knowledge elites played an important
role in the expansion of mass education during the July Monarchy, i.e., the period when local
elites had ample opportunities to foster the implementation of nation-wide educational reforms

                                                                18
(see the discussion in Section 2). These results are corroborated by department-level data on
school investment from the Statistique Générale de la France. More precisely, the data cover
total expenses for public primary schooling from private, commune-, department-, and State-level
funds. The commune-level expenditures accounted for the majority of the total expenditures –
in 1855 they were about 75% of the total. Figure 3 shows the coefficients of regressing school
expenditures (from all categories) in 10-year intervals between 1830 and 1870 on Encyclopédie
subscriber density. We find statistically significant coefficients in each decade before 1870, and
the relationship is particularly strong in the 1840s. This – together with the fact that most school
expenditures originated at the community level – suggests a strong involvement of local knowledge
elites in financing public education during the July Monarchy.
    Could our findings on school expenditures merely be driven by knowledge elites being richer,
and thus having more access to funding? Two additional checks in our data make this unlikely.
First, the regressions that underly Figure 3 control for the presence of nobility and land inequality;
both variables have small and insignificant coefficients. Thus, having a rich upper class alone is
not associated with investment in schooling. Second, for a later point in time – the year 1876
– data are available by source of school funding, so that we can run the regressions underlying
Figure 3 separately for each category. For town-level expenditures, we find a strong positive and
significant coefficient of 0.59 on subscriber density. In contrast, for private funding of schooling,
the coefficient is much smaller (0.03) and insignificant. This suggests that knowledge elites were
not merely families with deep pockets that donated money for schools. In sum, our empirical
results are in line with the historical evidence presented in Section 2.3, supporting the interpretation
that knowledge elites where involved in the local organization and implementation of schooling
policies.
4.3 Other Proxies for Modernization after the French Revolution
We now turn to the relationship between knowledge elites and alternative proxies for moderniza-
tion in the second half of the nineteenth century. First, we use data on members and number of
mutual aid societies in each department. Mutual aid societies were an important source of in-
surance for their members, and they were considered promoters of social order by the state. In
general, civic associations are often viewed as “schools in democracy” because they transmit skills
and competencies that are important for democratic participation, and because they foster the polit-
ical debate (Wollebaek and Selle, 2002). According to Putnam (1993, pp. 89-90), “[a]ssociations
instill in their members habits of cooperation, solidarity and public-spiritedness.” Columns 1-4 in
Table 7 present our results for mutual aid societies. Since financial means (and need) for worker
insurance was likely stronger in more developed departments, we divide the members in mutual aid

societies (cols 1-2) and the number of mutual aid societies (cols 3-4) by total disposable income in
the department in 1864. To further allow for non-linear relationships with economic development,
columns 2 and 4 flexibly control for the 5th order polynomials in p.c. income and urbanization
rates.26 In all specifications, the coefficient on lnSubDens is positive and significant. In terms
of magnitude (beta coefficient), a one-standard deviation increase in subscriber density is associ-
ated with a rise in the presence of mutual aid societies by 0.25 standard deviations. These results
imply that the historical presence of knowledge elites is associated with the formation of social
capital after the French Revolution. Below, we provide evidence that this relationship worked via
knowledge elites fostering mass education, which is in line with the argument by Lipset (1960)
that education is a cornerstone of modernization.

controls also for election turnout in 1876.


       In columns 5 and 6 of Table 7, we use as dependent variables the share of French speaking
population and the share of French speaking children, respectively. These variables represent
a proxy for state building (Alesina and Reich, 2015). In both cases we include a dummy for

    As is well-documented, urbanization rates and per-capita income in Europe before 1900 can be used interchange-
ably as proxies for economic development (DeLong and Shleifer, 1993; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2005;
Dittmar, 2011). Including the 5th order polynomials in these variables separately does not change our results.

                                                               21
historically non-French speaking departments to capture local variation in language from before
the French Revolution. The coefficients on lnSubDens are positive and significant, suggesting
that the presence of knowledge elites is associated with a higher local integration in the national
culture, as reflected by a higher familiarity with the French language. The size of the coefficient
in column 5 implies that a one-standard deviation increase in subscriber density is associated with
a 6 percentage point higher share of French speaking people in 1863, relative to a mean of 79
percent of French speakers. The beta coefficients for lnSubDens in columns 5 and 6 are above
0.4, implying that a substantial part of the variation in French speaking children and population is
associated with the variation in the historical presence of knowledge elites.
    Finally, column 7 in Table 7 uses the share of votes for Republican parties in 1876 as outcome
variable, controlling also for election turnout. The Republican parties included the Modérés et
Libéraux, the Radicaux socialistes, the Radicaux, the Socialistes, and the Ralliés. These parties
supported the ideals of the French Revolution, and they were opposed to the reactionary coalition,
which included the Monarchistes and the Revisionistes (Avenel, 1894). Consequently, the share
of progressive votes indicates the extent to which the spirit of modernization was anchored in the
population.27 We find a strong positive correlation between the presence of knowledge elites and
progressive voting. A one-standard deviation higher share of Encyclopédie subscribers in the 18th
century is associated with 4 percentage points higher votes for progressive parties, relative to an
average vote share of 55 percent in 1876.
   Next, we combine the different modernization proxies into a single index. Table 8 uses as
dependent variable the first principal component of members of mutual aid societies (relative to
disposable income in 1878), the share of French speaking children in 1863, and the share of Re-
publican votes in 1876. We find a strong positive coefficient for our main explanatory variable,
lnSubDens, using different sets of control variables (cols 1 and 2). The coefficient on historical
literacy is positive and marginally significant, suggesting that initial education of the population fa-
vored modernization (Lipset, 1960). Interestingly, the coefficient on lnSubDens becomes smaller
in magnitude and loses its statistical significance when we control for school rates in 1876 (col 3).
Recall that an important part of the variation in school rates in 1876, in turn, is explained by his-
torical subscriber density (Table 6, col 2). These two results in combination thus suggests that the
density of knowledge elites fostered modernization at the local level by promoting the expansion
of mass education.28
  27
      In 1848, the suffrage was extended to all resident male citizens in France. Thus, the results from the 1876 election
reflect the political preference of the (male) population overall, rather than just a small subset with voting rights.
   28
      In an exploratory 2-stage-least-square analysis, we use the variation in school rates that is predicted by knowledge
elites (controlling for all variables used in Table 8, including initial literacy). The first stage is strong, with an F-
statistic of 20.8. The second stage regresses the modernization index on predicted school rates in 1876, documenting a

4.4 Confounding Factors
In this section, we check whether our results may be driven by the demand for skilled labor in more
industrialized areas. In particular, Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015) have shown that knowledge
elites are strongly associated with industrialization in France. If industrialization needed qualified
workers, then the relationship between knowledge elites and schooling may reflect underlying
(and unobserved) skill demand. However, the timeline of our results makes this unlikely: Skills of
the workforce overall became important only during the Second Industrial Revolution (Galor and
Moav, 2006). This stage of industrialization began in France after 1870, and thus after most of
our outcomes are measured (Mokyr, 1999). Nevertheless, one may argue that demand for worker
skills increased gradually in the period leading up to the Second Industrial Revolution. To address
this possibility, we provide indirect evidence for an earlier period. Table 9 uses district level wages
in 1839-47 as a proxy for productivity.29 The presence of knowledge elites before 1780 is a strong
predictor of wages about 60 years later (col 1). In addition, the school rate in 1837 is also strongly
positively related with wages. This latter relationship suggests that there was a school premium –
areas with more education saw higher wages on average. Note, however, that for the skill premium
to confound our results in the way discussed above, it would have to be stronger in more industrial
areas, which in turn are areas with thicker knowledge elites. In other words, for skill demand to
confound our results, the skill premium would need to be higher in areas with thicker knowledge
elites. We check this in column 2, by including an interaction term between the school rate and
lnSubDens. We find a small, negative, and insignificant coefficient. Thus, if anything, the skill
premium was lower in areas with thicker knowledge elites. This holds also when we include
additional controls in column 3. This finding is compatible with the fact that early industrialization
was mostly skill-replacing. Thus, knowledge elites (who fostered early industrialization in France)
likely adopted technology that had relatively higher demand for unskilled labor, thus reducing the
skill premium.
    In columns 4 and 5, we provide further evidence along these lines by splitting the sample into
modern and old sectors.30 We find that the direct relationship between knowledge elites and wages
was much stronger in modern sectors (i.e., those that saw rapid innovation during the First Indus-
trial Revolution). In addition, the interaction term between schooling and lnSubDens is signifi-

strong, positive, and significant relationship. We refer to this analysis as ‘exploratory’ because the exclusion restriction
is unlikely to hold: we do not claim that knowledge elites affected modernization only through schooling. Instead,
schooling is one likely mechanism behind the elite-modernization relationship.
   29
      We derive wage data by industry sector and arrondissement from the firm-level data by Chanut, Heffer, Mairesse,
and Postel-Vinay (2000).
   30
      The definition of ‘modern’ and ‘old’ sectors follows from the data on ‘inventive output’ in Nuvolari and Tartari
(2011). See Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015, Section V.C.) for a detailed description.

cantly negative in modern sectors. This supports the interpretation that knowledge elites fostered
the adoption of modern, skill replacing technology before 1850. In turn, our findings make it un-
likely that the presence of knowledge elites had an indirect effect on schooling by raising the skill
premium and thereby incentivizing workers to obtain education, or by incentivizing industrialists
to augment the supply of schooling.

5 Conclusions
A large literature has debated the factors that drive modernization – the process of economic de-
velopment that goes hand-in-hand with democratization and the expansion of education. Previous
explanations have typically assumed a latent demand in the population for democratization and
education. We began by documenting the demand for modernization at the eve of the French
Revolution, using letters of grievances (Cahiers de Doléances) addressed to King Louis XVI. We

                                                       25
found that this demand was astonishingly small among the lower social classes. At the same time,
however, there was a strong relationship between the local presence of knowledge elites (prox-
ied by subscriptions to the famous Encyclopédie in 1777-80) and demand for modernization. We
then turned to the post-Revolution period and documented a strong correlation between knowledge
elites and the expansion of education after 1830 – the period during which the central government
pursued major schooling reforms. We also showed that the presence of knowledge elites was
strongly associated with other indicators of modernization and state-building in the mid-19th cen-
tury: the share of French-speaking school children, association density, and votes for progressive
political parties. These findings support the hypothesis that knowledge elites played an important
role in the modernization of France. They fostered the implementation of education policies at
the local level. Education, in turn, provided the basis for other dimensions of modernization, such
as state building, progressive political views, and social capital. In sum, our findings suggest that
enlightened elites had a latent demand for modernization already before the French Revolution,
and that they fostered modernization once the political environment after the Revolution allowed
for their active involvement. Thus, our results point to an interesting interaction between the local
demand for societal change and aggregate institutions that seek to promote modernization.
    In the context of the literature that has studied the relationship between inequality and de-
velopment, our findings suggest a novel angle. Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) have argued that
inequality can hamper development by favoring the development of institutions that entrench elites
and restrict economic opportunities for the masses. Our findings, in contrast, suggests that the type
of elites is crucial for whether they hamper or foster economic development. In particular, we find
that enlightened elites are positively associated with the expansion of education to the masses and
other proxies for modernization. Our findings also relate to the role of institutions that are put in
place by elites (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012). Our findings suggest that enlightened elites are
more likely to foster the development of inclusive (as opposed to extractive) institution. This opens
the door for future research to examine the relationship between the type of elites in power and
economic development more systematically and across countries.
