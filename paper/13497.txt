                                              ABSTRACT

In the past few years, YouTube and other sites for sharing video files over the Internet have vaulted
from obscurity to places of centrality in the media landscape. The files available at YouTube include
a mix of user-generated video and clips from network television shows. Networks fear that availability
of their clips on YouTube will depress television viewing. But unauthorized clips are also free advertising
for television shows. As YouTube has grown quickly, major networks have responded by making
their content available at their own sites. This paper examines the effects of authorized and unauthorized
web distribution on television viewing between 2005 and 2007 using a survey of Penn students on
their tendencies to watch television series on television as well as on the web. The results provide
a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use YouTube and related sites. While I find
some evidence of substitution of web viewing for conventional television viewing, time spent viewing
programming on the web -- 4 hours per week -- far exceeds the reduction in weekly traditional television
viewing of about 25 minutes. Overall time spent on network-controlled viewing (television plus network
websites) increased by 1.5 hours per week.

        In the past few years, YouTube and other sites for sharing video files over the

Internet have vaulted from obscurity to places of centrality in the media landscape.

YouTube allows users to post video files up to 10 minutes in length or 100 megabytes in

size available to anyone at any time. Founded in February 2005, YouTube was named

Time Magazine’s Invention of the Year for 2006 and is now among the top 10 sites on the

Internet.

        The files available at YouTube include a mix of user-generated video and clips

from network or studio-created fare. Networks fear that users will view clips on

YouTube instead of watching through conventional channels, depressing television

viewing. But YouTube might instead help them. Unauthorized clips are, in one sense,

free advertising for television shows. Given the serial nature of television programming,

with episodes as complements for one another, the availability of easily accessible clips

online could stimulate conventional television viewing.

        Another possible effect of unauthorized web distribution is also benign for

networks: those viewing material on YouTube might otherwise not have watched

television. While their viewership of unauthorized files might not simulate conventional

viewership, it may represent a gain to consumers without offsetting losses to the content

creators.

        As YouTube has grown quickly, major networks have responded by making their

content available at authorized online sites. As of July 10, 2007, abc.com offered full

episodes of about 20 series. Four recently-aired episodes of Grey’s Anatomy are

available as are four episodes of Lost. CBS, NBC, Fox, and Comedy Central also offer

their shows online. Network sites differ from unauthorized sites in that they offer full




                                             1
episodes rather than the excerpts available at, say, YouTube. The network web offerings

also include advertising.

        The possibility that content available on the web may either stimulate or depress

television viewing is by now familiar from the debates over the effect of file sharing in

music and movies.1 Here, as in the examples of music and movies, the question of

whether authorized or unauthorized web distribution stimulates or cannibalizes

conventional television consumption is an empirical one. The serial nature of television

programming – and the attendant complementarity across episodes of a series – give the

suggestion that web distribution stimulates television viewing a veneer of plausibility.

        To measure such effects, I have undertaken a survey, asking students on a college

campus about their habits in viewing television as well as video on the web. The results

of the survey provide a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use

YouTube and related sites. I am able to provide answers to the following questions:

        1) What unauthorized and authorized sites do people use for video?

        2) How much time they spend watching various forms of web video and

            traditional television?

        3) Which shows are most commonly viewed on the web as opposed to on

            television?

        4) Do authorized and unauthorized web video use displace conventional

            television use?

        The question of whether YouTube stimulates or cannibalizes interest in

conventional television viewing gained additional prominence in March of 2007 when

Viacom sued Google (YouTube’s parent) for $1 billion dollars in damages. According to

Viacom’s complaint, 100,000 of its clips were available at YouTube, and users had

viewed these clips 1.5 billion times (see Helft and Fabrikant, 2007). In its filing Viacom

charged that the “recent $1.65 billion acquisition price for YouTube reflects the website’s

enormous popularity. YouTube’s value, however, is built largely on the unauthorized

appropriation and exploitation of copyrighted works belonging to others, especially

Plaintiffs. As a result, a large part of YouTube’s value is directly attributable to the

availability of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works on YouTube’s website.”2 The damages that

Viacom suggests in its complaint depend on whether clips viewed at YouTube

cannibalize or stimulate authorized viewing of Viacom’s properties.

        This paper proceeds in three sections. Section 1 provides context and theoretical

background. Section 2 describes the underlying survey and the resulting data used in the

study. Section 3 presents results. A brief conclusion follows.



        I. Context and Theoretical Background

        YouTube was founded in February 2005 and has grown very rapidly. Ranked by

daily traffic from Alexa.com users, YouTube grew from obscurity – a rank of roughly

100,000th – in mid 2005 to nearly the top 100 by the start of 2006 (Figure 1).3 Between

January 2006 and July 2006, monthly unique audience grew from 4.9 million to 19.6

million visitors, according to Nielsen.4 Time Magazine named YouTube the Best

Invention of 2006 in November 2006.5 By late 2006 YouTube was in the top 10, where it

has remained through mid 2007. According to Alexa.com, YouTube was the 5th most

popular site on the web on July 10, 2007.6

        Apart from filing the lawsuit described in the introduction, the networks have

responded to YouTube’s emergence mainly by making their programming available

online in various authorized forms. In late 2005 ABC and then NBC began selling

episodes of popular shows on iTunes (Pennington, 2006). In early 2006 CBS began to

offer episodes of its popular shows for sale at Google’s Video Store (Mills, 2006). Even

as they were trying to sell episodes online, they were also experimenting with free

authorized distribution. Late in 2005, networks experimented with free streaming content

at their websites. CBS “streamed episodes of “Two and a Half Men” and “How I Met

Your Mother” on Yahoo!” during a “Christmas break experiment” that “increased

viewership for the two shows on the network,” according to CBS Entertainment President

Nina Tassler (Pennington, 2006).

        A few months later the networks changed their strategies, making programming

available for streaming free online (Grand Rapids Press, 2006). In May 2006, ABC

became the first network to offer full-length episodes online (Petrecca, 2006). By the fall

of 2006 - with the dawn of the 2006-2007 television season – all of the major networks

were offering multiple shows online without charge (Zap2It.com, 2006). Many observers

viewed this strategy as a “response to the popularity of digital recording devices and

piracy issues that major network broadcasters are facing.”7

          The rapid growth of both authorized and unauthorized distribution of network’s

video content on the web between 2005 and 2007 makes this period an auspicious one for

documenting effects of web distribution on viewership of network content on television

viewing. The growth in programming viewed on the web in this period reflects newly

available supply and is exogenous to the users. The changes in the environment over this

period subject intense web users – such as on-campus college students – to a natural

experiment: What happens to conventional television viewing of people who are now

able to view clips or shows at various authorized or unauthorized websites?

          Video obtained over YouTube differs from music or movie file sharing in that

YouTube literally provides excerpts, while music and movie file sharing typically

provide an unauthorized user with a complete copy of the file in question. While a music

downloader might be moved by his conscience to purchase a legal copy of a song, he gets

very little direct benefit from making this purchase once he has downloaded a copy.

Similarly, because most movie file sharing is done via copied DVDs, the possessor of a

pirated copy has little to gain, save perhaps a salved conscience, from purchasing a movie

he has already obtained without payment.

          Here, though, some of the video available for viewing on the web is of poor

quality by design. YouTube hosts video, and the clips are no more than ten minutes or

                                                    5
100 megabytes in length.8 The video of television content at network websites is of

higher quality, but like the unauthorized videos at YouTube, it is streamed and can only

be watched on a computer. Perhaps more important than their poor quality, episodes can

serve as complements for one another: watching one episode or excerpt online can

elevate a viewer’s interest in seeing other episodes through authorized channels (on

television or at a network website).9 Hence, it is far more plausible – here than in music

or movies – to suppose that web distribution use might stimulate demand for

conventional or authorized television viewing.

        Even if web distribution use does not stimulate conventional television viewing,

there is reason to think - more than in music or movies – that web distribution use would

not displace conventional television viewing. Unauthorized web distribution allows users

to time-shift their video viewing even if they lack a digital video recorder or VCR.

Moreoever, web distribution allows viewing on a computer rather than a television. Thus

it allows viewing by people unavailable when programming is aired as well as people

without ready access to a television set.

        The question of whether web distribution stimulates or depresses conventional

television viewing has two parts, both of which may be analyzed with a simple demand

curve. First, there is the question of whether the viewing on the web would otherwise

have occurred if viewers only had access to conventional television. Consider the

demand curve in Figure 1 that shows potential viewers’ willingness to “pay” to view

programming over conventional television. The price here is largely metaphoric given

that programming is mostly free, at least at the margin. For our purposes, the price

 This observation has multiple theoretical antecedents, including Shapiro and Varian (1999), Varian
(2000), and Bakos, Brynjolfsson, and Lichtman (1999).


                                                    6
consists of the willingness to watch commercials and viewers’ ability to schedule their

lives to be available when programming is broadcast.

         Prior to the availability of web distribution, viewers watch q0 shows, enjoying

some consumer surplus of CS while networks get revenue proportional to REV.10 There

is also some deadweight loss (DWL), in that some programming would be watched if

viewers could time-shift and/or avoid commercials.

         The effect of web availability depends on whether users watch programming they

would already have watched (i.e. if their valuations exceed the “price”). If viewers watch

on the web in instances in which their valuations exceed the price, web distribution will

cannibalize conventional viewing. On the other hand, if web viewings is drawn from the

region of the viewer demand curve where valuations fall short of the price p0, then web

distribution will raise consumption without reducing television viewing.

         Because of the serial nature of many programs, watching an episode (or an

excerpt) on the web can stimulate interest in watching other episodes of the same show

on television. This shifts the demand curve out, perhaps raising the number of instances

in which people “pay” for conventional television. The higher valuation function raises

the number of instances in which consumers would be willing to watch television, but

because they have the option of viewing on the web instead, it’s not clear whether

television viewing will rise. The availability of programming on the web has a

theoretically ambiguous effect on the use of conventional television.




10
  The revenue received by networks is not literally the region REVdepicted in Figure 1. Instead, it is a
rectangle that equals the product of q0 and the price per viewer for advertising, which is generally not equal
to the value of the programming to the viewer.


                                                      7
       II. Data

       The data for this study come from a survey administered on the campus of the

University of Pennsylvania in May 2007. The survey was given to 287 persons on

campus, who were asked about their use of television and the web for viewing television

programming.

       They were asked how often they watch video over the web, which authorized (e.g.

abc.com) and unauthorized (e.g. YouTube) video sites they use, how many weekly hours

they spent watching conventional television, video at authorized websites, and video at

unauthorized websites during the 2006-07 television season. I also asked them to

indicate which shows they watched. For each series they indicated viewing mode (on

television, authorized web sites, unauthorized web sites) and frequency (watched through

that mode sometimes or frequently). I asked for this series-level enumeration for both the

2006-07 season just ending as well as for the previous television season (2005-06).

       The resulting data include the numbers of shows that respondents frequently or

sometimes watch via one of three modes: on television, on the web via authorized sites

(such as abc.com), or unauthorized for both the 2006-07 season and the preceding 2005-

06 season.

       Respondents listed up to six sites that they use to view television programming.

YouTube was by far the most common response: 244 of 283 respondents listed YouTube

first. Other unauthorized sites mentioned repeatedly include tv-links.co.uk, peekvid.com,

and bittorrent. Authorized sites, including abc.com, nbc.com, fox.com, cbs.com, and

cnn.com, are also mentioned frequently.




                                            8
           Which shows do people watch on which media? The shows most frequently

viewed on television include Grey’s Anatomy, Entourage, and The Daily Show. The

shows most frequently viewed via authorized web sites include Grey’s Anatomy, Lost,

and The Daily Show. The shows most frequently viewed unauthorized on the web

include The Daily Show, South Park, and Scrubs.

           In both seasons, traditional television remains the most popular method of

viewing television content. Respondents report spending a mean (median) of 4.5 (3)

hours watching conventional television per week, compared with 3.8 (1) hours of

authorized web video and 3.0 (1) hour of unauthorized web video, during the 2006-07

television season.11 The numbers of series watched via each medium mirror the hours

breakdowns. Table 1 reports the number of shows viewed either frequently or sometimes

via each of the three modes during the two seasons. Of 223 persons with valid data for

both seasons, respondents watched an average of 2.62 series on television (either

sometimes or frequently) during the 2005-06 season, compared with 0.48 shows at

authorized web sites and 0.53 at unauthorized web sites.

           Between the two seasons, however, growth in viewing via the web far outstripped

growth in television viewing (see Table 1). The number of series (sometimes or

frequently) viewed unauthorized on the web grew by 96 percent, and authorized web

viewing grew even more, by 188 percent. Over the same period, the number of series

viewed on conventional television in the sample grew by only 11 percent. The sharp

growth in web viewing between the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons among survey

respondents reflects the overall growth in YouTube and network-authorized web

distribution over this period detailed above.
11
     The survey asked about weekly viewing hours only for the most recent (2006-07) season.


                                                      9
              During the 2006-07 season, television accounted for 72 percent of series that

respondents viewed (sometimes or frequently), and this share fell to 55 percent in the

following season. In this sample nearly half of series viewed are viewed via the web in

the second season. This change in the use of the web is an important source of variation I

will use to measure the impact of web distribution on conventional television viewing.

              ABC, FOX, and NBC are the most watched networks in the 2005-06 season

among the survey respondents. For every network TV viewing is more prevalent than

either authorized or unauthorized web distribution. In the later season ABC, FOX, and

NBC remain the most watched on television among these respondents. Authorized web

viewing rises sharply across the board and most sharply at ABC where respondents watch

as many series on abc.com as on television.

              The rapid growth of authorized web viewing in the sample suggests that the

networks have been successful at undermining the relative appeal of unauthorized

distribution. This should not be too surprising given the quality of the viewing

experience at, say, abc.com in contrast to YouTube. Abc.com offers full episodes with

high picture quality, albeit with some commercials, while unauthorized sites either stream

with low resolution (e.g. YouTube) or – for sites used less frequently for viewing

television programs – require actual downloading (e.g. BitTorrent).



       III.      Empirical Strategy and Results

              We have two broad strategies for determining whether the use of new modes of

distribution displaces traditional television viewing.12 First, we can ask whether those

who watch more web video watch less television, for example using the measures of
12
     These strategies mirror those adopted in Rob and Waldfogel (2006, forthcoming).


                                                     10
hours spent during the 2006-07 television season. An obvious shortcoming with this

approach is that those who watch a lot of television series on one outlet may watch a lot

on the other simply because they like television series, rather than because one

complements or stimulates the other.

       Still, it’s worth looking at simple statistics: The raw correlation of weekly hours

spent watching television and authorized web video in 2006-07 is 0.07, and the

correlation of television hours with hours spend watching unauthorized web video is 0.11

(in both cases insignificantly different from zero). The data on series rather than hours

reveal similarly non-negative relationships among viewing by different modes.

Aggregating the number of series viewed sometimes and those viewed frequently, TV

and authorized web viewing are significantly positively related in both seasons, as are

authorized and unauthorized web series viewing in 2005-06. That is, people watching

more series on television also watch more at authorized web sites. In the earlier season,

people watching more series at authorized web sites also watched more at unauthorized

sites. The positive relationships between viewing via different modes are consistent with

unobserved heterogeneity (people who like television shows enjoy them via multiple

media) but could also reflect complementary between viewing among different modes.

        Distinguishing intense from casual use – series viewed frequently from those

viewed only sometimes – via each mode produces somewhat different results. While

many correlations remain positive – between the number of series viewed on TV

frequently and the number sometimes viewed via authorized web sites, between

sometimes authorized and frequent television, between sometimes authorized and

sometimes unauthorized – others are significantly negative, notably the relationship




                                            11
between the number of series frequently viewed via unauthorized channels and the

number viewed on television. Given the looming concern of unobserved heterogeneity in

this context, these negative correlations provide interesting suggestive evidence of

substitution.

         1. Cross Sectional Approach

         Regressions provide a more systematic way of analyzing these data, via the

following statistical model:

         TVi = X i β + α 1WFi + α 2WS i + ε i , where (suppressing the individual’s subscript)

         TV = number of series watched (sometimes or frequently) on conventional

television during a season,

         WF = number of series watched frequently at authorized or unauthorized web

sites,

         WS = number of series watched sometimes at authorized or unauthorized web

sites,

         X = characteristics of the respondent (age, gender, etc.), and

         ε = unobserved determinant’s of the respondents’ television viewing.

In this model the unobserved heterogeneity problem is the concern is that ε is correlated

with AU and UN, for example because of unobserved tastes for television viewing.

         We can decompose TV into the separate numbers of series watched frequently

(TVF) and sometimes (TVS), where TV = TVF + TVS. We can also disaggregate frequent

and sometime web viewing into authorized and unauthorized components:

WFi = UNFi + AUFi , and




                                               12
WS i = UNS i + AUS i , where the prefixes “UN” and “AU” refer to unauthorized and

authorized viewing. Then we can also estimate a more flexible set of models:

TVFi = X i β F + λ1UNFi + λ 2UNS i + λ3 AUFi + λ 4 AUS i + ε iF , and

TVS i = X i β S + θ1UNFi + θ 2UNS i + θ 3 AUFi + θ 4 AUS i + ε iS .

This allows frequent and casual viewing over the web to bear different relationships to

the numbers of series viewed frequently, and casually, on television. Moreover, it allows

us to distinguish effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution on television.

         Table 2 presents regressions of the numbers of television series watched, either

sometimes or frequently, on television viewing on age, gender, and measures of the

numbers of series watched on authorized and unauthorized web sites for the 2005-06

season. The dependent variable in the first column aggregates both series watched

frequently and sometimes on television in the 2005-06 season. The number of series

watched on television bears a negative and significant relationship to the number of series

viewed on the web (-0.34) and a positive and significant relationship to the number

viewed sometimes on the web (0.39). The next two columns examine the two constituent

parts of the total number of series viewed on television, those viewed frequently (TVF)

and those viewed sometimes (TVS). For the 2005-06 season, web viewings’ relationships

with total series watched operate largely through relationships with the number of series

watched frequently on television: the coefficients in column (2) are large and significant,

while the coefficients in column (3) are indistinguishable from zero.

        The latter half of Table 2 repeats the exercise of the first three columns with

independent variables disaggregated to allow different coefficients on authorized and

unauthorized web viewing. While significance levels decline, we cannot reject the



                                                13
hypotheses of coefficients on authorized and unauthorized web viewing, equation by

equation.

        Table 3 repeats the exercise of Table 2 for the latter (2006-07) season. The first

column’s frequent web viewing coefficient in the total series television viewing equation,

-0.34 in the previous season, is now -0.10 and insignificant. The sometime web viewing

coefficient in the same equation rises from 0.39 in the previous season to 0.48. In the

latter season, frequent and sometime web viewing continue to have significant positive

and negative coefficients, respectively, in explaining frequent television viewing (col 2),

but both frequent and sometime web viewing have statistically significant coefficients in

explaining sometime television viewing (col 3).

        Disaggregating web viewing into authorized and unauthorized yields somewhat

different results for 2006-07 relative to the previous season. While authorized and

unauthorized web distribution had statistically indistinguishable coefficients in the earlier

season, in 2006-07 unauthorized distribution measures have consistently more negative

or less positive coefficients in explaining total and frequent television viewing.

        The cross sectional results contain distinctive positive and negative coefficients.

Given the underlying concern that unobserved heterogeneity would induce positive

relationships, it is difficult to interpret the positive coefficients as evidence of

complementarity. Still, two results are interesting. First, the negative coefficients in

Tables 2 and 3 are more convincingly suggestive of substitution. Second, the distinctions

between apparent effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution in the latter

season suggest that unauthorized distribution exerts a larger substituting effect.




                                               14
       2. Longitudinal Approach

       A second approach is to use the variation across individuals in the change over

time in their web and television video use. That is, we can estimate the model:

ΔTVis = α 0 + α 1 ΔWFis + α 2 ΔWS is + ε is (or its analogues that disaggregate frequent and

casual viewing), where variables are defined as above except that an observation is

corresponds to a season (s). This model “differences out” the unobservable person effect

in conventional television viewing that is potentially correlated with viewing at

authorized and unauthorized websites.

       The modeling approach asks whether those with larger growth in viewing of

television series at either authorized or unauthorized sites experience larger decreases –

or smaller increases – in television use. Figure 3 plots the inter-season change in the

number of series watched frequently on television (on the vertical axis) against that

change in the number of series viewed frequently at unauthorized web sites (on the

horizontal axis). A negative relationship is evident. The correlation is -0.18 and

statistically significantly negative. Figure 4 repeats the exercise replacing unauthorized

with frequent authorized website viewing on the horizontal axis. Again, a negative

relationship is evident. The correlation is -0.17 and significant. Both frequent authorized

and frequent unauthorized series viewing on the web bear significant negative

relationships with the number of series viewed frequently on conventional television.

       Table 4 reports regressions of the change in series watched on television on

changes in series viewed on the web. The table has the same organization as Tables 2

and 3, although variables are now in changes rather than levels. The dependent variable

in the first and second columns is the combined number of series watched sometimes or



                                             15
frequently on television. Column (1) presents a regression of the change in the number of

series watched on television on the change in the numbers of series viewed frequently

and sometimes on the web. Neither frequent nor sometime web viewing has a significant

coefficient, although the sometime coefficient (0.17) is nearly twice its standard error. In

column (2) explaining the change in series watched frequently on television, frequent

web viewing gets a negative (-0.31) and significant coefficient that is similar to its cross

section analogues (-0.3 to -0.4), while sometime web viewing gets an insignificant

coefficient that contrasts with its positive and significant cross sections analogues (0.3).

In column (3) explaining the change in series watched sometimes on television both

frequent and sometime web viewing measures have positive and significant coefficients

similar to their cross sectional analogues, particularly those for 2006-07.

       The latter half of the table allows authorized and unauthorized web viewing to

have different coefficients. For the most part, authorized and unauthorized web viewing

coefficients are statistically indistinguishable, but while unauthorized web series viewing

bears no relationship to sometime television viewing, authorized web viewing has a

positive and significant coefficient of 0.30.

       An additional series viewed frequently via unauthorized and authorized web

channels reduces the number of series viewed frequently on television but increases the

number of shows viewed sometimes on television. Evaluating equations (2) and (3) from

Table 4 at the mean values of frequent and sometimes web viewing in the latter season,

reduces the number of series viewed frequently on television (TVF) by 0.36, while they

increase the number of series viewed sometimes on television (TVS) by 0.55.




                                                16
       Determining the overall effect of the web viewing on conventional television

requires a way of comparing the amount of viewing associated with series viewed

“frequently” and “sometimes.” Because we have data on the number of hours

respondents spend in all three modes of viewing in the second season, we can run a

regression of, say, weekly hours of conventional television viewing on the numbers of

series watched frequently and sometimes, respectively. That is, we can run the

regression:

       TVHoursi = π 0 + π 1TVFi + π 2TVS i + ε i .

The coefficients π1 and π2 from this regression map sometime and frequent television

viewing of series into weekly hours. They have the interpretation that each additional

series viewed frequently adds π1 hours to weekly television viewing while each additional

series viewed sometimes adds π2 hours to weekly viewing.

       Table 5 presents results. The first two columns report a linear regression and a

median regression, respectively, for television. The next 2 columns repeat the exercise

for authorized web viewing, and the final two columns for unauthorized web viewing.

The first column indicates that an additional sometimes-watched series adds about half an

hour to weekly television viewing, while an additional frequently-watched series adds

over twice as much. The latter number is difficult to take literally, since few programs

are broadcast for over an hour per week. Still, it is comforting that the frequently

coefficient exceeds the sometimes coefficient.

       The overall effect on television hours can then be estimated as

ΔTVHours = π 1 ΔTVF + π 2 ΔTVS .




                                             17
Using the mean estimates of π1 and π2 from column 1, the answer is a quarter of an hour

(-0.24), which is 5 percent of the mean value of TV hours, 4.53 hours. Thus, web

distribution has on balance, reduced television viewing hours in this sample by 5 percent.

Separating the effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution, unauthorized

accounts for 69 percent of the reduction.

            While television hours decline slightly, total hours viewing network video content

rise overall because of the series viewing at authorized and unauthorized web sites. We

can use the hours regressions in the remainder of Table 5 to calculate the additional hours

of associated with the authorized and unauthorized web viewing in the 2006-07 season.

Additional hours of weekly viewing of authorized web video are 1.78, 13 while the

change in unauthorized web viewing hours is 2.26 hours per week. Thus, overall web

viewing rises by 4.04 hours per week, far offsetting the 0.24 hour reduction in weekly

television viewing in the sample. Hours of network-controlled viewing rise by 1.54 per

week (a 1.78 hour increase in network authorized web viewing in conjunction with a 0.24

hours reduction in traditional television viewing).

            Much of these respondents’ viewing would not have occurred absent web

distribution. Using the demand framework introduced earlier, the additional consumption

represents some combination of reduced deadweight loss of traditional distribution and

demand stimulation effected by web distribution.



            Conclusion

     This is calculated as   π 1AU AUF 06 / 07 + π 2AU AUS 06 / 07 =   2.14(0.57)+0.68(0.82).

       The empirical literature on file sharing in music and movies has, for the most part,

found depressing effects of web distribution on legal sales. We too find significant

depressing effects of web distribution on conventional television viewing, but we also

document largely offsetting positive relationships, reflecting complementarity.

       Overall, conventional television viewing is reduced slightly in this sample, while

overall viewing of network programming rises substantially. Hours spent viewing

television programming overall nearly double with web distribution. While conventional

television viewing falls by about 5 percent, this is more than offset by increases in time

spent viewing network-authorized web programming.

       The networks’ own web distribution has smaller but similar effects as the

unauthorized distribution on conventional television viewing. Of course, in the network

efforts, the network broadcasts advertising, so the loss the traditional viewing is at least

partially offset by online ad revenue.

       This study has examined the relationship between web viewing and conventional

television viewing for a small group of media users on a college campus. This is a good

population for study, given its intense computer use. Relationships documented in this

sample may offer a glimpse of relationships that will hold for a more general population

as broadband continues to spread. But it bears repeating that this sample is not

representative of the US population generally. Wider-scale sampling would be very

useful for determining typical effects of web distribution of television programming on

television viewing.
