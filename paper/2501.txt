                         The Baby Booms Legacy:
                    Relative Wages in the 21st Century




                                ABSTRACT




     This paper assesses the impact of the post MMII baby boom on
relative wages, when this baby boom cohort becomes the oldest segment

of the workforce.    Time series data are used to estimate a model of the
demand for workers in eight age/sex groupings.           Using these estimates,
we simulate relative wages in the year 2020 assuming the age/sex

composition of the workforce behaves according to projections. The
results are used to examine the baby boom's potential impact on wages
of older, prime-age, and teenage workers, as well as the anticipated

wage gap between males and females.

                            THE BABY BOOM'S LEGACY:
                       RELATIVE WAGES IN THE 21ST CENTURY

        The economic impact of the large cohort born between 1946 and 1964

has been explored by several researchers.         Analysis to date focuses
mainly on the downward pressure on baby boomer's wages as their cohort
entered the labor force (cf. Freeman, 1979; Russell, 1982; Welch,

1979)   -   The present paper extends this literature by assessing the baby
booms       impact on relative wages in the year 2020 when this generation

will be the oldest segment of the workforce.
        Several important   public policy questions are addressed.    First,

will the changing demographic structure decrease the relative wages of

prime-age workers? If so, there may be justification        for social policy

encouraging early retirement        among those age 55+ to lessen downward
pressure on prime—age workers' wages.        A second question that the
research addresses is, how will the graying of the workforce affect

teeenage workers wages? Because teens' wages and school attendance are
linked, pay reductions      may influence their investments in human capital
and future earnings potential (Ehrenberg and Marcus, l982.           Finally,

we investigate whether changing age structures are predicted to affect
the female/male wage gap forty years hence.

        The analysis uses national time series data (from 1955 to 1984) to
estimate an econometric model of the demand for workers in eight
different     age/sex categories.    Labor groups analyzed by sex are teens

(age 16—19), young workers      (age 20—34), mature workers (age 35—54) and

older workers (age 55+) .      Estimated coefficients are employed to
predict changes in relative wages to the year 2020, when the youngest
of the baby boom group will be over age 55.        Section I presents our

methodology and data, section II summarizes our elasticity estimates,
                                                                     2

section III describes    the policy simulstion and section IV draws

conclusions.



I.   Methodology and Date
        Mamermesh and Grant (1979) recommend using a production function

approach to compute how wages would change in response to changes in
factor quantities.     Rather than estimating a translog model directly,
we estimate the coefficients in the relevant output share equations.
In the empirical application below, cost shares will be utilized as the

dependent variable since in competitive equilibrium they are equal to
output shares.
        Estimated coefficients are used to compute elasticities of

complementacityand factor price elasticities.      Elasticity variances
are computed by applying the delta methodJ
        Coefficient estimates will also be employed in the policy
simulation to determine the total effect of a changing labor force on
relative wage rates. The effect of a quantity change (%A X) on wages
of labor subgroup i (%A   W)   is computed as:2

        %AW1=l/S1    (E?1   (%AX)]   —%itX±+ZS (%z%X),
where Si is the share of the 1th input to total cost and the         are

estimated translog coefficients.

        Like all production function models, the framework assumes that

input supply changes are exogenously determined.     We do not attempt to

relax this assumption since there exist few instruments in time series

data.    The likely effect of instrumenting has been shown to be

                                                                          3

negligible    in a study by Ehrenberg and Smith     (1987) though Borjas

(1986) finds that instrumenting     alters a few of his findings.

      The model is estimated with symmetry and homogeneity imposed.3

Imposing these cross—equationconstraints on the system of equations
implies that disturbance terms may be correlated across equations.

Thus the model is estimated using an iterative Seemingly Unrelated

Regressions    technique.
      Estimation requires data on the quantity of each labor input,

capital,    and each inputs share of total costs.          All variables are

annual national aggregates.4      Derivation of employment, hours, weeks,
and wage data is detailed in Freeman (1979)    .
                                                    Capital     quantity and
price data are taken from the MIT-Penn—SSRC        (MPS)    data bank.


:'.   Elasticity Estimates
      Table 1 presents statistically    significant substitutes and
complements    within all labor categories.5   Two conclusions emerge;

      1.    Most substitution occurs across gender for different age

categories.     Complementarityoccurs across age groups for a given

gender     (with the exception of teenagers)




3A test for symmetry and homogeneity is not rejected at the 5%

level.     Tests for separability of labor from capital and consistent
male and female aggregates are all rejected at conventional levels.

111.    Policy Simulation
     To determine the impact on relative wages caused by the aging of
the workforce, we apply the simulation formula above to our coefficient

estmates and projections of how the entire age distribution is likely
to change over time. Table 2 reports two projections of labor force

patterns between 1985 and 2020 by age/sex subgroup obtained from data

published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Social
Security Administration      (SSA)   .    Both series   are used in the empirical

analysis below since the magnitudes differ due to different

extrapolation methodologies. Both forecasts show the percentage of
older workers will increase substantially as the baby boom ages.
Predicted growth in female participation           also implies larger changes
for women than     men.   Changes in each labor      groups   wages are computed

allowing capital to vary as predicted.6
       Reported simulation results         (see Table 3) indicate the predicted

change in the wage of several labor subgroups            between 1985 and 2020.
If   labor   supply patterns behave according to projections,        the evidence
indicates that the aging of the workforce will have little effect on
the wage distribution by age.            While older workers' wages are predicted
to increase 1.2 to 5.6%, prime-age workers'             (mature and young) are

predicted    to increase a similar 4.4 to 7.8%.          This finding is contrary
to the notion that incentives for early retirement are needed to

protect prime-age workers' wages.

6The value of capital stock for 2020 is imputed from a regression of

actual capital stock from 1955 to 1984 on a tread variable.

      However, when we consider   males and females separately, we see

that prime—age women will be hurt relative to older workers.       The

predicted increase of 1.2 to 5.6% for older workers is contrasted with
a 10.8 to 15,7% decrease for prime—age women.      Female workers as a
whole will also be hurt in comparison with maleworkers.        While male

wages are predicted to increase 8.6 to 12.2%, female wages are
predicted to decrease 7.8 to 10.3%.     This result is driyen by prime—age

workers: among this age group, men's wages are forecasted to increase
11 to 14.9% and women's to decrease 10.8 to 15.7%.       As a result the

female/male   wage gap will rise by the year 2020, ceteris paribus.
      The analysis of teens remains inconclusive because of the large
differences   between SSA and BEA results,



I3L,....Conclusions

      Coefficients from a translog production function are used to

estimate demand elasticities and predict the relative wages of men and
women in the year 2020.    Our elasticity results indicate that, with the

exception of teens, substitution occurs across gander and
complementarityoccurs across age groups for a given gender.        Also, we

find several interdapendencies    with older workers:    older men are

complementary with young men and substitutable with teenage women,
while older women are substitutable with mature men.

      The simulation results indicate that wages of prime—age workers

will not deteriorate in relation to older worker's as a result of the

aging of the baby boom cohort.     Conclusions   for teens cannot be drawn.

The general result does not hold for women, however. Prime—age women

are predicted to lose in comparison with older workers and with men,

increasing rather than reducing wage differentials by sex, ceteris
psribus.

     From this we see that the only nonzero covariance is between the estimated


mean share and the fitst coefficient. But, since X = (e              x), the first



coefficient is just the constant term.


     This result also follows for estimates restricted by eynunetry and

The formula      for    cross—input      elasticities            of complementarity   evaluated   at

                       Cjj       h(ai.   j,                  i

        According to the delta method*, the estimate of cjj is asymptotically

unbiased and normally distributed with variance (Dh) V(Dh) where Oh is

the Jacobian of h.            In this case.

     This appendix derives a formula to compute relative wage changes
due to changes in the distribution of labor supply along the lines of
Ehrenberg and Smith (1987)   We adopt a general translog production

      where:         xj                th        input,
                      Y        =       output,

Rather than estimating this directly, we derive and estimate the
coefficients in the relevant share equations:

where Si = the share of the ith     input to total output.  In the
empirical application, cost shares are utilized since in competitive
equilibrium they are equal to output shares.

II.     Data Manipulations:

A.    Compute average weeks worked per     year for full time and part time
workers.
Using   data from 1969   Work Experience   of the Population      (following
Freeman,     1979), we computed a weighted average of weeks by age and
            JHR
sex for all FT and PT workers by sex.
B. Devise weekly hours of work Dec week for FT and PT workers.
Like Freeman (JNR 1979), we assume average hours of FT workers   40,
average hours of PT workers        20.

C. Compute money income of teens. ad-justed by the different coverage of
teenage oroups. 1955—84.  (1955—78 figures were for 14—19 year olds;
1979—on figures were for 15—19 year olds.)

This was done using CPR P—60 series by comparing earnings of FTFY
workers in 1978 versus 1979. Earnings excluding the 14 year old males
in 1979 were —2% (real) as compared to including the 14—year old males
in 1978; thus the correction multiplied male incomes for 1955—78 by
.98.  For females the difference was +5.4%, so the correction factor
for women was 1.06.
                                                                         16




D. Determine the number of full time and part time workers by age &
sex. 1955-84

     a. There are no readily available data on the number of full time
and part time workers in all years needed. (The SLFR has figures for-
only some years —— 1959—70, 1972—78, 1982; figures are not available
for 1955—58, 1971, 1979—81, 1983—5)
     However CPR P—GO series reports data by age/sex/year for % of full
time year round workers, which is used after adjusting by a correction
factor to "inflate" the figures.
     For three different years (1959, 1969, 1978) we computed the
relationship between (i) the % of full time year round workersofby age
and sex, and (ii) the % of full time workers.   The averages     the
ratios across the three years were fairly stable, and were as follows:
        male teens       =   4.28
        male (20—34)     =   1.43
        male (35—54)     =   1.20
        male (55+)       =   2.02
        female teens     =   7.73
        female (20—34)   =   2.20
        female (35—54)   =   1.70
        female (55+)     =   3.90
4e multiplied the % FTyear round by these corrrection factors to get a
time series on % full time by age and sex (and, by subtraction, % part
time)

     b. The next task was to obtain numbers of FT and PT workers by
age, sex, and year.
      (i)  # FT = % FT (from the last step) times the employment figures
[from Handbook of Labor Statistics 1985 (thru 1983) and Employment and
Earnings (for 1984)).
      (ii)  # PT = 4) Employed — 4) FT

     c. The final step was to adjust the employment figures for teens
to reflect the fact that from 1955—78 kids age 14—19 were included,
while from 1979 on, 15—19 year olds were included. Both figures were
adjusted to include only 16—19 year olds.
The Corrections could only use 1978 and 1979 data since other years did
not have all the numbers necessary for computing the factors.

The 1955—78 Correction 15 based on the fact that in 1978 there were 27%
fewer 16—19 year olds (from SLFR data) than 14—19 year—olds (CPR P—60)
The 1979—on correction factor is based on the finding that there were
24% fewer 16—19 year olds in 1978, than there were 15—19 year olds in
1979.

T1e correction factor for teens 1955—78 was hence .73, and .76 for 1979
forward.  These are multiplied by the 4) PT and 4) FT emploment figures
in the previous step.

E. Compute hourly wares for each aae/sex orouo 1955—84.
                                                                           17



For each age/sex/year, we divided money income of full time year round
workers as adjusted in C, by hours computed by multiplying annual weeks
of fuiltime workers in A by weekly hours in B

F. Compute total yearly hours worked for each age/sex group 1955—84.

This was equal to the hours computed by multiplying annual weeks in A
by weekly hours in B of full time and part time workers, weighted by
the number of full and time part time workers (from D)

      fS   computerized quarterly data file*
II.   Methodoloo3L:

     The object was   to   compute the quantity of   capital and its share of
total cost.

     1)  The MPS data set includes quarterly quantity of equipment and
quantity of structure variables in 1982 $. A single quantitythese
                                                              of
capital variable was created by taking the annual average of
variables and summing them.

     2>   To get cost shares, it is necessary to estimate the

rental rate. To get the rental rate, the       S
compensation paid no capital equal to the quantity of capital times rts
                                               data set includes
variables which measure the user cost of equipment and the user cost of
structures multiplied by the price index for equipment and structures,
respectively.   To get the rental rate, these two variables were first
divided by the appropriate price index and then aggregated to get
annual rates. Then a weighted average was computed to get one rental
rate for all capital.


*The user cost of structures" variable (RTPS) on the MI'S data set
contained unusual values for years prior to 1959. This was due to
unusual values in some of the price indices used in its computation
(PPSNV and PXXPFW1).  Hence the variable was recreated from the MI'S
data set using different price indices without these flaws. The help
of Flint Brayton of the Federal Reserve Board in diagnosing the problem
and recreating this variable is greatly appreciated.
