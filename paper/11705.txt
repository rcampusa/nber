                                            ABSTRACT

We examine the evolving structure of the U.S. hospital industry since 1970, focusing on how
ownership form influences entry and exit behavior. We develop theoretical predictions based on the
model of Lakdawalla and Philipson, in which for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals differ regarding
their objectives and costs of capital. The model predicts for-profits would be quicker to enter and
exit than not-for-profits in response to changing market conditions. We test this hypothesis using
data for all U.S. hospitals from 1984 through 2000. Examining annual and regional entry and exit
rates, for-profit hospitals consistently have higher entry and exit rates than not-for-profits.
Econometric modeling of entry and exit rates yields similar patterns. Estimates of an ordered probit
model of entry indicate that entry is more responsive to demand changes for for-profit than not-for-
profit hospitals. Estimates of a discrete hazard model for exit similarly indicate that negative demand
shifts increase the probability of exit more for for-profits than not-for-profits. Finally, membership
in a hospital chain significantly decreases the probability of exit for for-profits, but not not-for-
profits.

I. INTRODUCTION
       The hospital industry historically has been primarily composed of public and not-
for-profit hospitals. But over the last three decades, the share of both types of hospitals
has been failing as for-profits have taken over an increasing share of hospital activity (see
Table 1). Whether this will usher in changes in the behavior and performance of
hospitals depends on the extent to which for-profit hospitals behave differently than their
not-for-profit counterparts. The purpose of this paper is to focus on one aspect of
behavior that over the long run can have a considerable effect on an industry’s structure:
entry and exit decisions.
       A number of studies have explored differences in the behavior of for-profit and
not-for-profit hospitals. They have examined preferences for output (Newhouse,1970),
costs and efficiency [Lewin et al. (1981), Becker and Sloan (1985), Vitaliano, Toren
(1996), Zuckerman et al. (1994)], quality [Shortell and Hughes (1988), Keeler, (1992),
Mark(1996), Sloan et. al (2001)], pricing and market power [Gruber (1994), Lynk (1995),
Keeler (1999), Gaynor and Vogt (2003)], and provision of uncompensated care [(Norton
and Staiger,1994), Mann et. al (1995)]. Many of these studies do not find significant
differences in the behavior of for-profits and not-for-profits, and no consensus has yet
emerged as to whether ownership type is a major factor behind observed differences
when they do exist. A few studies have focused on the behavior of for-profits and not-
for-profits in response to decreases in demand, and here differences do seem to emerge.
Deily et al. (2000) find that less efficient hospitals were more likely to exit when
privately owned, and Hansmann et al. (2002) find that over the period 1985-1994 for-
profit hospitals adjusted their capacity more responsively to demand reductions than did
public or not-for-profit hospitals.
       The findings of Deily et al. (2000) and Hansmann et al. (2002) are suggestive that
the exit behavior of for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals differs, and we explore this in
considerable detail. We also analyze entry of for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals,
which has not been previously explored. Theoretical work by Lakdawalla and Philipson
(1998) demonstrates that if not-for-profits derive utility from greater quantity then they
will behave as if they have lower effective costs than for-profits. This can provide a
rationale for why not-for-profits appear to be less responsive to demand reductions than



                                                                                               1
for-profits. The same logic suggests that not-for-profits would also be quicker to enter in
response to demand growth, although we discuss how financial factors might impede the
growth of not-for-profits and make them less responsive to entry opportunities. To
explore how for-profit and not-for-profits respond to both growth and decline in demand,
we examine entry and exit behavior of both types of hospitals at the county level in
response to demand fluctuations.
           We implement our analysis by constructing a panel data set for all hospitals over
the period 1984-2000 that contains information for each hospital on its years of operation,
location, ownership status, and system membership. We first examine annual entry and
exit rates of for-profit and not-for-profits. These rates are positively correlated,
suggesting that both types of hospitals responded similarly to market developments. But
the annual entry and exit rates of for-profits were consistently higher than those for not-
for-profits, suggesting that for-profits were more responsive to both growth and decline
in demand.
           We next analyze entry and exit rates at the county level, linking them to
population changes and also market conditions relating to cost and profitability and to
certificate-of-need regulations that vary across states.1 We also control for whether
hospitals are part of systems. This might be expected to influence exit behavior based on
the findings of Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1998) and Disney, Haskel, and Heden
(2003) regarding differences in exit behavior of manufacturing plants that are and are not
part of multi-plant firms. We also test whether entrants had higher rates of exit than
incumbent firms, as is consistently found for manufacturing firms. Consistent with our
findings about overall entry and exit rates, we find that entry as well as exit was more
responsive to demand changes for for-profits than not-for-profits. System membership
also influenced entry and exit rates. Unlike the manufacturing sector, however, entrants
were not more likely to exit than older, incumbent firms.
           The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains the economic model
featuring the Lakdawalla and Philipson theory. It also discusses how the ability of not-
for-profits to expand into growing markets might be constrained by their limited ability to
raise capital. Section III presents the econometric model and Section IV describes the

data. Section V presents the results in three broad subsections. First, changes in the
structure of the U.S. hospital industry over the last three decades are described. Next
entry and exit at the national and regional level are analyzed. Then estimates of our
econometric model are presented. Section VI contains a summary and conclusions.


II. CONCEPTUAL MODEL
          Traditionally, not-for-profits are thought to derive utility from a number of factors
in addition to profits. Candidates include the quantity or quality of the services they
provide, care to the indigent, and physician revenue, among other factors (Newhouse,
1970; Pauly, 1978; Sloan, 2000). Lakdawalla and Philipson (1998) posit that not-for-
profits care primarily about two factors: profit and the quantity of services provided.
This implies a utility function for not-for-profits of U(x,π), where x denotes output and π
profit. Assuming hospitals choose a level of output that maximizes their utility, the first-
order condition for a maximum is:
Ux
   = −π x .                                                                            (2)
Uπ
Profits for a hospital are equal to revenue minus costs, both of which are a function of
output:
π = p( x) x − c( x) .                                                                  (3)
Differentiating profits w.r.t. output gives
π x = px x + p − cx .                                                                  (4)

Combining (2) and (4), we get
                  Ux
px x + p = cx −      .                                                                 (5)
                  Uπ
          The term on the right-hand-side of equation (5) is the effective marginal cost of a
not-for-profit. It equals the traditional marginal cost of production cx minus the implicit
value not-for-profits place on additional units of output. For-profit hospitals, in contrast,
are assumed to care only about profits. Then Ux equals 0 and the right-hand-side of (2)
simplifies to cx. Thus, in effect, not-for-profits have lower marginal costs than for-profits
because of their preference for output. This could be attributed to not-for-profits having a
goal of serving the community, with greater output the vehicle for providing greater


                                                                                                3
service2 . An alternative rationale for the lower effective costs of not-for-profits is that
they are less able or willing than for-profits at preventing their managers from indulging
their preferences (at the expense of profits). The inability to discipline managers could
arise due to the absence of residual claimants in the case of not-for-profits. For-profits, on
the other hand, have stockholder representatives on the board of directors, who are the
natural group to discipline managers.
         If indeed not-for-profits have lower marginal costs than for-profits, then it is easy
to see why for-profits would be the first to exit markets in which both for-profits and not-
for-profits participate. The same logic suggests that not-for-profits would be the first to
enter new markets that are growing—they will require a lower price than for-profits to
enter and thus might be expected to enter before for-profits.3 Indeed, taken to its
extreme, this logic questions why for-profit hospitals exist at all.
         One factor that can help explain the existence of for-profits is capital. If not-for-
profits indulge their preference for output, then they will earn lower profits than for-
profits, and hence earn a lower return on investment. They will then be at a disadvantage
in financing their operations unless they have preferential access to capital. Historically,
this has been the case. Prior to 1970, not-for-profits raised a considerable amount of their
capital from philanthropic sources, which provided them with an advantage. But
contributions to hospitals peaked in 1965 at $2.1 billion and by 1981 had fallen to $603
million in constant dollars (Sloan et al, 1990). Not-for-profit hospitals also benefited from
the federal Hill-Burton act, which subsidized not-for-profit and public hospital
investment. The other main advantage of not-for-profits in raising capital stems from
their ability to qualify as municipal borrowers. Lenders then do not have to pay federal,
state, or local tax on interest received, enabling not-for-profit hospitals to issue bonds at
lower interest rates than for-profits. Federal tax reform in 1986, however, eliminated
institutional investors’ deductions of carrying charges for holding tax exempt bonds,
reducing the spread between taxable and tax exempt bond yields (Grossman et al., 1983).
In addition, the General Accounting Office reported that by 1990 at least 17 states had

  Not-for-profit hospitals are often referred to as community hospitals, and many of them have the word
community in their title.

  In the Lakdawalla-Phillipson model, the number of not-for-profits is fixed, thus in their model for-profits
are more likely to enter growing markets.


                                                                                                            4
enacted or were considering legislation allowing not-for-profits favorable tax treatment
only if they provided charity care (Hassan et al., 2000). Consequently, in recent years
not-for-profits have found it increasingly costly to raise capital.
           If not-for-profits have been constrained in their ability to raise capital, then it
might be expected that for-profits would be more responsive to new opportunities for
growth. Existing not-for-profits already have capital, and if the capital was raised at
preferential rates then they might be expected to remain longer in declining markets than
for-profits in order to indulge their preference for output. This suggests that for-profits
might be more responsive both to increases and decreases in demand. They would be the
first to enter growing markets and the first to exit declining markets.
           Another factor that might bear on the responsiveness of hospitals to demand
changes is whether they are part of hospital systems. Hospitals that are part of systems
may have lower costs and greater access to capital (Levitz and Brooke, 1985; Carey,
2003; Cleverley, 1992). Lower costs would enable them to survive longer in declining
markets and thus be less likely to exit, all else equal. Lower costs would also enable
them to enter growing markets more quickly, which would be reinforced by their greater
access to capital. This suggests that entrants would be more likely than exiters to be part
of systems for both for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.


III. METHODS
           If all hospitals were identical other than regarding their ownership status, then
Lakdawalla-Philipson hypothesis suggests that in markets in which both ownership forms
coexist, for-profit hospitals will always be the marginal firm. Consequently, in response
to shifts in demand, for-profits would always enter and exit before not-for-profits4. But
in the presence of heterogeneity, high-cost for-profits might exit before lower-cost not-
for-profits, and similarly not-for-profits might be quicker to capture a particular growth
opportunity than for-profits. Accordingly, we test our hypothesis by comparing entry and
exit rates of for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
           We undertake three types of analyses. First, we describe broadly how the hospital
industry has evolved in recent years. We focus on differences between for-profits and

    The theory of Lakdawalla and Philipson implies that there is no entry or exit by not-for-profits


                                                                                                       5
not-for-profits, entrants/exiters and incumbent firms, system members and non-members,
and hospitals in different regions. We also consider the extent to which trends in the
hospital industry conform to patterns in other sectors, particularly the manufacturing
sector, which has been examined extensively using plant-level data.
        Second, we conduct an econometric analysis of entry. We use an ordered probit
model to test whether for-profit hospitals are more responsive to changes in the
profitability of entry than not-for-profit hospitals. Hospital entries in each county
between 1984 and 2000 are regressed on a measure of demand shift over the period and a
number of control variables. We use changes in the elderly population as our measure of
exogenous demand shifts. The elderly are heavy consumers of health care, so growth in
the elderly population should be highly correlated with growth in the demand for hospital
services. In most years, entry in a county is quite low and often zero. Accordingly, entry
is coded in four levels—zero, one, two, or three or more. Separate analyses are
conducted for for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. We expect that the effect of demand
growth on firm entry will be greater for for-profits.
        Third, we conduct an econometric analysis of exit. First, we perform a
difference-in-differences analysis of exit. We examine counties with only for-profit
hospitals, counties with only not-for-profit hospitals, and counties with both types of
hospitals. If for-profits are more likely to exit in response to decreases in demand, exit
rates should be greater for for-profits both in the single ownership counties and in the
mixed counties. Furthermore, in the mixed counties the difference between the exit rates
of for-profits and not-for-profits should be magnified if for-profits are the marginal firm.
Accordingly, we test whether the difference in exit rates for for-profit and not-for-profit
hospitals is greater in mixed than single-ownership counties.
        We also estimate a logit discrete hazard model of exit for each of the years 1985
to 2000, which allows us to control for other aspects of hospitals than their ownership
status that might influence exit. The model takes the form:
                Pijt
         ln              = X jt β c + X it β h ,
              1 − Pijt

where Pijt is the probability of hospital i in county j exiting in year t, X jt contains the

characteristics of county j at time t, and X it contains the characteristics of hospital i at


                                                                                                6
time t. Our key measure of interest in X jt is the shift in demand, again proxied by the

log change in elderly population. As in the ordered probit analysis, we estimate the
model separately for for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. Because we are interested in
testing whether for-profit hospitals are marginal, we examine only those counties in
which both for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals operate. If for-profit hospitals are more
sensitive to changing demand conditions, we expect the marginal effect of the demand
shift variable to be greater for for-profit than not-for-profit hospitals.
        We also estimate one additional model of exit for counties and years in which at
least one exit occurred and for-profit, not-for-profit, and government hospitals were all
operating in the county for that year. For each such county-year, we analyze the
probability that the exit is by a for-profit, not-for-profit, or government hospital, and how
these probabilities vary according to changes in demand. If for-profits are more sensitive
to demand conditions, then exiters should be more likely to be for-profits in counties in
which demand is falling than in counties in which it is increasing. We model the
probability that an exit is by a for-profit (in a market containing all three ownership
types) as:


                                    exp( X jt β FP )
        PFP =                                                              ,
                exp( X jt β GVT ) + exp( X jt β FP ) + exp( X jt β NFP )


where PFP is the probability of a for-profit exit (PNFP and PGVT are the analogous
probabilities for not-for-profits and government hospital exits respectively), Xjt are
characteristics of county j at time t, and βFP, βNFP, and βGVT are coefficients for the
respective three types of hospitals. We perform similar analyses for not-for-profit and
government hospitals.


IV. DATA
A. Sources
        We use data from three sources. First, we use data on U.S. hospital characteristics
collected in an annual survey by the American Hospital Association (AHA). Some of this
information that we use comprises bed size, inpatient days, length of stay, services


                                                                                             7
offered, system membership, ownership type, and location. The data are available in
electronic form from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which provides
complete information for 1985 to 2000 and partial information for even-numbered years
from 1970 to 1984. We have entry exit information only from 1984-2000 and system
membership information from 1985. Thus entry exit analysis is over 1984-2000. (The
econometric analysis of exit, which requires system membership information, is from
1985). Second, we use the Area Resource File (ARF), and U.S.Census data which
provide measures at the county level for population, elderly population and per-capita
income. Third, we use data on hospital system membership compiled from multiple
sources by Professors Daniel Kessler and Kristin Madison (Madison, 2004). While the
AHA survey contains extensive year-by-year information on hospital system membership
status, it contains some internal inconsistencies and also does not conform to the
information in other sources containing merger acquisition data, such as Modern
Healthcare, a hospital trade publication. We use a corrected system database created by
Kessler and Madison for the years 1985-1998. For the years 1999 and 2000 we modified
and extended their algorithm to create our own system membership database. We also use
hospital wage index data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and
information on certificate of need laws from American Health Planning Association.
B. Market Definition
   The product market we analyze is all short term hospital services. Our sample
comprises all hospitals over the years 1970-2000 serving this product market. To meet
our market definition a hospital must:
   •   List one of the following as its primary service offered: (1) general
       medical/surgical services; (2) obstetrics/gynecology; (3) eye-ear-nose-throat; (4)
       rehabilitation; or (5) all four of these categories for treatment of children
   •   Have an average length of stay below thirty days, and if it has a long-term-care
       unit then that unit should account for a minority of its admissions.
   •   Not be a federal hospital.
Because the market for hospital services is local and much of the data we use are
organized at the county level, we use the county as our geographic unit of analysis. After
eliminating counties in Alaska and Hawaii, our final sample comprises 3,070 counties.


                                                                                            8
V. RESULTS
A. Descriptive Analysis
1. Industry Structure across Ownership Types
        Table 1 lists the annual number of total and public, not-for-profit, and for-profit
hospitals from 1970 to 2001. The total number of hospitals fell steadily, and by 2001
there were 13% less hospitals than in 1970. Much of this decline is accounted for by
public hospitals. From 1978 to 2001 both the total number of hospitals, and the number
of public hospitals fell every year, and there were 29% less public hospitals in 2001 than
1970. The number of not-for-profit hospitals also declined by 10% from 1970 to 2001.
In contrast, the number of for-profit hospitals increased by 7% from 1970 to 2001. Table
2 further illustrates the rise of the for-profit sector. In contrast to public and not-for-profit
hospitals, for-profit hospitals have experienced growth in establishments, capacity, and
output and have increased their share of all three measures since 1970.
        The US hospital industry has experienced substantial consolidation in recent
years, including a considerable increase in the proportion of hospitals that are part of
multi-hospital systems. Figure 2 indicates that since 1985 over 80% of for-profit
hospitals are part of systems, and the trend has been rising over time. System
membership for not-for-profits is lower, around 40% as of 1985, but it too has been
growing, and by 2000 59% of not-for-profit hospitals were part of systems. Figure 1
indicates that the average for-profit system contains three times as many hospitals as the
average not-for-profit system.
        Figure 2 reports the proportions of for-profit and not-for-profit entrants and
exiters that are system members. We predicted a larger percentage of entrants than
exiters would be system members. Consistent with this prediction, the percentage of
entrants that are system members is 67% for for-profits and 62% for not-for-profits
whereas only 42% and 47% of for-profit and not-for-profit exiters respectively are system



                                                                                               9
members. The difference for for-profits is significant at the .01 level whereas the not-for-
profit difference is not significant at conventional levels.5 Among the for-profit entrants
that were part of systems, 36% entered markets already containing members of the same
hospital system. The comparable percentage for not-for-profit hospitals was much higher
at 61%.
        Figure 3 examines mean bed sizes across entrants, exiters, and incumbents for
various ownership types. Not-for-profit hospitals are larger than for-profit hospitals.
They have an average of 188 beds versus 132 beds for for-profits. Not surprisingly,
entrants and exiters are smaller than incumbents, and differences in their sizes according
to ownership type are smaller. Among entrants, the average bed size of not-for-profits is
63 versus 59 for for-profits, and among exiters the respective values are 92 and 76. The
latter difference for exiters was significant at the .05 level whereas the difference for
entrants was not.
2. Entry and Exit at the National and Regional Levels
        Table 3 indicates that over the period 1984-2000, annual entry and exit rates were
1.5% and 1.3% higher for for-profit than not-for-profit hospitals. Figure 4 indicates that
the entry rates of for-profit and not-for-profits varied similarly over time. In 10 of 15
years they moved together and had a correlation coefficient of 0.5. Similarly, exit rates
of for-profits and not-for-profits varied together. In 9 of 15 years they moved in the same
direction and had a correlation coefficient of 0.6. This suggests that both for-profits and
not-for-profits react similarly to changing market conditions, although the degree of
reaction is uniformly smaller for not-for-profits.
        In manufacturing industries, entrants typically have higher exit rates than
incumbent firms (Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson, 1988). Since for-profits have higher
entry rates than not-for-profits, their higher exit rate could merely be due to hospital
entrants having a higher exit rate than incumbent hospitals. To check this, Table 4
reports the proportion of entrants and incumbents as of 1984 that exited by the year 2000
separately for public, not-for-profit, and for-profit hospitals. There was no difference in
these exit rates for public and not-for-profits. In contrast, for for-profits, the exit rate was


5
 The difference existed at 10% level however, indicated that some of the advantages of system
membership made a difference in terms of not-for-profit survivability also


                                                                                                10
actually higher for incumbents than exiters. This suggests that the higher exit rate of for-
profits than not-for-profits was not driven by the higher entry rate of for-profits. It is a
strikingly different pattern than has been observed in manufacturing industries.
          We suspect this difference between the hospital and manufacturing industries
reflects the local character of hospital services. Many manufacturing firms service
national markets, whereas hospitals have to be located close to their consumer base.
Over the eighties and ninties,, population shifted from central cities to suburbs and from
the Northeast to the West and South. Consequently, incumbents tended to be located in
declining markets, whereas entrants were located in growing markets. If for-profits were
more likely to enter in response to growth opportunities, then for-profit entrants were
especially likely to be located in growth markets. This could explain why the difference
in the exit rates of incumbents and entrants was particularly pronounced for the for-
profits and why these patterns were so different from the manufacturing sector.
          Table 5 disaggregates the data on number of hospitals, entry, and exiters by
ownership type into the nine Census divisions. In all regions except New England, for-
profits have higher entry and exit rates than not-for-profits. Almost half the total entries
in the for-profit sector from 1984 to 2000 were in the West South Central region, which
also experienced the highest number of exits.6 The largest increase in the number of for-
profit establishments occurred in the Mountain region, which experienced the highest
regional growth in the overall and elderly populations of 50% and 90% respectively. New
England, Middle Atlantic and East North Central had some of the lowest increases in
total and elderly population among the census divisions. They also had the lowest levels
of for-profit entries. The muted for-profit entry in the Pacific region, in spite of high
population growth, was probably due to the prevalence of the managed care industry.
          The correlation coefficient between number of for-profit entrants and exiters
across census regions is 0.9. Since this is not due to exiting entrants, the high correlation
is likely attributable to population shifts within the same census region. For-profit
marginality predicts that for-profits would follow demand shifts to a greater degree than
not-for-profits and thus would experience a higher correlation between entry and exit

than not-for-profits. Interestingly, the correlation between entry and exit rates for not-for-
profits is almost negligible at 0.08.
B. Econometric Analysis of Entry
         The conceptual model predicts that for-profit firms should be more nimble in their
response to changing market circumstances. Following a positive demand shift, for-
profit should disproportionately enter, and following a negative demand shift, for-profit
firms should disproportionately exit. To test this prediction, we need a measure of
demand shift. Measures of quantity are obviously endogenous. Given the local nature of
the hospital market, a natural proxy for demand shift is the change in the local
population. To analyze the primary determinants of demand shifts, we estimated a cross
sectional regression for changes in local hospital capacity. The dependent variable is
changes in log hospital beds7 at the Health Service Area (HSA) level over the period
1980 to 2000.8 Table 6 reports the estimated effects of the explanatory variables in the
regression. The strongest predictor of changes in hospital capacity is the change in the
elderly population. This is to be expected given that about 60% of hospital services is
delivered to the elderly, the elderly have been growing as a proportion of the population,
and there has been a significant geographic reallocation of the elderly population in
recent years. Accordingly, we use log change in elderly population as our primary
measure of demand shift.
         Table 8 reports estimates from the ordered probit analysis of for-profit and not-
for-profit entry at the county level.9 Both types of hospital entry are positively and
significantly related to log of total population in 1980 and log change in elderly
population over 1980-2000. States with certificate of need (CON) laws regulate hospital
entry to avoid overbedding and duplication of services. Using data from the American
Health Planning Association, we included a dummy for states with certificate of need

7
  The correlations between capacity and other quantity measures such as admissions and days are all greater
than 0.9

  HSA is a geographic area consisting of one or more contiguous counties, previously designated by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for health planning on a regional basis
9
  We examined the sensitivity of these results to the geographic market definition and the choice of demand
proxy. We replicated all of the estimations reported here for a different geographic market definition, the
HSA. The results were qualitatively the same when it came to entry. Exit results however, were sensitive to
the choice of geographic markets. We examined the effects of using levels and growth for the total
population instead of the elderly population as demand proxies. The results were not sensitive to the use of
these different demand proxies.


                                                                                                         12
laws (CON), but this dummy did not have a significant effect on entry. Per capita income
growth has a positive but insignificant effect on not-for-profit entry, but a negative and
marginally significant effect on for-profit entry. This is opposite of what we would have
expected for for-profits. Both for-profit and not-for-profit entry are negatively related to
hospital wages, which comprise a major component of hospital costs10.
        The main prediction of the conceptual model is that for-profits will be more
responsive to changes in demand than not-for-profits. Consistent with this prediction, the
estimated coefficient of the log change in the elderly population is 1.14 for for-profits and
0.39 for not-for-profits, and this difference is significant at 5% level. Since the ordered
probit model is non-linear, it is more appropriate to look at the marginal effect of the
demand shift on the expected number of entries. Similar to the coefficient estimates, the
marginal effect of the log change in the elderly population is almost three times larger for
for-profits than not-for-profits. If elderly population in the average county in the year
2000 was 1% above its existing level, our estimates imply that expected for-profit
hospital entry would have been higher by 3.3% and expected not-for-profit hospital entry
by 1.1%
C. Econometric Analysis of Exit
        Earlier we reported that for-profits generally had higher annual exit rates than not-
for-profits, which is consistent with for-profits being the marginal firms. The conceptual
model also implies that the difference between for-profit and not-for-profit exit rates
should be more pronounced in markets where both ownership types are present. To
understand why, consider a market with two hospitals that experiences a negative
demand shift sufficient to force one of the hospitals to exit. In a market with two for-
profit (not-for-profit) hospitals, the exiting firm must be a for-profit (not-for-profit).
Thus, in uniform ownership markets, the exit rates for the two types are the same, 50%.
But in a market with one for-profit and one not-for-profit, if the for-profit is the marginal
firm, then it will be the exiter. Therefore, in the mixed market the for-profit exit rate is
100% and the not-for-profit exit rate is 0%.

10
  A hospital wage index is included in the regression (www.cms.gov). However, it is imperfectly
measured. Wage indices are available only at the MSA level. For non-MSA areas, every state has a single
rural wage index covering every non-MSA county. Due to changes in MSA definition, we take the wage
indices over 1990-2000. Per capita income change is over 1980 and 2000. However, the correlation
between base period wage index and per capita income is 0.53


                                                                                                     13
           Obviously, because hospitals are heterogeneous we will not see such a dramatic
difference, but this does suggest an estimation method. We can estimate the marginality
of for-profit hospitals by taking the difference between for-profit and not-for-profit exit
rates in mixed ownership markets and subtracting the difference between for-profit and
not-for-profit exit rates in uniform ownership markets. If for-profits are marginal, this
measure should be positive.
           We tabulate exit rates by ownership type, demand growth, and uniform vs. mixed
ownership markets in Tables 9 and 10. Table 9 breaks counties into four groups
according to the quartile of overall population growth while Table 10 breaks counties into
four groups according to the quartile of elderly population growth. Within each of these
four groups, the counties are further subdivided into counties with for-profit but without
not-for-profit hospitals (“only for-profit”), counties with not-for-profit but without for-
profit hospitals (“only not-for-profit”), and counties with both for-profit and not-for-
profit hospitals.11 For each of these twelve sets of counties we tabulate exit rates for both
for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. For example, Table 9 indicates that for counties in
the lowest population growth quartile for which both for-profit and not-for-profit
hospitals are present, exit rates were 0.46% for for-profits and 0.21% for not-for-profits.
           The final column of the tables present the “difference in differences” estimates of
the marginality of for-profit firms. For example, the entry in the difference column for
Quartile 1 of Table 9 is calculated as 0.08 = (0.46 − 0.21) − (0.31 − 0.14 ) . This estimate is
positive in all eight cases in the two tables, with five of the eight differences significant at
conventional levels. Consistent with the theory, for-profit hospitals are not only more
likely to exit,: they are especially more likely to exit when they are in mixed ownership
markets.
           The model further predicts that in markets with both for-profits and not-for-
profits, exit is more sensitive to demand shifts for for-profits than not-for-profits. To test
this prediction, we use the logistic discrete hazard model described earlier. Means and
standard deviations for the variables used in the hazard model are reported in Table 11.
Only county-years in which both for-profits and not-for-profits are considered. Separate
hazard equations were estimated for the for-profits and not-for-profits. Estimates are

reported in Table 12 for the marginal effects of county and hospital characteristics on the
probability of exit for each group of hospitals.
       A comparison of coefficient estimates from the two logistic regressions reveals
that lower growth of the elderly population increases the probability of exit for both for-
profit and not-for-profit hospitals. However, the estimated effect for for-profits of -0.017
is more than twice as large as the estimated effect for not-for-profits of -0.008, as for-
profit marginality would predict. System membership significantly decreases the
probability of for-profit exit but does not affect the probability of not-for-profit exit. The
effect of hospital wages is almost twice as large for for-profits than not-for-profits. For
both groups, the existence of a certificate of need law does not have a significant effect
on the probability of exit.
       It is possible that the difference in for-profit and not-for-profit responsiveness
reported in Table 12 is due to differences in the distribution of characteristics among
hospitals rather than the propensity to exit. To address this, we take the estimates from
Table 12 and apply them “out of sample” to the dataset for the opposite ownership type.
The results of this exercise are reported in Table 13. If we take the estimates for the for-
profit exit model and apply them to the data for the not-for-profit hospitals, we obtain an
average exit probability of 0.037 and a marginal effect of the demand shift variable on
exit of -0.043. Applying the not-for-profit model to this same not-for-profit data yields
an average exit probability of 0.008 with a marginal effect of -0.01. So, standardizing on
the not-for-profit dataset, the marginal effect of a shift in demand on the exit rate is more
than four times larger for for-profits than not-for-profits. The difference between for-
profit and not-for-profit responsiveness to demand shifts remains whether we standardize
on the for-profit data, the not-for-profit data, or a dataset pooling the two.
       Our tests focus only on differences between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
To see whether the differential response is affected by the presence of a public hospital in
a county, we incorporate public hospitals into our analysis. Three sets of coefficient
parameter estimates, one for each type of hospital ownership, are presented in Table 14.
Our main conclusions are robust to the presence of public hospitals in our model. High
growth in elderly population, system membership, and low wage growth all significantly
decrease the probability of for-profit exit.



                                                                                              15
       In our final analysis, we consider county-years in which an exit occurred and in
which for-profit, not-for-profit, and public hospitals were all present. We employ a
multinomial logit model in order to analyze the probability of these exits being of a for-
profit, not-for-profit, or public hospital. The conceptual model predicts that for-profits
will have the highest exit rate and that the probability of the exit being for-profit (relative
to the other two forms) will be decreasing in demand shifters. The coefficient estimates
of the model are presented in Table 15. The probability that a given exiting hospital will
be for-profit (in markets containing all three types) is over 70%. This probability is very
responsive to the demand shift variable: in markets with growing elderly population, the
probability that an exiting hospital is for-profit is dramatically reduced (the marginal
effect of log elderly population growth on the probability of for-profit status is -0.52,
p<0.05). Existence of a certificate of need law also reduces the probability of for-profit
exit at 10% level. Finally, the probability that the exit is not-for-profit is higher for high
elderly population growth markets (p<0.1).


VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS




       Our objective in this paper has been to examine the evolving structure of the U.S.
hospital industry, in particular the ways in which ownership form influences entry and
exit behavior. We test whether for-profits are the marginal firms in the hospital industry
regarding both entry and exit. Our findings support this hypothesis. For-profits have
higher entry rates than not-for-profits, and for-profit entry rates are more sensitive to
demand shifts than not-for-profit. Furthermore, for-profits have higher exit rates than
not-for-profit firms, and for-profit exit rates are more sensitive to demand shifts than not-
for-profits. Finally, the difference between for-profit and not-for-profit exit rates is
greater in markets in which both ownership types are present. All these results are
consistent with the theory of for-profit marginality. We thus find evidence that there are
significant differences between for-profits and not-for-profits in responsiveness to
demand and that this affects the way that hospital market structure has evolved in the
U.S.
