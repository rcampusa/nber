       The paper reviews the theoretical foundations of the use of forward interest rates to

infer expected future rates of interest, inflation, currency depreciation and inflation

differentials. Forward rates arc related to these expected future variables via combinations of

term, inflation and foreign exchange risk premia. A unified derivation, discussion and

comparison of these premia is provided under both general and specific assumptions, as well

as some comments on empirical estimation.

                                     I. Introduction
   The recent collapse of European exchange rate regimes with fixed exchange rates to
regimes with floating rates forces the central banks of the countries concerned to
reconsider the targets, indicators and instruments that constitute the monetary policy
regimes. Monetary policy with a floating exchange rate is more complicated than with a
fixed exchange rate. Indicators of inflation pressure, inflation expectations, and the
monetary policy stance become more important than when the policy just consists of
defending the intermediate target of a fixed exchange rate.
    The yield curve is frequently used as an indicator of expectations of future interest
and inflation rates. However, the forward rate curve, consisting of the forward interest
rates implicit in the yield curve, appears to be a more appropriate indicator than the yield
curve. This is because the forward rate curve indicates the expected future time-path of
the variables of concern, whereas the standard yield curve only indicates expected future
averages of these variables.
    The paper examines the theoretical foundations of the forward rate curve as an
indicator. It relates the forward rate curve to the expected time path of, respectively,
future interest rates, future inflation rates, future currency depreciation rates, and future
inflation rate differences across countries. This requires the derivation and examination of
the relevant risk premia: the term, inflation, and foreign exchange risk premia. In the
literature three different term premia are discussed (and sometimes confused): forward,
holding period, and rollover term premia. For the present purpose the forward term
premium is the relevant one. Under specific but not unreasonable assumptions convenient
and intuitive expressions for the relevant premia are derived and discussed.
    The paper provides a unified treatment of term, inflation and foreign exchange risk
premia by combining and borrowing from a large literature. The literature on the term
structure of interest rates and term premia is surveyed by Shiller (1990). Breeden (1986)
provides a synthesis of the literature on inflation risk premia and the Fisher equation, and
                                              2


provides references to the earlier literature. Adler and Dumas (1983) and Hodrick (1987)
survey the literature on the foreign exchange risk premium.
     The paper states general expressions for the different premia with a general framework
borrowed from Shiller (1990) and from Breeden's (1986) treatment of the inflation risk
premium. It exploits the conditional lognormality assumption, as in Breeden (1986), to
get specific easily interpreted expressions. The expressions are further danfied with
specific assumptions about the underlying utility function, one specification being a
time-separable utility function with constant relative risk aversion as in Breeden (1986).
     The paper's contribution, if any, is in the unified and parallel derivation and
discussion of the different premia; in the clarification of what combinations of premia are
involved in extracting expected future interest, inflation, currency depreciation, and
inflation differential rates from forward rates; and in the comparisons of the different
premia in these combinations under increasingly specific assumptions; all as a step in
assessing the possibility to use forward rates in order to extract expectations of future
interest, inflation and currency depreciation rates.
     To start with, I will give some preliminary definitions and define five issues to be
dealt with.
     Let z(t,T) denote the (nominal) spot (interest) rate, the yield to maturity on a
(nominal) pure discount bond purchased at time I the trade date, which matures at time
T> 1, the maturity date. The limit of the spot rate i(1,1+r) when the time to maturity r
=   T-1 approaches zero is denoted by i(t) and    called the instantaneous spot rate. The yield
curve at time is the spot rates i(1,T) plotted against different maturity dates T> I, (or,
alternatively, the interest rates i(i,t+r) plotted against different times to maturity r).'
     Let f(t,t',T) denote the (nominal) forward (interest) rate, that is, the nominal interest
rate determined at time I, the trade date, for the promised lending of cash from time 1',

   Bonds with time to maturity above one year are usually not discount bonds but
coupon bonds. Estimating implicit spot rates, that is, yeilds to maturity on discount
bonds from yields to maturity on coupon bonds is a separate problem not discussed here.
                                                3



the settlement date, to time T, the maturity date, (t < t' < 7). A forward rate curve at
time t is a plot of forward rates f(t,1',t'+r) against future settlement dates t' > t, for fixed
time to maturity r >    0.   Hence, there are several forward rate curves at time t: one for
each maturity r. The limit of the forward rate f(1,t',t'+r) when the time to maturity r
approaches zero is denoted by f(1,t') and called the instantaneous forward rate. The
instantaneous forward rate curve at time is the plot of the forward instantaneous rates
f(t,t') against future settlement dates 1' > I (or, alternatively, a plot of f(t,t+r) against r
> 0). The forward rate curves are implicit in the yield curve, and the implicit forward
rates f(t,t', 7) and f(t,t') can be derived from the spot rates i(t,t').
    The thick dashed curve in Figure 1 shows an example of a yield curve at time 1, that
is, the spot rates i(t,t') at the trade date I plotted against times to maturity t'-t 0. The
yield curve has been drawn with a U-shape (which is what the Swedish yield curve looked
like in spring 1993). The thick solid curve shows the corresponding instantaneous forward
rate curve at time 1, that is, the instantaneous forward rates f(t,t') at the trade date
plotted against times to settlement t'-t > 0.
    The yield and forward rate curves are actually related as average and marginal cost
curves: They coincide for zero maturity (when t'=t), the forward rate curve lies below the
yield curve when the latter is decreasing, cuts the yield curve where the latter has a
minimum, and lies above the yield curve when the latter is increasing.
    The discussion in the paper will be organized around five issues. Under the
hypothetical case of subjectively certain expectations, which includes the case of perfect
foresight but also the case with point expectations when there is actual uncertainty, the
forward rate equals the expected future spot rate, f(t,t') =               E1i(t') (E1 denotes
expectations with respect to information available at time I). A first issue is then to what
extent forward rates indicate expected future interest rates also with subjectively
uncertain expectations. When the overnight spot interest rate is the monetary policy
instrument, which is the case in many countries, it is especially important whether the
                                               4


overnight forward rates indicate expected future overnight spot rates. The overnight
forward rate curve (which will for practical purposes coincide with the instantaneous
forward rate curve) then indicates the expected future time path of the overnight spot
rates, and hence market expectations of future monetary policy as this is materialized in
overnight spot rates. The issue boils down to examining the difference between the
forward rate f(t,t',t'+r) and the expected future spot rate, Ei(t',t'+r), especially for
short maturities r. The difference equals the nominal (forward) term premium, to be
further examined below.
     Let r(t,t') denote the real spot rate at time I on a real discount bond that matures at
time t'.      Let g(t,t',T)    and   g(t,t') denote the corresponding finite—maturity and
instantaneous real forward rates. The thin curves in Figure 1 show an example of a real
yield curve and a real forward rate curve. They are also related as average and marginal
cost curves. The forward real rate curve has been drawn decreasing at first and then
leveling out, resulting in decreasing real yield curve.
     Let ir(t,t') denote the average inflation rate from time I to time I' > I, defined as
ir(I,t')   ln(P(t')/P(t)]/(I'-I) (where in denotes the natural logarithm and P(t) denotes the
price level at time I). Let the instantaneous inflation rate at time I, the limit of x(I,t')
when I' approaches I, be denoted by 7r(I) (when the limit exists). Under subjectively
certain expectations, the (nominal) forward rate equals the sum of the real forward rate
and the expected future inflation rate, f(i,i') = g(t,1') + E(t'). The difference between
the nominal and real forward rate curves in Figure 1 then shows the expected future time
path of the inflation rate.2
     A second issue is then to what extent forward rates indicate expected future inflation
rates also without subjectively certain expectations.       If so, the forward rate curve

2    If the limit ir(I) does not exist, for instance when P(I) is a diffusion process, we can
replace Er(I') by E(t'), where /z(P) is the drift of the log price level, the expected
instantaneous inflation rate, defined by t(1') limTl,E(,lr(t',7).
                                              5


f(t,t',t'+i) for one year maturity, say, can be used as an indicator of the expected time
path of future yearly inflation rates. In contrast, the standard yield curve at time I of
spot rates z(t,t') would only indicate the average inflation rate from time Ito time I'.
    This second issue involves several comparisons. One is a direct comparison of the
forward rate f(t,t','+r) with the expected future inflation rate, Eir(t',t'+r). The
difference will be the sum of three terms: the expected future real interest rate, the term
premium, and the inflation risk premium. However, if a real yield curve is available, with
corresponding real forward rates, a second comparison is between the difference between
the nominal and real forward rates, f(t,t',t'+r) - g(t,t',t'+r), and the expected future
inflation rate, Ex(t',t'+r). This difference will equal the sum of two terms: the difference
between the nominal and real term premia, and the inflation risk premium.
    A third issue is to what extent the difference between domestic and foreign forward
rates indicates the difference between expected future domestic and foreign currency
interest rates (which according to the above will be the case under subjectively certain
expectations). Especially, to what extent does the difference between the domestic and
foreign forward rate curves indicate the expected time-path of future differences between
domestic and foreign overnight interest rates, and hence expected differences between
domestic and foreign monetary policy?             This involves comparing f(I,t',t'+r) -
f*(t,jl,p+r) with E[i(t',t'-f-r) — i*(I,I+r)], especially for short maturities r (foreign
currency nominal forward rates and interest rates are denoted by a star). The difference
will equal the difference between the domestic and foreign term premia.

    Let b(I,I') denote the average domestic currency rate of depreciation from time I to
time I' > I, defined as (t,I')   ln[5I')/5t))/(i'-t) (where S(t) denotes the exchange rate,
the price of foreign exchange expressed in domestic currency units per foreign currency
unit). Let the instantaneous depreciation rate at time I, the limit of b(t,t') when I'
approaches I, be denoted by b(t) (when the limit exists). Under subjectively certain
expectations, the difference between the domestic and foreign nominal forward rates will
                                               6


equal the expected future depreciation rate, f(t,t') f*(gt) =
    Figure 2 shows examples of domestic and foreign currency yield curves and forward
rate curves. The domestic and foreign currency curves are drawn similar to the empirical
krona and deutsche mark curves in spring 1993. Under subjectively certain expectations
the difference between the domestic and foreign currency forward rate curves hence show
the expected time path of the future domestic currency depreciation rate.
    A fourth issue is then to what extent the difference between domestic and foreign
forward rate curves indicates the expected time path of future domestic currency
depreciation also without subjectively certain expectations. The discrepancy will equal
the sum of the foreign exchange risk premium and the difference between the domestic
and foreign term premium.
    A fifth issue, finally, is whether differences between domestic and foreign forward rates
indicate the expected time path of future differences between domestic and foreign
inflation rates, E1[ir(t',t'+r) - lr*(1),t)+r)J, without subjectively certain expectations (as it
would under subjectively certain expectations). The discrepancy will equal the sum of
three terms: the difference between the expected future domestic and foreign real interest
rates, the difference between the domestic and foreign inflation risk premia, and the
difference between the domestic and foreign term premia.
    The outline of the paper is as follows. Section II presents standard definitions of spot
and forward interest rates. Section III derives nominal and real term premia and relates
forward rates and expected future interest rates, the first issue. Section IV derives
inflation risk premia, and section V relates forward rates and expected future inflation
rates, the second issue.    Section VI derives foreign exchange risk premia and relates
forward rates to expected future currency depreciation rates and to expected future

replace E1o(t') by E,p(t'), where ji(V) is the drift of the log exchange rate, the expected
instantaneous currency depreciation rate, defined by p(t') limTl,E,,5(t',T).

inflation differential rates, the third through the fifth issues.       Section VII briefly
comments on how to empirically estimate the premia. Section VIII concludes. An
appendix includes some technical details.


                            II. Spot and Forward Interest Rates
    This section states standard definitions and relations between spot and forward
interest rates (ci. Shiller (1990)).   Let Q(t,I) denote the nominal value at time t of a
nominal pure discount bond that matures at time T and then pays one unit of money. Let
q( t, 7t) denote the real value (in terms of a composite consumption good) at time I of a real
pure discount bond that matures at time T and then pays one unit of the composite
consumption good. Then the nominal and real yields to maturity, that is, the nominal
and real spot (interest) rates at time I of maturity T-t > 0, i(t,T) and r(i,T), are defined
by the relations4

(2.la)        Q(I,7')   exp[- i(t,T)(T-t)] and q(t,7)        exp[- r(t,T)(T-I)].
Equivalently, the nominal and real spot rates are given by

(2.lb)       i(t,T)    ln[Q(I,7)J/(T—t) and i(1,T)
                        —                              —
                                                         lrt[q(I,T)]/(T—t).
    The instantaneous(-maturity) nominal and real spot rates at time I, i(I) and r(t)     are

defined by


4 The interest rate i(t,t') is continuously compounded (at an annual rate, that is, time is
measured in years). Calculations and comparisons are easiest if all rates are expressed as
continuously compounded. Interest rates can also be compounded with any finite interval
(see Shiller (1990)): i(t,t',h) exp[i(I,t')h] - 1 is the interest rate compounded with an
interval of /i years at an annual rate. For h = 1 year it is annually compounded at an
annual rate, the interest rate usually used for bonds with maturity above one year
(effective annualized rates). Another way to express interest rate is - i(I,t') E
exp[i(I,t')(t'—t)] — 1, the period interest rate (for period (1'—I)). The rate i(t,t',h)
i(t,t')h/(t'—t) is the simple /i—period interest rate. For ii equal to one 1 year, it is the
simple annualized rate usually used for treasury bills and short-term rates below one year
maturity.
    For very short maturities (overnight, for instance), continuously compounded and
simple annualized rates coincide. Annually compounded annualized interest rates are
higher than continuously compounded interest rates. Simple annualized rates are lower
than annually compounded annualized interest rates for maturities less than one year.

(when the limit and partial derivatives exist).

    The nominal and real (implicit) forward rates at time I with settlement at time I' >
and maturity     at time T> I', f(t,t',r) and g(t,t',7'), are defined by
(2.3a)                 f(t,t', 7')           [i(t, fl( T—t) — i(t,t')(t'—t)]/( T—t')           and
(2.3b)                     g(t,t', 7')         [i(t, T)( T—t) — r(t,t')(t'—.t)J/( T—t').
The instantaneous(—maturity) nominal and real forward rates, f(1,I') and g(i,t'),                                     are

defined by

(2.4)            1(1,1')      limT...$, f(t,t', 7') and !j(t,t')                  limTl, g(t,t', 7').
    The finite-maturity forward rates will be averages of instantaneous forward rates,
(2.5a)                            f(t,t',7)        J7'1, f(t,r)dr/(T-L') and
(2.5b)                                g(t,t',T)
                                   Jl' g(t,r)dr/( T—t').
Furthermore, the instantaneous forward rates and the finite-maturity spot rates are
related as marginal and average cost,
(2.6a)                            f( t,t')      z( 1,1')   + (1'—!) öi( 1,1')! 01' and
(2.6b)                            g(t,t')       r(1,t') + (i'—l)Or(t,t')/Ot', or
(2.6b)       i(t,1')    J1', f(t,r)dr/(1'-I) and z!,1')                           f"1
It follows from (2.7) and (2.la) that the forward rates also fulfill
(2.7)        f(t,1')    —{OQ(t,t')/Ot']/Q(i,t') and g(t,t')                       —[Oq(t,t')/ D1']/q(t,L').
    Below I shall also use the property that the forward rates at time 1 with settlement at
time t equal the spot rates at time 1,

(2.8)                        f(t,t,T)           i(i,T) and g(t,I,7')
                                                         r(1,fl.
    Let me also define the nominal holding period return li(l,1',i'), the rate of return on
holding a bond maturing at time Tfrom time Ito I', as
(2.9a)                        exp[h(t,i', fl(t'—t)J               Q(1', T)/Q(t, 7'), or
(2.9b) h(t,t', T)      ln[Q(1', 7')/ Q(I, T)]/(t'—,)                  [i(1, 7)( T—1) —   i(    'J')( T—/')}/(t'—i),

where I have used (2.la).


                                              UI. Term Pretnia
    The first issue is to what extent nominal forward rates indicate expected future
nominal interest rates. This boils down to examining the determinants of the nominal
(forward) term premium, defined as the excess of the forward rate over the expected
future spot rate,
(3.1)                                        7')     f(l,t', 7') —     Ei(t', 7).
    The term premium can be interpreted as the expected excess return on a forward
contract that is financed on the spot market. More precisely, f(t,t',T) - i(t',7) is the
excess return on a forward contract at time I to lend cash from the future settlement date
1' to time T, when the forward contract is financed by borrowing on the spot market at
time I'.
    The forward term premium is related to a second term premium, the holding period
term premium,

(3.2a)                               ,,(t,t', 7)         E,h(l,t', 7') —
defined    as the expected excess of the holding return h(l,1', I) over the spot rate i(t,t'). It
follows from (2.3a) and (2.9b) that the excess holding return is proportional to the excess
return on the forward contract,

(3.2b)                 [h(t,t', 7)   —
                                         i(t,t')](P—t)         (f(t,t', 7') — i(1', 7')]( T—t').
Hence the holding period term premium is proportional to the forward term premium,

(3.2c)                           p(l,t', 7')         ,(l,l', T)( T—t')/(i'—I).
    The forward term premium is also related to a third term premium, the rollover term

prem7um                defined as the excess of the return on holding a bond from time 1. to its

maturity at time I' over the expected return on rolling over a short bond of maturity r a
total of n times, where r = (l'—t)/n and n is an integer. That is,

(3.3a)               Pr(tpt'T)           i(t,t') (1/n)E 1E1h(t÷(j—i) r,/+jr,l+jr)

Since   i(t,t')   (1/fl)Em1f(t+(j1)T,t+iT,t+JT), it follows from (3.1) that
(3.3b)                      r(tt'T)         (l/n)E1,(t,t+(j-l)r,t+jr).
The rollover term premium equals the average future forward term premia of maturity r.
   Here the forward term premium is in focus, rather than the holding period and
rollover term premia. From now on the forward term premium is just called the term
premium. In order to derive an expression for the nominal term premium, I assume that
the nominal price of a pure nominal discount bond, Q(1,'fl, in equilibrium is determined
as in a standard asset pricing model by

(Ala)                            L,T) = E1[(1,flP(t)/P(fl].
Here Kt,T) denotes a representative investor's real marginal rate of substitution
between time I and time T> 1, that is, the marginal rate of substitution of real wealth at
time T for real wealth at time 1; P(t) is the nominal price level at time 1. Then
A(t, F)P(t)/P( 7) is the nominal marginal rate of substitution between time I and time T,
that is, the marginal rate of substitution of nominal wealth at time T for nominal wealth
at time I. Consequently (Ala) states that the nominal price of the nominal discount bond
equals the expected marginal rate of substitution for nominal wealth.5
    I shall also assume that
(A2) £(t,7) and P(t)/P(7) are jointly conditionally lognormal for all land T> t.
This assumption of conditional lognormality of the real marginal rates of substitution, and
of conditional normality of the inflation rates, leads to exact and simple expressions for
the premia. Conditional lognormality of real marginal rates of substitution follows from
conditional normality of consumption growth rates under the assumption of constant
relative risk aversion. Conditional lognormality, counter to unconditional lognormality, is
not a very restrictive assumption. The parameters (means and covariances) of the

    Specific assumptions about the nominal and real marginal rate of substitution then
leads to specific theories of the term structure of interest rate, as for instance in Cox,
Ingersoll and Ross (1981).

distributions are not assumed to be constant but may be time- and state-dependent. The
increments to the log of the variables need not be independent but may be serially
correlated.

      Under assumptions (Ala) and (A2) the nominal term premium fulfills (see Appendix
for details)

(3.4)          (t,t', 7') =   — +Var1[z(t', 7)]( T— t') —  Cov[rn(t,t'), rn(t', 7')]/( T— t'),
where rn(t,7)      ln[J((t,7)P(t)/P(7')]           m(t,7) - [p(T)-p(t)] is the log nominal marginal
rate of substitution, m(t,7) ln(i) is the log real marginal rate of substitution, and p(t)
    lnP(t) is the log price level. The nominal term premium is the sum of two terms: the
negative of half the variance of the future spot rate multiplied with its maturity, and the
negative of the covariance between the log of the nominal marginal rate of substitution
between times t and t' and the log of the nominal marginal rate of substitution between t'
and T (1 < t' < 7'), divided by the maturity T-1'. The first term is obviously always
negative, that is, increased variance of the future spot rate by itself reduces the nominal
term premium. The second term is positive or negative depending upon whether the
nominal marginal rate of substitution is negatively or positively serially correlated.6 7
      In order to get some intuition for the variance term in (3.4), note that financing the

approximation exp(z z 1+1 as in Shiller (1990). With the approximation in Shiller the
variance term in (3.4 is lost.
      The instantaneous(-maturity) nominal term premium is given by (see Appendix for

forward contract by borrowing on the spot market at time 1' means selling bonds at time

t' at the price p(t',7'). That price is the convex function exp[—i(t', fl( T-t')] of the spot
rate i(t',T). By Jensen's inequality, for a given mean of the spot rate a higher variance of
the spot rate increases the expected price of the bond to be sold. This makes the forward
contract more favorable, and makes the representative investor accept a lower term
premium.
    In order to get some intuition for the covariance term in (3.4), note that the term can
be written

               Cov1[rn(t,t'), m(t', T)]/( T—t') = — Cov1[nz(e,t'), E 1,171.(t', T)}/( T—t') =
           —
(3.5)
                  = — Cov1[in(t,V), —i(t', T)] + Cov1[in(t,1'), Var,rn(t', T)] =

               = — Cov1[in(t,t'), f(t,t', fl—i(t', 'I')] + Cov[in(1,t'), Var1,rn(t', I)],

where I have used the law of iterated expectations, that E1,m(t',l) = —i(',fl(T-t') -

Var,m(t',T) (see Appendix), and that f(I,i',T) is known at time 1. The first term on the
right-hand side includes the negative of the covariance of the excess return on the forward
contract with the log nominal marginal rate of substitution. The covariance indicates the
degree of riskiness of the forward contract. If the covariance is positive (negative), the
excess return on the forward contract is less (more) risky than the safe nominal return
from to 1', i(t,t') (which has zero covariance with the log nominal marginal rate of
substitution since it is known at 1). A forward contract less (more) risky than a safe
nominal return contributes to investors' accepting a negative (positive) expected excess
return and hence a negative (positive) term premium.8 (This argument can of course also
be expressed in terms of the riskiness of the holding period return in (2.9), the riskiness of
holding a long bond that matures at time T from time t to time 1' instead of a bond that
matures at time t'.)
    The covariance term in (3.4) can be studied further by specific assumptions about the

8   Note that a safe nominal return is not safe in utility terms, since the nominal
marginal rate of substitution is stochastic. Therefore a stochastic nominal return can be
less risky (in utility terms) than a safe nominal return.

marginal rate of substitution. The frequent assumption of a time-separable utility
function for the representative investor with constant relative risk aversion and constant
rate of time preference results in the log real marginal rate of substitution fulfilling

(A3)                    m(t,7) = - )fc(fl-c(1)] - p(T-t), 7? 0, p> 0,
where c(t) denotes the log of the representative investor's real consumption at time t, 7 is
the coefficient of relative risk aversion, and p is the rate of time preference.
     Under assumption (A3) the second term in (3.4) can be written
                                   -                               =
(3.6)                            Cov1[in(t,t'), m(t', fl}/( T-t')
           = — Cov1{7[c(t')—c(t)]/(t'—) + ir(,'), fc( 7')—c(t')]/( T—t') + ir(t', 7)}(t'—t).

The term is proportional to the negative of the covariance between the sum of - times real

consumption growth and the inflation rate from time t to t' and the same sum from time t'
to T. (Recall that r(t,t') is the average inflation rate from time t to time 1' > t, defined as
7r(t,t')   [p(t')—p(t)]/(t'—t).)
     We also observe that in the special case of - = 1, that is, of the log utility function,

(3.6) equals
               —
(3.7)              Cov{[p(t')+e(1')J—[p(t)+e(1)], [p( T)+c( fl]—[p(t')+c(t')]}/( T—t').
This term is simply proportional to the negative of the covariance between the growth
rate for nominal consumption between times I and I' and the same growth rate between
times I' and T. Thus, for the log utility function, monetary policies that target nominal
consumption or nominal GNP (argued for the US by McCallum, for instance in McCallum
(1990)) have direct implications for the nominal term premium. If such targeting is
period by period, with fairly short periods, and if each period is targeted independently of
the outcome in previous periods (that is, accepting base drift), the outcome may be
serially uncorrelated nominal consumption growth rates, resulting in a zero covariance
term for the nominal term premium. If the targeting is for longer periods without
accepting base drift, mean reversion arises in nominal consumption growth rates, and
nominal consumption growth becomes negatively serially correlated, having a positive

effect on the nominal term premium. If the targeting is successfui in the sense that
variability of the nominal consumption growth rate is small, the covariance will in any
case be small and have only a small effect on the nominal term premium.9
    Below I will also need the real (forward) term premium, '(t,t', T), defined as

(3.8)                               1(t,t',7')       g(t,L',7) -
Under the assumption that the real price q(t,7) of a real discount bond is determined by

the expected real marginal rate of substitution,
(Aib)                                         q(t,T) =    E(t,fl,
and the assumption of lognormality of the real marginal rate of substitution, (A2), the
real term premium can be written

(3.9)         '(t,t', T) =   — Var1[i(t', T)]( T—I') — Cov1[m(t,t'), m(t', 7)]/( T—t').
The real term premium is the sum of two terms: the negative of half the variance of the
expected future real interest rate times its maturity T-1', and the negative of the
covariance between the log of the real marginal rate of substitution between times and t'
and the same log between times 1' and T, divided by T-t'. Equation (3.9) is of course a
special case of (3.4), namely when the price level is constant. The intuition for the
variance and covariance term in (3.9) is analogous to the intuition for the terms in (3.4).
    Under assumption (A3) the second term in (3.9) can be written
(3.10) — Cov1[in(t,t'), in(t', T)}/( T—l') = — 2Cov1[c(t')—c(t), c( fl—c(t')}/( T—t'),
which is proportional to the negative of the covariance between consumption growth rate
from t to t' and the consumption growth rate from 1' to T. Whether the second term in
(3.9) contributes negatively or positively to the real term premium then depends on


    Under assumption (A3) the instantaneous nominal term premium fulfills (see
Appendix)

                                       IV. Inflation Risk Premia
    In order to relate forward rates to expected future inflation rates, I first need to
specify the relevant inflation risk premia. The forward inflation risk premium, O(t,t', 7), is
defined as the excess of the difference between expected future nominal and real interest
rates over the expected future inflation rate,

(4.1)                    0(1,1', 7')      E,i(t', 7') — E,r(t', 7') — EL1r(t', 7').

    The standard (spot) inflation risk premium is give by 0(t,t, I)                   i(t, I) - r(t, 1) -
          that is, when t and 1' coincide. The inflation premium can be interpreted as the
expected real excess return on a nominal bond from time ('to maturity time T over a real
bond from time ('to maturity time T.
    Under assumptions (Al) and (A2) the forward inflation risk premium fulfills (see
Appendix for details)"
(4.2)           0(t,P, 7') =   — 4Var1[w(.', T))(     T—(') + Cov[tn(t', 7), ir(t', 7')].
The forward inflation risk premium is the sum of two terms: the negative of half the
variance of the future inflation rate from time ('to time T multiplied by T-t', and the
covariance between the real future marginal rate of substitution between times 1' and T
and the inflation rate from ('to 7'•12 13


10 The instantaneous(-maturity) real term premium is given by
                 lim7,4, t',1)         (t,t') —
                                                E1;t') = — Cov1[1fl(t,t'), "m(')}
Under assumption (A3) it fulfills
                                           =   — 2Cov1[e(!'), /1((()1.
11  As explained in the Appendix, the expression (4.2) is under the assumption that the
spot inflation premium 0(P,t',7) at time ('is a deterministic function oft' and information
available at time t. Without this assumption, Var1 and Coy1 in (4.2) are replaced by
E1Var1 and E1Cov1,.
12 In order to get an idea of how the lognormality assumption simplifies the expression
for the inflation risk premium, we can compare with the cumbersome expression Benmnga
and Protopapadakis (1983) derive without using the lognormality assumption (notation
                                                         16



     Thus, increased variance of the inflation rate by itself reduces the inflation risk
premium. In order to get some intuition for that, note that the real return on the nominal
bond varies with the ratio of price levels P(1')/P(7) which is a convex function
exp[-ir(t',I)(T-g')] of the inflation rate between time t' and time T. By Jensen's
inequality, for a given mean inflation rate a higher variance of the inflation rate will
increase the expected ratio of price levels. This makes investment in the nominal bond
more attractive and makes the representative investor accept a lower inflation risk
premium.
     In order to get some intuition for the covariance term, we note that the inflation rate
is the excess real rate of return on real bonds over nominal bonds. If the covariance of
that excess real rate of return with the log real marginal rate of substitution is positive


modified to coincide with that of this paper):

where i(1,7) and r(1,T) are simple (T- 1)-period interest rates.

(negative), the real bonds are less (more) risky than nominal bonds, which contributes to
a positive (negative) inflation risk premium.
    Under assumption (A3) the second term in (4.2) can be written
                                - yCov
(4.3)                                     { c( fl-e(t'), r(t',T)},
which is proportional to the negative of the covariance between real consumption growth

and inflation.


                  V. Forward Rates and Expected Future Inflation Rates
    I examined above the first issue mentioned in the Introduction, namely, to what
extent forward rates indicate expected future interest rates. The second issue is to what
extent forward rates indicate expected future inflation rates. Let me therefore first
examine the difference between the forward rate and the expected future inflation.
    From the definition of the term premium in (3.1) and the forward inflation premium
in (4.1) it follows that the difference can be written

(5.1)            f(t,t', 7) — Ev(1', 7)   =   E1r(1', T) + p(t,t', 7) + 0(1,1', 7),
the sum of the expected future real interest rate, the nominal term premium and the
forward inflation premium. The determinants of the nominal term premium were
discussed in section III and the determinants of the inflation premium in section IV.
Since the nominal term premium depends on the serial correlation of the real marginal
rate of substitution and inflation between the nonoverlapping periods from time I to 1' and
from time 1' to T, whereas the forward inflation premium depends on the covariance
between the real marginal rate substitution and inflation for the period from time t' to T,
there is no scope for further simplification of the last two terms in (5.1).
    Use of the forward rate to indicate expected future inflation must hence be conditional
upon the expected future real interest rate, which must therefore be explicitly assumed or
estimated separately. If however real forward rates are available, that is, if there is a well
functioning market in real bonds for different maturities so a real yield curve is available,
                                                   18


these real forward rates can exploited. Let me therefore consider to what extent the
difference between the nominal and real forward rates indicates the expected future
inflation rate. From the definitions of the nominal and real term premia in (3.1) and
(3.8), and of the forward inflation premium in (4.1), it follows that the difference between
the nominal and real forward rates exceed the expected future inflation rate by

(5.2)      f(t,t', 7') — g(t,t', 7') — ELir( 1', 7') = [ç( 1,1', 7') — '(t,1', 7)] + 0(1,1', 7),
the sum of the difference between the nominal and the real term premium and the forward
inflation premium.'4
     The difference between the nominal and real term premium is

(5.3)                              ,(t,t',7) — (t,t',7') =
                            = — +{Var[i(1', T)] —
                                                  Var1[71, T')]}( T—I')

                     {Cov1[m(t,1.'), in(1', 7")] — Cov1[in(t,1'), in(t', T)]}/( 7'— 1').
                 —




It obviously depends on the difference between the variances of the nominal and real
future interest rates and the difference between the serial correlation of the nominal and
the real marginal rates of substitution. As above, with assumption (A3) the second term
in (5.3) can be expressed in terms of consumption growth rates and inflation.


              VI. Foreign Term Premia and Foreign Exchange Risk Premia
     The third issue is to what extent the difference between domestic and foreign nominal
forward rates indicate differences in the expected future domestic and foreign nominal
interest rates. For that issue I need to define the (nominal) foreign currency interest rate,
forward rate and term premium. These definitions are analogous to the definitions of the
corresponding domestic currency variables:
     Let Q(1,7') denote the foreign currency price at time I of a foreign currency pure
discount bond that matures at time T and then pays one unit of foreign currency. Then

'4 Ben-Shahar and Cukierman (1973), Paunio and Suvanto (1977), Woodward (1990),
Yariv (1990), and Bank of England (1993) use market interest rates on indexed bonds and
nominal bonds to infer inflation expectations.

the (nominal) foreign currency interest rate z*(t, 7) is defined by the relation

(6.1)         Q*(t,7)         exp[— i(t,T)(T—t)], or z*(t,T) = — ln[Q*(t, T)1/(T—t).
The (nominal) foreign currency forward rate, f*(1,t),7), is defined by
(6.2)                       f*( t,t', T)   [i*(t, T)( T— 1) —   i*( i, t')( t'— t)]/( T— t').
The (nominal) foreign currency term premium is defined as

(6.3)                               t(t,t',7')     f*(,i,7) — E11*(tt,7).
    In order to specify the determinants of the nominal foreign term premium I make the
analog assumption to (Ala), namely that the foreign currency bond is priced according to
(Ala')                             Q*(t,T) = E,[K*(t,flP*(t)/P*(7)],
where £*(t, 7) denotes a representative investor's foreign real marginal rate of
substitution and P(t) denotes the foreign price level. Then the right-hand side is the
expected foreign investor's foreign currency marginal rate of substitution. Then the same
analysis of the determinants of the foreign term premium can be undertaken as in section
III, with the substitution everywhere of the foreign interest rate, real marginal rate of
substitution, consumption, price level and money supply for the corresponding domestic
variables.
    The issue of to what extent the difference between nominal domestic and foreign
currency forward rates indicate differences between expected future domestic and foreign
interest rates is then straightforward. By the definition of the domestic and foreign
nominal term premia, we simply have

(6.4)        [f(t,', 7) —   f*(t,t, 7')] — [E1i(t, 7) —
                                             E,i*(,, 7)] = '(t,t', 7) — y*(t1 T),
the difference between the domestic and foreign nominal term premia.
    According to the analysis above, under assumptions (A3) and (A4) the difference in
the term premia will depend on the degree of risk aversion in the two countries, whether
the price levels are pro- or countercyclical, and the serial correlation of consumption
growth rates.      If the countries are not very different in these respects, the difference
between the domestic and foreign nominal term premia are likely to be small. Then the
                                                     20


difference between the forward rate curves is a precise measure of the expected future
interest rate differential.
    The fourth issue is to what extent the difference between domestic and foreign
forward rates indicates expected future domestic currency depreciation rates. For this
issue I need to define and specify the foreign exchange risk premium.
    The (noininat) forward foreign exchange risk premium, (t,t', I), is defined as
(6.5)                        (t,t',7)      Ei(1',7) - E1i*(t),7) ES(t',T),
                                                                    —



the excess of expected future interest rate differential over the expected future domestic
currency depreciation rate (recall that 5(t,t')               [s(t')—s(t)]/(t'—t), where s(t)       lnS(t)
denotes the log exchange rate). The foreign exchange risk premium can be interpreted as
the expected nominal excess return on domestic bonds over foreign bonds. 15
    From the definitions of the domestic and foreign currency term premium in (3.1) and
(6.3) and the above definition of the forward foreign exchange risk premium it follows that
the excess of the difference between the domestic and foreign currency forward rates over
the expected future domestic currency depreciation rate is

(6.6)      [f(t,1', 7') —   ft(t,t', T)] — E15(t', 7') = [y(,1', 7•') — p*(g,t, 7')] + (t,t', T),
the sum of the difference between the domestic and foreign nominal term premia and the
forward foreign exchange risk premium.
     In order to derive the determinants of the forward foreign exchange risk premium, the
nominal foreign discount bond is assumed to priced not only according to (Ala') but also
according to

(Ala")             Q'(t,7) = E1{ .Ae(i,'fl[P(i)/P(fl][S(7)/S(t)]}.
Here the expression between the curly brackets is a representative investor's foreign
currency marginal rate of substitution, that is, the representative investor's marginal rate



 ' In the recent literature on exchange rate target zones the foreign exchange rate
premium has been disregarded. Svensson (1992) argues that this is warranted for narrow
target zones, even if there is realignment risk.

of substitution of foreign currency at time T for foreign currency at time t. 1
    Under assumption (A5) and (A2), conditional lognormality (extended to include the
exchange rate), the forward foreign exchange risk premium fulfills (see Appendix for
details) '
(6.7)            i(1,t', 7) =    +Var1[5(t', T)]( T— t') + Cov1[m(t', 7), 6(t', 7)].
The forward foreign exchange risk premium is the sum of two terms: half the rate of
variance of the currency depreciation rate from 1' to T multiplied by T-t', and the
covariance between the domestic currency marginal rate of substitution between times t'
and T and the domestic currency depreciation rate from t' to T. '
    In order to get some intuition for the variance term, we first note that it enters with a
positive sign in the foreign exchange risk premium, in contrast to the case for the term
and inflation risk premia. Increased variance of the currency depreciation rate by itself
increases the foreign exchange risk premium. The reason is that the domestic currency

16 The representative investor's real foreign marginal rate of substitution £*(t 1) and
the real (domestic) marginal rate of substitution .,*'(t,fl fulfill £*(t,fl[P(t)/F*(T)]
 Jt(t,7)[P(t)/P(7)j[S(7)/S(t)]. Then (Ala') and (Ala") are consistent.
17 As explained in the Appendix, the expression (6.7) is under the assumption that the
spot foreign exchange risk premium (1',t',fl at time t' is a deterministic function of t'
and information available at time 1. Without this assumption, Var1 and Coy1 in (6.7) are
replaced by E1Var1, and E1Cov,,.

rate, and a5(tt') is the expected future instantaneous rate of covariance between the log

which is consistent with previous derivations (cf. Adler and Dumas (1983), Engel (1992),
Fama and Farber (1979), Hodrick (1987), Roll and Solnik (1979) and Stulz (1981, 1984)).

return on foreign bonds varies with the ratio of exchange rates 5'( 7)/S(t'). This ratio is a
convex function exp[6( 1', T)( T- 1')] of the currency depreciation rate. For a given expected
depreciation rate a higher variance of the depreciation rate increases the expected ratio,
which makes foreign bonds a more attractive investment than domestic bonds. This
contributes to the representative investor demanding a higher foreign exchange risk
premium.'9
    In order to understand the covariance term, note that the currency depreciation rate
is the nominal excess rate of return on foreign currency bonds over domestic currency
bonds. If the covariance with that excess rate of return with the log nominal marginal
rate of substitution is positive (negative), foreign currency bonds are less (more) risky
than domestic currency bonds. This contributes to the representative investor demanding
a positive (negative) foreign exchange risk premium.
    Under assumption (A3) the second term in (6.7) can be written
                     —
(6.8)                    Cov1{7(e( 7)—e(t')]/( T—t') + ?r(t', T), 5(t', 7)]( T—1'),
which can be subject to empirical estimation.
    The fifth and final issue is to what extent the difference between domestic and foreign
currency forward rates indicates the expected difference between future domestic and
foreign inflation rates. From (5.1) and its foreign currency analog follows directly that the
excess of the difference between the forward rates over the difference in expected future
inflation rates fulfills

the difference between the domestic and foreign currency term premia, and the difference
between the domestic and foreign forward inflation risk premia. If the premia have the
same sign and same order of magnitude in the domestic and foreign country, they will
obviously tend to cancel.
    In passing, we note that in analogy with the nominal forward foreign exchange risk
premium defined in (6.5) we can define a real forward foreign exchange risk premium
((t,t',T) according to
(6.10)                   ((t,t', 7)    EgT(t', 7') — E1r*(17, 7')   —
                                                                        E1#c(1', T),
the difference between the domestic and foreign expected future real interest rates and the

expected future real currency depreciation rate, E1,(t',T). Here the real currency
depreciation rate, the rate of change of the real exchange rate, is defined as

(6.11)                       c(t',7)     6(1',7') + r(1',7)    —




the nominal currency depreciation rate adjusted for the inflation rate difference. The real

foreign exchange risk premium is not independent of the risk prernia already defined;
substitution of (4.1), its foreign analog, and (6.5) into (6.10) results in
(6,12)                     ((1', 7)                ?t,1', 7)].
                                       (t', 7') — [0(1,1', 7) —
The real foreign exchange risk premium is identical to the nominal forward foreign
exchange risk premium less the difference between the domestic and foreign forward
inflation risk premia.
    Even if expected Purchasing Power Parity holds, in the sense that E1K(t', 7') = 0, the
expected future domestic and foreign real interest rates may differ, unless the nominal
foreign exchange risk premium equals the difference between the domestic and foreign
inflation risk premia.


                                 VII. Estimation of the Premia
    The different risk premia can be estimated in two different ways, under the
maintained assumption of rational expectations. The first way is simply to regress the
                                              24


relevant excess return on variables in the information set, without relying on any
particular asset pricing model. The second way is to rely on a particular asset pricing
model to derive expressions for the risk premia and then estimate these expressions.
    The first way is straightforward. Recall (3.1), the definition of the nominal term
premium as the difference between the forward rate and the expected future spot rate,
( t,t',T)   f(t,t',7) — Ei(t',T). The expected future spot rate is not observed. However,
under rational expectations the realized future spot rate differs from the expected future
spot rate by an error term that is uncorrelated with date t information,
(7.1)                     i(t', 7) = E1i(t', I) + (t'), E1(1') = 0.
It follows that the realized excess return on a forward contract differs from the nominal
term premium by the negative of the error term,

(7.2)                       f(t,t',7) - i(t',7)
Regression   of the excess return on variables in the time I information set will then result
in an estimate of a time-varying conditional nominal term premium. Regressing the
excess return on a constant will result in an estimate of the unconditional nominal term
premium, the average conditional nominal term premium.
    Similarly, the real term premium can be estimated by regression of the realized excess
return on a real forward contract, q(i,I.', 7) - i(f', 7), on variables in the time t information
set. This requires observations of real interest rates on a market for real bonds, though.
The inflation risk premium can be estimated by regression of the realized excess return on
on a nominal bond over a real bond, i(i',fl - i(I',I) -           7r(t',7).   This also requires
observations of real interest rates on real bonds. Without a market for real bonds the real
term premium and the inflation risk premium can hence not be estimated in this direct
way.
    The foreign exchange risk premium can be estimated by regression of the realized
excess return on domestic bonds over foreign bonds, i(i',7) -    i(I',T) - S(t',fl.
    The second way to estimate the risk premia is to rely on the expressions derived under
                                                 25


the asset pricing assumption (Ala,b) and the conditional lognormality assumption (A2).
For the nominal term premium, this is expression (3.4), repeated here as

(7.3)                7') = — Var1[i(t', flJ( T—t') — Cov1[in(t,t'), in(t', T)]/( T—t').
Assuming a particular asset pricing model means specifying the log nominal marginal rate
of substitution, m(t,t'). The assumption (A3) of constant relative risk aversion implies
(7.4)     rn(t,t')     rn(t,t') - r(t,t')(t'-t) = -7[t')-t)] - p(1'-t) - ir(t,t')(t'-t).
This expression can then be substituted into the covariance term in the right-hand side of

(7.3), resulting in the expression (3.6). Conditional upon a given coefficient of relative
risk aversion y > 0, and with time series data on consumption and inflation, a
time-varying conditional term premium can be estimated with the General Method of
Movements as in Harvey (1989). The unconditional term premium can be estimated by
computing the sample moments of the right-hand side of (7.3).
    The real term premium, the inflation risk premium and the foreign exchange risk
premium can be estimated along the same line. The real term premium and the inflation
risk premium can be estimated even if there is no market for indexed bonds (cf.
expressions (3.9) and (3.10), and (4.2) and (4.3)), counter to what is the case in the first
way above.
    It is well known that the standard consumption asset pricing model cannot explain
the US equity premium, the average excess return on stocks over bonds. Therefore
various other asset pricing models have been tried. Using another asset pricing model just
boils down to making different specifications about the marginal rate of substitution,
£(t,t') (as long as the representative investor assumption is maintained). Cochrane and
Hansen (1992) and Weil (1992) have recently discussed different such specifications.
These specifications can be readily incorporated in the present framework.2°


20 The relative consumption model, a specification along the lines of Abel (1990), is
discussed extensively in Weil (1992). It is especially easy to handle since it just replaces
the log of the marginal rate of substitution (in the discrete time case) with
                  in( t,t') = — [ln( (,— c1 1) ln(    —
                                                                )] — p( '— 1),

                                   VII!. Conclusions
    A unified treatment of term, inflation and foreign exchange risk premia has been
provided, as a step in evaluating the usefulness of forward interest rates as indicators of
market expectations of future interest rates, inflation rates and currency depreciation
rates. The relevant premia have been defined as the appropriate expected excess return:
on a forward contract for the term premium, on a nominal bond over a real bond for the
inflation risk premium, and on a domestic bond over a foreign bond for the foreign
exchange risk premium. For the present purpose the relevant term premium is the
forward term premium, rather than the holding period or rollover term premium.
    Under an asset pricing assumption, and an assumption of conditional lognormality of
the relevant variables, explicit and intuitive expressions for the risk premia have been
derived. The risk premia each consist of two terms, a variance term and a covariance
term. The variance term arises from Jensen's inequality, since asset prices are convex
functions of interest rates and inflation rates. The variance term enters with a negative
sign for the term and inflation risk premia, with a positive sign for the foreign exchange
risk premium. The covariance term is the negative of the covariance between the
appropriate excess return and the marginal rate of substitution. In a consumption asset
pricing model the covariance term simplifies to the covariance between excess return and
consumption. In the capital asset pricing model, the covariance term simplifies to the
covariance between the excess return and the market portfolio.
    The risk premia can be estimated in two different ways. The first way is direct
regression of realized excess returns on variables in the information set. This has the
advantage of not relying on a particular asset pricing model, but the drawback that data
on real interest rates on real bonds are required for the real term premium and for the
inflation risk premium.


where     is consumption and i > 0 is a constant measuring the relative consumption
effect.
                                                      27


     The second way is to use a specific asset pricing model and the corresponding specific

expressions for the risk premia. This has the advantage of not requiring data on real bond
rates, but the drawback of using a more restrictive maintained hypothesis.
     If estimation results in premia of negligible size, forward interest rates can be used
directly as indicators of expected future interest rates, inflation rates and currency
depreciation rates. If estimation results in nonnegligible premia, constant or time-varying,
this does not imply that forward interest rates are useless as indicators, only that they
need to be corrected by estimates of the premia. Neither does nonnegligible premia imply
an advantage for traditional yield curves over forward rate curves. Regardless of the risk
premia, the forward interest rate curve and the yield curve contain the same information,
precisely as the marginal cost curve and the average cost curve contain the same
information. The forward rate curve only presents that information in a more informative
and easily interpreted way.2'

                                                  f(t,1',T) — E1[i(t',7))

      limT4l, Cov(2(t'), z( T)—z(i')I/( T—i') = Cov{zit'), limT 1,E,,[r( T)—x(t')]/( T—V)}.
To see this, note that
                                         =                                                     T—t') =

          = Cov1{z(t'), E,[x( T)—r(t')])/( T—i') = Cov1{.r(t'), E1,[r( fl—i(t'))/( T—t')},

5.     Derivation of the spot inflation risk premium, 0(1',!', T):

     Q(t', fl/q(t', 7) = -Ez(1',
                                 fl-i(i', fl]( T-t')       =   Er,E   (!', flP(t')/P( T)1/,     7) =
                           = /A(1',T), P(1')/P(T) jointly lognormal/ =
                        = E,,[P( f')/ P( T)]exp{Cov1,[ '( 1', ),         i( i')— i( 7)1 } =

         =
             exp{—E{p( fl—p(V)] + +Var1[p( T)—p(t')] — Cov1,[in(t', T), p( fl—p(t')}}.
Hence,

                               O(t',t',T)     i(1',7') — i(i',T) — E1,ir(t',T) =
                        = — +Var11Er(1', fl]( T—t')
                                                        + Cov1,[in(1', T), ?r(1', T)].
6. The forward inflation risk premium O(1,t',7) is defined for < 1' < Tas
                 O(t,t', 7')        E10(1',l', F)    E1i(1', T) —   Er(1', I') — E,r(t', 7'),
and it hence fulfills

              O(t,t', 7') = — 'EVarL,[r(t', T)]( T—1') + E1Cov1,[7n(t', 7'), w(t', 7')].
In general the operators EVar1, and E1Cov1, cannot be simplified further, since
              E1{Var,[zJ} = E{E1,[z2J + [E11x]2} = E[z2] + E{[E,x]2}.
The second term on the right hand side is in general not equal to [Ez]2. However, if E1,x
conditional upon information available at time I < 1' is not stochastic but a deterministic
function of I' and information available at time 1, we have E1{[E1,x]2} =                                 Then it
                                                                                                [E1z]2.
follows that El{VarL,[x1}            Var1[z]. The variance at 1' indeed becomes a deterministic
function of information available at time 1. The same argument applies to ECov1. To
sum up, only if the spot inflation premium at I', 0(1',1',7), is a deterministic function of
information available at time I can we in general simplify the expression for the forward
inflation premium to be

                 0(1,1', 7") = — +Varjr(1', T))( T— I') + Cov1[m(1', 7'), '( 1', 7')].
(For specific distributions, we may of course be able to simplify E1Var1, even if Var, is
stochastic given information available at time /.)
7.   Derivation of the spot nominal foreign exchange risk premium, (",f',T):
              exp[—i'4'(1', 7')( T—1')] = E1,{f            7')P(I')/P( 7')][S fl/.S'(i')]}
                               =
                                   E,{ .(i', T)P(I')/l'( T)}E1,{S( 7')/S(i')}
                                     exp{Cov1,[in(t', 7'), s( T)—s(I')]} =
               = exp{—i(t', 7')( T—/')}exp{E1,[s( 7)_.s(i')J + Var,[s fl—S(/')J}

                                       exp{Cov1[m(r, 7'), s( fl—s(i')]}.
                                                   30



Hence,
                                                  —
                                                      z"(',7) — E,o(1',T) =
                     = 4Var,,[6(1', T)](T—t') + Cov11[m(t',7), 7r(t', 7)].
8. The forward foreign exchange risk premium, (t,t',7), is, for I < 1' < T,
              (t,I', 7)      E1(t',t',T)        E1i(t', 7) — E1z*(1, 7) — EL6(t',           =
                  = +E1Var11Eö(1', 7)]( T—1') + E1Cov,[m(t', 7), 6(1', 7)].

If the spot foreign exchange risk premium at time 1' is a deterministic function of
information available at time 1, the forward exchange risk premium can be simplified to
                          7') =   +Var1[6(1', 7)]( 7'— 1') + Cov1[m( 1', 7'), 5(1', 7')].
