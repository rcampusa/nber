                                         ABSTRACT

Public expenditures on non-contributory pensions are equivalent to at least 1 percent of GDP in
several countries in Latin America and is expected to increase. We explore the effect of non-
contributory pensions on the well-being of the beneficiary population by studying the Pensiones
Alimentarias program established by law in Paraguay, which targets older adults living in
poverty. Households with a beneficiary increased their level of consumption by 44 percent. The
program improved subjective well-being in 0.48 standard deviations. These effects are consistent
with the findings of Bando, Galiani and Gertler (2020) and Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) in
their studies on the non-contributory pension schemes in Peru and Mexico. Thus, we conclude
that the effects of non-contributory pensions on well-being in Paraguay are comparable to those
found for Peru and Mexico and add to the construction of external validity.

    I.      Introduction

While pensions are believed to be critical for protecting material well-being after
retirement, only 20 percent of seniors worldwide receive pension benefits (Pallares-
Miralles, Romero and Whitehouse, 2012). For those who have coverage, the benefits are
often inadequate (ILO, 2014; Gasparini et al., 2007). Additionally, poverty rates among
the elderly are substantially higher in countries where social security coverage is limited;
the number of people who are 60 years of age or older is estimated to double by 2050
(United Nations, 2013); and the life expectancy of the elderly is also estimated to
substantially increase by 2050 (Bosch, Melguizo and Pagés 2013). For these reasons,
improving the effectiveness of pensions and expanding pension programs compel
immediate attention.

Several governments have responded to high poverty rates among the elderly with non-
contributory pensions. In OECD countries, 59 percent of the income of individuals over
age 65 comes from public pension transfers (OECD, 2015). In Latin America, at least 15
countries have implemented non-contributory pension programs covering about 20
percent of the region's population (Bosch, Melguizo and Pagés, 2013; Pallares-Miralles,
Romero and Whitehouse, 2012). In Latin America, these programs constitute a large part
of social safety nets. For example, in Mexico, the Adultos Mayores program is the second
largest social program behind the conditional cash transfer program Progresa (formerly
Oportunidades). In Peru, Pension 65, a non-contributory pension program for the elderly,
is second only to the conditional cash transfer program Juntos (Rubio and Garfias, 2010;
Aguila et al., 2013, MIDIS, 2012). In Paraguay, Pensión Alimentaria, is the largest social
program (STP, 2018).

In this paper, we study the effects of Pension Alimentaria in Paraguay. The program's
main goal is to provide economic security to persons who are 65 years of age or older and
living in poverty. At the time this study was conducted, the program provided
beneficiaries with US$ 92 every month. Identification in our study relies on a randomized
control trial.


                                             2
We explore program effects on labor market outcomes. The lack of economic security
may not allow elders to afford retirement. We explore changes in household labor and
expenditure. We also test whether the transfer had impacts on physical health or
subjective well-being. Evidence from Mexico and Peru show non-contributory pensions
improve well-being by allowing beneficiaries to reduce work for pay while increasing
consumption (Galiani, Gertler and Bando, 2016; Bando, Galiani and Gertler, 2020).
Other studies have documented pensions may improve well-being by devoting time to
pleasant activities (Knabe et al., 2010; Krueger and Muller, 2012; and Ruhm, 2001).
Evidence also favors the idea that elders enjoy sharing transfers with other family
members (Gertler et al., 2012, Duflo, 2003). Thus, we also test if the program resulted in
benefits to other household members.

We find that households with a beneficiary increased their level of consumption by 44
percent and that the program reduced the proportion of older adults doing paid work by 4
percentage points. These effects contributed to their subjective welfare as indicated by a
0.48 standard deviation increase on a well-being index. The well-being index is
composed of the depression scale (which itself decreased 7 percentage points), reported
satisfaction with quality of life, empowerment, feeling of contribution to the expenditures
common to all household members, and perception of self-worth. Beneficiaries reported
suffering less illnesses (a decrease of 6 percentage points) and perceived better health (an
of 8 percentage points for good or very good health). However, we do not find impacts on
the use of health services, enrollment of minors in school or household composition.
Finally, we find that transfers from persons residing outside the household decreased (a
decrease of 8 percentage points) and transfer to persons residing outside the household
increased (an increase of 34 percentage points).

Several studies have focused on the effects of non-contributory pension schemes on the
health and material welfare of beneficiaries. Some examine the effects of such schemes
on consumption (Martinez et al., 2020; Fan, 2010; Blau, 2008; Case and Deaton, 1998),
physical and mental health (Alzua et al., 2019; Tae-Young, 2020; Kadir and Barret, 2014;
Lingguo et al., 2018), and labor supply (Alzua et al., 2019; Chen and Jin Tan, 2018;

                                             3
Borrella-Max, 2019; Martinez et al., 2020; de Carvalho, 2008; Bosch, Melguizo and
Pagés, 2013; Grueber and Wise, 1998). Other studies have analyzed the effects of
pensions on other family members. For example, Case and Deaton (1998), Duflo (2003),
Hamoudi and Thomas (2014) and Fan (2010) explore program effects on children's
school enrollment, household composition and private transfers. Our work is also related
to the work of Finkelstein et al. (2012) and Baicker et al. (2013) who find access to
Medicaid health insurance lowered self-reported depression in low-income adults.
Indeed, the literature shows unemployment results in more depression because of the lack
of work, but also in less depression as people can spend more time in pleasant activities
(Knabe et al., 2010; Krueger and Muller, 2012; and Ruhm, 2001).

In contrast, in previous work, we took a comprehensive approach in examining the
influence of Peru's and Mexico's non-contributory pension schemes of Pensión 65 and
Adultos Mayores on both material and subjective well-being (Bando, Galiani and Gertler,
2020; Galiani, Gertler and Bando, 2016). Indeed, pensions may allow older adults to
reduce their time working and increase their time enjoying life. We found that
beneficiaries used part of the transfer to finance an increase in household consumption
and used the rest to offset reduction in labor earnings from beneficiaries reducing paid
work. These changes resulted in an improvement in mental health as measured by the
Geriatric Depression Scale.1

When we compare the results in this paper with the effects of the Pensión 65 and Adultos
Mayores program in Mexico, we find that, qualitatively, we can broadly generalize the
estimates for Mexico and Peru to Paraguay. We find that the effects of the programs are
not that different across the three countries. The depression score in Paraguay decreased
by 6.90 percent, while it decreased by 8.68 percent in Peru and by 9.11 percent in
Mexico. Paid work decreased by 4 percentage points in Paraguay and Peru, and 5
percentage points in Mexico. In addition, consumption rose by 44 percent in Paraguay, by
40 percent in Peru and by 14 percent in Mexico. For food consumption, households in

 Mental health is a widely accepted indicator of quality of life among the elderly (Campbell et al., 1976;
Walker, 2005).
                                                     4
Paraguay allocated 69 percent of the increase, while they allocated 67 percent in Peru and
54 percent in Mexico.

This study is important in that it provides one of the first experimental assessments on the
impact of non-contributory voluntary contributions. The studies by Gertler, Galiani, and
Bando (2016) in Mexico exploited within region variability for identification while
Bando, Galiani, and Gertler (2020) in Peru relied on a regression discontinuity approach.
Many other evaluations on the effects of non-contributory pensions have relied on this
approach such as those used for evaluations in Taiwan by Fan (2010), in Bolivia by
Borrella-Mas, Bosch and Sartarelli (2010), and in El Salvador by Martinez et al., (2020).
Other evaluations have relied on difference-in-difference approaches such as those in
South Korea by Tae-Young (2020), and Singapour by Chen and Jin Tan (2018). To our
knowledge, the only one other experimental assessment of non-contributory pensions is
the study of Alzua et al., (2019) in the state of Ekiti in Nigeria.

In addition to contributing to strengthen the internal validity of evidence on the effects of
non-contributory pensions, this study contributes to construct external validity.2 As
sciences mature, greater weight should be placed on evidence on multiple studies (see,
among others, List, 2020).

In principle, the effects of any program are contingent on the context of the study
(Angrist, J., 2004; Campbell, 1969; Fisher, 1935). Understanding program effects in
multiple economic and cultural contexts is necessary to construct external validity and
inform policy. Several studies use similar multi-country strategies to generalize cause-
and-effect constructs. For example, Cruces and Galiani (2007) examine the effects of
fertility on labor outcomes in three counties, Banerjee et al. (2015) study microcredit in
six countries, Gertler et al. (2015) study health promotion in four countries, Dupas et al.
(2016) examine the effects of opening savings accounts in 3 countries, and Galiani et al.

not built in one day".3

This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the Pension Alimentaria program.
Section III describes the data, and section IV describes the identification strategy. Section
V presents the empirical results. Section VI compares our findings with the results
obtained in Peru and Mexico. Section VII concludes.




    II.     The Pensiones Alimentarias Non-Contributory Pension Program

The program provides beneficiaries with a monthly pension of a quarter of the minimum
salary, which was equivalent to about US$ 92 (Law N. 3728-2009).4 The program targets
those persons 65 year old or older which live under the poverty line and do not have
access to other mechanisms to ensure a minimum income. While 32% of the 327
thousand persons 65 years old or older were in poverty in 2009, non-contributory
pensions covered only 16 percent. The program expanded its coverage to reach 42
percent of the population 65 years old or older (Ministerio de Hacienda, 2019).

To be eligible, a person must be of Paraguayan nationality and reside in Paraguayan
territory, must not be receiving any economic benefits in the field of Social Security
(social insurance, does not include medical insurance), must not be receiving any income
from the Public or Private Sector, such as salaries, pensions, allowances, conditional
transfers, or any other type of remuneration from these sectors, must accept the duties
established in the Law and its regulations for granting the pension as a subsidy, and must
not be serving or have pending sentence with final and executory conviction.

Beneficiaries contact the municipal government to request the program. On a second step,
government officials make a physical visit to the household to check for living

  List (2020) cites the work of Francis Bacon, Novum Organum, which demands researchers slowly build
an essential base of knowledge from the ground up, one experiment at a time .

  The exchange rate in May of 2018 was 5,734.94 per US$1 (Banco Central del Paraguay, 2020
[Retrieved 09/28/2020]). The minimum salary in July of 2018 was 2,112,562.
                                                  6
conditions. On a third step, program officials verify all eligibility requirements are met.
Finally, eligible persons receive a bank transfer through the Banco Nacional de Fomento
(BNF).

The targeting criteria to assess the living conditions of the household changed in
December of 2016 to proceed with a more efficient data collection process. Before 2017,
the ICV (Indice de Calidad de Vida) score used a multidimensional model that
incorporated income, structural poverty, vulnerability, disability, and dependence of
Senior Citizens. Starting 2017, the Technical Planning Secretariat applied a means tested
score denominated STP (Secretaria de Técnica Planificación) scores. The STP score
was adjusted and thus, there are two versions of the STP scores denominated score A and
score B.




    III.     Data Sources

The data used in this study come from a survey carried out by the Innovation for Poverty
Action lab non-profit organization. The survey was designed to evaluate Pensiones
Alimentarias. The sampling frame aimed to identify 3,000 eligible individuals through
random stratified selection on 15 of 17 departments. The departments of Amabay,
Boquerón, and Alto Paraguay were excluded because the Census data indicated only 1
percent of the senior citizen population lived there. Three strata were based on whether
the beneficiary was male or female, and whether the household was located in a rural or
urban location. Among urban households, half were selected from urban districts and half
among the greater Urban Area districts.5 The sampling frame resulted in a sample
composed of beneficiaries out of which 50 percent are male and 50 percent are female, 50
percent live in rural areas and 50 percent in urban areas. The respondent of the survey
was chosen at random when more than one person was eligible for the program within a
household.

 These districts included Asunción, Ciudad del Este, Encarnación, and all districts from the Central
Department.
                                                     7
Data was collected between July of 2017 and November of 2018, approximately a year
after beneficiaries started receiving benefits. The sample was designed to survey 3,000
identified but living conditions were assessed for 2,968 eligible individuals. However, 17
percent of individuals rejected to answer the survey, were absent, were unfit to respond,
were deceased, or not found. Data was collected on a sample of 2,473 individuals.

The survey was designed to be answered by an older adult and the household head in
about one hour each. The survey aimed to assess physical and mental health,
employment, consumption among other items. To ease comparability, the survey
included items used to evaluate the Adultos Mayores and Pensión 65 y más non-
contributory programs in Mexico and Peru.

The survey questions were designed to collect detailed information on eligible older
adults. The survey also collected basic information on other household members,
including labor market participation, hours worked and monetary compensation for
persons 14 years of age or older. The survey included a series of questions to assess the
cognitive health of the respondent.

The survey also collected data on perceptions about life satisfaction, empowerment,
contribution to household expenditures and self-worth. We use the weighted average of
these data to build an index. The index is standardized relative to the distribution in the
control group.

The survey collected information on food and non-food expenditure. Online Appendix A
includes definitions for all the variables used in this study. All variables have non-
missing values for at least 93 percent of the observations, except for memory. The share
of missing values is 17 percent but not related to treatment (p-value = 0.268).




   IV.     Identification Strategy

To identify the impact of the program on the outcomes of interest, we rely on a stratified
randomized control trial (RCT) approach. Within strata, individuals received treatment
                                              8
with equal probability (p=0.500). Online appendix B includes a map showing the
allocation of beneficiaries in the country. We estimate the following empirical model to
assess program impacts:

          =  +  +                                              (1)

where  is the outcome for individual i in strata s,  denotes treatment status and
varies at the individual level, and  denotes an error term. The term  denotes a strata
fixed effect. We cluster errors at the strata level.

A threat to the identification of program effects is attrition. It was not possible to gather
data on 15 percent of the sample. The share was statistically higher among the targeted
individuals in the treatment group (18 percent of treatment individuals and 12 percent
among of control individuals, p=0.000). We focus the main analysis on 54 out of the 66
districts were attrition did not threat the RCT design. This subsample is composed of
1,939 individuals representing 78 percent of the 2,473 households which responded to the
survey. The mean in characteristics across observations in the sample are not statistically
different from those excluded. We repeat the analysis on the full sample in the robustness
check section. We find results consistent with those estimated based on the restricted
sample.




    V.      Descriptive Statistics and Balance

In this section, we provide descriptive statistics of the study population and investigate
balance. Table 1 reports the means of individual and household head characteristics for
the control group and differences in the means of the treatment and control groups.
Column (1) reports the means for the control group. The individual and household
characteristics reflect the targeting criteria. The individuals are on average 72 years old,
47 percent are male, 40 percent are married, and have 2 years of education. The
household heads are on average 65 years old reflecting that a high percentage of
individuals are both eligible are heads of the household, 40 percent are male, 47 percent

                                               9
are married, and have 2 years of schooling. Twenty nine percent of household had
children ages 3 to 15 years old. Column (2) reports the difference of the treatment and
control group means and column (3) shows p-values for tests of the null hypothesis of
equal means estimated using the fixed effects model described by equation 1. The
experimental design resulted in no statistically significant differences among treatment
and control groups.

                                         [Insert Table 1 Here]




    VI.       Empirical Results

In this section we present estimates of the impact of non-contributory pensions on labor
supply, health, well-being, and consumption. We start out by discussing our preferred
specification. More specifically, we focus on the average treatment effect estimates
estimated by the restricted sample and with strata fixed effects. We then discuss how our
results vary when estimation is based the full sample in the before last subsection.

          a. Labor Supply

Table 2 reports the results for labor market participation. Column (1) shows averages
among individuals in the control group, column (2) show differences between treatment
and control groups controlling for strata fixed effects, and column (3) shows p-values
adjusted for the family-wise error rate from multiple hypothesis testing following the
procedure presented in Anderson (2008).6 The adjusted p-values control for the
probability of false rejection for the family of outcomes listed within each table.

These results indicate that the program did not affect labor supply or hours worked. The
share of individuals working remained at 35 percent. The number of hours worked in the
previous week remained at 7.06. However, the receipt of pensions decreased work for


6
  We use FDR p-values. Anderson (2008) also uses FWER p-values to correct for multiple hypotheses
tenting. We find little differences among the two types of correction given the small number of hypotheses
tested in our paper.
                                                    10
pay by 29 percent (from 14 to 10 percent). Labor earnings remained at US$ 22.78. These
findings are consistent with an increase in unpaid work in the household.

                                       [Insert Table 2 here]

       b. Health and Well-Being

Table 3 shows the results for health and well-being. The values of program estimates
given in Column (2) for Panel A show that physical health was not affected. More
specifically, the share of adults which reported illness in the last month decreased in 6
percentage points (from 62 to 56 percent). Consistent with this finding, older adults felt
that their health had improved. The share of older adults with perception of good or very
good health increased from 39 to 47 percent. The perception of older adults that they
were having less difficulty than before in performing daily activities did not change and
remained at 21 percent.

Table 3 Panel B, which focuses on subjective well-being, shows a consistent story. The
program reduced the older adults' score on the Geriatric Depression Scale by 6.85
percent (from 0.58 to 0.54). In addition, the contribution-to-household expenditures score
increased by 87.35 percent (from 0.52 to 0.97), the self-worth score rose by 20.55 percent
(from 0.49 to 0.59). In addition, the satisfaction score increased by 5.09 percent (from
0.82 to 0.87), and the empowerment score increased in 17.14 percent (from 0.70 to 0.82).
The overall well-being score, shown in the last row of Panel B, indicates that the program
led to an increase in well-being equivalent to 0.48 standard deviations. Thus, the pension
transfer may allow older adults to carry out non-paid work and enjoy life.

                                       [Insert Table 3 Here]

The program did not incorporate any health insurance component. Consistent with this,
the share of older adults affiliated with health insurance remained at 10 percent and there
were few impacts on the use of health services. Primary care visits remained at 29
percent, the share which reported seeing a doctor, purchasing medication, or having a test
remained at 64 percent. The share of adults which report having been hospitalized or

                                             11
having had surgery remained at 15 percent. However, we find the share of older adults
which reported having dental, ophthalmological, or optometric care increased in 16.17
percent (from 0.32 to 0.38 percent). Table 4 reports estimates of program effects on
health perception, insurance and health services.

                                      [Insert Table 4 Here]

       c. Household Income and Consumption

Table 5 reports impact estimates for household labor income and consumption
expenditures, with income and expenditures being presented in US dollars (US$) and in
terms of adult equivalents. Column (2) shows that the program did not affect total
household labor income. Indeed, total labor income remained at US$ 42.66. The program
did not affect labor income when excluding older adults either, which remained constant
at US$ 31.85. However, the program increased household expenditure by 43.73 percent
(from US$ 57.74 to US$ 82.99). Older adults allocated 69 percent of their expenditure to
food consumption and 31 percent to non-food consumption.

To get a sense of how these changes relate to the pension transfers, consider the
following. The program transferred US$ 92 (528,141 Guaranies ()) per month per
person. Considering that the average household size is 2.84 and additionally that, on
average, the sample includes 1.29 older adults per household, the average transfer per
adult equivalent to each household was US$ 92/2.87 = US$ 32.06. This amount is
statistically different from the increase in consumption of US$25.25 (p=0.000).

                                          [Insert Table 5 Here]

       d. Benefits to Other Family Members and Transfers

Increases in household consumption may benefit other household members, in addition to
the older adults. Thus, we seek to determine if the pension transfer affected school
enrollment, where we define this outcome variable as the percentage of household
members who are 3 to 15 years old and enrolled in an educational institution. Table 6 in
Panel A shows the results of this analysis. No effects were found.
                                            12
We then look at whether pensions influence living arrangements. As may be seen from
the same panel, we do not find any effects on household size. Next, we try to determine if
transfers at the older-adult and/or household-level change. Panel B shows impact
estimates for current transfers at the household level. The share of households with
individuals who report having received a transfer in the previous six months decreases
from 22 percent to 14 percent. We also find the share of older adults which received a
transfer decreased from 78 to 70 percent, but the share which sent a transfer increased
from 24 to 58 percent. Thus, pension transfers may be offsetting dependence of the
household from transfers and promoting support to other family members who live out of
the household.

        d. Robustness Tests

In this section, we discuss the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of all
observations. In summary, our findings are robust. We compare the results just discussed
with those estimated on the full sample. We find the coefficients are not statistically
different to those discussed. We find impacts very similar in magnitude and significance.
Tables that compare these estimates with our evaluation sample estimates are found in
Online Appendix C. Thus, we conclude our results rely on the exogenous variation
introduced by the experimental design and attrition did not threat the identification of
program effects.




    VII.    Generalizing the Results

Our study is restricted to older individuals living in poverty in 66 departments in
Paraguay. Our study also applies to individuals aged 65 and older. In 2018, the
population of people 65 years old or older represented 6.4 percent of the population
(ECLAC,2020). However, this share is expected to increase to 7.7 percent by 2025
(ECLAC,2020).

                                               13
Our findings are consistent with evidence found in similar contexts. Our findings on labor
supply are consistent with those documented for Brazil in 1991 by de Carvalho (2008)
and for El Salvador in 2013 by Martinez et al. (2020) who find beneficiaries of old-age
pensions decreased their labor force participation in thirty-eight and three percentage
points, respectively.7

We also find the pension transfer leads to increases in consumption as in Fan (2010) in
Taiwan who finds that in Taiwan transfers increased consumption by about 20 percent,
Martinez (2020) in El Salvador who finds that El Salvador transfers increased
consumption by 9 percent. Our finding on physical health is consistent to that in Kadir
and Barret (2014) for Australia and Cheng et al., (2018) for China. Our findings on
benefits to children in the household differ from those in Duflo (2003), but our findings
on transfers to other family members are consistent to those of Hamoudi and Thomas
(2014) for South Africa. Hamoudi and Thomas (2014) find that the receipt of pensions
did influence transfers. We find evidence that the receipt of these pensions leads to a
decrease in transfers received and an increase in transfer made. Our results on transfers
are also like those of Fan (2010) in Taiwan, who finds that pension transfers translate into
decreases in private transfers to the elderly equivalent to 39 cents for every pension
dollar. The receipt of a pension is likely to benefit family members who reside elsewhere.
This finding contrast with that of Peru and Mexico where the programs had no impacts
on transfers.

Though informative, these contrasts among programs have important limitations in that
there are differences in the programs as well as in the measure of outcomes across
studies. To better assess the generalizability of the results in our study, we now compare
our findings with those of Bando, Galiani and Gertler (2020) and Galiani, Gertler and
Bando (2016). Even though the programs in these studies are not identical, they tend to
show important similarities. In addition, we can describe both similitudes and differences




7
 This finding is not generalizable to other age groups. Banerjee et al. (2017) finds cash transfers do not
discourage overall paid work.
                                                     14
with precision in many dimensions (List, 2020). We assess impacts on labor outcomes,
consumption, physical and mental health, and transfers to other family members.

The Pensiones Alimentarias program in Paraguay, the Pension 65 program in Peru, and
the Adultos Mayores program in Mexico have three main features in common. First, all
are federal programs intended to provide social security coverage to the elderly in poor
areas. Second, all programs have minimum eligibility requirements, since they both target
persons above a set age threshold who are living in poverty. Third, all programs provide
regular non conditional cash transfers.

However, the programs differ in three important ways as well. First, both Peru and
Mexico provided bi-monthly transfers of similar amounts (at the time these studies were
conducted, the bi-monthly transfer in Mexico was equivalent to US$ 95, while it was
equivalent to US$ 78 in Peru), while Paraguay provided a monthly transfer of US$ 92.
Second, the Mexican government initially implemented the Adultos Mayores program
only in rural areas (see Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) for an evaluation of the
program's implementation in rural localities with fewer than 2,500 habitants). Over time,
however, Adultos Mayores was expanded to urban areas. The Paraguayan and the
Peruvian governments, on the other hand, did not introduce any geographic restrictions
based on population size. Third, until the 2013 fiscal year, individuals in Mexico did not
become eligible for the Adultos Mayores program until they reached 70 years of age,
whereas, in Paraguay and Peru, people became eligible at age 65 ever since its inception.

In summary, we find that the results in the three countries are qualitatively similar: The
Geriatric Depression Scale scores in Paraguay decreased in 6.85 percent, while in Peru
and Mexico it decreased by 8.68 and 9.11 percent, respectively. Paid work decreased by 4
percentage points in Paraguay and Peru, and in 5 percent in Mexico. Consumption rose
by 44 percent in Paraguay, 40 percent in Peru, and 14 percent in Mexico. In Paraguay,
Peru, and Mexico, a share of 69 percent, 67 percent, and 54 percent of the increase in
consumption was allocated to food, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the comparison of
the consumption, depression and labor variables in Mexico and Peru.


                                             15
                                      [Insert Figure 1 Here]

The three populations have many similarities. The average age of the beneficiaries is
around 72 years in all three countries, and approximately half of the population is male.
Household consumption per adult is equivalent to US$ 58 for Paraguay, US$ 45 for Peru
and US$ 40 for Mexico. There were some significant differences between these sample
populations, however. The program in Mexico targeted rural populations, while the
programs in Paraguay and Peru did not. The sample for Paraguay however over
represents the rural population as it is composed of 50 percent rural households, while 40
percent of the population lives in rural areas (OECD, 2018). As a result, the households
in the sample for the Mexican study were larger, and the education level of the older
adults was lower in the Paraguayan and Mexican sample populations. Another difference
was that 59 percent of older adults work in Peru, while the corresponding figure was only
36 percent in Mexico and 35 percent in Paraguay. Despite these differences, the labor
impact of non-contributory pension systems is similar in magnitude in the three countries
but is smaller as a percentage of initial outcomes in Paraguay and Peru than it is in
Mexico.

The three surveyed populations are similar in terms of the age and gender of older adults,
as well as household consumption levels. However, there are some significant differences
between the three populations that need to be identified, as they allow us to learn how the
effects of non-contributory pensions vary in different contexts. We identify two main
differences. First, the percentage of older adults who are working for pay is larger in Peru
(51 percent of older adults reported having worked in the previous week), relative to
Mexico (23 percent) and Paraguay (14 percent). Accordingly, older adults' labor earnings
amount to US$ 23 in Peru and Paraguay and US$ 16 in Mexico. The programs in
Paraguay, Peru and Mexico triggered a decrease of around four percentage points in paid
work. This change represents a 29 percent decrease (from 14 to 10 percent) in Paraguay,
a 20 percent decrease (from 23 percent to 18 percent) in Mexico, but a decrease of only
nine percent in Peru (from 51 percent to 46 percent).



                                             16
In addition, the household size in terms of adult equivalents is larger in Mexico, where an
average household has 5.6 adult equivalents, while a household has 3.2 adult equivalents
in Peru and 2.9 in Paraguay.8 The average older adult in Peru has four years of education,
while the average older adult in Paraguay or Mexico have one and two years,
respectively. These differences may, in part, be a result of the difference in targeting
criteria and sampling, since the Adultos Mayores program in Mexico targets rural
populations and the Pensión Alimentaria oversamples rural beneficiaries in Paraguay,
while Pension 65 in Peru does not.

We conclude that the results for Paraguay contribute to our knowledge about the effects
of non-contributory pensions and allow us to apply that knowledge to yet a different
context. Despite contextual differences across the three countries, we observe a decrease
in work for pay, improvements in subjective well-being and an increase in consumption.
The evidence suggests that the findings of Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) in rural
Mexico and Bando, Galiani and Gertler (2020) in well-being and consumption can be
reasonably well generalized to Paraguay in qualitative terms.




    VIII.    Conclusions.

To study the effects of non-contributory pensions in Paraguay, we exploit a randomized
control trial, and thus, this study provides a strong identification strategy. We find
improvements in mental health resulting from reduced paid work and an increase in
consumption assessed via regression discontinuity approaches are confirmed by
experimental evidence. We find that the receipt of non-contributory pensions in Paraguay
benefited older adults in several ways. For instance, it led to improvements in physical
and mental health, as evidenced by a decrease of 6 percentage points in reported illness
and an increase of 0.48 standard deviations in the subjective well-being index. We do not
find impacts on the use of health services or labor. The bulk of the cash transfer was used


8
  This implies the transfer in Paraguay (US$92/2.9) and Peru (US$78/3.2) were 91 and 44 percent larger
than that in Mexico (US$95/5.6).
                                                   17
to finance an increase in consumption of 44 percent. In addition, recipient households are
more likely to support members who reside elsewhere, as the share of households that
made transfers to other individuals or households increased from 24 to 58.

More importantly, we find that our results in subjective well-being and consumption are
qualitatively like those of Bando, Galiani and Gertler (2020) and Galiani, Gertler and
Bando (2016) in Peru and Mexico and hence these sets of results help us to construct
external validity on the effects of non-contributory pensions on material and subjective
well-being.

Panel D. Well-being
   Depression                  The index is based on a 8-item yes/no questionnaire that contains
                               queries about whether one feels satisfied with life, whether one is
                               bored or lacks attention from other people, whether one prefers to
                               stay at home rather than going outside or feels full of energy, and so
                               on. The answers to each question are then compared with those
                               corresponding to a person with no trace of depression. Each opposite
                               answer is assigned a value of 1. The Geriatric Depression Scale
                               (GDS) score is simply the sum of the points assigned to the answers
                               divided by the number of questions, with a higher score reflecting
                               the presence of more symptoms of depression. GDS used here was
                               developed by Sheikh and Yesavage (1986).
   Satisfaction                To construct this variable we used the following questions:
                               "How content are you...
                               With your health status?
                               With yourself?
                               With your ability to carry out daily activities?
                               With your interpersonal relations (neighbors, friends)?
                               With the place where you live?
                               With your relationship with your children?
                               With your relationship with other family members?
                               With your life in general?"
                               The points for each question for the possible response options were
                               as follows:
                               Very content=1; Content=1; Not very content=0 ; Not content=0.
                               The score is the sum of the points for each question, divided by
                               eight.
   Empowerment                 To construct this variable we used the following questions:
                               "Do you think...
                               That your family takes you into account when making decisions on
                               household expenditures?
                               That your family takes you into account when making important
                               decisions for the household?
                               That you support household expenditure?
                               That you decide freely about what to spend your money on?
                               That your family treats you with respect?
                               That your family respects your wishes, opinions and other
                               interests?"
                               The points for each question for the possible response options were
                               as follows:
                               Always=1; Yes, most of the time=1; Sometimes=0; Rarely=0;

                               The score is the sum of the points for each question, divided by six.

   Contribution              To construct this variable, we used the following question:
                             "How much of your income do you contribute to household
                             expenditure in the household where you live?"

   Self-worth                To construct this variable, we used the following questions:
                             "Do you consider that you:
                             Provide economic support for the household?
                             Provide support by doing household chores (cleaning, cooking, etc.)?
                             Provide support in the form of childcare?
                             Support others with your advice and experience?
                             Represent a burden for the household?" (coding order reversed)
                             The points for each question for the possible response options were as
                             follows:

Appendix B. Map of beneficiary distribution across districts

This appendix includes a map showing the location of beneficiaries in the country.




Figure B1. The departments show the distribution of beneficiaries across departments.
Departments in brighter red represent those with the highest share of beneficiaries and those with
darker shade the lowest share (Share ranged from 1 to 20 percent). The departments of Boquerón,
Alto Paraguay, and Amambay were not sampled because less than 1 percent of the beneficiary
population resided in these departments.

Appendix C. Comparison of households included and those excluded from analysis

Table C1 shows the number of households according to their inclusion in the different
stages that defined the evaluation sample. The program targeted 3,000 potential
beneficiaries out of which 2,968 were identified and needs were assessed to confirm
eligibility for the program. Out of those, a total of 2,473 potential beneficiaries received
visits and information was collected. Out of those, a total of 1,939 potential beneficiaries
provided information which could be used for evaluation.
Table C2 shows estimates for differences among those individuals in the surveyed
sample but excluded from the evaluation and those in the evaluation sample. Such tests
allow us to assess if the lack of information of excluded potential beneficiaries would
result in a biased sample. The first column shows the average of characteristics both for
older adults and household heads among the 1,939 older adults included in the sample.
The second column shows averages among the 534 older adults excluded. The thirds
column shows average differences. The fourth column lists p-values for tests of
differences in means between the two groups. Overall, we find no statistically significant
differences at the 10 percent confidence level.
We conclude that any exclusions resulting from the lack of data is unlikely to bias the
sample.
