                                           ABSTRACT

This study examines the various uses of subjective outcomes as a focus of interest for economists.

It outlines the possible channels by which economists can usefully add to what are already massive

literatures on such outcomes in the other social sciences. Generally we contribute little if we merely

engage in fancier empirical work and still less if we describe subjective outcomes by other

subjective outcomes. Our biggest contributions can be in adducing economic theories that allow a

better understanding of objective behavior using subjective outcomes, or of the determinants of

subjective outcomes; or in understanding subjective outcomes, such as expectations, that underlie

objective economic behavior.

1. Introduction

        There has been an upsurge in the use and analysis in economics of subjective

outcomes. A long survey paper (Frey and Stutzer 2002) discussed some of the literature, but

even that was restricted to only one part of the interest in this type of outcome. A relevant

question is why economists are looking at these expressions of behavior now. I think it is

partly due to the fact that we are seeking things to do with the large amounts of data that we

have suddenly discovered—the Mt. Everest phenomenon, if it’s there, we must climb it.

Partly too, it may be that we believe that our skills enable us to do better jobs of analyzing

outcomes that have previously been in the sole purview of other social scientists.

       In the mid-1970s I did some research on a subjective outcome—job satisfaction. The

comment from the editor of a journal to which I submitted the paper was “This is not

economics.” Was the editor correct, and would he still be correct today? There is a lot of

work being done on these topics, but what kind of work should we be doing? Here I go

through a variety of examples of my own and others’ research in trying to distinguish

between the kinds of topics where we have something to offer and others where we do not.

I neglect many examples with which I am not familiar that may be at least as good as those

that I present. This brief discussion indicates that there is a disjuncture between what we

economists are doing in these areas and what we should be doing.

       This discussion raises a larger question, which I am not going to answer: “Is there

anything beyond the scope of economics?” I have some bona fides in asking this question,

having written papers on such bizarre topics as suicide, beauty and sleep that some people

argue are not subjects that we should be working on. If those topics are off limits for us,

discussing the economics of subjective outcomes is even further away from what we should

be considering. Some of it is; but I will try to demonstrate that some of these things are very
                                                                                                  2

much within our purview, and that we should be thinking about them. While I cover a fair

number of topics, there are other subjective measures (e.g., preferences toward risk, rates of

time preference) that I do not discuss but that have been studied by economists and used in

empirical analyses of economic outcomes.

2. Life Satisfaction

       The first research area that I deal with is life satisfaction: How happy one is with

one’s life. Economists’ work on this topic comprises, if not the majority of our research on

subjective outcomes, at least surely a plurality. The general idea here is to obtain data on

how satisfied the subjects are, based on their subjective responses, and to look at the effects

of economic variables on their satisfaction. The typical economic variable is income. The

general research question is, “How happy does your income make you?” Many of the people

who work in this area try to equate this happiness measure with utility (with Lévy- Garboua

and Montmarquette 1997, being the best example so far). On the surface this is very

appealing. Utility is one of the two foundation ideas that we deal with in our intro micro

classes, and it is a topic we should be able to say something about. How happy are people

over time within a country? How happy are people across countries? What are the effects of

various demographic correlates on differences in happiness?

       I find most of the analysis by economists on this issue to be rather silly. The first

difficult issue is the scaling problem—the problem of converting what must be some

continuous ordinal measure into a measure described by a few categories. How people scale

it in their own minds is a question that we economists have barely begun to think about,

although cognitive psychologists have paid this issue substantial attention.

       The larger problem, however, is not the scaling problem. I am willing to admit that

we might not be able to solve the scaling problem; but at least we can wave our hands and
                                                                                                 3

say that somehow there is an underlying ordinal index of people’s behavior that could be

captured if we were able to spy on them sufficiently carefully. But there is another problem

here: There is no apparent link of these subjective responses to any underlying measure of

utility, at least measures that maintain the properties that we desire for utility functions. On a

theoretical basis, Homans (1961) pointed out that there is no reason to believe that long-run

improvements in objective circumstances will generate long-run increases in subjective

responses. While we generally believe that utility rises with additional inputs of goods and

the time to consume them, many psychologists believe that satisfaction adjusts to

expectations about living standards. If we believe that utility equals expressed satisfaction,

there is little justification for any policy designed to raise living standards.

        On the empirical side, there are books and articles surveying hundreds of empirical

studies of life satisfaction by psychologists (e.g., the survey by Diener and Biswas-Diener

2002). If you examine this literature, you find that every specification that economists have

used has also been included in at least several psychological studies. For example, I

discussed a paper at the 2002 AEA meetings (Gardner and Oswald 2001), which received

immense amounts of press, in which the focus was on lottery winners. If I won the Texas

Lotto, I would be very happy for a while. But after I was used to the lottery win, I would

think, “The lottery’s my due, I deserve to have won it.” My satisfaction would revert to its

mean. This is exactly what was observed in this study. It is also exactly what was shown in

two very similar studies of lottery winners done by psychologists in the 1970’s.

        Our ability to push buttons in STATA, SAS, TSP, or whatever, is not unique:

Psychologists and sociologists are perfectly capable of doing that. Our strength, I would

argue, and the thing that should underlie whether we do anything in this area, is the extent to

which we can bring economic theory to bear on the specifications that we try to formulate.
                                                                                                  4

On this topic in particular I have seen nothing where any economic theory has been brought

to bear. Thus, in terms of a hierarchy that I will summarize at the end of this article, it is

clear that economists’ work on this topic has not progressed very far.1 Now perhaps

somebody will generate more ideas that use economics here; but simply running fancy

regressions on this subject is not new (except to economists). Although I would like to see

more people working in this area, thus far we have not done much to justify our incursions.

3. Job Satisfaction

       I have published two papers on job satisfaction, one each quarter century

(Hamermesh 1977, 2001). To show that I am not completely self-congratulatory, I rather

doubt that we have offered much in this area either. We have only one notion here that other

fields do not have, and that is the idea of equilibrium. If people choose an occupation based

on the returns to working in it, then a permanent shock to those returns will in the long run

have no effect on the average satisfaction of workers in the occupation. A little testing of

that idea—putting it into the context of wage determination, which psychologists do not seem

to have done—might have some small value. There is no real basis in economic theory; there

is just the notion of equilibrium, of adjustment to what one expected upon making one’s

investments in human capital—end of story.

       To demonstrate that there is some evidence of equilibration in people’s stating

subjectively their job satisfaction I looked at information for the United States (Hamermesh

2001) that links changes in job satisfaction across earnings quartiles to interquartile changes

in income inequality. This is essentially a double-difference study, estimated using data from

various National Longitudinal Surveys for the United States.

       Interquartile differences in job satisfaction and earnings inequality grew in tandem

over the period 1978-88—a time when the very rapid growth in earnings inequality began in
                                                                                                5

the U.S. When one looks at changes over the longer period, 1978-96, the picture looks

entirely different. Workers in the top earnings quartile no longer exhibited higher job

satisfaction than those in the second and third earnings quartiles. They appear to have

become somewhat used to their increased relative earnings—to the increased returns to their

skills.

          A similar analysis in that study used data from the German Socioeconomic Panel. In

Germany there was almost no change in interquartile earnings inequality over 1984-94; and

interquartile differences in the fractions of people responding that they were highly,

somewhat or fairly satisfied during this period compared to the fraction stating that they were

dissatisfied were also quite small. Between 1994 and 1996, however, earnings inequality,

especially the advantage of the top earners over other workers, rose rapidly. At the same

time, the difference in average satisfaction of top earners over others became much greater.

The stimulus of a rapid rise in earnings generated an immediate response of a sharp rise in

job satisfaction.

          One might argue that, by using double differences, this approach also circumvents the

problem of scaling in categorical subjective variables, so that it might handle both of the

problems I alluded to in discussing life satisfaction. I am dubious about that; and surely

without detailed work on cognitive responses to these questions (a task for which economists

are ill-prepared), one cannot make any such claims. Perhaps the best to be said about this

literature is that we economists have made a very small contribution to a large social-

scientific literature.

4. Subjective Health Outcomes

          The next area is one in which I have not worked, although many people have. The

standard measure of health status asks survey respondents to rate their health on a numerical
                                                                                                 6

scale, typically denoting excellent, very good, good, fair or poor. Many labor economists,

including me, have used this measure as a control variable on the right-hand side of wage and

other equations. Why do we use this subjective outcome? Very simply, we usually cannot

take blood samples, measure heart rates or count cholesterol when we conduct the large

surveys that provide most of our data. Instead, we ask the respondents how healthy they are.

       Is there any economic content in explaining these subjective health outcomes? There

is a large literature on health production functions, and we can measure the effects of inputs

on this subjective outcome. There is an important economic question here: Does spending on

health improve health? While we can measure health objectively through morbidity and

mortality measures, in large micro data sets of living people we typically do not have those

measures. Since the evidence (Bound 1991) indicates that this subjective measure is fairly

highly correlated with some objective measures of health status, as a cost-effective first-pass

at the issue it has some value. We can thus use it as a way around our inability to get

objective measures of health outcomes. Marrying it to what we believe might be objective

determinants of health status through the notion of a production function is something we

should approve of.

5. Measuring Expectations

       Expectations are inherently subjective—they deal with events on which objective

measures cannot as yet be provided. A number of purely subjective expectations are central

to testing basic theories of economics. When we write down the lifetime maximization of the

consumer, for example, we derive paths of consumption, labor supply, wealth and other

outcomes from the dynamic optimization problem defined over a horizon, T. How long is T?

This is rather important. As another example, what is the subjective discount rate in this

maximand, something that surely differs across people?
                                                                                                 7

       As an illustration I deal here with expectations about the horizon, T, and about

expectations of the probability of survival through various future years. The idea in this

example was to elicit from people information about their expectations of longevity and to

append it to a representative dataset to examine the role of expectations in the consumer’s

lifetime maximization problem. To do this I undertook two mail surveys of randomly

selected adult males, economists and others (Hamermesh 1985), obtaining information on

expected length of life and various personal characteristics. The surveys included questions

about the length of life of the respondent’s parents and grandparents.

       To infer the impact of the objective measures on expected longevity I estimated the

regressions presented in Table 1. (Other variables in the equations tested for the rationality

of forecasts by using information from life tables and are unimportant here.) The crucial

variables are those for old and young grandparents and parents (whether one’s forebears died

naturally before age 60 or lived beyond age 79), as their estimated impacts on subjective

longevity in these samples can be used to create forecasts of longevity in some of the large

random samples that empirical economists use. The results are heartening, in the sense that

the forecasts of members of both samples are sensitive to the life experiences of their parents

and grandparents. Indeed, they are too sensitive—they overstate what the epidemiological

evidence suggests is the objective relationship (Hamermesh and Hamermesh 1983), but that

excess enhances their value in creating forecasts of expectations in large samples.2

       Using the 1975 wave of the Retirement History Survey, and the Terman sample of

high-IQ Californians and their families, I linked these results to information on the

respondents’ parents’ ages at death to create variables proxying the respondents’ horizons

(Hamermesh 1984). These were then used to examine whether, other things, including

financial wealth, equal, these older Americans’ consumption of goods and leisure differed as
                                                                                               8

their imputed horizons differed. The results, contained for the RHS sample in Table 2,

suggest that the length of the horizon does affect these important life-cycle outcomes.

Consumption spending in particular is reduced among otherwise identical people if their

horizons are longer. The effects of increases in the subjective horizon on market work are

relatively much smaller and less significant statistically, but they are in the expected

direction.

        The samples from which subjective expectations were obtained were quite small, and

the respondents whose behavior was examined were not those whose expectations about

longevity were elicited. More recently, the Health and Retirement Survey has obtained

information from a panel of older Americans on their expectations of longevity and their

spending and labor-force behavior. Within this one data set researchers (e.g., Gan, Hurd and

McFadden, 1998; Haider and Stephens 2004) have begun to examine the interactions

between the subjective horizon and the crucial variables that result from lifetime utility

maximization. This combination avoids the loss of information on idiosyncratic behavior

that plagued my now-ancient research.

        This stuff is great fun—and it speaks to some of the central issues in both

microeconomics and macroeconomics. By itself, however, the work on expectations

contains no economic analysis—it merely estimates regressions on a subjective outcome

using a set of variables that I believed, with no theoretical justification, might affect

expectations, and I then appended the results to standard econometric models. The

justification for an economist undertaking this kind of analysis—this atheoretical empirical

discussion of a subjective outcome—is that the results are important inputs to our basic

research and are not likely to be considered (and were not discussed) by other social

scientists.
                                                                                                  9


6. Time Stress

       Some issues are inherently subjective and describe outcomes that would seem to be

entirely outside the purview of economists. The crucial word here is “seem”—topics like

fertility, discrimination, sumo wrestling, and many others may at one time have seemed

outside our area of expertise; but if by using economic theory we can advance knowledge of

these subjects, they become economic topics. Jacob Viner once remarked that economics is

what economists do. I would modify that to note that economics is what economists do if

economists use economic theory.

       One area that I believe fits this description is the analysis of time stress, on which I

have recently been working (Hamermesh and Lee 2003). The issue here is purely

subjective—what determines how rushed people feel? Previous analysis, by social

psychologists and sociologists, has linked these feelings to the presence of children and to

time allocation at home and in the workplace. Economic theory, particularly the theory of

household production (Becker 1965), allows us to recognize that time use is affected by

financial resources, and thus that the extent to which a time constraint binds is in the end an

increasing function of the opportunity cost of the time of an individual and other members of

his/her household. The explicit prediction, which is far from intuitively obvious (and even,

from many discussions, clearly unthinkable by intelligent laypeople or many other social

scientists) is that otherwise identical people whose incomes are greater will feel more rushed

for time. The same prediction holds even more strongly if one does not hold constant for

differences in time use.

       We examined this hypothesis for a number of countries (Hamermesh and Lee 2003)

by relating subjective responses about how stressed respondents in large micro data sets are

for time. The determinants in each sample were the individual’s hours of market work, hours
                                                                                              10

of non-market work, earnings (and thus full income, since hours of market work are held

constant) and spouse’s earnings and time allocation. Various demographic and locational

controls were included for each of the data sets.

       Otherwise identical men and women in couples with higher incomes are more

stressed for time—feel more rushed—holding constant their use of time. The effects are not

insubstantial—one-standard-deviation increases in household pay raise the percentages of

workers who state that they are stressed by three to fifteen percentage points (over sample

means ranging from 33 to 45 percentage points). In North America and Canada the effects of

interquantile increases in earnings in increasing time stress begin to approach those of

interquartile increases in hours of market work. Someone might claim that common traits

generate positively correlated errors in both income and expressed time stress (although as an

economist I would rather assume that differences in traits are uncorrelated with income).

Even that essentially non-economic objection would seem vitiated by the additional finding

(for Germany) that non-working (in the market) women with high-earning husbands are more

stressed for time than their otherwise identical compatriots whose husbands earn less. The

results demonstrate that people with a higher value of time are more stressed for time, not

only because they may work more, but because the command that they possess over goods

makes them busy spending their incomes.

       Here is an example where simple economic theory generates a prediction that is novel

and utterly unattainable without using theory. While the outcome is subjective and not

inherently interesting to economists, it is directly linked to areas—time use and

consumption—that we study extensively. While we do not study how people feel about

issues in these areas, other social scientists do; and we have something useful and unique to

say about these feelings.
                                                                                              11


7. Some Recent Negatives and Positives

        What is disturbing is that, in addition to our welcome forays into using economic

theory to describe the determinants of subjective outcomes, and to analyzing the formation of

the subjective determinants of economic outcomes, we are also increasingly making forays

into studying how subjective outcomes are affected by subjective measures. Thus, for

examples: 1) Coleman and DeLeire (2003) have analyzed how youths’ expectations about

their incomes at age 30 are affected by the extent to which the youth “felt in control” at age

13; 2) Boex (2000) examined how students’ instructional ratings of their professors are

affected by the same students’ perceptions of the professors’ lecturing ability; 3) McGarry

(2002) used using respondents’ self-assessed health status to describe retirement

expectations.

        There is nothing wrong with this if we are interested in how expectations affect

expectations per se, although I see no economic content in that issue. If, however, we are

using a subjective measure to proxy an objective determinant of a subjective outcome, the

difficulty is readily apparent from the following simple set-up. We are interested in the

determinants of subjective outcome S* by objective determinant B and controls X, and we

have information on a large set of respondents indexed i. We wish to estimate:

S*i = αXi + βBi + ε i ,                                                                      (1)

where ε i is an error term. The difficulty is that we do not observe B, instead having

information only on some subjective proxy for it, BS. Now BS may be a fairly good

predictor of B, as in the case of self-assessed health. But like any subjective outcome it will

be shaded by some person-specific effect, θi, reflecting person i’s general optimism or

pessimism. A person-specific effect ηi also shades the subjective response S* and is likely to

be highly positively correlated with θi. We thus have as observables:
                                                                                               12

BSi = Bi + θi ,                                                                              (2a)

and:

Si = S*i + ηi    .                                                                           (2b)

When we estimate using the observables S and BS:

Si = αXi + β[BSi + θi] + ε i .                                                               (3b)

we are really estimating:

[S*i + ηi]= αXi + β[Bi + θi] + ε i .                                                         (3b)

        The same difficulty arises if we wish to describe some objective outcome by a

subjective measure and proxy the dependent variable by some subjective measure. The extent

of the difficulty in both cases depends on the relative contributions of σθ to σBS and ση to σS,

and on how strongly positive is the correlation between θ and η. The degree of bias thus

varies from case to case. It is hard to believe, however, given the R2 that we typically

produce in micro data, that the positive correlations between the observed variables of

interest that are induced by this problem are not large in nearly all cases. In short, even if we

rationalize equations like (1) as having a basis in objective behavior, the need to use

subjective proxies usually obviates any hope of correctly estimating a behavioral

relationship.3

          A number of other inherently subjective expectational and other outcomes should

be of interest to economists, as the extent of rationality in their revision is important. Thus,

for examples, Charles (2002) examined how depression among older Americans is affected

by their retirement status, cleverly using kinks in retirement incentives under the American

OASI scheme to circumvent problems of simultaneity. Lochner (2003) used the NLSY97 to

examine whether arrest led young people to alter their perceptions of the criminal justice

system.
                                                                                               13

         One could at least as well analyze the impacts of these and other subjective

measures on economic outcomes. Thus it would be interesting to know how changing

expectations about arrest and punishment probabilities affect individuals’ propensities to

commit crimes. In another area, it would be interesting to learn how individuals’ preferences

for neighbors of the same income (or race) as themselves affect patterns of residential

location.4

8. A Hierarchy for Research

   The availability of interesting questions; the immense amount of data; and, despite the

burgeoning interest among economists, the relative paucity of economic research make the

analysis and use of subjective outcomes a fertile field for us, and one that is likely to be

heavily ploughed by economists in the next decade. We need to be careful, however, to

ensure that we use our skills and do not merely replicate what other social scientists have

accomplished; still worse, we should not abandon our comparative advantage—our

frameworks for analyzing maximizing behavior by individuals and how that behavior affects

individual and group outcomes.

   We should keep in mind the following hierarchy that moves from less to more desirable

approaches to research using subjective measures:

1. Atheoretical statistical models examining subjective outcomes and explaining them by

their subjective determinants. We economists should view this approach as a no-no—we can

learn nothing about objective behavior from this approach, and in most cases cannot even use

it to describe the determinants of subjective outcomes.

2. Atheoretical statistical models examining the objective determinants of subjective

outcomes that are not relevant inputs into describing economic behavior. These kinds of

studies that have proliferated in other disciplines. They are interesting to the intelligent
                                                                                                 14

layperson and to other social scientists, but as economists we have little novel to add to the

discussion.

3. Atheoretical statistical models examining the objective determinants of subjective

outcomes that are important inputs into describing economic behavior. While other social

scientists might have studied these, in most cases we know better what subjective measures

are the most important variables in our models of objective economic behavior.

4. Theoretically based statistical models of important, albeit non-economic outcomes. There

are no doubt many other areas besides time stress where we can analogize a subjective

outcome of general interest to a concept in one of our models and derive how individual

agents’ maximizing behavior affects the outcome.

5. Theoretically based statistical models of the determinants of economically relevant

subjective outcomes. I have seen nothing of this type yet, but I view it as the summit that we

should be trying to reach.

       Research on the determinants of subjective outcomes and work using those outcomes

to describe objective behavior are booming areas among economists. As the boom

continues, we need to be careful to base the research on our comparative advantage—our

coherent models of underlying behavior—lest we either duplicate what other social scientists

have already done many times over or, worse still, generate results that have no absolutely

economic meaning.

FOOTNOTES


1
    An example of useful work on this topic that, although it lacks an economic-theoretic basis,

at least uses subjective outcomes to analyze questions that only economists would consider,

is Di Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald (2001).
2
    Unlike these, the estimated impacts of smoking on subjective longevity accord well with

objective evidence, a finding that has been used repeatedly by other economists to defend

tobacco companies against lawsuits by ex-smokers or their heirs.
3
    Winkelmann (2002) discusses other econometric issues in analyzing subjective outcomes.

    I am indebted to Stephen Ross for suggesting this example.
