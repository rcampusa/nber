                                            ABSTRACT

There is a well-established association between income and child health. We examine the
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides cash assistance to low-income
children with disabilities, to assess how this relationship arises. We use a large database of
Medicaid administrative records to estimate the causal effects of SSI receipt on children's health,
using a regression discontinuity design that exploits the rule that low-income children born below
a birthweight threshold are automatically eligible for SSI. We find that children whose
birthweights fall below the threshold are significantly more likely to be awarded SSI. Over the
first 8 years of their lives, children with birthweights just below the threshold incur Medicaid
expenditures 30% lower than do those born just above the threshold. They are less likely to be
admitted to hospital, have shorter hospital stays when admitted, and use fewer specialist services.
Eligible children experience reduced rates of diagnosis across a range of conditions, with
significantly lower rates of both acute (infection, injury) and chronic (malnutrition,
developmental delay) conditions in early life. SSI receipt delays the incidence of new chronic
conditions by 1.7 months and reduces the number of new chronic conditions recorded through
age 3 by 15%. Past health shocks significantly increase current healthcare utilization, but an
interaction term between the SSI eligibility and past health shocks is not statistically significant, a
pattern that suggests that increased income derived from SSI reduces the incidence of early health
shocks but does not change how families respond to these shocks. Children receiving SSI are
more likely to live in higher income neighborhoods mainly because their families are less likely
to move out of better neighborhoods. However, we do not find evidence that children's receipt of
SSI affects their mother's health or fertility. Reductions in Medicaid spending associated with
SSI eligibility offset increased cash transfer payments by a ratio of 3.3:1.

Introduction

In 2018, 16.2 percent of American children (approximately 12 million) lived in families with

incomes below the federal poverty threshold (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). Cash transfers, as well

as other in-kind transfers, provide benefits to help expand families' budgets and allow low-income

parents to optimize investment in their children (Almond, Currie, 2011). A growing body of

research shows that such investments in early life have significant long-term impacts, including

improved educational attainment and earnings (Hoynes, Schanzenbach, 2018). Cash transfers have

also been found to improve long-term health outcomes including longevity (Aizer et al., 2016), 1

nutrition (Milligan, Stabile, 2011; Aizer et al., 2016), mental health (Milligan, Stabile, 2011; Akee

et al., 2018), and maternal mental health (Milligan, Stabile, 2011). But the process through which

income improves child health is not well understood.

In the United States, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides means-tested cash assistance

to the elderly and to individuals with disabilities, including children. SSI is administered by the

Social Security Administration (SSA), which is responsible for screening applicants based on

income, assets, citizenship, and eligibility categories (age, vision, and disability) and making SSI

awards. Beginning in 1993, low birthweight became a presumptive disability category ("premature

children") for SSI 2. This allowed families of premature babies to be awarded cash benefits for up

to six months while their applications were under review for eligibility determination. Later, in

2015, low birthweight became its own medical listing in 2015 (Guldi et al., 2018). Eligibility for

benefits based on low birthweight is based on weight relative to gestational age, which SSA gathers

from birth certificates. After 32 weeks of gestational age, the SSI eligibility threshold gradually


1
  Conversely, reduced social welfare benefits resulted from the 1996 welfare reform was associated with an increase
in infant mortality (Leonard, Mas, 2008).
2
  This change followed the 1991 decision of SSA that low birthweight is a condition functionally equivalent to
meeting conventional medical listings.

increases from 1,200 grams: to 1,250 grams at 32 weeks, 1,325 grams at 33 weeks, 1,500 grams

at 34 weeks, 1,700 grams at 35 weeks, 1,875 grams at 36 weeks, and 2,000 grams at 37-40 weeks.

For children who gain eligibility due to low birthweight, SSA typically conducts Continuing

Disability Reviews (CDR) within 1 year of birth or later (Hemmeter, Bailey, 2015). 3 If an

otherwise eligible child is found not to have any significant developmental delays, SSI benefits

may end. In 2018, of the 17,346 children who qualified for SSI benefits based on low birthweight,

only 49.8% were deemed eligible for continuing benefits (SSA, 2019; Guldi et al., 2018).

SSI support can provide a substantial source of income for families (Guldi et al., 2018). Duggan

and Kearney (2007), using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data and

following families of disabled children before and after SSI participation, estimate that child SSI

enrollment reduces the likelihood that children live in poverty by 11 percentage points. Their

household-level fixed effects estimation finds that an additional $100 of child SSI benefits

increases household income by $72 (Kubik, 1999). 4

Cash transfers in early life may be particularly valuable to children at high risk of adverse health

outcomes, such as those born at low birthweight. Prior research documents that low birthweight

has persistent effects on later life outcomes (Black et al., 2007). Cash benefits for low birthweight

children could improve well-being by offsetting extra disability-related expenditures or by

replacing earnings of parents who have to reduce their work hours to take care of a disabled child

(Daly, Burkhauser, 2003). While one study (Currie, Hyson, 1999) found that family income does




3
  According to Hemmeter and Bailey (2015), however, more than 90% of low birthweight SSI recipients received
their first CDR decision at age 1-3 during 1998-2008.
4
  It reflects the program rule that a child is not able to receive benefits from both SSI and other social welfare
program such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Because of SSI's more generous benefits, there
have been more children in households with SSI income than children living in households with TANF income
(Duggan, Kearney, 2007).

                                                        2
not fully mitigate the negative effects of low birthweight, the evidence directly exploring the

relationship between SSI and child outcomes is limited.

To our knowledge, only one study on the effects of child SSI receipt on outcomes exists (Guldi et

al., 2018). Using a nationally representative longitudinal data set and exploiting the 1,200-gram

birthweight cutoff for SSI eligibility, Guldi et al. (2018) find that eligibility increases the

probability that families of low birthweight children benefit from SSI for the first two years of

their life by 25-30 percentage points. The authors estimate that these SSI benefits for low

birthweight infants increase child motor skill development scores (Bayley Mental Motor scale) by

0.4-0.7 of standard deviation and reduce maternal labor market participation on the intensive

margin (54.6% of the mean of mother's weekly hours worked), without affecting child mortality.

Their dataset, however, has several limitations. The sample size is small (N=150-650 depending

on specification) and SSI participation is measured at the household level, not the child level. They

also do not have direct measures of health service utilization.

Our study builds on this work by using Medicaid administrative data from New York State to

estimate the causal effects of SSI on a comprehensive range of child health measures over 8 years

of follow-up. We use a regression discontinuity design and exploit variation in eligibility for SSI

based on birthweight. We find that being born below the low birthweight cutoff increases the

probability of SSI enrollment before age one by 93%. In early childhood (before age 6), SSI

recipients are significantly less likely to be diagnosed with both acute (infection, injury) and

chronic (malnutrition, developmental delay) conditions, and have a decreased probability of

hospital admission.

The effects of SSI eligibility on health span a wide range of outcomes, although only a minority

are statistically significant. Looking across outcomes, we find that children birthweight-eligible



                                                 3
for SSI incur 30% lower Medicaid costs by age 8 than children born just above the threshold.

Reductions in Medicaid costs occur across the distribution of spending, at and above the median,

with the greatest impacts at the top of the Medicaid cost distribution.

In an earlier descriptive analysis, Currie and Stabile (2003) examine whether socioeconomic

gradients in health occur because of differences in the rate of incidence of health shocks or because

of differences in the response to these shocks. Following their approach, we find that birthweight

eligibility for SSI delays the incidence of new chronic conditions by 1.7 months and reduces the

number of new chronic conditions diagnosed by age 3 by 15%. We also find that past health shocks

significantly increase current healthcare utilization, but, like the earlier literature, we find that an

interaction term between the SSI eligibility and past health shocks is not statistically significant.

This pattern implies that the increased income received through SSI reduces the probability that a

child is subject to health shocks in early life, but does not change how families respond to these

shocks (Case et al., 2002; Currie, Stabile, 2003).

We find that children birthweight-eligible for SSI also live in higher income neighborhoods by age

8, mainly because their families are less likely to move out of such neighborhoods than are families

whose infants were born above the threshold. Unlike a prior cash transfer study (Milligan, Stabile,

2011), we do not find evidence of protective effects of increased unearned income extend to

maternal health outcomes.

Reductions in Medicaid spending associated with SSI eligibility are substantial; while our study

population only accounts for 0.7% of the entire 2006-2010 Medicaid birth cohort, their total

Medicaid costs through age 8 are about 4% of the total costs incurred by the whole cohort.

Reductions in Medicaid spending associated with SSI eligibility offset increased cash transfer

payments by a ratio of 3.3:1.



                                                   4
Method

Our study uses New York State Medicaid claims data. We restrict the sample to include low-

income children born in the state of New York between 2006 and 2010 5 whose birthweights fall

between 900 grams and 1,500 grams. Our primary study sample is restricted to include only those

continuously enrolled in Medicaid (without any lapse in coverage) from birth until age 8 (we relax

this restriction in sensitivity analyses below). 6 We further restrict our study sample to those born

at 32 weeks of gestation or earlier (ICD-9 diagnosis codes: 765.21-765.26), to limit bias due to

errors in determination of birthweight eligibility at higher gestational ages (we test this restriction

in sensitivity analyses below). Our final sample includes 1,348 low birthweight, preterm births

from low-income households in the state of New York.

To examine the impacts of SSI, we exploit the 1,200-gram threshold in a regression discontinuity

design by comparing children whose birthweight fall just below the threshold (and are more likely

to benefit from SSI) to children above the threshold, using the following parametric linear

regression model:

(1)  =  + 1  + 2  + 3   +  + 

where  is birthweight in grams (centered at 1,200 grams) of child  ,  is an indicator that

equals one if birthweight is smaller than 1,200 grams, and  is a vector of demographic factors

including race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other




5
  The 2006 data are the earliest and the 2018 data are the latest we are able to use. Note that the 2006-2010 birth
cohort was not affected by the 1996 welfare reform which toughened the disability standard for SSI participation
(Kubik, 1999).
6
  Among all the 3,690 preterm babies born in 2006-2010 whose birthweights fell between 900 and 1,500 grams,
35.2% were continuously enrolled in Medicaid for the first eight years of life.

                                                          5
race/ethnicity), gender, and birth month and birth year fixed effects. 7 We also control for trend in

birthweight by interacting the treatment group indicator and the birthweight measure. In addition,

our main specification includes full interactions between birth year dummies, gender, and

race/ethnicity.

Outcome measures  include medical conditions children experienced during the study period

identified through diagnosis codes in the Medicaid encounter data. Following previous studies

(Case et al., 2002; Clark et al., 2019), we include a set of common conditions in childhood as

outcome measures by grouping conditions using the Clinical Classifications Software (CCS)

system, leaving aside rare conditions for this study population (for instance, hypertension, diabetes

mellitus, and renal failure). In addition, we focus on single conditions such as the incidence of

inadequate nutrition (malnutrition), maltreatment (injury), and infection, which are expected to be

affected by an improved household environment (Lee, Mackey-Bilaver, 2007; Schnitzer et al.,

2011; Phil, Basso, 2019). We also measure overall healthcare utilization as total Medicaid costs,

hospitalization utilization, and specialist visits.

To test if SSI benefits affected maternal health outcomes, in the way the Canada Child Tax Benefit

program improved maternal mental health (Milligan, Stabile, 2011), we estimate the impacts of

increased unearned income on maternal outcomes including mental health, fertility, and healthcare

utilization by applying an algorithm linking mothers to the 2006-2010 cohort through

administrative case identification numbers and birth dates (Knox et al., 2019). Using this method,

we were able to identify 94% of mothers.




7
  In addition to the general purpose of controlling for socioeconomic health shocks common to each cohort,
including the birth year and birth month fixed effects is beneficial given the fluctuation in the cessation rate after
SSA's CDR (which presumably reflect administrative reasons) (Hemetter, Bailey, 2015).

                                                            6
We used information on residential address records to explore the effect of SSI on residential

mobility and neighborhood characteristics. We characterize mobility as the probability of moving

(zip codes had ever changed during the study period), number of moves (total number of changes

of zip codes), and logged distance moved in miles (great-circle distance between centroids of zip

code tabulation arears). We also explore whether children moved into or moved out of New York

City.

We match each child's residential address to the American Community Survey (ACS) five-year

estimates of neighborhood socioeconomic status to capture the changes in neighborhood

environment each child experienced. We use census tracts as a proxy for neighborhoods and utilize

the 2009 ACS five-year estimates (covering 2005-2009) to describe neighborhood characteristics

at birth and the 2017 ACS five-year estimates (covering 2013-2017) to measure the characteristics

of the neighborhood where children lived at age 8. We calculate net changes in poverty level, net

changes in educational attainment (the share of adults who graduated high school, and the share of

adults who earned bachelor's degree), and changes in median household income (expressed as

CPI-adjusted $2009).

We use Calonico et al.'s (2017) bandwidth selection method, which yields 250-300 gram as a

bandwidth and use a 300-gram bandwidth for our main specification to maximize sample size (we

also estimate the impacts of SSI on our main outcome measures with a 250-gram bandwidth as a

sensitivity check). We test manipulation of birthweight around the threshold by using Cattaneo et

al.'s (2015) manipulation test with local polynomial density estimation and find no evidence of

manipulation around the 1,200-gram cutoff (p=0.849).

Our main specifications report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates of the impacts of SSI. We also report

treatment on the treated (TOT) effect estimates by specifying a fuzzy regression discontinuity



                                                 7
design given that many SSI-eligible children below the threshold did not receive the benefits and

some children above the threshold did receive SSI benefits. We estimate TOT effects in a two-

stage least squares framework where SSI spells are regressed using the 1,200-gram threshold in

the first stage. Note that we primarily rely on SSI spells instead of a binary indicator (ever being

on SSI) to recover the impacts of additional benefit amounts.

As ITT estimates are a weighted average of local average effects of compliers and local average

effects of never takers, differences between ITT and local average treatment effect (LATE), if any,

may be worth further exploration. Following Abadie's (2003) kappa-weighted means theorem

                         = 1,  = 1-  = 0,  = 1
( [ |1 > 0 ] =                 = 1-  = 0
                                               ), we compute the relative probability that

each group (complier/always taker/never taker) has certain observable characteristics such as

gender, race/ethnicity, residency (New York City versus rest of the state), and neighborhood

socioeconomic level.



Results

Table 1 reports summary statistics of our study sample. The first column shows means for the

whole sample. The second and third columns report means for the sample whose birthweights fall

below the 1,200-gram cutoff (thus eligible for SSI) and fall above the birthweight cutoff. Our study

sample is 47% female, 34% non-Hispanic White, 22% non-Hispanic Black, 31% Hispanic, and

51% New York City residents. Our identification relies on the assumption that both observable

and unobservable factors related to outcome measures are continuous at the 1,200-gram cutoff. As

a first check, we test whether differences between the two groups are significant. There are few

statistically significant differences between the two groups, except for the share of female and

location of residency.


                                                 8
Consistent with our expectations, SSI enrollment is significantly higher among children born

below the threshold. By age 1, 59% of eligible children (below the cutoff) were enrolled in SSI,

compared to 17% of children above the threshold. Average SSI spells by age 1 are 5.1 months

below the cutoff and 1.2 months above the cutoff. Appendix Table 1 further explores the

differences in SSI enrollment by age 1 classified by demographics. Results indicate that SSI

enrollment, both on the intensive and extensive margins, is significantly higher below the 1,200-

gram cutoff across the all subgroups. Figure 1 plots local linear regression fitted values of

cumulative SSI enrollment by age 8 with a 300-gram bandwidth, quadratic function of the running

variable, and triangular kernel function. The figure shows that the association of birthweight with

SSI enrollment, both in terms of the probability of SSI enrollment and SSI spells, is negative and

linear in general, but discontinuous at the 1,200-gram cutoff for the child SSI benefit.

Appendix Table 2 presents first stage regressions of the indicator that birthweight is below 1,200

grams on the months on SSI during the indicated age intervals. Consistent with expectations, the

birthweight cutoff is significantly positively associated with SSI spells only in a child's early life.

Birthweight below the 1,200-gram cutoff increases SSI spells by around 2 months per year until

age three. However, the significance of the effect disappears later in life, indicating that CDR

resulted in many cessation cases below the cutoff. Results also show evidence that child SSI

enrollment increases in age above the cutoff, suggesting newly-diagnosed physical/mental

impairments among children born above the cutoff.

In Appendix Table 3, we further explore SSI enrollment trajectories between the two groups

through age eight. We find that children below the cutoff initially enrolled in SSI earlier in life,

particularly before their first birthdays. Among all children below the cutoff who ever enrolled in

SSI, 79.2% enrolled in SSI by age 1. By contrast, among those born above the cutoff, 53.7%



                                                  9
enrolled in SSI for the first time after age one. Among those enrolled in SSI and born below the

cutoff, only 30% of those children enrolled in SSI for the first time by age 1 remained on SSI

continuously until age eight. Lapse in SSI benefit among children below the threshold occurred

most frequently at around age 2-4, relative to children on SSI born above the cutoff. Our data do

not contain information on the reason for lapse in SSI benefit; however, the pattern we observe is

consistent with the findings of Hemmeter and Bailey (2015), who show that a majority of low

birthweight child SSI enrollees received their first CDR at age 1-4 and that SSA ended benefits in

33-48% of cases.

Table 2 presents estimated ITT effects of SSI (1 from equation (1)) on the cumulative prevalence

of common conditions. Crossing the 1,200-gram cutoff for SSI eligibility increases SSI spells by

102% between ages 0-3 and increases SSI spells by 24% between ages 3-6. Results show that the

incidence of malnutrition and urinary tract infection prior to age three are significantly lower below

the threshold.

We also find that crossing the eligibility cutoff decreases the incidence of developmental delay

and the receipt of special education by 10 percentage points between ages 3-6. Results for almost

all conditions are negative, though only a few reach statistical significance. In Appendix Table 4,

we present a full set of estimated health impact of SSI. We find evidence that SSI reduces the

incidence of fever of unknown origin, upper respiratory tract infection, digestive diseases, and

burns early in life.

Aggregate Medicaid expenditures, which capture utilization across the full range of conditions,

are significantly lower among those birthweight-eligible for SSI. Table 3 reports the ITT effects

of SSI on healthcare utilization. SSI reduces Medicaid costs by 27-36% through age eight. SSI

also decreases the probability of hospital utilization (excluding initial stays at birth) by 10.6



                                                 10
percentage points (14.7% of the mean) by age 3. Children eligible for SSI also spend fewer total

days in hospital, with length of stay 32.6% lower by age three. 8 Children eligible for SSI because

of low birthweight have a significantly lower probability of being hospitalized for urinary tract

diseases and injury. Specialist visits are also substantially lower among those born below the cutoff

(-40-63% of the mean). Coefficients on the probability of hospitalization for infection, nutritional

and metabolic diseases, digestive diseases, and diseases of the nervous and sensory organs are

negative, though statistically insignificant. These results suggest that SSI reduces the incidence of

severe medical conditions requiring costly services in early childhood.



Mechanisms

Our results indicate that SSI reduces the incidence of both acute (infection and injury) and chronic

(malnutrition and developmental delay) conditions in early life, and leads to substantial reductions

in Medicaid spending. To further investigate the mechanism through which SSI eligibility affects

the health of children, we first explore when a child was initially diagnosed with chronic conditions

and how these health shocks affect healthcare utilization later in the child's life.

Currie and Stabile (2003) hypothesize that financial resources may help children avoid adverse

health shocks and may help families deal with those health shocks that do occur. In Table 4, we

find that children born at birthweights above the cutoff were diagnosed with chronic conditions 9

1.7 months earlier, on average, than were children born below the cutoff. We also find that SSI

reduces the incidence of new chronic conditions (not diagnosed in the previous periods) through



8
  This estimated impact is unconditional on a stay. The impact on stays conditional on any hospitalization is quite
similar; SSI reduces length of stay by 14.986 days from birth to age 3 (32.6% of the mean) and reduces length of
stay by 16.482 days until age 8 (35.2% of the mean).
9
  These include 9 conditions shown in Appendix Table 4 with the chronic nature of medication and follow-ups;
malnutrition, anemia, obesity, vision defect, hearing defect, asthma, genitourinary tract diseases, and developmental
delay.

                                                         11
age three (the age at which the differential in SSI between birthweight and non-birthweight eligible

children is significant (Appendix Table 2)). A fuzzy regression discontinuity estimation (SSI spells

by age 3 are instrumented by an indicator for birthweight below the cutoff) in Appendix Table 5

provides similar results; an additional month on SSI delays the arrival of new chronic conditions

by 0.3 month and decreases the number of new chronic conditions by 2.4% of the mean.

Replicating the methods of Case et al. (2002) and Currie and Stabile (2003) in their descriptive

analyses, we also estimate a regression of current healthcare utilization on an interaction term

between the low birthweight threshold and a chronic condition indicator diagnosed in previous

period (Table 5). Results show that the presence of chronic conditions diagnosed by age 3

significantly increase healthcare utilization in future periods, suggesting that past negative health

shocks affect the subsequent health of children. 10 However, an interaction term between the SSI

eligibility and past health shocks is small and not significantly different from zero, indicating that

the effect of past health shocks on current utilization does not differ by increased household income.

Appendix Table 6 reports results from two-stage least squares regression of current healthcare

utilization on SSI spells by age 3 (instrumented by an indicator for the low birthweight eligibility)

and similarly shows that both additional months on SSI by age 3 and chronic conditions diagnosed

by age 3 are associated with current utilization, but that the interaction term is small and not

statistically significant. These results suggest that the increased income obtained through SSI does

not change how families respond to health shocks, but reduces the probability that a child is subject

to health shocks.




10
   The low birthweight eligibility for SSI also independently affects utilization measure, though coefficients become
less significant compared to our main specification in large part due to collinearity between the low birthweight
eligibility and an indicator for diagnosis of chronic condition (shown in Table 4).

                                                         12
We also run a fuzzy regression discontinuity estimation (instrument: indicator whether birthweight

is below 1,200 grams) of cumulative Medicaid costs in Appendix Table 7. We present first stage

and second stage regression coefficients, where the first stage coefficients are cumulative SSI

spells for indicated age intervals. Consistent with the results shown in Appendix Table 2, the

association of the low birthweight threshold with SSI take-up gradually decreases in age. TOT

effects of SSI on Medicaid costs are statistically significant until age 7, though the marginal effects

of SSI benefit significantly decrease as a child ages. This finding corroborates our identification

assumption that the Medicaid cost-saving effects of SSI we observe are primarily driven by

exogenous variation in exposure to social welfare benefits based on the low birthweight eligibility

criterion. Our findings imply that any lasting effects (especially beyond age 3) of SSI are generated

by cash benefits transferred in early life.

Table 6 presents ITT effects of SSI on the mobility of families of affected children. We find

evidence that SSI does not significantly affect the probability of moving, number of moves, or the

probability of moving into/out of New York City by age 8. However, children below the 1,200-

gram cutoff experienced significant improvements in neighborhood environments. The change in

census tract level median household income between birth and age 8 is about $8,500 (156% of the

mean) greater for children below the cutoff. Low birthweight SSI eligibility is also marginally

significantly associated with an increase in bachelor's degree completion rate at the census tract

level. These estimates suggest that neighborhood environment improves for children born below

the threshold because they are less likely to move out of better neighborhoods.

We present impacts of SSI on cumulative maternal health outcomes and fertility until children's

age 8 in Table 7. We find no evidence of impacts of child SSI receipt on mental health, fertility,




                                                  13
substance- and alcohol-related disorders. 11 Child's SSI eligibility is negatively associated with

mother's Medicaid costs, the probability of anxiety, pregnancy, and hospitalization utilization, but

none of these results are statistically significantly different from zero 12.

Table 8 reports distributional effects of SSI through age 8. Reductions in Medicaid costs occur

across the distribution of spending, at and above the median, with the greatest impacts at the top

of the Medicaid cost distribution. SSI is not significantly associated with changes in Medicaid

costs below the 25th percentile, but the estimated cost-saving impacts of SSI are 27.5% at the

median, 36.1% at the 75th percentile, and 53.7% at the 90th percentile. We also find similar

distributional effects for the number of hospitalization and specialist visits. In contrast, results

reveal that children eligible for SSI benefit experienced improved neighborhood environment

across the whole distribution with similar impact size.



Robustness

We present results from alternative specifications in Table 9. The second column shows estimation

results using a narrower birthweight bandwidth (250 grams). Although standard errors are bigger

due to a smaller sample size (N=1,122), results are qualitatively similar to our main specification.

In our main estimates, we restrict the study sample to those born at 32 weeks of gestation or earlier.

We compare ITT estimators of the impacts of SSI between the sample restricted to preterm birth

(N=1,348) and the sample without the preterm birth restriction (N=1,871) in the third column.

Estimated impacts from an analysis using the sample without the preterm birth restriction are

smaller than our main specification, indicating that measurement error leads to a bias toward zero.


11
   In an unreported analysis, we estimate the effect of having a sibling birthweight-eligible for SSI on Medicaid costs
of older siblings (N=594) by specifying a difference-in-differences approach. We find a null impact of increased
income on older sibling's logged annual Medicaid costs (coefficient=0.007, standard error=0.171).
12
   We also find that estimates from quantile regression of Medicaid costs or specialist visits are not significant.

                                                          14
To address the possibility of errors in calculating weight of newborns especially near the 1,200-

gram cutoff, we exclude those whose birthweights fall between 1,195 and 1,205 grams (fourth

column). The fifth column reports result from a non-parametric local linear regression with a

quadratic function of birthweight and triangular kernel function. In the last column, we report

results from a regression that excludes all utilization measures and diagnosis indicators before the

first three months of life. Month three is the median at which infants below the cutoff were initially

awarded SSI before age 1, so we expect that excluding all outcome measures that occurred before

this time should not change the estimated effect of SSI. Overall, across the columns, results are

qualitatively similar to our main specification.

In Appendix Table 8, we additionally test whether our sample restriction (continuous enrollment

by age 8) resulted in selective sampling bias at or around the 1,200-gram cutoff. We find that,

among all preterm babies (32 weeks of gestation or earlier) born in 2006-2010 whose birthweight

fall between 900 and 1,500 grams (N=3,690), the low birthweight cutoff is not meaningfully or

significantly related to the probability of continuous enrollment in Medicaid by age three, six, or

eight. In addition, a coefficient on an interaction between the cutoff and neighborhood median

income at birth is insignificant, indicating that neighborhood environment is not significantly

associated with the likelihood that children stay longer on Medicaid.

Appendix Table 9 reports main health outcomes by age 3 with study samples varying by different

continuous enrollment restrictions. Moving from the sample continuously enrolled in Medicaid for

3 years to the sample continuously enrolled for 8 years, coefficient estimates increase slightly, but,

in general, we find that all significant findings remain unchanged.

In Appendix Table 10, we regress initial hospital utilization measures on the low birthweight

threshold. Because most preterm and extremely low birthweight babies are initially admitted to



                                                   15
neonatal intensive care unit, we should find a null impact of increased household unearned income

on Medicaid costs for initial hospital stays at birth. Because preterm babies born at 32 weeks or

earlier are highly likely to develop respiratory distress due to a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant,

initial hospital costs are significantly higher for this population compared to full-term babies.

Average hospital costs and length of stay among our study population (preterm infants whose birth

weight(900, 1200)) are $105,815 (median=$87,831) and 56 days (median=50 days), consistent

with estimates from AHRQ (2013) and from Gilbert et al. (2003). 13 Our results indicate that the

1,200-gram cutoff does not meaningfully or significantly affect initial hospital stays and Medicaid

costs, lending support to our finding that the cost-saving effects of SSI do not appear until babies

go home.

Appendix Table 11 shows characteristics of complier, never taker, and always taker by applying

Abadie's (2003) theorem. Results show that compliers are more likely than the whole sample to

be living in higher-socioeconomic level neighborhood (the bottom poverty quartile and the top

median income quartile) at birth. This finding, together with the estimated impacts of SSI mobility,

provides evidence that eligible children experienced improved neighborhood environment mainly

because their families were less likely to move out of high-income neighborhoods than were

families whose infants were born above the threshold.



Discussion and Conclusions

Children in poor families are subject to more and to worse negative early-life shocks (Almond,

Currie, 2011). This study finds that crossing the 1,200-gram cutoff for SSI eligibility significantly


13
  Average hospital costs and length of stay among all newborns in the U.S. whose birthweights are less than 1,500
grams were $76,700 and 42.6 days in 2011 (AHRQ, 2013). In California, average hospital costs and length of stay
ranged from $52,000 to $92,700 and 36.5 days to 55.2 days among newborns whose birth weight[1000, 1500] in
1996 (Gilbert et al., 2003).

increases child SSI enrollment, improves the health of affected children (reduced incidence of

malnutrition, infection, injury/burn, and developmental delay), reduces Medicaid costs, and

improves neighborhood environments.

The protective health impacts of SSI on infection and malnutrition in early childhood we find are

closely in line with Jones et al. (2019), who report that additional income through refundable child

benefits in Canada increased household expenditures on non-durable goods such as food and child

care. In contrast to the findings of Guldi et al. (2018), our results show that the child health effects

of SSI last until at least age 6, despite the fact that the 1,200-gram cutoff is associated with SSI

only until age 3, meaning that the effects of SSI may continue past the point of enrollment. 14

We find that SSI reduces the probability that a child is subject to health shocks in early childhood.

In particular, we find evidence that the SSI-related gradients in healthcare utilization are not

explained by family's differential response to health shocks 15, but primarily driven by the fact that

SSI reduces the probability that children eligible for SSI experience such health shocks. These

findings indicate that SSI's income enhancement effect help affected children enter childhood with

fewer chronic conditions, consistent with previous American and Canadian studies (Case et al.,

2002; Currie, Stabile, 2003).

Our study provides a strong economic argument for SSI given the high Medicaid cost burden for

low birthweight, preterm infants. In our study, Medicaid spent $5.87 billion on the 2006-2010 birth

cohort (continuously enrolled in Medicaid for 8 years, N=185,022) by age 8; within this group,

Medicaid costs for the 0.7% of the cohort who were preterm infants whose birthweight fell between




14
   Observed average SSI spells, which seem longer than expectation of Guldi et al. (2018), may be attributed to lags
in administrative decision time. Desphande (2016) reported that over 20% of review cases need at least 1 year for
final decision. Also, Hemmeter and Bailey (2015) showed that a majority of children on SSI due to low birthweight
received their first CDR decision at age 1-3.
15
   This is especially unlikely given that our study population is all covered by Medicaid.

                                                         17
900 and 1,500 grams (N=1,348) totaled $233 million, that is 4% of the cohort's total Medicaid

spending. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the average monthly SSI benefit

(approximately $600) and the average impacts of the 1,200-gram cutoff on SSI spells by age 8

(10.4 months) indicates that the average SSI benefits provided to these children ($6,240) are far

lower than the reduction in Medicaid costs ($20,510) per beneficiary 16. Our results thus support a

growing body of evidence that health shocks that occur in early childhood, which may have long-

term negative impacts on health and human capital, 17 can be remediated by unconditional cash

transfers targeting vulnerable children (Almond, Currie, 2011). For example, Desphande (2016)

finds that children who stay longer on SSI earn significantly higher lifetime income than those

removed from SSI do.

Our results are limited by relatively small sample size, which might contribute to large standard

errors and imprecisely estimated coefficients on the impacts on other health outcome measures.

We are also limited in our ability to estimate the health impacts in the longer term beyond age 8.

Despite these limitations, our study, using a large cohort of low birthweight infants in New York

State, is one of the first to estimate the causal impacts of SSI on child health. We demonstrate that

SSI benefits are associated with better health outcomes and lower medical expenditures,

suggesting that relatively small cash transfers provided to vulnerable populations may be a cost-

effective solution to improving health outcomes and reducing health spending.




16
   We multiply the estimated impacts of SSI on Medicaid costs by age 8 (-29.7% on average) by the average
Medicaid costs incurred after initial hospital discharge of the control group ($69,057).
