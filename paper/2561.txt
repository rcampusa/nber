    In   a   labor market where workers seek rents, employers that offer a

supra—competitive wage would face a long queue of qualified workers,
The presence of this job queue would encourage employers to reduce their

wage to the market-clearing level.     Interference in the wage setting

process from government regulation (e.g. an enforced minimum wage law)
or from union bargaining power could prevent the forces of labor market

competition from lowering wages to eliminate excessive job queues.        In

addition, efficiency wage, expense—preference, and insider—outsider
models suggest that some firms or managers may find it in their

interests to maintain above market—clearing wages.1     In this paper we
test for the presence of above market—clearing total compensation

packages by examining whether firms that pay the minimum wage or that
are in high—wage industries face an excessive supply of labor as

measured by their number of job applicants.2

     A government—enforced minimum wage law provides a natural

experiment to examine the relationship between wage premia and job

     'The efficiency wage literature is surveyed by Stiglitz (1986) and
Katz (1986). Insider-outsider models are surveyed by Lindbeck and
Snower (1986).  Jensen and Meckling (1976) discuss managerial agency
models.

     2The approach of examining relative application rates to determine
whether earnings differentials among jobs are non—market clearing has a
venerable tradition in labor economics. In their classic study of the
relative wages of doctors and dentists, Friedman and Kuznets (1945) rely
heavily on a comparative analysis of application rates to medical and
dental schools. Given that the preliminary training required for the
two professions is virtually identical, Friedman and Kuznets (p. 124)
conclude that their finding that "more than four times as many persons
applied annually for admission to American medical schools as for
admission to American dental schools" is sufficient alone to establish
that "at existing levels of remuneration, prospective practitioners
consider medicine more attractive than dentistry.' And H.G. Lewis
(1963) uses a similar approach to examine the importance of entry
barriers into the medical profession as well as the relative earnings of
doctors and dentists.
queues.   Unless firms find it profitable to extract all rents from

workers that are generated by a binding minimum wage by cutting fringe

benefits, raising effort requirements, upgrading hiring standards, or

letting working conditions deteriorate, positions in which firms are
constrained to increase wages to meet the legal minimum wage will confer

rents to workers.   A   finding that jobs that offer the minimum wage tend
to face an excessive queue of job applicants would support the joint

hypothesis that firms do not extract all rents generated by the minimum

wage, and that there is a labor supply response to the presence of these
rents.

     Our second application pertains to the inter-industry wage

structure.   Much research has documented the existence of large and

persistent inter-industry wage differentials for similar workers.3     In a

textbook competitive labor market model, persistent wage differentials

for observationa].lyequivalent workers must reflect either compensating
differentials for nonwage job attributes or unmeasured differences in

worker productive abilities.     Under this market—clearing scenario, one

does not necessarily expect any systematic relationship between wages

and the job application rate.4
     On the other hand, labor market segmentation models (e.g.

efficiency wage, rent sharing and insider—outsider models) provide an
alternative explanation for inter—industry wage differentials in which


     3For recent evidence see Dickens and Katz (l987a,b) and Krueger and
Summers (1987, 1988)

     4unqualified workers may apply for high wage jobs and give the
misleading appearance of a job queue even in a market—clearing
situation. We return to this issue below,
                                       3

workers in high—wage industries earn rents relative to their opportunity

cost.     Thus, these models predict that firms in high-wage industries
should attract longer queues of job applicants than firms in low—wage

industries.     Demonstrations of a comparatively lower quit rate in high—

wage industries by Pencavel (1970) and others provide some evidence of
the presence of rents in high—wage industries, although this

relationship may also be attributable to specific human capital and
omitted worker quality variables.     While quit rate differentials provide
evidence on the location of ex—oost rents, the relationship between the

number of job applicants per opening and wage differentials provides a

more direct test of the presence of ex—ante rents in high—wage jobs.

        The prediction of segmented labor market models of the presence of

equilibrium ex—ante rents in some jobs has been severely criticized on
theoretical grounds.    The basic idea behind this critique is that if

there are queues for jobs because they pay ex—ante rents, workers will
be willing to pay to obtain these jobs (Carmichael, 1985). Murphy and

Topel (1987) argue that even if explicit job purchases are ruled out,
firms may have alternative mechanisms to extract the ex—ante rents that

arise from wage premia paid for efficiency wage reasons.5    These

arguments essentially deny the possibility of rents in almost any
situation.    In particular, this line of reasoning has been applied to

the case of a government—imposed minimum wage.    Wessels (1980a,b),
Mincer (1984) and others contend that firms constrained to pay the legal

minimum wage have an incentive to reduce fringe benefits and erode


     5The fairness efficiency wage model (Akerlof and Yellen, 1987) and
models based on the bargaining power of insiders are less susceptible to
this bonding critique.
working conditions until all rents are completely dissipated.     On the

other hand, firms may choose not to extract all surplus from workers

because such actions may reduce morale and productivity, or because

employers may be utilitarian and the cost to workers of changing nonwage

compensation may greatly outweigh the reduction in costs to employers.
       In the next section, we discuss the factors likely to determine

whether firms constrained to pay the minimum wage will fully dissipate

rents, and discuss theoretical issues concerning the relationship
between job application rates and wages.    We then examine whether firms

that are constrained to pay the minimum wage attract excessive queues of

job seekers as measured by the number of job applications they receive

per opening.     The micro—level employer—reported data on job applicants,

firm characteristics, and wages that we utilize is described in section

two.    Our empirical results concerning the minimum wage are presented in

section three.     The main finding is that firms that pay the minimum wage
receive substantially more applicants for their job openings than firms

that pay either more or less than the minimum wage.     This finding makes

plausible the idea that above market—clearing wage premiums can persist
in the labor market.

       In section 4 we examine whether jobs in high—wage industries

attract more applicants than similar jobs in low-wage industries.

Although the evidence on the relationship between job queues and

inter—industry wage differentials is somewhat inconclusive, the results

suggest that firms in high—wage industries attract a larger number of

job applicants than other firms.     In addition, the empirical work shows

that the size of an establishment has a large, positive effect on then
                                       5
number of applicants for a given job opening that cannot be explained by
the higher starting wages paid by larger establishments.



1.   Theoretical Considerations
A.   Minimum Wages. Job Queues, and Rent DissiDation

        In the standard textbook analysis of an above market—level minimum

wage,    employers constrained to pay the minimum wage are assumed to not
offset the minimum wage by reducing other forms of compensation

(Stigler, 1946).    Workers remaining in minimum wage jobs are made
better—off since their total compensation rises by the mandated increase

in wages.    The minimum wage reduces the number of jobs in the covered

sector by increasing the relative cost of labor and creates rents for

workers employed in minimum wage jobs.     The model yields ambiguous
predictions concerning the impact of the minimum wage on the welfare of
workers in the uncovered sector and the workers displaced from the
covered sector (Mincer, 1976). However, the standard model

unambiguously predicts that jobs that are constrained to pay the minimum

wage should attract a relatively large queue of job applicants.
     Wessels (l980a,b), Hashimoto (1981),    and Mincer (1984) have

analyzed an extended model of the minimum wage in Which firms attempt to
offset mandated wage increases by altering other unregulated
                                                             aspects of
the compensation package. Firms can lower labor costs
                                                       by reducing
expenditures on fringe benefits, reducing on—the—job training, and

worsening working conditions,     Firms will continue to attract employees
until total compensation is lowered to a market—clearing level.       The
presence of the minimum wage leads covered firms to provide an
                                     6

inefficient compensation package,   This reduces labor demand at the

total compensation level prevailing before the minimum wage was imposed.

If the labor supply schedule to the low-wage sector of the labor market

is upward sloping, a minimum wage can actually reduce the total

compensation in both covered and uncovered jobs.6

      Thus, if firms can completely dissipate the rents generated by a
minimum wage law, all workers —— including those holding minimum wage

jobs —— can be made worse—off by the minimum wage, and in this situation
minimum wage jobs would not face excessive queues of job applicants.
                                                    rents then the
If, on the other hand, firms do not fully dissipate

welfare of those obtaining minimum wage jobs is improved, and jobs that

offer the minimum wage should receive a relatively large number of job

applicants.
     Wessels (l980b) suggests three reasons why firms may not choose to,

or may not be able to, fully offset the increase in workers' total
                                                                    the
compensation generated by the imposition of a minimum wage. First,
fixed costs of adjusting the compensation package may outweigh the

potential cost savings.   This is likely to be the case if the minimum

wage is set in nominal terms and is expected to be rapidly eroded away

by inflation.   Second, the amount of adjustments possible on unregulated
                                                   offset the minimum
aspects of compensation may not be large enough to

wage (e.g. fringe benefits are only a small part of the compensation
package in low-wage jobs).   Third, nonwage conditions of work (e.g.


     6We note that as a practical matter it is unlikely that those who
hold minimum wage jobs are made much worse-off as a result of the
minimum wage because available econometric evidence surveyed in Brown,
Gilroy and Kohen (1983) suggests that the relevant demand schedule is
very inelastic.

heating and work pace) may be public goods affecting workers above the
minimum wage as well as minimum wage workers, or legal requirements such
as pension regulations and equal rights laws may require that all

workers are treated equally and thus essentially turn some private goods

into public goods.

       There are two further reasons why   firms   may not reduce nonwage
expenditures to fully eliminate the increased rents for covered

employees created by a binding minimum wage.        The first is related to

efficiency wage models of the labor market and depends on the additional
assumption of decreasing marginal utility of wages and fringe benefits.7

According to efficiency wage models, worker productivity is      a   positive
function of compensation.    This relationship is posited because higher

compensation may reduce turnover and absenteeism, increase effort, or
make it easier to recruit workers.    To see that a firm will not totally
offset the wage increase brought about by a minimum wage if productivity

depends on worker pay, suppose that an "efficiency wage" employer were
to fully offset the minimum wage by cutting fringe benefits to the point

where the worker's compensation equals the pre—minimum wage level. In
this situation, the compensation mix is not optimal and a dollar spent

on fringe benefits has more than a dollar's value to employees.        If the
firm increases fringe benefits above this level, the increase in net

worker productivity will more than pay for the additional cost of fringe

benefits.    When faced with a positive wage—productivity schedule, a firm

is   no longer a wage—taker —— the firm's effective labor supply is an



     71n a similar vein, Wessels (l980b) notes that turnover costs may
induce firms to only partially offset a minimum wage increase.

upward sloping function of its wage and fringe benefits, and
inhibit the firm's desire to fully offset the minimum wage. A similar

argument could be made if the firm has monopsony power over
      The final reason why firms might not fully offset a minimum wage

increase is related to agency problems which give firms non—profit

maximizing preferences.   According to this argument, because managers

are not perfectly monitored by shareholders, firms will maximize

objective functions that depend positively on their employees' utility
                                                                offset a
as well as profits. In this situation, a firm will not totally
                                                    to do so may exact a
wage increase generated by the minimum wage because
                                                      a small amount for
great toll from workers while only raising profits by
the firm. To take an extreme example, if after eliminating fringe

benefits workers who earn the minimum wage still receive some surplus,

it seems unlikely that managers will require workers to perform arduous

tasks if such activities only generate a trivial amount of additional

profit for the firm.
     There is limited evidence that firms adjust some nonwage aspects of

their compensation package in response to binding increases in the

minimum wage. Wessels (1980a,b) reports the results of a survey of

offsets made by retail stores in response to the New York state minimum

wage law of 1957.  Only a small minority of the stores reported
reductions in fringe benefits although many reduced the hours of work of

minimum wage workers. Alpert (1986) finds no evidence of more than
                                          in response to large increases
quite minor reductions in fringe benefits
in the minimum wage in the restaurant industry in the 1970's. Lastly,

 Leighton and Mincer (1981) provide some evidence of reduced job training
                                       9
and lower wage growth in response to increased minimum wages for workers

with less than high school education.

     The number of job applicants for minimum wage jobs relative to the

number of applicants for other jobs provides a direct test of the

standard model of the minimum wage which assumes incomplete nonwage

offsets versus the full offset model.      The failure of firms to

completely of fset the compensation increase created by a minimum wage

clearly leads to the prediction of greater numbers of applicants to
firms paying the minimum wage than to uncovered or noncomplying firms

paying wages below the minimum wage.

     Additionally, a spike in applications at minimum wage jobs relative
to      jobs that pay more than the minimum wage and jobs that pay less
than the minimum wage would provide even stronger evidence that rents

created by the minimum wage are not totally dissipated.     First, jobs
paying more than the minimum wage may have different entry requirements
than jobs paying the minimum wage or less. The job application rate may

vary with skill levels.   A   finding of a discontinuous jump in
applications at the minimum wage will suggest that the minimum wage is
not just picking up the general application-wage profile.     Second, and
perhaps more important, jobs that pay more than the minimum wage may be

equally desirable as jobs that pay the minimum wage or less, but may
offer a higher wage to compensate workers for some disamenable working

condition.   In this equalizing differences eguilibrium, a binding
minimum wage will increase the desirability of minimum wage jobs

relative to jobs that pay more than the minimum wage, and thus generate

a spike in applications at the minimum wage.     This latter argument is
                                    10

more plausible for jobs that are only slightly above the minimum wage.

B,   Job Application Rates and Wages with Homogeneous Workers

      We first consider a labor market with identical workers and with

firms that differ in their valuations of the benefits of filling a

vacant job.8   Finns attract applicants by announcing the existence of

the job opening and advertising its offered wage. Job seekers
                                                                   Each job
costlessly obtain all relevant infonnation about job openings.
seeker is assumed to be able to apply to only a single firs.     If the job

seeker is the only applicant for the opening, he or she is hired and
                                                               the job,
paid the advertised wage. If more than one person applies for
the firs randomly selects from the applicant pool. If a worker is

unlucky and not selected for a job he is assumed to consume leisure

and/or work in home production, which provides a lower level of utility
than the forgone job.

     The net expected benefit of applying to any job opening must be
                                                                 be
equalized across openings in equilibrium. Job seekers will then
indifferent between applying for low wage positions Which have a high

probability of acceptance, and applying for high wage positions which
have a low probability of acceptance.    Workers pick higher probabilities

of applying to high wage jobs in equilibrium,9    Finns choose wages

of the relationship between wages and job queues. See Lang (1987) and
Weitzman (1987) for related models.
                                                                       The

opening is constant across openings even when not

openings. If workers cannot apply to all openings, high wage jobs in
receive more applicants than low wage jobs. Lang (1987) analyzes
detail the issues that arise when workers can simultaneously apply to
                                      11

knowing that job seekers respond in this manner.         Thus, firms with high
valuations of filling a job will offer high wages in order to attract a

larger expected number of applicants.       A   direct result of the

equilibrium condition in this model is that the expected number of

applicants for an opening will be positively related to the offered

wage.
C.   Heteroaeneous Labor with Nonrandom Selection

         If individuals differ in their productive capacities, and if

employers make job offers to applicants on the basis of their

perceptions of workers' abilities, the analysis becomes more

complicated.     Our purpose here is only to present a heuristic discussion

of these effects.

        It is probably reasonable to assume that individuals have a noisy

estimate of their ability relative to the labor force, and that

prospective employers have an imperfect but positively correlated
measure of each applicant's ability.       A final assumption is that there
is a positive correlation between the applicant's reservations wage and

ability.
        An increase in total compensation in this situation potentially
has three distinct effects on the application rate.        First, a job
candidate's expectation of being rated the most highly qualified

applicant and therefore of being selected for the job is diminished.
This occurs because individuals with higher reservation wages and

therefore greater expected ability will apply for the job (Weiss, 1980;

Nalebuff and Stiglitz, 1982).    The average quality of the job queue

more than one firm and receive more than one offer.
                                      12

increases.    In the extreme case, if employees know with certainty who

the most qualified applicant for the job will be, only that individual

will apply for the job.

      The second effect occurs because an increase in a job's wage,

holding all else constant, makes it   a    more attractive alternative than

other jobs and is therefore worth applying for even though the chance of

ultimately being selected is reduced.       This is the result that is

discussed in the model above in the case of homogeneous labor.

      Finally, some workers may find it in their best interest to apply
for high—wage jobs for which they lack the required training and skills

to perform the job adequately.    Since employers only have an inaccurate

measure of job seekers' abilities, there is a nonzero probability that

unqualified workers will succeed in being selected for high-wage jobs.
As a result, high wages may attract relatively many unqualified

applicants.  If this is quantitatively and important effect, it will be

impossible to distinguish between the segmented labor market

interpretation and the human capital interpretation of inter-industry

wage differentials on the basis of inter-industry differences in

application rates without further knowledge of the abilities of job

applicants.


2.   Data

       The data we use are from an evaluation survey of the Employment

Opportunity Pilot Project (EOPP) sponsored by the National Institute of
Education and the National Center for Research in Vocational Education.

Although the survey is longitudinal, we focus on the 1982 follow-up
                                          13

cross—section because it contains specific information on the

demographic characteristics and starting salary of the selected job

applicant, as well as information on the vacant position.             A   total of

3,400 firms were surveyed.        The surveyed firms are located in 28

geographic sites, with a disproportionate number          of   sites concentrated

in southern and midwestern states.        Twelve of the sites are SNSA's.

Employers were contacted by phone between February and June of 1982, and
the person who "handles the hiring activity" for the company for the
area contained within the geographic site was asked to directly answer

the questionnaire.       The survey deliberately over—sampled low—wage firms.
        The survey contains information on the recent hiring activities of

firms,     specifically, the person responsible for hiring was asked
several questions concerning the last position filled by a "new

employee" prior to August 1981,       including the number of applicants for
the position, the Occupational category of the position, the starting

salary, and the new worker's demographic characteristics (age, sex,

training, work experience and education))'0           The designers of the survey
intended that the question concerning the number of persons who applied

for the last position filled should measure the number of individuals

formally applying for the position.11          A   formal application typically
would require     a   worker to submit a written application form;        casual

        1'0Three—quarters   of the firms in the survey hired their most recent
employee    in   1981;
                  15% hired       their
                                  most recent employee           in
                                                          1980; 7% hired
their most recent employee in 1979; and 3% hired their most recent
employee in 1978. The survey also contains a small number of firms
whose most recent outside hire was prior to 1978, but these observations
are dropped from the sample because the accuracy of the retrospective
information is likely to become less accurate with time.

inquiries over the phone or personal visits that do not involve a
written application were not intended to be counted as job

applications.12      In situations where multiple employees are hired for

the last position filled, we divide the number of applicants by the

number of workers hired.

          In addition to questions on recruitment and employee

characteristics, the survey contains information on several aspects of
the employer, including firm and establishment size, industry,

proportion of workers covered by a union contract, and geographic
location.      Unfortunately, the establishment size variables is defined in
a nonstandard way.      Instead of asking for the size of an individual

establishment, the establishment size question solicits the combined
size (number of employees) of all the establishments of a particular

firm that are located within the geographic site,      As a result,

establishment size in this data set is a conglomeration of typically
defined establishment size and firm size measures.

Aeplication Rates and Unemoloyment

          In order to crudely gauge the validity of the application variable

as   a   measure of labor market conditions, we regress the average

application rate in a city on the local unemployment rate for a sample
of 28 cities,      Results of estimating this regression (with standard

errors in parentheses) are presented below.




     12Thjs interpretation of the application measure seems especially
plausible since earlier in the survey respondents were asked questions
that treated phone inquiries from people seeking work, visits to the
company of individuals seeking work, written job applications, and
formal job interviews as distinct categories.
                                       15

(1)      in (Applications per   =   3.954 + .710   ln(UR)     R2=.15
             Last opening)          (.850)   (.329)

        The relationship between the site level job application rate and

the unemployment rate is positive and statistically significant.'3

While we do not put a structural interpretation on this equation, it

suggests that the application rate is correlated with the
characteristics of the local labor market.         As the fraction of the labor

force that is unemployed increases, more applications are received by

firms in the area.     Later we compare this estimate of the responsiveness

of the application rate with respect to a change in the unemployment

rate to the responsiveness of the application rate with respect to a

change in the wage rate.


3.    Emtirical Evidence on Queues for Minimum Wage Jobs

       A   legally enforced and binding minimum wage provides a clear

opportunity to examine the relationship between job applications and
wage premia.     Under a wide variety of assumptions, economic models

predict that imposing an above market-level minimum wage will result in
an excess supply of labor to those firms.       Unless firms can extract all
rents by cutting fringe benefits or making work more burdensome, firms

that are constrained by the minimum wage should receive more job

applications than firms that are in labor markets where the minimum wage


     :L)since other characteristics of firms and the labor force might
affect the relationship between applications and unemployment, we also
estimate equations that include average firm size and a dummy variable
for being in an SMSA. The results are not significantly changed by
including these variables.
                                    16

is not constraining.   The existence of a queue for minimum   wage   jobs

would support a conclusion that employers do         fully offset the

effects of a minimum wage by altering some other form of compensation or

working conditions.
     Table 1 reports means and standard deviations for several

variables disaggregated by whether the starting wage for the job was
less than, equal to, or greater than the legal minimum wage that was in

effect in the year the position was filled)4       Fortunately, the survey

provides a disproportionally large sample of low—wage jobs —— 197 (14%)

job openings in the sample paid newly hired workers the prevailing legal
minimum wage, and 65 (5%) job openings paid   a   starting wage below the

prevailing legal minimum wage.   Jobs that pay less than the minimum wage

are either not covered by the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor

Standards Act (FLSA) or are in violation of the Act,      Congress raised
the minimum wage six times in the 1970's.   The 1977 amendments to the

FLSA scheduled increases in the minimum wage for each year from 1978 to

1981,15   As a result, in years covered by our sample (1978-1981),

increases in the minimum wage were expected and scheduled in advance,

which should have facilitated any possible nonwage offsets by employers.

      Looking at Table 1, workers who are hired into minimum wage jobs
are on average less educated, younger, less experienced and more likely


     14We have eliminated from the sample 40 restaurant jobs that offer
a subminimum wage because workers in these jobs are likely to receive
unreported tips, and as a consequence the hourly wage will not
adequately reflect the total compensation of these workers.

     15The minimum wage rate was $2.65 in 1978, $2.90 in 1979, $3.10 in
1980 and $3.35 in 1981. Increases in the minimum wage over this time
period roughly kept pace with inflation.

to be female than workers who are hired into jobs that pay more than the
minimum wage; while workers whose starting wage is less than the minimum

wage have similar personal characteristics and training to workers whose
starting wage equals the minimum wage.     In addition, as others have

found using different data sets, this sample shows that jobs that pay
either the minimum wage or a subniinimum wage are more likely to offer

part-time work compared to jobs that pay more than the minimum wage.
These summary statistics suggest that workers whose starting wage is
less than the minimum wage may be fairly close substitutes for workers

whose starting wage exactly equals the minimum wage, but workers who
earn more than the minimum wage have different skills and qualifications

than workers who earn the minimum wage or less.

      Most importantly for our purposes,   the table indicates that the

number of applicants per job opening is greater for positions that pay

exactly the minimum wage to start than for positions that initially pay
either more or less than the legal minimum wage. The pairwise

comparisons of the difference in the mean log application rate between
the subsample of workers whose starting wage rate equals the minimum

wage and each of the other two groups are both statistically significant
at the 10% level.   These differences in application rates are not driven

largely by a few outliers.   The median number of applicants per job

opening for jobs that paid exactly the minimum wage was 5 as compared to
4 both for jobs that paid less than the minimum wage and for jobs that

paid more than the minimum wage.
     In addition, we find that an apparent "spike" in application rates

at the minimum wage exists when we limit our sample to the narrow band
                                      18
of jobs that pay within 25 cents of the minimum wage.         On average, 10.02

applicants applied per job opening that paid within 25 cents less than
the minimum wage; 11.40 applicants applied per job opening that paid

exactly the minimum wage; and 10.92 applicants applied per job opening
that paid within 25 cents more than the minimum wage)6 These findings

suggest that there is a discrete jump      in   applications at the minimum
wage.
        If a job offers an above market-clearing wage and therefore

attracts a queue of qualified applicants, the duration of time required
to fill a vacancy for this job will be short relative to other jobs that

do not offer an above market—clearing wage rate.        It follows that a

complementary test of the existence of rents in minimum wage jobs would
be that vacancies in jobs that offer the minimum wage will require less

time to fill than vacancies in other jobs, all else equal.

Unfortunately, the EOPP survey only allows us to address this issue

indirectly.    The survey asks a question on the length of time elapsed
"between [when the employer) started looking for someone to fill the

opening and the time the new employee started work."        However, one
serious shortcoming of this question is that the length of time between
when a new employee is hired and he or she actually begins work may

increase with the skill requirements of the position (i.e. the academic

job market ends in February or March but new assistant professors do not

officially begin work until September). As a result, this question may

     16The findings are similar when the sample includes all jobs that
pay within 50 cents of the minimum wage. On average, 10.25 applicants
applied per job opening that paid within 50 cents less than the minimum
wage and 9.47 applicants applied per job opening that paid within 50
cents more than the minimum wage.
                                     19

not adequately represent the duration of employer search time necessary

to recruit a new employee for a vacancy.
      In the EOPP sample the average time elapsed between the initiation

of a job search and the actual date an employee begins work is shorter

among jobs that pay the minimum wage than among jobs that pay more than
the minimum wage, but is shorter still in jobs where the starting wage

is less than the minimum wage (see Table 1).    This pattern suggests that

responses to this particular vacancy duration question may reflect the

lag between the date a job offer is accepted and the date the new
employee eventually assumes his job instead of the comparative

difficulty of filling a job vacancy.
      In Table 2 we estimate OLS regressions to examine whether the

"spike in applications for    minimuii wage jobs holds-up after controlling

for a variety of alternative sets of independent variables.    The

dependent variable in the regressions is the natural log of the number
of applicants for the last position filled by an outside hire.    We

include a dummy variable that equals one if the job pays the minimum

wage and zero otherwise, and another dummy variable that equals one if
the job pays a subminimum wage and zero otherwise,    The reported

coefficients should be interpreted as the proportionate excess supply of

job applicants relative to firms that pay more than the minimum wage.
Because workers who earn substantially more than the minimum wage may

very well be in different labor markets than workers who earn the
minimum wage or less, we eliminate from the sample workers whose wage

rate exceeds $5.00 an hour.    However, we note that our results are

qualitatively unchanged when we examine the full sample, and we report

minimum wage and jobs that pay more than the minimum wage, while jobs
that are above or below the minimum wage do not have a statistically

significant difference in applications.   According to the point
estimates, jobs offering the minimum wage attract between 22.5% and 26%
more applications than jobs that offer a starting wage that exceeds the
minimum wage, and between 20% and 10% more applications than jobs that

pay starting wages that are less than the minimum wage.     The application
differentials fall when employer size variables are added to the

regression,   but are not very much influenced by the other independent

variables such as industry affiliation or union coverage.    Employer size
has an important effect on these results because workers who earn a
subminimum wage tend to work in relatively small establishments, and

results discussed more fully below show that the application rate is
lower in small firms, all else equal.

       These results take on added significance since it is unlikely that
workers who apply for jobs for which they are unqualified in the hope of

deceiving their employer will apply for minimum wage jobs.    Such
beguiling behavior will have a higher payoff in jobs that pay more than
the minimum wage. Moreover, the finding that more workers apply for


     17We also note that the spike in the application rate for minimum
wage jobs becomes larger and more statistically significant when we
narrow the sample to the group of workers who are age twenty—one or
younger.

minimum wage jobs than for jobs paying a greater wage than the minimum

wage suggests that the excess supply of applicants for minimum wage jobs
relative to jobs below the minimum wage does not merely reflect an

upward sloping applicant—wage relationship.
       This spike in applications for firms paying the minimum wage

strongly suggests that workers queue for minimum wage jobs, which in
turn implies that employers do not fully offset the effects of the
minimum wage by reducing fringe benefits or eroding working conditions.

Since employers constrained to pay the minimum wage may be able to cut
back on direct recruiting activities (e.g. advertising job openings)    and

still attract applicants, our estimate of the minimum wage application
differential may even understate the effect of the rents generated by

the minimum wage on application rates.


4.   The Inter-Industry Wage Structure and Job Aoplications

       This section examines the relationship between two—digit industry
affiliation and application rates.   It is well known that industry

status exerts a powerful influence on workers' wages, and that the

industry wage structure is extremely stable over time,   However, the

interpretation of these facts is not clear.   If inter—industry wage

differentials are equalizing differentials for nonwage aspects of work,

then we would not expect to find a systematic relationship between

application rates and wages at the industry level.   On the other hand,

if differences in wages across industries are rents to workers there
should be a positive relationship between inter-industry application

rates and wages.
                                                  22

        To test whether jobs in high—wage industries offer wages above

market—clearing rates, we assume that when occupation, education,

geographic location, and other variables are held constant,                   a firm's

industry does not directly influence the number of applications the firm
receives     for its available job openings;           instead, industry operates

indirectly on applications through its effect on wages.                    Under this

exclusion restriction, a test of the market—clearing hypothesis boils

down to whether using industry dummy variables as instnments for the

wage rate in an application equation gives a positive estimate of the

wage-application relationship. Moreover, the industry exclusion
restriction ia testable because there are many industry dummies to
estimate only one parameter.

        To fix ideas, consider the following structural model of the log
of job applications per opening, A, and the log of the starting wage

rate, W:

(2)          AWSW+Xax+LA
(3)          W=APA+ZflE+X$x+cW
where            is the elasticity of job applicants with respect to the wage

rate, Z is an        N x   K   matrix of K mutually exclusive industry dummy

variables,       W is a    K x 1    vector of industry wage differentials, and X
is an    N  q matrix
             x                 of control variables that includes a constant.18

The   c, ic{A,W}, are           N x 1   vectors of i.i.d. errors.         There are N
observations. We assume that 8 is a valid instrument for W, so                     that

plim Z'W s 0         and plim Z'LA      =   0.   Equation   (2)   is over-identified

     18There are a total of K + 1 mutually exclusive and exhaustive
industry dummies, but because the equations include constant tens, only
K industry dummies are included in 8.
                                    23

because there are more than one industry dummy    that may   be used as

instruments for W.
      A simultaneous system is posited because in a standard demand and

supply framework the wage rate offered affects the number of applicants
received, while the number of applicants simultaneously affects the
offered wage.   Even if the starting wage is predetermined and

unresponsive to the number of job applicants, another reason for

instrumenting for the wage rate in the application equation is that
unobserved, omitted variables in the application equation will affect
the starting wage rate, which will lead to spurious correlation between

W and £A   For example, a university bookstore may attract more

applicants at any given wage than a remote bookstore and may therefore
choose a low wage policy. A positive estimate of     is consistent with

the view that inter—industry wage differentials represent ex—ante rents
to workers.

Results
      Results of estimating equation   (2)   by two-stage least squares are

reported in Table 3.   The table reports estimates of three different

specifications using alternate sets of included regressors (the X
matrix). Each specification uses 34 industry dummy variables as
instruments for the wage rate.   The results indicate that the job

application rate tends to increase with the starting wage rate, however,
this relationship becomes statistically insignificant once employer size

and union coverage are held constant. The point estimates of the

elasticity of applications with respect to wages range from .27 to .51.

the estimate of the application-unemployment relationship reported

earlier in equation (1), a 10% increase in the starting wage rate has
about as much of an enhancing effect on the application rate as a half

of a percentage point increase in the unemployment rate.
      The specification tests reported in the bottom of Table    3   test the
assumption of the orthogonality of the industry dummies and the error
term in the application equation, and also summarize results of Hausman

tests of simultaneity between the starting wage and application rate.
The Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) error-orthogonality test

involves regressing the two—stage least squares residuals on the

industry dummy variables and included regressors; N times the         from
this regression asymptotically follows a chi-squared distribution (see

Newey, 1985).   A   weak relationship between the residuals and instruments
would indicate that the equation is properly specified. The reported

chi-squared test of the null hypothesis that industry is properly
excluded from equation (2) accepts at the .01 level and rejects at the
.05 level for each of the specifications in Table 3.  Given the large
sample size, however, the industry exclusion assumption may not be too
bad an approximation.19

      In addition, the Hausman tests for endogeneity of the wage in the

application equation (Which are based on the assumption that industry
dummy variables are valid instruments for the wage) are suggestive of a
simultaneous relationship between applications and starting wages. We

note, however, that even though the probability values for the Hausman


     19The exclusion restriction would not be rejected using the
Schwartz criterion ((K-i) x ln(N) = 233), which allows the probability
of making a type I error to shrink as the sample size grows.
                                       25
tests are greater than .10, there is a qualitative difference in the

estimated application-wage elasticity when equation         (2)   is estimated by
OLS and when it is estimated by two—stage least squares using industry

dummy variables to identify the wage.       For instance,   the OLS estimate of
the application—wage elasticity and standard error using the control
variables in column   (2)   is .03 (.11).
      To look more deeply into the relationship between the inter—

industry wage structure and applications, Figure 1 presents a plot of
industry application differentials against industry wage differentials
with the OLS line drawn through the points.20       Each set of differentials

is obtained from a reduced form regression of applications or wages on

industry dummy variables and the included variables used in column          (3)

of Table 3 (i.e. including employer size, union coverage, and other X—

variables).21   Extreme points are identified in the plot.
      The plot reveals a linear relationship between application
differentials and wage differentials. Some high—wage industries such as

public utilities and petroleum have extremely high application rates,
while low—wage industries such as apparel have relatively low

application rates.    While too much should not be made about individual

points in the plot because of sampling error in estimating the wage and
application differentials, it is interesting that the mining industry

     20The OLS regression through these points can be shown to give a
consistent estimate of the elasticity of applicants with respect to
wages. This estimator, which we denote visual instrumental variables,
is an instrumental variables estimator although it differs from 2SLS.

     21The omitted industry in each of these regressions is given a
value of zero.

lies far below the fitted line.    In spite of the high wages paid to

miners, relatively few applicants apply for each job opening in the

mining industry.    This finding is consistent with the obvious

interpretation that a significant element of the high average wage in
the mining industry is a compensating differential for disagreeable

work.

        Turning next to the other variables in the application equation,
it is interesting to note that personal characteristics such as age,
education and sex have an insignificant effect on the application rate.

Jobs with more formal and informal on—the-job training,   however, tend to
receive more applicants than other jobs, and there is substantial

dispersion in job application rates across occupations.
        The size of an employer has a tremendous effect on the application
rate.    The number of applications per job opening rises sharply with
establishment and firm size, all else equal.22    In addition,    controlling
for employer size greatly reduces the effect of wages and union coverage

on the application rate.   Moreover, a GMM specification test that adds

employer size variables to the list of excluded variables   (Z)    fails,
which suggests that employer size enters directly into the application

equation rather than indirectly through its effect on wages.
        There are at least four plausible explanations for the significant

establishment size—application relationship that exists even after wages




     22This finding is consistent with results reported in Barron and
Bishop (1985). In addition, Brown and Medoff (1987) find that looking
at only a sample of minimum wage jobs, large employers report more
applicants per job opening than small employers.
                                    27

are held constant.23 First, large firms are more visible and better
known by job seekers compared to small employers. As a result, there

may be better information about job openings at larger firms. Second,
if there are fixed costs in applying to firms it may be advantageous for

job seekers to apply to large firms because the same application may be
used for multiple openings. Third, our application measure is a stock,
not a flow, and large firms may maintain a greater inventory of
                                                            is some
applications in their files compared to small firms. There
indirect evidence for this explanation in the EOPP survey because we
find that large employers are more likely than small employers to report
that they interviewed applicants who had previously applied for

positions in their firm.   Finally, there may be nonwage aspects of work
such as fringe benefits and favorable working conditions that make large

firms more attractive employers than small employers. The last

explanation, it should be noted, runs counter to explanations of the
positive employer-size wage effect that are based on equalizing
differences.


5.   Conclusion

      Our empirical examination of application rates for job openings
that pay the minimum wage finds that positions that offer the minimum



     23yurthermore, this finding could be, at least partially, an
artifact related to the particular application measure utilized. Large
firms tend to make greater use of formal application procedures than
small firms. Casual inquiries concerning job openings are more likely
to lead to the completion of a written application form in large
employers. The greater use of written application forms by large firms
may mean that casual applications are more likely to be picked up in our
application measure for large firms than for small firms.

wage attract substantially more applicants than jobs that pay either
more than the minimum wage or less than the minimum wage.   This spike in

applications for minimum wage jobs supports the view that the minimum
wage confers rents to low—wage workers. This result suggests that
worker who obtain minimum wage jobs are made better—off than they

otherwise would have been in the absence of a minimum wage law.    In

addition, if true this finding casts doubt on models of the minimum wage
which predict that employers will fully offset the effects of a minimum

wage by reducing fringe benefits, on-the-job training and eroding
working conditions. Since employers do not appear to extract all rents
created by the minimum wage, there is reason to believe that employers

might not extract rents in other contexts in the labor market.
      In the second half of the paper we examine the relationship

between inter—industry wage differentials and application rates.    There

appears to be a weak, positive relationship between inter—industry job

application differentials and inter—industry wage differentials. This
finding complements the work of Pencavel (1970) and others who document
a negative effect of industry wage differentials on turnover. The

apparent low quit rate and relatively long queue of job applicants in
high—wage industries suggests that differences in earnings across
industries do not entirely reflect equilibrium compensating

differentials for nonwage work attributes.   However, it is not clear
from these results whether the effects of industry wage premia on

turnover and application rates stem from unobserved worker abilities or

from a labor supply response to ex—ante rents.
      There are three reasons to believe that the observed positive
                                     29

relationship between wages and job applications at the industry level
represents a queuing response by workers to ex—ante rents and not a
hoard of unqualified workers attempting to obtain high—skilled jobs.

First, the results of the analysis of queues for minimum wage jobs

suggests that the application rate successfully measure job queues in a
situation where there is a strong presumption that ex—ante rents exist.

Second, the industry dummy variables pass a specification test for
orthogonality with the error, which suggests that industry is not
correlated with omitted quality variables. And finally, evidence

presented in Krueger (1988) finds that the fraction of applicants for
federal jobs who pass   qualifying standards increases with   the relative

wage of federal workers.
      This paper suggests several important directions for future

research to further examine the existence of ex—ante rents in the labor
market.   First, the reasons why employers seem to only partially extract
rents created by the minimum wage need to be identified and explored

directly. Second, data on the average quality of job seekers across
industries can be brought to bear on the issue of whether inter—industry

job application differentials represent queues of qualified workers.
Finally, an examination of the relationship between appropriately
measured vacancy duration and wage premia would provide an alternative

approach to measuring job queues.
