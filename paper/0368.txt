          Optimal Tax Treatment of the Family: Married Couples

                Michael J. Boskin and Eytan SheshinskJ.




      This paper examines the appropriate tax treatment of the family

in a series of analytical models and numerical examples. For a popula-

tion of taxpaying couples which differ in earning capacity, we derive

the optimal tax rates for each potential earner. These rates depend

crucially upon own and cross labor supply elasticities and the joint

distribution of wage rates. Our results suggest that the current system

of income splitting in the United States, under which husbands and wives

face equal marginal tax rates, is nonoptimal. Using results from recent

econometric studies, and allowing for a sensitivity analysis, the optimal

tax rates on secondary workers in the family are much lower than

those on primary earners. Indeed, our best estimate is that the secondary

earner would face tax rates only one—half as high as primary earners.

1. Introduction

         The appropriate tax treatment of the family has been a basic

issue in the design and implementation of federal taxation in every

country employing direct taxation. Many countries use personal exemp-

tions, deductions and/or credits varying with family size. Several

countries, the United States among them, allow some type of income

splitting among family members.1 These provisions generally are defended

by an appeal to differing economic circumstances across families of

different size and economic characteristics.

         Many countries rely on the individual rather than the family as

the primary unit of account for personal taxation. Important examples

include Canada, Australia, Japan and The Netherlands. Among OECD countries,

only France requires families to file a joint return. Further, several

countries, such as Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden, recently have

switched to the individual as the unit of account.

         While the question of the appropriate unit of account for personal

taxation has always been important, it is assuming increasing importance.

Dramatic changes have occurred in family size and composition in most
          2
countries. The combined effects in the United States of the post-World

War II baby boom and the 1970's baby bust, the recent rapid increase in

the labor force participation of married women, the postponement of marriage

and child-bearing, the increased life expectancy and the soaring of the

divorce rate render the traditional one worker, one child raiser, continuously

married several child family representative of a dwindling proportion of the

population.
                                  2

         While the time thus seems ripe for a reexamination of the role

of the unit of account in personal taxation, such studies not only are

few and far between,3 but do not focus on what we consider the most

important economic issues. For example, virtually no attention is paid

to the efficient allocation of the time of family members between the

market and the household. Nor is the assortive mating in society and the

valuation of full income examined in an attempt to design an efficient and

equitable tax system.

         The purpose of the present paper is to begin to provide a theory

of the optimal tax treatment of the family. Our procedure is to examine

a series of models, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the

problem of the tax treatment of the family. Thus Section 2 presents a

model of identical families and discusses the issue of the most efficient

tax system to raise the goverTunent's required revenue. Various approaches

to the taxation of the family are analyzed from this efficiency point of view.

         Section 3 extends the analysis to the case of differences across

households in the ability to produce market income. Introducing the joint

density of thewage rates of husbands and wives and a representation of

social welfare enables us to discuss the tradeoff between efficiency losses

and redistribution inherent in designing a tax system.

         Section 4 develops an instructive and illustrative special case

of the analysis by confining attention to the Stone-Geary class of utility

functions. Since the analyses of Sections 2 and 3 reveal that certain

empirical parameters--own and cross substitution effects on the labor

supply of husbands and wives plus the parameters of the joint distribution

of abilities--play a central role in the design of the optimal tax treatment
                                   3

 of the family,we discuss econometric estimates of these parameters and

 employ them to estimate the optimal tax system.

           Section 5 concludes with a discussion of issues in the taxation

 of families of different size and composition which we address in the

 sequel to this paper.


2. Optimal Tax Treatment of
      Identical Families

          We first examine the structure of the optimal tax treatment of

the family in a world of identical families. This is the simplest case

to begin the analysis and will prove particularly useful in generating

insights in the subsequent analysis of the optimal tax treatment of non-

identical families.

          Assuming identical preferences and endowments and income effects

are taken care of elsewhere, we may treat social welfare as the welfare

of a representative consumer. The simplest case which begins to yield

some insight into the problem under consideration contains three goods:

the labor (available time less leisure) of the husband, L1, the labor of

the wife, L2, and other consumption, C. Without loss of generality,

non-leisure consumption is taken as the untaxed nuiieraire.

          Thus the welfare of each family nd social welfare) may be

represented by the usual well behaved utility function


(1)
          U(L1, L2, C)


Note that for analytical convenience we put labor supply rather than the

more usual leisure (the remaining fraction of time) into the utility function;

hence
                                  4


                                < 0         =   1,   2,



the marginal utility of labor supply is assumed to be negative.

         Within the context of such a model, we inquire under what conditions

it is desirable to tax the earnings of husbands and wives (or primary and

secondary earners) at the same rate, at different rates, or even to sub-

sidize the earnings of one of the workers. In general, we derive the

optimal tax rates for the two taxed commodities, L1 and L2.

         In the United States, husbands and wives are allowed to pool

their income and file a joint return which taxes them as if they had

each earned one-half of the income. This income splitting provision

1) reduces the rate of progression for married couples, and 2) equates

the marginal rate of income taxation on the earnings of husbands and

wives. The provision thus has important consequences for the horizontal

and vertical equity of the income tax. It is commonly argued that the

concern over the effects of income splitting stems from the progressive

rate structure imbedded in the current income tax. For example, Groves

[1963] argues that "The issue is associated with progressive taxation and

would be of little or no importance under a proportional tax." Under a

flat rate tax,there would be no rate of progression to reduce; hence, the

first effect noted above would be absent. The second effect of income

splitting, equating the marginal tax rate for husbands and wives, would not

disappear under proportional taxation. We may then inquire as to whether

it is desirable tax policy for husbands and wives (or primary and secondary

workers in the family) to face the same marginal rate of tax.

        The usual view on this matter is summed up by Pechman [1971],
                                                     5

         The classic argument in favor of income splitting is that husbands
      and wives usually share their combined income equally. . . . Two con-
      clusions follow from this view. First, married couples with the same
      combined income should pay the same tax irrespective of the legal
      division of income between them; second, the tax liabilities of married
      couples should be computed as if they were two single persons with
      their total income divided equally between them.

               We shall demonstrate below that taxing the earnings of husbands

and wives at the same rate is inefficient, in the sense that it produces

a dead weight loss to society substantially in excess of that obtainable

under a differentiated rate structure. The reason for this is straight-

forward: a tax on earnings distorts the work-leisure (or market vs. non-

market work) choice; equal marginal tax rates (since the [income-compensated]

supply of wives is much more elastic than that of husbands) induce a larger

decline in the market work of wives relative to husbands than is socially

optimal

               Choosing scales of measurement so that initial net prices, which

are the unit resource costs, equal unity for all goods, and that costs are

constant in the relevant range, we seek the tax rates that minimize the

dead weight loss from the tax system, subject to raising the required revenues

per family, R. Under these assumptions, the government's problem is to5

                           L1S23 = L2S13           or


                             S23 — S13
                              L2         L1

          Given initial prices of unity, this tells us that the earnings

of husbands and wives should be taxed at the same rates as under the

income-splitting provision, when the labor supplies of husbands and wives

have identical compensated cross elasticities of demand with respect to

the consumption of goods, or


                                   =
                                        ni3.

          Further, the tax rate on the husband should exceed the tax rate

on the wife if


                         L1S23 >   LS           (and


conversely if        <
                         L2S).         This is equivalent to


                     L1(S22 + S12) > L2(S11 +           S12).

Thus if the cross—substiutiori effects are small relative to the own

substitution effects, the higher               tax rate should be levied according to

whether


                          S22 >        S11
                          —f—          —i:-—
                                               i.e.,

we should tax more heavily the earnings of the factor with the smaller own-

compensated wage elasticity.

          The optimal tax rates need not both be positive.6 The denominators

in (4) are necessarily non-negative, being equivalent to a second-order
                                  8

principal minor of the negative semi-definite Slutsky matrix. Examining,

for example, the optimal tax rate on the wife's earnings, we note that it

will be negative if


                            L2S11 < L1S12.



Since S11 < 0 and L2   0, complementarity of husbands' and wives' labor

is sufficient for a wage subsidy for wives to be optimal.7


         While we shall return to econometric estimates of the S.          .    in
                                                                          13
Section 4 below, we note here that numerous econometric studies of labor

supply have concluded that the own-substitution effect on labor supply

for wives is much larger than that, for husbands as well as the cross-

substitution effect;8 since the typical hours of work of husbands exceeds

that for wives, a higher tax rate for husbands than wives would appear

desirable.


3. Ability Differences and the Optimal
    Tax Treatment of the Family



         Household behavior. Households are assumed to have identical

utility functions, U(C, L1, L2), where again, C denotes total consumption,

L1 labor supply by the husband, and L2 labor supplied by the wife, each

measured as a fraction of total hours available.9 Households differ in

their wage rate per hour, w1 the husband's wage-rate, and w2 the wife's

wage rate. Consumption is taken as numeraire with a unit price. There

is no income apart from laborincome, so      =          and   =                The
                                                 w1L1             w2L2.
household's before-tax total income, Y, is therefore Y =           +      =


w1L1 + w2L2.

              Tax instruments. The policy instrument examined in this paper

is an income tax schedule which may be written in general form t(Y1, Y2),

implying that the government can distinguish, for tax purposes, between

husband's and wife's incomes. We examine these possibilities by consider-

ing a general linear tax schedule of the form


(6)           t(Y1, Y2) = .. + (l-1)Y1      +
                                                (l-2)Y2
where   ci.   is an income guarantee, l_l and l_2 are the

marginal tax rates on             and Y2, respectively. A requirement for joint

returns without distinction between incomes would imply equal tax rates,

i.e.,         =          A favorable tax treatment of, say, the wife's income

implies 2 >         l'    etc.

               If the joint distribution of w1 and w2 is given by f(w1, w2),

the government's budget constraint is given by


              1 1 t(w1L1, w2L2)f(w1, w2)dw1dw2 = R


or, by (6),


(7)           c=1 1 [(l—81)w1L1 +                         w2)dw1dw2 — R,
                                       (l—2)w2L2]f(w1,

where R is the net required revenue.

              Policy objectives. If it is assumed that the government's policy

objectives are represented by a social welfare function, N, of the form


(8)           N =   1
                    001    G[U(C, L1, L2)]f(w1, w2)dw1dw2

where G is a concave function. This formulation allows for a range of

concern for equality from the strict utilitarian case G(U) = U to the
                                                       10

Rawisian case (G =          mm     U). The government maximizes (8) with regard to

       and 2 subject to (7).

         Obviously, the government is also constrained by the fact that

C, L1 and L2 are functions of w1, w2 and the tax parameters. Thus, the

household's budget constraint is given by


         C =
                 ''l   +         - t(Y1,     Y2)
(9)
             = a +                 +
                           1w1L1        2w2L2.

         Maximization of U subject to (9) yields the first order conditions


(10)     U2 + 1w1U1 = 0                      and            U3 + $2w2U1 =    0,

are the Slutsky terms for husbands' and wives' leisure.


         In order to simplify the interpretation of the optimum solution

(l6)-(l8), let us assume that w2 is a nonrandom, strictly monotone function

of w1. This, in effect, reduces the problem to one dimension, so we omit

henceforth t1subscript for w in the density functions.

         We may now provide an interpretation for
                                                                      h(w1, w2) = H(w).      The

first term in (15) is the social marginal utility (expressed in money terms by

division by A) of a lump-sum transfer to a household with wage w. This is

clearly a decreasing function of w. The second term is the change in tax

revenue due to such a transfer. Thus, if T(w) = - c'                     +               +
                                                                             (l-1)w1L1       (l-2)w2L2,
then this term is equal to BT(w) .        We      assume that this expression is non-
                                     12

increasing with w. This is a sufficient assumption to ensure that H(w)

is a decreasing function of w.

           The interpretation of H(w) is now straightforward. It is the

net social marginal utility of an increase in a (the income guarantee).

Condition (16)states that


(20)       1 H(w)F(w)dw =   0,
           0


where F(w) is the marginal density of w1, i.e., the optimum level of a

is such that the social marginal utility of an increase in its value

averages to zero over the population.

           Equations (17) and (18) can now be rewritten


(21)       1 H(w)(—w1L1)F(w)dw + .1 w1[(l—1)w1S11 +                        =   0,
                                                       (1-2)w2S21]F(w)dw


(22)      .r H(w)(-w2L2)F(w)dw +   I w2[(l-1)w1S12   + (l-2)w2S22)F(w)dw = 0.



       Let us assume further that the wage income of the husband, w1L1, and

of the wife, w2L2, are non-decreasing with the wage rate, w)° Under

these assumptions it can be shown that the first terms in (21) and (22)

are non-negative.


          Proposition 1.    If H(w) is non-increasing in w and incomes are

non-decreasing with the wage rate,

          (a) whenS12 =     Othen l-3 >0 and 1_2 >0;
          (b) when S12 < 0 (two types of labor are complements), then

                            either 1- >   0   or 1_2 > 0.

          The proof is obvious.

          Further simplification towards empirical application is obtained

by assuming that the                 are constant. In this case (21)-(22) simplify

to


(23)      (l—81)511S11 + (l_82)cS12S12 = A



(24)      (l—) SS +                                        = B



where

         A    =   I H(w)w1L1F(w)dw <           0,              B =   I   H(w)w2L2F(w)dw
                                                                                              <

                  0

The solution of (23)-(24) is given by


                                      —

                          ll22ll22 — sl2s12
where * denotes the optimum.

         Notice that the covariance between husbandvs and wifets wage rate,

expressed by l2' affects the optimum tax rates only through S12. In

particular, if S12 = 0, then                   and3 are independent of 612.

         Now, the sign of tIdenominator in (25)-(26) is positive by the

             Proposition 2.         If S are constant, and the two types of labor

are Hicksian substitutes, S12 >                   0, then 1- > 0 and l- > 0.
             It is seen that when S12 < 0, i.e., when the husband's and the

wife's labor are Hicksian complements, it                      is   possible that one tax rate
                                                                                  11
will be negative, that is, a wage subsidy is desirable.

             Note that         =         when


(27)         A522S22 - B612S12 = B11S11                -

There is no a priori reason why this condition should be satisfied.

Furthermore, when A = B (equal social marginal utility for a lump-sum

transfer to husband and wife) then (27) implies S11S11 =
                                                                                       522S22, i.e.,
the product aEthe variance of earnings and the own-substitution effect

on labor supply should be the same for husbands and wives. More generally,
                                                           S

larger the elasticity of wives' relative to husbands' labor supply the

larger should be the tax on husbands' relative, to wives' income. Further,

given the elasticities of labor supply, the higher tax rate should be

levied on the earnings with the smaller variance, ceteris paribus.

        As expected, the optimum tax rates are decreasing in the respective

coefficients b1 and b2 which express the relative weight of husband and wife's

leisure in the family's utility. Furthermore,           and            decrease (i.e.,

tax rates increase) as a, "inequality aversion", decreases.

         A variety of studies have estimated family labor supply functions.

As noted in Section 2, these studies invariably conclude that the labor

supply of wives is much more elastic than that of husbands.12 For

example, Pencavel and Johnson [19781 estimate a linear expenditure system

with the S. .'sat mean values as follows: S      =   73.9;    S        = —6.2; S
                                                                                 22
                                                                                    =   249.3.
             13                             11                    12

Since L1 exceeds L2 by a substantial amount, the compensated wage elasticity

of wives is five or six times as large as that for husbands. Further,

Pencavel and Johnson [1978] estimate a b1 slightly larger than zero and a

modest b2.
         Studies of the correlation in wage rates between husbands and

wives, like the labor supply studies, must account for the fact that a

large percentage of wives do not work in the market at any point in time.

A recent careful study by Smith [1978] suggests a substantial positive

correlation in wage rates of husbands and wives.

         As an instructive example, we present a sample calculation of

the optimal tax rates derived from the Stone-Geary function with reasonable

ranges of values of 5; we assume b1 = .05; b2 = .2 and a =               .os13 (the S..'s
are simple functions of the b's, L's, and


                              OPTIMAL TAX RATES

                            Husbands       Wives

                      .05    0.48           0.25

                      .25    0.43           0.21
                  6
                      .50    0.38           0.17

                      .75    0.34           0.14


         While alternative estimates would change these rates somewhat, our

major qualitative feature--the higher rate of tax on husbands than wives--
                                 18

results from all reasonable parameter values. We take this to be a

strong indictment of the case for income splitting quoted in Section 2.

In a world of married couples, the primary earner should face higher

tax rates than the secondary worker.


5. Conclusion

         We have examined the appropriate unit of account for personal

income taxes in a world of married couples which differ in earning

capacity. The typical second-best problem yielded both analytical results

and empirical insights which suggest that equal. marginal tax rates on

husbands and wives, as under the U.S. income splitting provision, is

nonoptimal. The primary.earner in the family would face higher optimal tax

rates than the secondary earner due to the relatively less elastic labor

supply of primary workers. A numerical example based on recent parameter

estimates derived from the Stone-.Geary utility function suggests that the

rate. on husbands would be roughly twice that on wives.

         Families differ in more than their ability to produce market income.

They differ in the number of children, whether or not two adults are

present, etc. The increase in divorce rates and other changes in family

patterns suggest that the relative tax treatment of families of different

size and composition is also becoming more important. Indeed, we hear more

and more about incentives to marry or to divorce embedded in the tax codes

of different countries. We shall deal with questions of family size and

composition in a sequel to this paper. We hope that by focusing on the

optimal tax treatment of the family in a world of married couples only, we

have brought to attention the neglected, but crucial, issues of relative

labor supply elasticities and wage rate variances and covariances of
                      15
husbands and wives.

1. Other countries allowing or requiring income splitting include Spain,

    Switzerland, France, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom.

2. See the excellent summary          by      Michael, Fuchs and Scott [1978].

3. Important recent exceptions include Munnell [1978], Brazer [1978], Rosen {77&78].

4. The allocative inefficiency induced by various tax devices has been

    a central issue intax theory and policy for many decades. In its

    modern form, it dates back to Ramsey [1972] and Pigou [1947], and

    includes important contributions by Roiph and Break [1949], Friedman

    [1959], Little [1951] and Corlett and Hague [1951]. The most empirically

    relevant analyses are those of Harberger [1964, 1966]. While                 earlier
    contributions        tended to focus on how to achieve optimal taxation,

    Harberger extended the analysis to include the measurement of the dead

    weight loss associated with any set of non-neutral taxes. Renewed

    interest has been stimulated by the work by Diamond and Mirrlees [1971]

    and Atkinson and Stiglitz [1972].

5. Here the tax rates are expressed as percentages of the net price of

    leisure; the more usual quotation in terms of gross earnings may be
                                                                           l—.1
   derived once we note that a subsidy to leisure at the rate                      is

   equivalent to a subisdy at the rate 1-8. on the gross price. Thus,

 6. Obviously, one tax rate must be positive with a positive revenue

     requirement.

 7. For husbands, L1S22 < L2S12.

 8. For example, see Boskin [1973], Hall [1973], Rosen [1976], Heckman

     [1974], Hurd [1977], Ashenfelter and Heckman [1973], and Pencavel

     and Johnson [1978].

9. Note we here normalize total time available to unity.

10. Thus, we assume the wage elasticity of labor supply exceeds minus one.

    The empirical studies discussed below render this a safe supposition.

11. Note the similar conclusion arrived at in Section 2.

12. For example, see Boskin [1973], Bowen and Finegan [1969], Cain [1966],

     Hurd [1977], Mincer [1962], and Pencavel and Johnson [1978].

13. Since a is wage—weighted, and fh(w)f(w)dw, presumably a will be close

     to zero unless there is extreme social inequality aversion. The level

     of a would affect the level of tax rates and transfers; since our focus

     is on the differential in these tax rates, we do not present results

     for other values of a. However, our calculations reveal that even

     with much larger values of a, the same pattern of much lower tax rates

     on wives occurs.

14. Obviously, the         and     depend upon the tax rates; the current

     estimated values will change if we change tax rates. However, the

     qualitative conclusions reported here are quite robust to modest
                                                                        -

15. Robert Hall points out to us that as formulated, our problem can be

     thought of as applying to any two—dimensional labor supply decision,

     e.g., optixnal taxation of a worker early and late in life.
