Output Spillovers from Fiscal Policy

                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we estimate the cross-country spillover effects of government purchases on output for
a large number of OECD countries. Following the methodology in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
(2012a, b), we allow these multipliers to vary smoothly according to the state of the economy and
use real-time forecast data to purge policy innovations of their predictable components. We also consider
the responses of other key macroeconomic variables. Our findings suggest that cross-country spillovers
have an important impact, and also confirm those of our earlier papers that fiscal shocks have a larger
impact when the affected country is in recession.

1. Introduction

One of the challenges facing a country attempting to maintain economic stability is the economic

shocks emanating from abroad, which through trade and other linkages may have important

effects on domestic conditions. While such shocks may have many sources, one of particular

interest is fiscal policy. Indeed, a common justification for fiscal agreements like the Stability

and Growth Pact and successive measures adopted by Eurozone countries is that, having

relinquished independent monetary and exchange rate policies, individual countries need some

protection from the shocks of uncoordinated fiscal policies. Economic observers long

appreciated the importance of fiscal spillovers but it is the current economic environment of ever

increasing globalization and of conflicting calls for fiscal austerity and fiscal stimuli that

demands clear and robust evidence to navigate policymakers through the Great Recession and its

aftermath. Specifically, there are at least three key questions: (1) What is the effect of fiscal

austerity/stimulus in one country on economic conditions in another country? (2) Can countries

short of fiscal ammunition (e.g., Greece during the Great Recession) be supported by positive

fiscal stimulus in other countries? (3) Does the strength of fiscal spillovers vary over the business

cycle? If so, what should be the scope of coordinated fiscal policies in recession? In this paper,

we try to shed new light on these questions, with results that have a number of immediate policy

implications.

       Our paper is certainly not the first empirical investigation of fiscal spillovers. For

example, Bénassy-Quéré and Cimadomo (2006) estimate the impact of fiscal spillovers from

Germany to the remaining G-7 countries using an augmented SVAR model. Beetsma et al.

(2005) estimate the spillover impact of shocks via the trade channel by combining panel VAR

estimates of the effects of domestic shocks on output and estimates of the effects of output on
imports from abroad. In a recent paper, Hebous and Zimmermann (2012) adopt a panel VAR

approach to estimate the effects of domestic and foreign fiscal shocks among Eurozone

countries, representing foreign shocks as a common, GDP weighted aggregate of the individual

country shocks. 1

        We extend the existing literature in a number of ways. First, we consider fiscal spillovers

among OECD countries, a larger and more heterogeneous group than the G-7 or the Eurozone.

This allows us to consider, for example, the differences in effects among countries sharing fixed

exchange rates versus those that do not. Second, although we allow shocks to depend on trade

linkages, we directly estimate the effects of shocks in one country on another country’s output.

This makes interpretation of estimated coefficients in our econometric specification particularly

straightforward and transparent. Third, we allow multipliers to vary across states of the business

cycle, thus relaxing standard assumptions that our previous analysis of domestic shocks in the

United States and the OECD (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012a, b, respectively) suggested

was important. Fourth, we enhance identification of fiscal shocks by removing predictable

innovations in government spending by controlling for information contained not only in the lags

of macroeconomic variables but also in professional forecasts. This aspect is important because

anticipated and unanticipated fiscal shocks may have different effects and mixing these two

types of shocks, which is likely to happen in VAR models (see e.g. Ramey 2011 and Auerbach

and Gorodnichenko 2012a, 2012b), can lead to understating estimated effects of fiscal shocks.

Finally, we consider the effects of fiscal spillovers not only on output but also on a number of

other macroeconomic variables; hence we can paint a more detailed picture of how fiscal shocks

propagate across countries.

1
 There have also been a number of papers estimating the impact of fiscal spillovers using DSGE models. See, for
example, Bénassy-Quéré (2006) and Corsetti, Meier, and Müller, (2010).

                                                                                                                  2
       We document that fiscal spillovers are significant in both statistical and economic terms.

The effect, however, varies tremendously over the business cycle with the spillovers being

particularly high in recessions and quite modest in expansions, with the output multiplier in

recessions being even larger than those found in our previous work for domestic shocks, based

on what would expect given the strength of trade linkages. We also find that fiscal spillovers are

increased further when both recipient and source countries are in recession.


2. Modeling Fiscal Spillovers

To model the effects of fiscal spillovers, we extend the approach taken in Auerbach and

Gorodnichenko (2012b) and use data for a panel of OECD countries to estimate fiscal spillover

multipliers using direct projections. Specifically, for our baseline model we run a series of

regressions for different horizons, h = 0, 1, …, H of the form:


       𝑌𝑖,𝑡+ℎ −𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1          𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖𝑡              Δ𝑌𝑖,𝑡−𝑠              Δ𝐺𝑖,𝑡−𝑠
(1)                     = 𝛼ℎ              + ∑𝑚
                                             𝑠=1 𝛽ℎ𝑠 𝑌         + ∑𝑚
                                                                  𝑠=1 𝛿ℎ𝑠 𝑌         + 𝜙ℎ𝑖 + 𝜇ℎ𝑡 + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑖ℎ𝑡
          𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1                𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1               𝑖,𝑡−𝑠−1              𝑖,𝑡−𝑠−1




where 𝑡 and 𝑖 index time and countries, Y is real GDP, and G is real government purchases (both

Y and G are measured in terms of local currency in fixed prices of the base year), 𝜙 and 𝜇 are

horizon-specific country and time fixed effects, and 𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘 is the government spending

spillover shock emanating from other countries, which we will specify further. The impulse

response for 𝐻 periods is constructed from a sequence of estimated {𝛼ℎ }𝐻
                                                                        ℎ=0 .

       Before we continue, a few observations about equation (1) are useful. First, variables in

equation (1) are in differences, scaled by lagged GDP, which follows the approach in Hall (2009)

and Barro and Redlick (2011). Estimated {𝛼ℎ }𝐻
                                             ℎ=0 in this specification directly correspond to

multipliers while in our previous work we estimated elasticities of output with respect to a


                                                                                                             3
government spending shock and then converted them into multipliers. Also, scaling by lagged

output puts the observations from different dates and countries in similar units. 2 Second, we

omit lagged values of taxes from our specification. Experiments with the inclusion of taxes and

other potential own-country controls, such as rates of interest, inflation and unemployment, did

not have an appreciable impact on the results, and so we omit them in the interest of conserving

degrees of freedom. Third, we do not include own-country fiscal shocks in equation (1). While

the analysis of the effects of such shocks was the main objective of our previous papers,

including them here would require a significant reduction in sample size, for there are many

country-years for which we do not have OECD forecasts of government spending. Analysis of

models including own-country shocks using this reduced sample suggests that their inclusion has

little impact on the estimated effects of fiscal spillovers; given the larger standard errors caused

by this reduction in sample size, we omit own-country shocks from the results we report.

         To construct the fiscal spillover shock 𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘, we regress real-time one-period-ahead

forecast errors for government spending from the OECD’s “Outlook and Projections Database”

in each country on that country’s lagged macroeconomic variables (output, government

spending, exchange rate, inflation, investment, and imports) as well as a set of country and

period fixed effects. Since the residual from this regression captures innovations in government

spending orthogonal to professional forecasts and lags of macroeconomic variables, we take this

residual as a measure of unanticipated government spending shocks. Denote this policy shock in

source country q with eq,t. Then we aggregate eq,t across countries using bilateral trade as a



2
 In principle, if G and Y are cointegrated, their ratio is stable in the long run and a regression based on first
differences should include an error correction term reflecting this relationship in levels. However, our estimates are
for a relatively short time period (1985-2012), during which there are trends and swings in the G/Y ratio. Moreover,
specifications with included levels of G and Y (or their ratio) barely affected the coefficients of interest and therefore
are not reported separately here.

                                                                                                                        4
measure of inter-country linkages. In particular, our base specification for the fiscal shock

affecting country i in year t is:


                                       𝑴𝒊𝒒,𝑩
                               ∑𝒒≠𝒊�           �×�𝒆𝒒,𝒕 ×𝑮𝒒,𝒕−𝟏 ×𝑬𝒒,𝑩 �
                                       𝑮𝒒,𝑩
(2)             𝑮𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒄𝒌𝒊,𝒕 =                       𝑬𝒊,𝑩



where 𝑀𝑖𝑞,𝑡 is country q’s imports from country i in year t, Ej,t is country j’s US dollar exchange

rate in year t, and B is a base year. The term in curly brackets in expression (2), 𝑒𝑞,𝑡 × 𝐺𝑞,𝑡−1 ×

𝐸𝑞,𝐵 , equals the dollar value of country q’s fiscal shock, calculated using a base-year exchange

rate. The first term in the numerator, 𝑀𝑖𝑞,𝐵 /𝐺𝑞,𝐵 , scales this shock by the ratio of imports from

country i to government purchases, and division by the base-year dollar exchange rate of country

i converts the shock into units of the recipient-country’s currency. One may interpret 𝑀𝑖𝑞,𝐵 /𝐺𝑞,𝐵

as a weight which corrects for heterogeneity of countries in the strength of the trade linkage

between source country q and recipient country i and in the size of government in source country

q. This ratio also captures the idea that a certain factor of government purchases translates

(directly or indirectly) into imports from other countries, which stimulate demand in those

countries.

        It is possible that a dollar increase in government spending in country q is going to be

converted into less than 𝑀𝑖𝑞,𝐵 /𝐺𝑞,𝐵 dollars of imports from country i. Indeed, discretionary

government spending shocks are often designed to support the domestic economy. For example,

the 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus in the United States had many restrictions, such as that firms

receiving federal aid had to hire U.S. citizens or purchase inputs from U.S. suppliers. While

examples that go in the other direction are less obvious (military spending abroad would be one

instance), indirect effects matter, too; the propensity to import out of induced changes in private


                                                                                                      5
spending in country q must also be taken into account. Our specification in (2) effectively

                                                                                  𝑀𝑖𝑞,𝐵
assumes that spillover shocks occur through imports, and that 𝜃                           is imported from country i
                                                                                   𝐺𝑞,𝐵


for each dollar increase in government spending in country q, with 𝜃 being constant across

countries. Obviously, 𝜃 = 1 is an important special case. However, even when 𝜃 ≠ 1, the

estimated 𝛼ℎ in specification (1) will absorb 𝜃 and our interpretation of the estimated 𝛼ℎ is not

affected. The higher the value of θ, the higher we would expect the estimate of 𝛼ℎ to be.

        One can re-write the expression in (2) as follows


                                        𝑀      𝐸𝑞,𝐵        𝑒𝑞,𝑡 ×𝐺𝑞,𝑡−1                              𝑒𝑞,𝑡 ×𝐺𝑞,𝑡−1
(2’)     𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑀𝑖𝑇,𝐵 ∑𝑞≠𝑖 � 𝑀𝑖𝑞,𝐵 𝐸 � × �                           � = 𝑀𝑖𝑇,𝐵 ∑𝑞≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑞,𝐵 × �                  �
                                            𝑖𝑇,𝐵 𝑖,𝐵            𝐺𝑞,𝐵                                    𝐺𝑞,𝐵



where 𝑀𝑖𝑇,𝐵 is the total imports from country i to other countries measured in the currency of

country i (i.e., country i’s total exports to those countries from which fiscal shocks emanate) and

𝜔𝑖𝑞,𝐵 is the share of these imports from country i going to country q. The last term (curly

brackets) can be interpreted as an unanticipated shock to government spending measured in

percent terms. Thus, 𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡 is the weighted average percent shock in government spending

in other countries scaled by the level of imports from country i.

        Equation (2) uses fixed, base-year exchange rates and import intensity for scaling fiscal

shocks. An alternative is to allow these factors to change over time reflecting changing trade

patterns and exchange rates. With time-varying weights, we specify country i’s fiscal shock in

year t as:

real US dollar exchange rate in year 𝑡 − 1. An advantage of using time varying weights is that

they will pick up trends in exchange rates and trade linkages and hence more accurately

represent current economic conditions. A disadvantage is that imports, government purchases

and exchange rates are potentially correlated with the shocks we measure (to the extent that we

have not fully purged the shocks of predictable components) and also can exhibit volatility over

short periods. To deal with the latter issue, we smooth the time-varying weights in equation (3)

by averaging values over two lagged periods.

        In addition to the standard real GDP series, we will examine responses of other key

macroeconomic variables to government spending spillover shocks, following the same general

approach as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012b). As discussed there, a benefit of

estimation using direct projections is that consideration of these other variables involves only a

small modification to equation (1). For example, equation (1) for a variable of interest 𝑋 is

specified as follows:

could be measured in units or scale different from 𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘 (e.g., real exchange rate, hours per

worker). 3

         Whichever version of the fiscal shock we use, we also wish to allow the impact of shocks

to vary over the business cycle, given the findings in our earlier work that multipliers vary over

the cycle and are larger in recessions. Following our earlier approach of allowing smooth

transitions between the states we label “recession” and “expansion,” we modify specification (1)

fix 𝛾 = 1.5 so that an economy spends about 20 percent of the time in recession. We calculate

𝑧𝑖,𝑡 after removing very low frequency movements in the data using the Hodrick-Prescott filter

(smoothing parameter 𝜆 = 10,000), so one can think of 𝑧 as (normalized) deviations from trend.

For our base case, as before, we measure 𝑧𝑖,𝑡 using the growth rate of real GDP, but we also

  We find similar results when in equations (1’) and (1’’) we control for lags of the government spending growth
rate rather than lags of the output growth rate. We prefer the latter specification as it has a better fit and produces
smaller standard errors.

consider the logarithm of real GDP and the unemployment rate. When we use the latter two

variables, one can use the slump/boom dichotomy rather than the recession/expansion

dichotomy. For each variation, we lag 𝑧𝑖,𝑡 by one period to minimize contemporaneous

correlations between fiscal shocks and macroeconomic variables.


3. Data

The macroeconomic series we use in our analyses come from the OECD’s Statistics and

Projections database. Aside from the benefits these data provide in terms of standardized

variable definitions and measurement, we also have available semiannual forecasts prepared by

the OECD for key macroeconomic variables such as GDP and government spending in June and

December of each year. 4 For further information on these forecasts and their quality, see

Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012b) or the OECD’s website. 5

          The OECD’s forecasts are consistently available since 1984 for “old” members of the

OECD (e.g., the United States) and since the mid-1990s for newer members (e.g., Poland). A

drawback of using the OECD projections is that, for most of the available sample, they are

available only semiannually rather than quarterly. Thus, we estimate our equations at this

frequency. To avoid a further reduction in sample size, as discussed above, we omit own-

country fiscal shocks from our specification, in order to include observations for countries in

years for which their own forecasts of government purchases are unavailable. Also, we treat

countries for which forecasts are unavailable as having zero weight in the fiscal shock

calculations for other countries. This undoubtedly introduces some error to our key variable, but


4
 Consistent with the OECD definitions and the previous literature on fiscal multipliers, our government spending
series is the sum of real public consumption expenditure and real government gross capital formation. That is, it
excludes imputed rent on the government capital stock, unlike under the current U.S. NIPA convention.

we have complete data for the large leading economies that account for a considerable share of

world imports. Finally, we exclude from our analysis all observations from a few small

economies—Greece, Estonia, Luxembourg, and Turkey—for which there are large and volatile

changes in reported government spending, in at least some cases due to data revisions. In the

end, we have 30 countries in our sample.

       For all model specifications presented below, we estimate impulse responses for six

semiannual periods, starting in the first half of 1985 (because our projections of government

spending are available beginning in 1984). That is, we set the maximum horizon H = 5 and

estimate equations for 0 to 5 periods ahead. Also, we set m, the number of lags of changes in

real GDP and government purchases included as control variables, equal to 4. All estimates are

reported along with Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors that allow arbitrary correlations of

the errors across countries and time.

       Figure 1 shows time series of fiscal spillover shocks for selected countries and Table 1

reports basic descriptive statistics. The average (across countries) standard deviation of scaled

                          𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡
fiscal spillover shocks               × 100 is about 0.09 but there is considerable variation across
                           𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1


countries from 0.2 for Canada to 0.025 for the USA. The magnitude of these shocks is fairly

small for big economies and, given plausible multipliers, they are thus unlikely to explain a large

fraction of variation in output and other macroeconomic variables. The correlation of shock

series across countries varies between -0.4 to 0.99 with the mean correlation of approximately

0.4. In general, countries that have very different trading partners tend to have low or negative

correlation (e.g., Canada and the Czech Republic), while countries sharing the same key trading

partners (e.g., Hungary and Slovakia or Canada and Mexico) have highly correlated series. The

across countries from 3.6 in Slovakia to 0.6 in Japan and 0.66 in the United States.


4. Results
   A. Basic Results
Table 2 presents results for a variety of specifications based on the approach outlined above.
                                                1
Each entry in the table provides the average (6 ∑5ℎ=0 𝛼ℎ ) real GDP multiplier of fiscal spillovers

over the six-period (i.e., three-year) horizon window, with standard errors in parentheses.

To help in the interpretation of these coefficients, recall that the fiscal shocks are measured in

units of real government spending, scaled by the ratio of bilateral imports to government

spending in the source country. Thus, if the percent shock to government spending, 𝑒𝑞𝐺 , were

uniform across all source countries q, this shock would be scaled by the sum of imports from

country i by all source countries (e.g. 𝑀𝑖𝑇,𝐵 in (2’)) before being included in the regression as the

variable 𝐺𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘. In contrast, when using a framework similar to specification (1), the literature

estimating domestic government spending multipliers for country i scales percent shock 𝑒𝑖𝐺 by

the level of government spending 𝐺𝑖,𝑡−1 . Thus, if the impact of spillover shocks is in proportion

to the ratio of imports from country i to government spending—if 𝜃 = 1 in our previous

terminology—we should expect the estimated multipliers to be of the same magnitude as those

estimated for domestic shocks. Otherwise, as discussed, the estimated spillover multipliers will

be larger (if 𝜃 > 1) or smaller (if 𝜃 < 1).

       The first column of Table 2 provides estimates for the linear model, given in (1). The

upper panel corresponds to the fiscal shocks in expression (3); those in the lower panel are based

on the fiscal shocks as specified in expression (2). For each of these specifications, we present

results for three samples: i) our full sample (the base case), ii) our full sample but with fiscal

                                                                                                     11
spillover shocks constructed using only eight relatively large economies for which we have

complete data since 1984: the US, UK, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Australia –

the G-7 plus Australia – and our full sample of countries, but truncated at the end of 2007, to

eliminate the possibly unique effects occurring during the Great Recession. The multipliers for

all six variants are similar, given their standard errors, and are statistically significant when the

sample is constrained to exclude post-2007 observations.

       The remaining columns of Table 2 show estimates of state-dependent multipliers, based

on economic conditions in the recipient country, i, from expression (4), using our three different

measures to represent the state of the business cycle, based on output growth, log output level,

and the unemployment rate. Results are again relatively similar across specifications within any

column, but are strikingly different across business cycle regimes, with multipliers being much

larger in recession, and much smaller in expansion, than for the linear model. Indeed, the

multipliers in expansion are generally negative, although not significantly so, while those in

recession are considerably larger than those estimated using the linear model. We obtain values

in recession of a higher order of magnitude than those found in our earlier work for the United

States (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012a), which suggests that fiscal spillovers have a greater

impact than would be implied simply by the ratio of imports to government spending. Note that

because shocks are fairly correlated across countries by construction, and because we control for

many lags of macroeconomic variables as well as country and time fixed effects, the standard

errors are relatively large. However, even with this considerable sampling uncertainty,

multipliers in recessions are routinely statistically significant at the conventional levels.

       Figure 2 presents impulse responses over the six-period horizon, with 90 percent

confidence bands, reflecting the estimates in the lower panel and first three columns of Table 2,



                                                                                                        12
which correspond to fixed-weight fiscal shocks for the linear model and states based on lagged

output growth rates. Aside from overall differences in magnitude, the impulse responses also

differ between recession and expansion in their shape, with the effects in recession growing over

time, unlike those in expansion.

       Given the similarity of results for different specifications, for the remaining tables we

will report results only for this particular specification of fiscal shocks, GShock (using fixed

weights over time, as in equation (2)) and the business cycle index z based on lagged values of

real GDP growth.

       Table 3 provides multiplier estimates for a variety of other important macroeconomic

aggregates. For example, fiscal spillover shocks have a strong, stimulating effect on exports in

recessions, while in expansions the effect is negative. In contrast, imports have only weak,

statistically insignificant responses to fiscal spillover shocks. These responses are consistent

with the notion that trade can be an important channel of how fiscal shocks are propagated across

countries. In general, the results confirm those in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012b) where

we estimate the effects of own-country fiscal shocks within the OECD, especially when one

constrains the sample to large countries or pre-2008 observations. All components of output rise

more in recession, as does employment.


   B. Exchange rate regimes

As discussed earlier, the issue of fiscal shock transmission within currency areas is of particular

interest, given the inability of countries to offset these shocks via monetary and exchange rate

policy. More generally, we would expect the transmission of shocks to differ between fixed and

floating exchange rate regimes, ceteris paribus, because changes in a source country’s demand

for imports would not have the same effects on its exchange rates vis à vis its trading partners.

                                                                                                    13
In particular, we would expect smaller effects of shocks under a floating exchange rate regime,

as an increased demand for imports resulting from a positive shock would cause an appreciation

of the recipient country’s bilateral exchange rate.

          We modify our previous methodology by allowing the effects of shocks to vary

according to the recipient country’s bilateral exchange rate regime with the source country. That

is, we aggregate fiscal shocks into two components, those for countries with a fixed exchange

rate with the recipient country, and those for countries with a floating exchange rate with the

recipient country. 6 Specifically, for each combination of countries 𝑖 and 𝑞, we create dummy

variable 𝐵𝐼𝐹𝐼𝑋𝑖𝑞 equal to one if countries 𝑖 and 𝑞 have a fixed exchange rate (directly or

indirectly) and zero otherwise. Then measures of fiscal spillover shocks for countries sharing a

fixed exchange rate and countries with floating exchange rates are

The state-dependent version (4) is modified in a similar spirit.




6
  Our categorization of fixed and floating exchange rates is based on Rose (2011). We classify a pair of countries A
and B as sharing a fixed exchange rate if one of the countries has a fixed exchange rate with another directly (e.g. A
pegs to B) or indirectly (i.e., A pegs to C and C pegs to B or B pegs to C).

                                                                                                                    14
       Using this modification, we find (Table 4) that while multipliers are broadly similar, the

magnitudes of multipliers in countries sharing a floating exchange rate tend to be larger than

multipliers in countries sharing a fixed exchange rate, although the differences are not

statistically significant. This pattern emerges in both linear and state-dependent models. While

these results are somewhat surprising, one should keep in mind that the samples of countries with

fixed and floating exchange rate regimes vary in a number of other ways which may affect our

estimates. For example, countries having fixed exchange rates are almost exclusively covered by

the Eurozone.


   C. Cyclical properties by source country
Throughout our discussion thus far, we have allowed impulse responses to differ according to the

state of the recipient country’s business cycle. This makes sense, as we might expect the effects

of a given external shock to vary according to the extent of slack in the recipient economy. But

it is also possible that the relationship between the external shock and the source country’s fiscal

shock might depend on that country’s economic conditions. For example, if a source country is

in recession, a positive fiscal shock there might have a bigger local impact on output and on

import demand, and therefore provide a bigger stimulus to recipient country production.

According to this logic, multipliers should be bigger if there is a recession in the source country

as well as if there is one in the recipient country. Whether this prediction is borne out by the data

has immediate policy implications in the current economic environment where economic activity

is depressed in many countries. Specifically, if a fiscal stimulus in one depressed economy has a

more positive effect on another depressed economy, then amplified fiscal spillovers would

increase the argument in favor of coordinated fiscal stimulus so that externalities from fiscal

shocks are internalized.


                                                                                                  15

and the state-dependent version (4) is modified similarly.

          Table 5 presents estimates based on expression (6), with a second dimension of

distinction between recession and expansion based on the state of the business cycle (measured

using the same method) in source countries. Each pair of columns corresponds to one state of

the business cycle in the source country (linear; expansion; and recession). For each pair, our

previous results hold: multipliers are larger when the recipient country is in recession than when

the recipient country is in expansion. Looking across these sets of columns, we see that when

the recipient country is in recession, (columns 4 and 6 in the table), the multipliers are generally

larger when the source country is also in recession, a result consistent with the reasoning laid out

above.




                                                                                                             16
5. Conclusions

In an increasingly globalized world, policies adopted in one country are likely to affect economic

outcomes in other countries. To what extent, if at all, fiscal policies spill over into other

countries is a key question in the current environment with depressed economies and high or

rising levels of public debt in many developed countries. We document that fiscal stimulus in

one country is likely to have economically and statistically significant effects on output in other

countries. Furthermore, the strength of the spillover varies with the state of the economy in the

recipient and source countries, with the output multipliers being large in recessions. These

results suggest that fiscal activism may indeed be effective in stimulating demand in economic

downturns and that coordination of fiscal policies may be more valuable than previously thought.

       The present paper estimates fiscal spillovers based on the historical experience of OECD

economies since the mid-1980s and thus it may be difficult to generalize these estimates to

different episodes or countries. However, one may reasonably argue that future theoretical and

empirical models should allow for non-linear and potentially strong positive responses of

economies to domestic and foreign fiscal shocks. This approach is likely to provide a solid,

empirically plausible foundation for designing fiscal policies.

Notes: the table reports average multipliers from fiscal spillovers for variables indicated in the left column. A positive coefficient for
the real exchange rate means that the real exchange rate appreciates. State-dependent multipliers are for the case where the state of the
business cycle is measured as deviation of the output growth rate from trend. The estimated specification is given by equation (1’) for
consumption, investment, exports, and imports, and by equation (1’’) for the real exchange rate, hours per worker, employment and
the real wage rate.

spending innovations in all countries. The red, thin, dashed line is constructed as in equation (3) using
government spending innovations in only large OECD economies. The solid, thin, blue line is constructed as in
equation (2) with fixed weights using government spending innovations in only large OECD economies.

                   Notes: the figure reports impulse response of output to a GSshock with fixed weights (equation
                   (2)). The left column reports impulse responses in the linear specification (1) while the right two
                   columns show responses in the non-linear specification (4). Each row corresponds to the sample
                   of countries and construction of shocks described in section 4.A. Solid, thick, red lines are point
                   estimates. Dashed, blue, thin lines are 95% confidence intervals constructed using Driscoll and
                   Kraay (1998) standard errors.
