            An Empirical Analysis of the Fixed Coefficient
               "Manpower Requirements" Model, 1960-1970

                                ABSTRACT


      The fixed coefficient "manpower requirements" model is one of the most

widely used tools in the empirical analysis of labor skills.   The model

has the advantage of providing information on the effect of changes in

the industrial composition of an economy on demand for labor in highly

disaggregated occupations at the cost of neglecting factor substitution.

This study examines the ability of the fixed coefficient model to explain

changes in employment in 3-digit occupations in the United States from

1960 to 1970 and develops an "augmented requirements" model which uses changes

in wages as well as fixed coefficient shifts in demand to analyze changes

in employment.   The paper finds that 1. by themselves, the requirements

shifts account for much of the change in employment among detailed occu-

pations in the period studied, though standard errors of estimate are

sizeable; 2. even with crude adjustments for factor price effects, demand

for detailed skills is far from zero elastic; 3. the fixed coefficient

model seems to work not because demand and supply are economically unrespon-

sive but because the variation in the wage structure and corresponding

incentive to alter input coefficients is moderate relative to the variation

in the shift in demand due to changes in industrial mix.

     One of the most widely used tools in the empirical analysis of

labor skills is the fixed coefficient "manpower requirements" model.

Variants of the model have been employed by the         u.s.   Bureau of Labor

Statistics to forecast manpower "needs" and provide guidance in vocational

decision-making; by the O.E.C.D. in its Mediterranean Regional Project

to analyze relations between growth and educational "requirements";

and by numerous developing countries as part of the manpower planning
           l
process.        Wide usage notwithstanding, the fixed coefficient approach
                                                        2
has been severely criticized by many economists.            From the perspective of

standard factor demand theory, the main flaw of the model is its failure

to allow for the adjustment of inputs to changes in factor prices.               As

a tool of labor market analysis, the approach also suffers from being
                                                                       3
widely used with extrapolative supply projections to forecast              shortages

or surpluses in a system that neglects supply as well as demand adjustments.

In large       ~easure   because of the poor supply projections, requirements/

supply forecasts of market problems have often been seriously in error,

projecting "shortages" for example when "surpluses" in fact developed

(see Freeman and Breneman).

     These difficulties notwithstanding, the fixed coefficient demand

model offers the only general analytic tool for studying the effect of

changes in the industrial composition of an economy on demand for workers

in a large number of disaggregate occupations.          The alternative variable

coefficient production function methodology cannot handle more than a
                                                                                       4

Li.ke input-output analysis in general, the fixed coefficient manpower

model sacrifices potential knowledge about substitution among aggregated

inputs for knowledge about disaggregated changes in the industrial mix

in the economy.    ~fuether   this tradeoff is worthwhile is an empirical

issue dependent on the problem under study, the extent of disaggregate

shifts in industrial structure,and the extent of factor substitution.

To j4dge the usefulness of the tool. it is necessary to examine the actual

link between fixed coefficient shifts in demand for labor skills and

changes in employment at the level of disaggregation on which the analysis

focuses.

      This paper presents such an investigation using data on 3 digit

occupations in the United States from 1960 to 1970.       It imbeds the fixed-

coefficient manpower approach into a more general demand model. in which

the fixed    co~fficient   calculations are interpreted as measures of

horizontal shifts in demand whose elasticity is set by standard substitution

considerations and. in which employment depends on changes in wages as

well as shifts in demand.      The "augmented" model is estimated and compared

to the simple fixed coefficient predictions.      There are three basic

findirrgs.   First, by themselves, the requirements shifts account for much

of the change in   e~ployment   among detailed occupations in the period studied,

though standard errors of estimate are sizeable.      Second, even' crude

adjustments for factor price effects sho..r th,:r.t demand for detailed skills

is far from zero elastic.      Third, the model seems to work not because

demand and supply are economically unresponsive but because the variation

in the wage structure and corresponding incentive to alter manpower coefficients

is moderate relative to the variation in the shift in demand due to changes

in industrial mix.

             The paper is divided into five sections.     The first sets out the basic

methodology of the fixed coefficient approach and develops an augmented

requirements model [ARM] which also allows for factor substitution.

The second examines the variation in the changes in            ~mp10yment     and income

among detailed occupations in the 1960-1970 period and the link between

changes in employment predicted by fixed coefficient shifts and actual

changes.          Section three presents estimates of the reduced form employment

and demand equations of the ARM model.             Section four seeks to explain the

greater variation in changes in employment than in changes in incomes among

occupations in terms of the estimated demand relation             and the apparently

high occupational mobility of the work force.             There is a brief conclusion.


I       The Model

             The principal element in manpower requirements analysis is an inter-

industry model in which labor skill coefficients--the ratio a .. of workers
                                                                        1.J
in an occupation i and industry j [N .. ] to total industry employment
                                            1.J
[N.]--are assumed to be fixed.          The assumption of fixed input ratios
    J
means that only a single observation is needed to estimate a .. (though
                                                                       1.J
more observations should improve the estimates), which permits a highly

disaggregate analysis of occupational skills across industries that
                                                                                     S
would not be possible if substitution             parameters were also estimated.

             With input ratios within industries fixed, the moving force of the

requirements model is the changing industrial composition of employment

(or output), which is taken as exogenous to the labor market.                 Formally,

if D          is the number of workers "demanded" in occupation i (other
         i
factors fixed), the basic coefficient relation is:

     In the year (data set) in which the a ij are calculated, equation

(1) is an identity and 0i will equal the actual number employed.                                               The

     Taking first differences of (1) yields the basic equation relating

the actual change in               employmen~ 6L                      is, by definition:

From equation (3) we see that 60. will give a perfect prediction of the

       In this paper I interpret                            ~Di   or   Vi   as measures of horizontal shifts

in demand due to changes in the interindustrial mix of employment at

fixed wages, not (as is common in the requirements literature) as predicted

manpower needs.                      The changes are part of the more general demand function

for occupation i:

                                         .      .

                                               = 02

In .equation (5) other factor prices are assumed constant; in empirical

work, the change in wage in occupation i will be compared to the average

change for all occupations.

      Rewriting the actual change in employment (3) in percentage change

form yields a comparable expression for L in terms of changes in industrial
                                         i

where all summations are taken over j.

If   nij       is the elasticity of demand for the ith occupation in industry

j, the changes in input coefficients can be written as:




where for simplicity other (randor:1) changes in the coefficients are ignored.

Substituting (7) into (6) and noting that                         Di = EYijN j      yields:

an equation which           makes the overall response of demand to changes in

wages a weighted average of responses of demand within industries

(EYijnijWi) and an interaction term (EYijnijWiNj)'

     When the interaction term is sufficiently small to be ignored,6 equation (8)

translates directly into the summary demand equation (5),7 with




Equation (9) shows that the elasticity of demand for workers in occupation

i is a weighted average of the elasticities of demand for the occupation

across the j industries.

     When the interaction term is large, on the other hand, expression (8)

shows that (5) is not an adequate representation of the change in demand,

fGr it ignores the interaction effect.                         I~ile     in general there is no easy

way to treat interactions, it can be readily seen that when the n .. are

According to (10) an appropriate specification of demand requires not

only shift and wage terms but also their direct multiplicand, which should

obtain a coefficient equal to the elasticity of demand.                                 Because of the

finite difference form, shifts in demand have small effects on employment

when wage changes are large while wage changes have large effects on

employment when demand shifts are large.

     However one treats the interaction effects, the model of (1)-(10)

shows that the assumption that input coefficients respond to changes in

wages can yield a relatively simple generalization of the fixed coefficient
                                                                                                          8
model, in wIlich changes in wages operate through a single elasticity term.

     One additional assumption is needed for the demand model to be empirically

tractable.    Because the requirements analysis is applied to decadal changes

in a large number of occupations, it is not possible to estimate (5) with

separate elasticities for each occupation.                            Instead   ni   must be assumed to

be the same across         occupations~yielding the                   following demand function to be

estimated:



                                                           2
where vi has a mean 0 and variance 0

along a supply schedule due to changes in wages and to shifts in the schedule

Alternatively, if supply is assumed to decline over time proportionately

with the size of the work force due to normal retirement, death, or other

mobility patterns, the supply curve can be written as:

as in (5'), each occupation is assumed, for reasons of empirical tractability,

to have the same elasticity of response.

                                             i

This equation shows that, on average, changes in employment depend on a

weighted average of the shift in demand and the shift in supply, with
                                                                                                               12

If. for si.mplicity. we assume no exogenous shifts in supply (Si                                = 0).    the

requi~ements           model is seen to provide a perfect prediction of changes in

employment under two conditions:                         when the elasticity of demand is zero

(n      = 0),    the usual fixed coefficient postulate; or when the elasticity

of supply is infinite (¢                     = 00),   so that wages do not change.         More     generally~

 input coefficients (A ij ) was used together with actual 1970 industry

 employment levels to predict shifts in demand for occupations.                        These shifts

 were then compared to actual changes in employment as estimated from the

 B.L.S. data.         With superscripts to reflect the time period, the level of

 employment in 1960 and 1970 by occupation was obtained from

such groups as unpaid family labor, apprentices, student nurses, some

'not elsewhere classified,' and certain other small categories deleted

or amalgamated into others.14            Changes in actual employment (L.) were

        The major problem in analyzing the occupational change data is that

between 1960 and 1970 the Census altered greatly its occupational definitions,

expanding the number of categories from 297 (including diverse not elsewhere
classified groups) to 441.           To make categories comparable over time, the occupations

based on 1970 categories were transformed into occupations based on 1960 definitions

Table 1 of that volume provides data on the percent of persons in each 1970

occupation who would have been in the various 1960 groupings.         It was deemed

more fruitful to collapse occupations based on 1970 definitions into occupations

based on 1960 groups than to do the reverse because of the potentially smaller

error in aggregating than in decomposing groups and because of the desire

to preserve the actual 1960 matrix as the critical component of the analysis.

The 1970 industry figures were similarly bridged to 1960 definitions using

Table 2 of Technical Paper 26.

     The other variables of the model were obtained from published Census

data as described in the notes for tables 3 and 4 and were similarly

'bridged' into 1960 categories using the same procedure from Technical Paper 26.

Changes in wages were approximated by changes in the average of the median

income of male and female workers in an occupation, using the proportion

in each occupation by sex to form the average.       w~ile   it would be more

desirable to have changes in mean hourly rates of pay, the published

Census data do not permit calculation of that variable for the two periods.

Shifts in supply were estimated from changes in the distribution of the

total work force by sex and education assuming that workers in a given

sex-education class had (with wages fixed) the same propensity to choose

a particular occupation in 1970 as in 1960:

        E.= percentage change in persons in the jth sex-education group.
        J           .
The sax-education data were also used to calculate the mean years of

schooling of workers in an occupation.

        Because of the bridging of the income (and other) Census data needed

to obtain comparable 1960-1970 categories, there is a potentially substantial
                                                                     ·11


measurement error for occupations which undergo considerable change.        To

obtain a 1970 income for a "1960 occupation" which was divided into several

groups in 1970, it is necessary to take a weighted average of the incomes in

the 1970 occupations, on the assumption that persons who would have been in the

1960 category are paid the average of persons in the 1970 group.    When a 1970

occupation contains several 1960 groups, this assumption is liable to be

wrong, leading to errors of measurement.   As some occupational definitions are

essentially the same in both years (accounting, for example) while other undergo

sizeable definitional changes (tailors, which in 1970 included what had

been previously termed operatives n.e.c. in 5 industries and laundry

and dry cleaning operatives) in some calculations the sample is restricted to

occupations with relatively small changes in definitions, thereby    minimizin~


measurement problems.



 Patterns of Change and Interrelations

      The pattern of change in the major variables of concern is examined

 in table l,which records the standard deviation of the log changes in

 employment and in wages among occupations and the standard deviation of

 the log changes in calculated shifts in demand and   ~pply.    Column 1 gives

 the basic standard deviations while column 2 gives "weighted" standard

 deviations obtained by weighting the observations by the square root of

 the number of workers in 1960.   The weighted statistics have the advantage

 of minimizing the impact of the often large log changes in small occupations,

 where measurement error is likely, and of placing greater impor IDee on

 the larger and more significant groupings.

0(1) is three times as large as cr(W).     Weighted by the square root of the number

of workers in 1960, the standard deviation of log changes in employment falls

markedly, indicative of the large variance in employment changes among

small occupations, but is still nearly 2 1/2 times the standard deviation

in the log changes of wages.      Indicative of the greater variation in

employment than wages in the underlying data, the unweighted average

change in employment in the ten fastest growing occupations from 1960

to 1970 was 1.13 log points compared to an unweighted average change of

-.73 points for the ten slowest while the average change in income in the

ten occupations with the greatest increases in income was .82 log points

compared to an average change of .14 points in the ten occupations with

the smallest increases in income.

     The differential pattern of change in employment and income constitutes
a major empirical relation for the analysis of this study.      In the context

of supply and demand, there are three possible explanations for the enormous

variation in employment among occupations and relatively moderate variation

in incomes.    First, demand for labor skills could be highly elastic,

limiting variation in wages, while the supply of workers shifts greatly

over time.    This is the high elasticity of substitution interpretation placed

by various analysts on cross-country data on relative incomes and employment
                      15                •
among skill groups.        A second possibility is that shifts in the demand and

supply of labor skills are, for unknown reasons, positively correlated, preserving

the wage structure while altering the compositiun of jobs.      The third possibility,

to be termed the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis, is that the supply of

labor is relatively elastic, which limits variation in wages, while the

demand for labor is highly variable, producing substantial changes in

employment.    In this case movements along a demand curve do not contribute

greatly to changes in employment not because substitution among labor
                                                                                   14


skills is limited but because wage variation is moderate due to elastic

labor supply schedules.

     The standard deviations of the calculated demand and supply shift

terms in lines 3 and 4 cast light on potential explanations of changes in

employment.    They show that changes in the industry mix and in the sex and

education mix of the work force produced sizeable and comparable

dispersions in the shifts of supply and demand among occupations, which

implies a potential role for both forces in the observed differential

growth of occupations.              More formally, since by reduced form equation

the changes in employment due to unmeasured shifts in supply or demand

are also quite important.

     Table 2 turns from the pattern of variation in the major variables of

concern to the univariate link between the driving force of the augmented

requirements model, the fixed coefficient shift in demand, and actual changes

in employment in th e 254              occupation sample. If D and L are closely

connected in the simple statistics presented in the table, there is some

 plausibility to the fixed cOf'fficient approach; if not, we -should abandon the

 exercise at this point.             Line 1 records the correlation coefficient between

 the observations by the square root of employment in 1960 in each occupation.

The weighted correlation gives greater weight to the larger occupations

and less to smaller occupations which, as noted, often evince sizeable

 log changes in employment,             Line 3 records the number of cases in which the

 predjcted change in the share of employment in occupation i has the same

 sign as the actual change in the share,               It is a non-parametric statistic

 that allows differences in demand or supply elasticities among occupations

 to create differences in the impact of             Di on   ii but which requires that

 shifts in demand dominate market outcomes in the sense of producing changes

 in employment in the~)same direction as the changes' in demand.

      The statistics show that the fixed coefficient component of the change

in demand does a reasonably good job of tracking employment.                Despite the
                          .
large variation in Li due to the changes in small occupations, the

correlation coefficient in line 1 is 0.50.               With observations weighted by

the square root of the number of workers in 1960, the correlation rises to
                                                                                   .,

result that is highly significant by the sign test.


II   The Augmented Requirements Model

      The finding in table 2 of a reasonably close link between the

fixed coefficient shift in demand and changes in employment suggests

the value of a more detailed investigation of the augmented

requirements model,           To what extent can the explanation of changes in

employment be improved by taking account of supply side developments and

movements along demand schedules?              In the cross-occupation data treated

by the   rcoCli'l:"f""'lents Model    is t!'lere a sizeable or t\iniscule response of

demand to wage changes?              What types of supply and demand schedules and

shifts account for the differential variation of changes in employment

and in wages by detailed occupation?

     As a first step toward answering these questions, the reduced form

employment equation (12) was estimated for several samples of 3 digit

occupations.   The dependent variable in the regressions is the log change

of employment in three digit occupations.    The independent variables are:

the predicted log change from the fixed coefficient model; the predicted

shif~   in supply; and the log of lagged number of workers in occupation.       The

calculations were done using ordinary least squares and weighted least

squares, with weights based on the square root of the number of workers in

an occupation in 1960.    Because of the potential heteroskedasticity of log

changes in employment in small, often ill-defined occupations,18 which may

be in part due to the fact that the data are based o? a 5% sample of the

Census rather than a complete count, the weighted regressions are more

desirable and will be given greater stress in evaluating results.         In

no case do results hinge critically on whether the regressions are weighted

or not.

     The results, summarized in table 3, show that the demand and supply

shift terms have a substantive positive effect on employment, with the

coeficient on the former always larger than that on the latter, though

by an amount that differs depending on the weighting and sample.       In

line 1, which treats the complete 254 occupations in unweighted regressions,

a log change in D changes employment by nearly twice as much as a log

change in S.    In line 2, where weighted regressions are used, the

impact of the demand shift term rises while that   of the   supply shift term

falls, with a resultant differential of nearly 5 to 1.      The overall

explanatory power of the model is considerably higher and the standard

               The samples are defined as follows:

                 B = 231 occupations, all not elsewhere classified (nee) occupation deleted

error of estimate for the equation considerably lower in the weighted

than in the unweighted regressions, presumably because the former attach

less importance to the random variation in the log changes of employment

in occupations with relatively few workers.           Lines 3 and 4 report the

results of experiments with smaller more narrowly defined groupings.

for which the    bridging~·of   1970 categories into 1960 categories seemed worst,

with roughly comparable results.         In these cases, moreover, the differences

between weighted and unweighted (not reported in the table) regressions were much
smaller, supporting the interpretation of the marked differential in the complete

sample as being largely due to changes in ill-defined or badly measured groups •
                                                                      .
     According to equation (12) the coefficients on D to S reflect the elas-

ticities of demand and supply.       If the shift variables are reasonably good

measures of horizontal changes, their regression coefficients will sum to
                                     .
unity and the ratio of the D to S coefficients reflect the elasticity of

supply relative to demand.       The sum is close to unity in lines 2-4 but exceeds

it   somewhat in the unweighted regression of line 1.             The ratio of coefficients

is always above one, by amounts ranging from 1.7 to 6.3, which implies that

supply is more elastic than demand.          Taking the restricted sample results as

providing the "best" estimates of the key parameters, supply is estimated to

be 2.5 times as elastic as demand.



Shares of Employment

changes in the share of employment in occupations predicted by the fixed

           There are two basic ways to analyze changes in shares.                        First, information

 theoretic concepts, which treat predicted or actual proportions, can be

 used to calculate the "nits" of information given by the demand shift

 model.           In terms of information theory (see Theil for a detailed discussion)

 the inaccuracy of the fixed coefficient predictions can be measured by

            (16)        II   = rti    log(ti/d i )
                               i
 where t i          =   share of workers in occupation i in 1970

             di     = share        of workers in occupation i in 1970 predicted by the

 requirements model.                   (D i divided by total employment in 1970).

           This measure reflects the inaccuracy of the predictions in terms of

 the deviation of the true (posterior) proportion (t 1 ) from the predicted

When'predicted proportions are not correct (d i                      ¥   t i for, some i), II takes on

a negative value, indicating that the predicted proportions do not explain

fully actual proportions.                    In the data set under study, II       = -.00010,       which

 means that there is only a relatively small average error in using



           A stronger test of the information content of the requirements shift

 is to compare the inaccuracy of predictions based on the d. with the
                                                                                    1.

 share of workers in an occupation (t.(-l)) which is the appropriate share

in the share of workers supplying services to occupation i based on

equation (14) gave an insignificant negative coefficient to the change in

supply variable, indicating that with the change in share functional form

demand effects are the driving force of employment changes.



The Demand Equation

       Direct estimates of the augmented requirements equation are given in

table 4 using both unweighted and weighted regressions.                                         Lines 1-3

record ordinary least squares estimates of the effect of shifts in demand

and of changes in wages on employment in the entire sample and in the

restricted            sample which excludes all not elsewhere classified groups.
                                                                        22


Lines 3-6 gives instrumental variable estimates, in part to correct for

simultaneity in the determination of changes in incomes and in part for

likely measurement in the wage change variable.         The OLScalculations

provide a base for evaluating the IV results and may, because Census

income figures relate to the previous year, be sufficiently free of

simultaneous bias to provide a useful estimate of the elasticity of

demand itself.     The instruments (in addition to those in the equation)

are listed in the table notes.      Both the OLS and IV regressions accord a

significant and sizeable negative coefficient to the change in income,
which supports the basic notion that the fixed coefficient analysis can

be improved upon by taking account of movements along the demand curve.

In the OL5 calculations, the elasticity estimates range from -.42 (line

2, full sample, weighted) to -.61 (line 3, restricted sample, weighted)
The demand shift term obtains a coefficient close to unity in lines 1

and 2,suggesting that it does reflect horizontal shifts, but a smaller

coefficient in line 3.       In the IV calculations, the unweighted regressions

in line 4 essentially replicate the OL5 results in line 1.          The weighted

regressions in lines 4 and 5, however, differ noticeably from the comparable

OL5 regressions:      the coefficient on W rises, as expected,while that on D

declines.      The estimated elasticity of demand goes from -.42 to -.81 in the full

sample and from -.61 to -.91 in the restricted sample.          The drop in the coefficient

on   D is   anomalous for it means that   D is   negatively rather than positivelv

correlated with     Win   the instrumental equation, a result which might be

attributed to the greater impact of measurement errors than of simultaneous

errors in the data and/or to the possi.ble positive correlation between unmeasured
                                                         19
shifts in supply and the measured shift in demand.            Even with this problem,

however, the results show that the augmented demand model offers a better

representation of demand than the standard fixed coeffici.ent model.

Further Analysis

raised the possibility that the effects of D and W on employment would

be interrelated.         To test for the possibiliy of such an interaction, I

added the multiplicand of         Dand   W to the demand equations of table 4.              When

the elasticities of demand for an occupation are the same among industries,

DW is the appropriate interaction term and will obtain a negative coefficient

equal in magnitude to the product of the coefficient
                                                                           .
                                                                     on D and the coefficient

on W.     In all of the regressions,          DW   entered with the expected negative

sign, obtaining an especially significant effect in the OLS weighted

regressions in the complete sample:

      (19)   i =   .13     .37W +   1.38D -    .85DW
                          (.13)     (.28)     (.49)
                                                                    SEE    =   .21.3

where numbers in parentheses are standard errors.                 The negative interaction

shows that, as expected, changes in wages have a greater effect on employment

when demand is shifting upward.             Moreover, the coefficient on DW is only

moderately different from the         produc~      of those on Wand D.
                                                                       .       This is

con~iGtent    with the finite expansion term in enunti0n (10),                 ~~vcn


similar within-industry elasticities of demand for occupations.                        As the

interactions could be due to other factors which might lead to interactive

functional forms, no strong conclusions shnuld be drawn from the results,

especially in light of the measurement error problems.                 "(fuat (19) does

suggest is the value of more detailed analysis of interaction                     effe~ts   in

analysis of decadal changes, due to the finite change formulae.



 IV   The Differential Variation of EmplOyment and Wage Changes

        The final issue to consider is the potential causes of the strikingly

greater variation of changes in employment than of changes in incomes presented
                                                                                        25

in table 1.            On the basis of the estimates of the augmented requirements

model, which of the three hypotheses outlined earlier--shifts in supply

along a stable highly elastic demand curve; correlated shifts in supply and

demand; or shifts in demand along an elastic supply shedule (the dynamic

demand/elastic supply hypothesis)--appear best able to account for the

observed pattern?

          While not definitive, the estimated equations tend to favor the

dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis and to rule out an explanation

based on shifts in supply along a highly elastic demand curve.                         First, as

noted, the reduced form calculations in table 3 yielded coefficients on the

demand shift variable                COrisiderab~y     larget than the coefficients on the supply

shift variables.              According to equation (12) this implies that the supply

of labor to occupations is more elastic than is the demand for labor.                          Second,

the demand elasticities in table 4, though non-negligible, are much

below the magnitudes needed to sustain the argument that demand for

detailed skills is highly elastic.

          Another way to judge the hypotheses is to use the estimated coefficients
      .
on D and S and the variation of the variables in the data to calculate standardized
                 .     • 20
Beta weights for D and S.   These weights measure the effect of a stand&rd
                                .        .
deviati.on change in D and S on a standard deviation change in employment.

If demand shifts are the predominant force altering employment among occupations,
                                 .
the Beta weight for D should exceed that for S.
                                                                    .   Using the regression coHficients

of table 3 to obtain estimated coefficients and the relevant standard deviations

in    D and      in   ·S   in the samples yields the following Beta weights:             for line 1 of

table 4, 1.32 for             Dversus        ,86 for    S;   for line 2 of table 3, 1.42 for   Dversus   .21

for
          .
          S;   for lines 3 and 4, .82 for
                                                       .
                                                       D versus   .48 for S,   Thus. in each ca8e,

the Beta weights for the demand shift factor exceed the Beta weig:lts for

the supply shift factor, implying that demand factors dominate the

observed patterns of change.                    This does not mean, however, that supply
                                                                     26

shifts were unimportant nor that correlated shifts in demand and supply may

not have contributed to the observed pattern.      In all of the calculations
                      .
the Beta weight on S was non-negligible.      The shift terms in the two

schedules were correlated at .43.    Because the supply shift term treats

the educational upgrading of the work force and increased labor

participation of women as exogenous, however, it probably overstates the

"true" exogenous shifts in supply and probably overstates the correlation

between supply and demand shifts in the period.      To some extent at least,

the upgrading of the education of the work force and increased participation

of women are likely to represent endogenous behavior.      These considerations

strengthen the case for the dynamic demand/elastic supply interpretation.

     The plausibility of the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis can

be probed further by examining one particular component of supply, the

occupational mobility of the work force, on which the Bureau of Labor

Statistics has recently provided considerable information.      Mobility of

of workers from one occupation to another is, according to the Bureau of

Labor Statistics' study, a major    el~~ent   in changes in employment by

occupation:   from 1965 to 1970 the B.L.S. estimates that nearly one-third

of workers reporting in the 1970 Census of Population transferred from one

three-digit occupation to another while less than one-half remained in the

same occupation. 21   If this substantial volume of occupational movement

is related to economic incentives, an important component of the dynamic

demand/elastic hypothesis will be established.      If the movement is un-

related to economic incentives, it will be difficult to maintain the

hypothesis that the large change in employment relative to the change in incomes

is, at least in part, the resultant of shifts in demand along reasonablv

elastic supply curves.

     To test the responsiveness of occupational mobility to market conditions,

I "bridged" the B.LoS. estimates of the percentaRe of workers in each three digit
                                                                                   27

occupation transferring to a different occupation (SWITCH) or remaining

in the same occupation (STAY) from 1965 to 1970 to be

comparable to the 1960 occupational categories used in this study.                      The

two variables were then regressed on                t~~   indicators of economic   incentives~


the level of incomes in the occupation in 1960 and the change in income from

1960 to 1970; on the percentage of the occupation in 1960 who were women, on

the hypothesis that women are less likely to be occupationally mobile than

men; and on the percentage of workers aged 30 or below in 1960 and the

percentage aged 45 or over in 1960, on the hypothesis that young workers

are likely to be highly mobile across occupations and older workers

likely to be less mobile.                 Persons aged 30 or below would be less than

35 years of age in 1965 while those 45 or over would be 50 years or older

in 1965.     Two functional forms were used in the analysis:                a log-log

equation in which the log of the relevant percentage was the dependent

variable; and a logit regression in which the log odds ratio of the variable

was dependent.           In the former case, the coefficients on the log of income or

on changes in log income represent the supply elasticities with respect to

the given occupation's income v€rsus income of all other occupations.                         In

the latter, the coefficients represent the logistic curve parameters of the

effect of the variables.                 The coefficients must be multiplied by l-P,

where P is the mean proportion who switched or stayed,to obtain elasticities

at the mean.     Formally, the log'odds equation is

     The analysis treats both the percentage switching and the percentage

staying in occupations because the two variables are not complements.           They

differ by the percentage of workers who left the labor force or died.           Because

the B.L.S. reported no figures in cases where the standard error on the

proportion exceeded 10 percent, moreover, the two variables are available

for different numbers of occupations.     In the samples under study there were

184 occupations with data for STAY and 158    occu~ations   with data for svITTCH.

     The regression results are summarized in table 5.       What stands' out

in the table is the substantial and significant effect of the income variables

on occupational mobility, with changes in income and levels of income reducing

the proportion of workers who transfer out of occupations and increasing the

proportion of workers who remain in the same occupation over time.          In line 1

the percentage of switchers has an elasticity with respect to changes iil incomes

of 0.7 and an elasticity with respect to the level of income of .3.         The logit

regressions in line 2 yield different coefficients but imply similar

ela~icities (-1.01   and -0.33) at the mean value of SI.JITCR (.24).    In lines

3 and 4 the proportion who remain in an occupation has a somewhat smaller

but still marked elasticity, again of comparable magnitude at the mean

percentage (.55) in the two forms.     In all the calculations, the higher

the percentage of females, the less likely is occupational mobility, while

the higher the percentage of workers less than 30, the greater is mobilitv.

     Since responsiveness to market conditions is likely to be greater

among new entrants (who have not yet invested heavily in occupations)

the estimates in the table provide lower bounds on the extent of flexibility
                     22
of the work force.        While more detailed analysis of occupational mobility

patterns, which takes into account incomes in fields to which persons

move as well as incomes in their 1965 occupations, is surely needed, the

overall impression is that occupational mobility patterns are sufficiently

sizeable and responsive to be consistent with the dynamic demand/elastic

supply hypothesis.



IV   Cone lusion

      This study has examined the applicability of the fixed coefficient

manpower requirements model to changes in employment in detailed occupations

in the U.S. from 1960 to 1970 and explored the possibility of improving

the model by taking account of factor substitution at an aggregate

occupational level.    The principal findings can be summarized briefly:

      1)   The fixed coefficient manpower requirements model can be treated

as a model of shifts in demand for labor in the context of a more general

augmented requirements demand model, in which movements along demand       sch~dules

due to changes in incomes as well as shifts in demand are treated as

determinants of changes in    QT'l.~lc:~cn::.

      2)   By itself the fixed coefficient shift term provides a good fix

on changes in employment, accounting for about 60% of changes in the share

of the work force in occupations and 44% of changes in the log of employment,

weighted by the size of occupations.

      3)   Allowing for movements along the demand curves induced by i~~me

variation tends to improve the analysis noticeably.       Direct estimates of

the elasticity of demand for occupational skills clearly rejects the

hypothesis of fixed or economically unresponsive manpower coefficients.

EstiIIiated (average) elasticities of demand with respect to incomes are on

the order of -.4 to -.9.     In addition, there is indication of interaations

between change in incomeand shifts in demand, which result from the finite

change formulae.

      4)   The variation in changes in employment among occupations exceeds

the variation in changes in incomes.        There are three possible explanations

of this phenomenon:    movements of highly variable supply schedules along

elastic demand curves; correlated shifts in supply and demand; or movements
                                                                                                 . .,.

                                                                                  31



of a highly variable demand schedule along elastic supply schedules, which

we have termed the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis.                  The evidence

suggests that the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis explains at-

least part of the -observed difference in variation.              Shifts in demand

for detailed occupational skills appear to have contributed more to                    chan~es


in employment than shifts in supply.         The demand for labor in three

digit occupations appears to have a moderate elasticity.                 High significant

occupational mobility seems to make the supply of labor relatively

elastic to three digit occupations.

     5)   Since even the best fitting equations leave considerable standard

errors of estimate, the fixed coefficient model must be used cautiously

in projections and policy analysis.

     Because of the great difficulties with changing Census definitions,

some of these results may be altered given better data.                The findings are,
hO'.vever, generally similar to those obtained in a comparable analysis of

the 1950-1960 period;3 when occupational definitions did not undergo

great change, and given the usual effect of measurement errors are, if

anything, likely to be strengthened bybetter data sets.                Overall, the

evidence supports the use of the fixed coefficient model in demand analysis

but indicates that the model can be improved by taking account of factor

substitution,even in a highly aggregate manner.             Further work to bridge

the traditional dichotomy between the fixed coefficient and factor

methodologies should improve our understanding of and ability to

4In a general production function, which permits different elasticities of

    substitution among different labor inputs, the number of Allen elasticities
         i
    is (;)   where i    = number   of inputs.   The technology is such that with

    available data points, it is virtually impossible to estimate factor

    demand relations for more than "5 inputs (10 elasticities).

5Since one form of economy wide substitution is to shift employment among

    sectors with different skill mixes, the methodology does not,'in fact,

    necessarily involve more rigidity than st:mdard demand models which focus

    on factor prices.     A very detailed fixed coefficient model in which

    industry scale depended on wages through the effect of wages on cost and

    cost on price could predict greater changes in employment than would

    occu= via factor substitution, industry mix fixed.       However, existing

    models do not take industry scale as dependent on wages.

    Note, however, that n i is on average a "reduced form" elasticity rather

     than the more fundamental elasticity of demand for the occupation with

     an industry.

 assume that the elasticity of demand for                               ~ccupations     varies randomly

     First they dropped "allocated" and "not specified" groups, distributing

     those workers proportionately by industry or occupation.          Second, they

     adjusted the Census data for seasonality (due to the fact that the

     Census is conducted in the spring), by altering totals to be on a comparable

     basis to the Employment and Earnings annual averages.          Third, certain cells

  reason to believe that it is prone to measurement error.                 Probl~r:;n   \1i th the
     supply shift term may also cause the instrumental variable estimate of

     the elasticity of demand to be biased downward.

ZOSpecifiCally, when        b is   the regression coefficient of y on x, then the

     Beta weight is b(O /0 ) where a          and a       are the standard deviations of the
                        y     z           y           x
     dependent and independent variables, respectively.

     Attempts to estimate a supply equation based on the changes in                emplo)~ent

     figures used in the demand equations of this study yielded weak

     or perverse results on changes in incomes, presumably due to identification

     problems and the mixture of age, education, and sex groups with very

     different elasticities of response.          This suggests the need to decompose

     carefully the various components of supply:                the supply of new. entrants;

     the occupational mobility of existing workers; and to distinguish between

     various demographic groups of workers and, where possible, various occupations.
