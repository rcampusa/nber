                                           ABSTRACT

We study economic growth and inflation at different levels of government and external debt. Our
analysis is based on new data on forty-four countries spanning about two hundred years. The dataset
incorporates over 3,700 annual observations covering a wide range of political systems, institutions,
exchange rate arrangements, and historic circumstances. Our main findings are: First, the relationship
between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90
percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls
considerably more. We find that the threshold for public debt is similar in advanced and emerging
economies. Second, emerging markets face lower thresholds for external debt (public and private)—which
is usually denominated in a foreign currency. When external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual
growth declines by about two percent; for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half. Third,
there is no apparent contemporaneous link between inflation and public debt levels for the advanced
countries as a group (some countries, such as the United States, have experienced higher inflation
when debt/GDP is high). The story is entirely different for emerging markets, where inflation rises
sharply as debt increases.

         In this paper, we exploit a new multi-country historical data set on central government debt as

well as more recent data on external (public and private) debt to search for a systematic relationship
                                               1
between debt levels, growth and inflation.         Our main result is that whereas the link between growth and

debt seems relatively weak at “normal” debt levels, median growth rates for countries with public debt

over 90 percent of GDP are roughly one percent lower than otherwise; average (mean) growth rates are

several percent lower. Surprisingly, the relationship between public debt and growth is remarkably

similar across emerging markets and advanced economies. Emerging markets do face a much more

binding threshold for total gross external debt (public and private)—which is almost exclusively

denominated in a foreign currency. We find no systematic relationship between high debt levels and

inflation for advanced economies as a group (albeit with individual country exceptions including the

United States). By contrast, inflation rates are markedly higher in emerging market countries with higher

public debt levels.


         Our topic would seem to be a timely one. Government debt has been soaring in the wake

of the recent global financial maelstrom, especially in the epi-center countries. This might have

been expected. Using a benchmark of 14 earlier severe post-World-War II financial crises, we

demonstrated (one year ago) that central government debt rises, on average, by about 86 percent

within three years after the crisis.2

  In this paper “public debt” refers to gross central government debt. “Domestic public debt” is government debt
issued under domestic legal jurisdiction. Public debt does not include debts carrying a government guarantee.
Total gross external debt includes the external debts of all branches of government as well as private debt that is
issued by domestic private entities under a foreign jurisdiction.



2
 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a, b) demonstrate that the aftermath of a deep financial crisis typically involves a
protracted period of macroeconomic adjustment, particularly in employment and housing prices.

        Outsized deficits and epic bank bailouts may be useful in fighting a downturn, but what is

the long run macroeconomic impact or higher levels of government debt, especially against the

backdrop of graying populations and rising social insurance costs?


        Our approach here is decidedly empirical, taking advantage of a broad new historical data

set on public debt (in particular, central government debt), first presented in Reinhart and Rogoff

(2008, 2009b). Prior to this data set, it was exceedingly difficult to get more than two or three

decades of public debt data even for many rich countries, and virtually impossible for most

emerging markets. 3 Our results incorporate data on forty-four countries spanning about two

hundred years. Taken together, the data incorporate over 3,700 annual observations covering a

wide range of political systems, institutions, exchange rate and monetary arrangements, and

historic circumstances.


        We also employ more recent data on external debt, including both debt owed by

governments and by private entities. For emerging markets, we find that there exists a

significantly more severe threshold for total gross external debt (public and private) -- which

tends to be almost exclusively denominated in a foreign currency -- than for total public debt (the

domestically-issued component of which is largely denominated in home currency.) When gross

external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual growth declines by about two percent; for levels

of external debt in excess of 90 percent of GDP, growth rates are roughly cut in half. We are

not in a position to calculate separate total external debt thresholds (as opposed to public debt

thresholds) for advanced countries. The available time series is too recent, beginning only in

early 2000s as a byproduct of the International Monetary Fund efforts and creation of the Special

Savasatano (2003) and Jeanne and Guscina (2006), see the discussion in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b).

Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). We do note, however, that external debt levels in

advanced countries now average about 200 percent of GDP, with external debt levels being

particularly high across Europe.


         The focus of this paper is on the longer term macroeconomic implications of much higher

public and external debt. The final section, however, discusses the role of private domestic debt

examining the historical experience of the United States. We highlight episodes of private sector

deleveraging of debts, normal after a systemic financial crisis; not surprisingly, such episodes are

associated with very slow growth and deflation.


                            II. The Global 2007-2009 Buildup in Public Debt

         Figure 1 illustrates the increase in (inflation adjusted) public debt that has occurred since

2007. For the five countries with systemic financial crises (Iceland, Ireland, Spain, the United

Kingdom, and the United States), average debt levels are up by about 75 percent, well on track to

reach or surpass the three year 86 percent benchmark that Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a,b) find for

earlier deep post-war financial crises. Even in countries that have not experienced a major

financial crisis, debt rose an average of about 20 percent in real terms between 2007 and 2009.4

This general rise in public indebtedness stands in stark contrast to the 2003-2006 period of public

deleveraging in many countries and owes to direct bail-out costs in some countries, the adoption

of stimulus packages to deal with the global recession in many countries, and marked declines in

government revenues that have hit advanced and emerging market economies alike.




4
  Our focus on gross central government debt owes to the fact that time series of broader measures government are
not available for many countries. Of course, the true run-up in debt is significantly larger than stated here, at least
on a present value actuarial basis, due to the extensive government guarantees that have been conferred on the
financial sector in the crisis countries and elsewhere.

                                 III. Debt, Growth, and Inflation


        The simplest connection between public debt and growth is suggested by Robert Barro

(1979). Assuming taxes ultimately need to be raised to achieve debt sustainability, the

distortionary impact imply is likely to lower potential output. Of course, governments can also

tighten by reducing spending, which can also be contractionary. As for inflation, an obvious

connection stems from the fact that unanticipated high inflation can reduce the real cost of

servicing the debt. Of course, the efficacy of the inflation channel is quite sensitive to the

maturity structure of the debt. Whereas long-term nominal government debt is extremely

vulnerable to inflation, short term debt is far less so. Any government that attempts to inflate

away the real value of short term debt will soon find itself paying much higher interest rates.


       In principle, the manner in which debt builds up can be important. For example, war

debts are arguably less problematic for future growth and inflation than large debts that are

accumulated in peace time. Postwar growth tends to be high as war-time allocation of manpower

and resources funnels to the civilian economy. Moreover, high war-time government spending,

typically the cause of the debt buildup, comes to a natural close as peace returns. In contrast, a

peacetime debt explosion often reflects unstable underlying political economy dynamics that can

persist for very long periods.


       Here we will not attempt to discriminate the genesis of debt buildups, and instead simply

look at their connection to average and median growth and inflation outcomes. This may lead

us, if anything, to understate the adverse growth implications of debt burdens arising out of the

current crisis, which was clearly a peace time event.




                                                  6
A. Evidence from Advanced Countries


         Figure 2 presents a summary of inflation and GDP growth across varying levels of debt

for twenty advanced countries over the period 1946-2009. This group includes Australia,

Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan,

Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the

United States. The annual observations are grouped into four categories, according to the ratio

of debt-to GDP during that particular year as follows: years when debt to GDP levels were

below 30 percent (low debt); years where debt/GDP was 30 to 60 percent (medium debt); 60 to

90 percent (high); and above 90 percent (very high). 5 The bars in Figure 2 show average and

median GDP growth for each of the four debt categories. Note that of the 1186 annual

observations, there are a significant number in each category, including 96 above 90 percent.

(Recent observations in that top bracket come from Belgium, Greece, Italy, and Japan.) From

the figure, it is evident that there is no obvious link between debt and growth until public debt

reaches a threshold of 90 percent. The observations with debt to GDP over 90 percent have

median growth roughly 1 percent lower than the lower debt burden groups and mean levels of

growth almost 4 percent lower. (Using lagged debt should not dramatically change the picture.)

The line in Figure 2 plots the median inflation for the different debt groupings—which makes

plain that there is no apparent pattern of simultaneous rising inflation and debt. 6




5
  The four “buckets” encompassing low, medium-low, medium-high, and high debt levels are based on our
interpretation of much of the literature and policy discussion on what is considered low, high etc debt levels. It
parallels the World Bank country groupings according to four income groups. Sensitivity analysis involving a
different set of debt cutoffs merits exploration as do country-specific debt thresholds along the broad lines discussed
in Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003).

Notes: Central government debt is gross debt. The number of observations for the four debt groups are:
129 for debt/GDP below 30%; 59 for debt/GDP 30 to 60%; 23 observations for debt/GDP 60 to 90%; and
5 for debt/GDP above 90%, for a total of 216 observations.

       Table 1 provides detail on the growth experience for individual countries, but over a

much longer period, typically one to two centuries. Interestingly, introducing the longer time

series yields remarkably similar conclusions. Over the past two centuries, debt in excess of 90

percent has typically been associated with mean growth of 1.7 percent versus 3.7 percent when

debt is low (under 30 percent of GDP), and compared with growth rates of over 3 percent for the

two middle categories (debt between 30 and 90 percent of GDP). Of course, there is

considerable variation across the countries, with some countries such as Australia and New

Zealand experiencing no growth deterioration at very high debt levels. It is noteworthy,

however, that those high-growth high-debt observations are clustered in the years following

World War II.

B. Evidence from Emerging Market Countries


           We next perform the same debt ratio exercise for 24 emerging market economies for the

periods 1946-2009 and 1900-2009, using comparable central government debt data as we used

for the advanced economies. 7 Perhaps surprisingly, the results illustrated in Figure 4 and Table

2 for emerging markets largely repeat the results in Figure 2 and Table 1. For 1900-2009, for


7
  While we have pre-1900 inflation, real GDP, and public debt data for many emerging markets, nominal GDP data
is seldom available.

example, median and average GDP growth hovers around 4-4.5 percent for levels of debt below

90 percent of GDP but median growth falls markedly to 2.9 percent for high debt (above 90

percent); the decline is even greater for the average growth rate, which falls to 1 percent. With

much faster population growth than the advanced economies, the implications for per capita

GDP growth are in line (or worse) with those shown for advanced economies. The similarities

with advanced economies end there, as higher debt levels are associated with significantly higher

levels of inflation in emerging markets. Median inflation more than doubles (from less than 7

percent to 16 percent) as debt rises from the low (0 to 30 percent) range to above 90 percent. 8

Fiscal dominance is a plausible interpretation of this pattern.

C. External Debts


       Because emerging markets often depend so much on external borrowing, it is interesting

to look separately at thresholds for external debt (combined public and private). Combined

public and private sector debt is of interest because in the case of crisis, the distinction between

public and private often becomes blurred in a maze of bailouts, guarantees, and international

hard currency constraints (see Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009b).


       In Figure 5, we highlight the connection between for gross external debt as reported by

the World Bank and growth and inflation. As one can see, the growth thresholds for external

debt are considerably lower than for the thresholds for total public debt. Growth deteriorates

markedly at external debt levels over 60 percent, and further still when external debt levels

exceed 90 percent, which record outright declines. In light of this, it is more understandable that

over one half of all defaults on external debt in emerging markets since 1970 occurred at levels

of debt that would have met the Maastricht criteria of 60 percent or less. Inflation becomes

significantly higher only for the group of observations with external debt over 90 percent.

       As noted in the introduction, there is no comparable long time series on total external

debt for advanced countries; the relatively new IMF data set we use begins only in 2003.

Although we have no historical benchmarks for the advanced countries, the summary results in

Figure 6, based on 2003-2009 gross external debt as a percent of GDP, is indeed disconcerting.

The left hand panel of the figure indicates whether there has been an increase in indebtedness to

GDP over the 2003-09 period, or a decrease (deleveraging.). The right hand panel gives the

ratio of gross external debt to GDP as of the end of the second quarter of 2009. The group

averages are based on a total data set of 59 countries.

           As the right hand side of the figure illustrates, external debt burdens are particularly high

in Europe, with an average external debt to GDP ratio across advanced European economies of

over 200 percent, and an average external debt to GDP across emerging European economies

roughly 100 percent.9 (The fact that a sizable share of these debts are intra-European may or

may prove a significant mitigating factor.) Interestingly, the United States’ gross debt liabilities

are less than half of Europe’s as a share of GDP, despite the country’s epic sequence of trade

balance deficits. Japan, despite having a gross public debt to GDP ratio approaching 200

percent, has much smaller gross external liabilities still, thanks in no small part to Japan’s

famously strong home bias in bond holdings.


           Famously profligate Latin America, by contrast to the advanced economies, now has

gross external debt liabilities averaging only around 50 percent of GDP. Moreoever, in contrast

to the advanced countries who added an average of 50 percent of GDP to gross external debt

during the recent period, Latin American countries actually delivered external debt by over 30

percent of GDP.


           Of course, given the lack of sufficient long-dated historical data on advanced economies

external debts, it is not possible to know whether they face similar thresholds to emerging

markets. It is likely that the thresholds are higher for advanced economies that issue most

external debt in their own currency.




                                    IV. Private Sector Debt: An Illustration




9
    In effect, if Ireland is added to the list, the average for advanced European economies rises to 266 percent!.

                                                             20
         Our main focus has been on total public and total external debt, since reliable data on

private internal domestic debts are much scarcer across countries and time. We have shown that

public levels of debt/GDP that push the 90 percent threshold are associated with lower median

and average growth; for emerging markets there are even stricter thresholds for external debt

while growth thresholds for advanced economies remains an open question due to the fact only

very recent data is available.10


         These observations, however, present only a partial picture of the post-financial crisis

landscape, particularly for the years immediately following the crisis. Private debt, in contrast to

public debt, tends to shrink sharply for an extended period after a financial crisis. Just as a rapid

expansion in private credit fuels the boom phase of the cycle, so does serious deleveraging

exacerbate the post-crisis downturn. Just as a rapid expansion in private credit fuels the boom

phase of the cycle, so does serious deleveraging exacerbate the post-crisis downturn. This

pattern is illustrated in Figure 7, which shows the ratio of private debt to GDP for the United

States for 1916-2009. Periods of sharp deleveraging have followed periods of lower growth and

coincide with higher unemployment (as shown in the inset to the figure). In varying degrees,

the private sector (households and firms) in many other countries (notably both advanced and

emerging Europe) are also unwinding the debt built up during the boom years. Thus, private

deleveraging may be another legacy of the financial crisis that may dampen growth in the

medium term.




10
  It is important to note that post crises increases in public debt do not necessarily push economies in to the
vulnerable 90+ debt/GDP range.

                                                  V. Concluding Remarks

        The sharp run-up in public sector debt will likely prove one of the most enduring legacies

of the 2007-2009 financial crises in the United States and elsewhere. We examine the

experience of forty four countries spanning up to two centuries of data on central government

debt, inflation and growth. Our main finding is that across both advanced countries and

emerging markets, high debt/GDP levels (90 percent and above) are associated with notably

lower growth outcomes. In addition, for emerging markets, there appears to be a more stringent




                                                                    22
threshold for total external debt/GDP (60 percent), that is also associated with adverse outcomes

for growth. Seldom do countries simply “grow” their way out of deep debt burdens.


       Why are there thresholds in debt, and why 90 percent? This is an important question that

merits further research, but we would speculate that the phenomenon is closely linked to logic

underlying our earlier analysis of “debt intolerance” in Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003).

As we argued in that paper, debt thresholds are importantly country-specific and as such the four

broad debt groupings presented here merit further sensitivity analysis. A general result of our

“debt intolerance” analysis, however, highlights that as debt levels rise towards historical limits,

risk premia begin to rise sharply, facing highly indebted governments with difficult tradeoffs.

Even countries that are committed to fully repaying their debts are forced to dramatically tighten

fiscal policy in order to appear credible to investors and thereby reduce risk premia. The link

between indebtedness and the level and volatility of sovereign risk premia is an obvious topic

ripe for revisiting in light of the more comprehensive cross-country data on government debt.


       Of course, there are other vulnerabilities associated with debt buildups that depend on the

composition of the debt itself. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b, ch. 4) emphasize and numerous

models suggest, countries that choose to rely excessively on short term borrowing to fund

growing debt levels are particularly vulnerable to crises in confidence that can provoke very

sudden and “unexpected” financial crises. Similar statements could be made about foreign

versus domestic debt, as discussed. At the very minimum, this would suggest that traditional debt

management issues should be at the forefront of public policy concerns.


       Finally, we note that even aside from high and rising levels of public debt, many

advanced countries, particularly in Europe, are presently saddled with extraordinarily high levels



                                                 23
of total external debt, debt issued abroad by both the government and private entities. In the case

Europe, the advanced country average exceeds 200 percent external debt to GDP. Although we

do not have the long-dated time series needed to calculate advanced country external debt

thresholds as we do for emerging markets, current high external debt burdens would also seem to
