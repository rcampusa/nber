                   The Significance of Tax Law Asymmetries:
                          An Empirical Investigation

                                   ABSTRACT




     This study uses tax return data for U.S. nonfinancial corporations for

the period 1971-82 to estimate the importance of restrictions on the ability

of firms to use tax credits and to obtain refunds for tax losses. Our results

suggest that the incidence of such unused tax benefits increased substantially

during the early 1980s, though we do not find these increases attributable to

increased investment incentives during that period.

     Using estimates of a three-state (taxable, not taxable, partially

taxable) transition probability model, we calculate the effective tax rates on

various types of investments undertaken by firms differing with respect to tax

status. We confirm previous findings about the marginal tax rate on interest

payments, and that it is important to distinguish current tax payments from

marginal tax rates in estimating the incentive to invest.

1.   Introduction

     The asymmetric treatment of gains and losses by the corporate income tax

has figured prominently in many areas of research about the effects of

taxation on firm behavior. One theory of capital structure has focused on the

limited deductibility of marginal interest payments to explain the existence

of optimal interior debt-equity ratios (DeAngelo and Masulis 1980). Another

area of research has considered the impact of the limited loss offset

mechanism on the cost of capital and investment incentives (Auerbach 1983,

1986, Cooper and Franks 1983, Majd and Myers 1985, Mayer 1986, Mintz 1985).

Yet another line of research has focused on the incentives to transfer

unusable tax benefits through leasing (Warren and Auerbach 1982) or merging

(Auerbach and Reishus 1987).

     The recent tax reform process in the U.S. has paid particular attention

to this characteristic of the tax code, without any consistent view emerging

about the appropriate treatment of tax losses. Legislation in 1981

liberalized the treatment of leasing to obtain tax benefits, but this

provision was repealed in 1982. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduces the

ability of firms to transfer tax benefits through merger activity, and applies

a corporate minimum tax to firms whose losses were attributable to various

deviations of taxable income from book income.

     When considering the impact of the asymmetric treatment of tax losses,

and the reform of such provisions, it is important to have a sense of their

quantitative importance. Few studies have provided empirical estimates of the

importance of unused tax benefits in the economy. A primary reason is the
                                         —2—


 lack of data on the tax status of individual corporations. One exception is

 Cordes and Sheffrin (1983), who, using confidential data on the tax returns of

corporations for a single year, estimated the average effective marginal tax

 rate at which corporate interest payments could be deducted. Auerbach and

Poterba (1987b) estimated the size and distribution of tax loss carryforwards

and their impact on investment incentives using data collected from the annual

reports of several hundred large corporations representing a significant

fraction of the value of the corporate sector. However, they conclude on the

basis of indirect evidence that they may have seriously underestimated the

magnitude of aggregate tax loss carryforwards.

     The current study extends these previous efforts in several important

ways. Like Cordes and Sheffrin, we use confidential tax return data available

from the U.S. Treasury. However, our sample is a panel of firms over the

period 1971-1982, rather than a single year's cross-section. This is an

important difference, since the effective marginal tax rate for a firm in a

given year depends on its status in previous and subsequent years. A firm

with a current loss could be fully taxable at the margin, for example, because

of its ability to offset the loss against previous gains.   Following Auerbach

and Poterba, we estimate the quantitative importance of tax losses and their

impact on the incentive to invest. However, we also consider the additional

effects of the limitations on the use of investment and foreign tax credits by

taxable firms. Such credit limitations appear to affect many more firms than

does the inability to deduct losses, so their inclusion in the analysis is

important if one is to gain an accurate understanding of the effects of tax

law asymmetries on corporate behavior.

     The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief

discussion of the relevant U.S. tax law. Section 3 describes the data that

formed the basis for our analysis. Next, section 4 presents aggregate and

industry statistics on the importance of loss and credit limitations. Section

5 presents a general algorithm for using a three-state, second-order

transition model for the tax status of the firm to estimate effective marginal

tax rates. Section 6 presents estimates of such a model and the effective

marginal tax rate distribution they imply. Section 7 discusses the effects of

tax constraints on the incentive for corporate investment, and Section 8

offers concluding comments and suggestions for future research in this area.



2.   Constraints on the Use of Tax Benefits

     The corporate tax in the U.S. is essentially a flat rate tax on taxable

income.1 Like most other countries, however, the U.S. does not provide

corporations with a "full loss offset" that would treat positive and negative

tax bases symmetrically. Instead, it imposes a different set of provisions

for firms with negative taxable income. Moreover, it does not allow a full

use of tax credits applicable to taxes payable even for firms which have

positive taxable income before credits.

     Corporations calculate their taxes payable in two stages. They first

estimate taxes due before credits, and then apply credits to reduce taxes as

allowed. The constraint on losses applies at the former stage, before credits

are considered. Only after the effect of this constraint has been calculated

do credits, and constraints on credits, enter the tax computation.
                                         -4-


A.       Losses

         In a given tax year, a firm calculates its taxable income before credits.

If it is positive, no loss constraints apply and it goes on to the credit

calculation. If it is negative, it must "carry" the loss "back" (to an

earlier year) or "forward" (to a subsequent year). Carrying back entails

recomputing the tax return of at least one of the previous three years,

beginning with the earliest of the three, deducting the current loss from the

previous years' taxable income. Thus, if the current loss is smaller in

absolute value than the carryback potential of the previous three years, the

firm can carry all current losses back. At the margin, an additional dollar

of losses would also be carried back, with the firm obtaining an additional

tax refund at the statutory corporate tax rate.

        If the firm cannot carry all its current losses back, it must carry them

forward. In each of the next fifteen years (changed from five by the Economic

Recovery Tax Act of 1981) that its taxable income is positive, it may deduct

the losses until either losses or income are exhausted. The disadvantage of

carrying losses forward is that they are carried with zero nominal interest

and may expire.

        For the firm with losses in more than one year, the calculation for the

second loss (and subsequent ones) follows in the same manner, with the second

loss "stacked" after the first. Carrying back is figured net of previous

losses carried back, and net operating loss deductions induced by losses

carried forward are based on income net of those generated by the earlier

loss.

        Finally, firms are not required to carry losses back. In any year in

which losses occur, the firm may choose either not to carry back, or to carry
                                        —5-


back to the previous three years. It may not carry back selectively to one or

two of the previous three years. Choosing to carry forward could be optimal

for carrying losses back could displace previously taken investment tax

credits. If these credits, in turn, had already been carried forward, they

might expire upon being displaced.


B.   Credits

     Firms with taxable income before credits have no losses carried forward.

But many have excess credits, and this influences their marginal tax rate.

The two primary tax credits received by corporations are the foreign tax

credit and the investment tax credit.

     The rules governing the foreign tax credit are quite complex, and became

more so with the enactment of the 1986 Act. The basic approach is to require

firms to add repatriated foreign income to domestic income in the computation

of taxable income and then permit a credit for foreign taxes paid on the

foreign source income, against U.S. taxes on that income. Firms with positive

worldwide taxable income will be unable to use all such credits for one of two

reasons:

     (1) the effective foreign tax rate is higher than the U.S. rate, so that

           the U.S. tax liability on foreign source income is exhausted by the

           credits,

     (2) the firm has domestic losses; in this case, the firm may only use

           foreign tax credits to offset the tax on its worldwide income, i.e.,

           its foreign source income net of domestic losses.

These two cases have fundamentally different implications. In case (1), an
                                      -6-


additional dollar of domestic income is fully taxable, so that the foreign tax

credit carryforwards are irrelevant for our purposes. In the second case, a

reduction in domestic losses would have no effect on tax payments,

simply reducing the foreign tax credits being carried forward. Hence, firms

with domestic loses but positive total income are in a tax position quite

similar to firms with net losses, paying no taxes and carrying forward foreign

tax credits rather than losses.

     After foreign tax credits have been subtracted, firms compute their

investment tax credits. (The ITC was repealed in 1986 but was in place

throughout our sample period.)

     Until 1986, firms could offset all taxes up to 25,000 dollars and 85

percent of all taxes in excess of 25,000 dollars with investment tax credits.

Before 1978, the percentage was 50 percent. Were there no such limitation,

unused credits could simply be combined with tax losses in calculating the

firm's tax position, as in the second foreign tax credit example. With the

credit limit, a firm with taxable income but facing credit constraints was

effectively taxed at a low positive rate on its marginal income, since the

addition of more income allowed it to increase the credits that it uses.

     Since investment tax credits were calculated after losses for foreign tax

credits had been subtracted from taxable income, firms with substantial

current domestic income could be credit constrained if loss and foreign tax

credit carryforward from earlier years were used to offset this income.

Moreover, as mentioned above, a firm could displace credits it had already

used if a subsequent loss were carried back to the current year, reducing

allowable credits. Credits then had to be carried back or carried forward,

even though they were allowable on the firm's initial tax return for the year.

C.   Summary

     Figure 1 (which is very similar to one presented by Majd and Myers 1985)

pictures the tax function for a typical firm, ignoring the ability of firms to

carry losses and credits back. Current domestic income is on the horizontal

axis. The tax on that income is on the vertical axis. The firm will be in

one of three regimes. If its tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits

(current and carried forward) exceed current taxable income, it pays no taxes.

This occurs in the example if its domestic income is less than V1. We refer

to this situation as state 1.   In state 1, firms carry foreign tax credits

and/or losses forward. If Y>V1, the firm pays taxes, but unless Y>Y, it

cannot use up all of its accumulated investment tax credits. We refer to this

intermediate regime as state 2. The fully taxable regime, where no investment

tax credits are carried forward, is referred to as state 0.

     The current marginal tax rate (i.e., the derivative of current taxes with

respect to current income in these three states) is 0, T(1-a), and T,

respectively, where a is the percent of taxes that investment tax credits may

offset. However, there are additional effects on future (and previous) taxes

that cause the effective marginal tax rates to differ from these values.

These are discussed in section 4.



3.   Data

     The data set employed in this project comes from the Treasury Department

Corporate Tax Model. The Treasury data set consists of thirteen annual

samples of corporate tax returns for the years 1970-82. We omit financial

companies because of their different tax rules.2 Because there are many
                                     -8-


missing observations for 1970, we limit our consideration to the period

beginning in 1971. Likewise, we ignore firms with assets under 10 million

dollars in 1982 because such firms are intentionally incompletely sampled at

source and account for only a trivial fraction of nonfinancial corporate

assets (about 3 percent).

     By combining the annual samples, we are able to create a twelve-year

panel of corporate tax returns. As discussed above, a firm's marginal tax

rate depends not only on its current tax status but also its future and past

ones, so such a data set is necessary to perform such calculations. Indeed,

because of data limitations the firm's current state itself can often only be

inferred by looking at several years of data simultaneously. Unfortunately,

the attrition caused by requiring that there be no missing observations

between 1971 and 1982 is significant. From a sample of 15,575 firms present

in our 1982 sample, only 2,808 have complete data for 1971—82. This attrition

is strongly related to size, as over half of all nonfinancial corporate assets

are accounted for by firms in the panel. (The attrition is not due solely or

even primarily to births or deaths of firms. In a large fraction of the

cases, for example, firms with missing data have data in noncontiguous years.)

Our approach, therefore, is to use the smaller panel data set for calculations

requiring such data and then impute values of calculated variables for the

remainder of the annual samples for the years 1980, 1981 and 1982. The

imputation includes a correction for sample selection bias.

     Classified by industry, the 1971—82 panel includes 23 firms in

Agriculture, 89 in Mining, 103 in Construction, 1533 in Manufacturing, 361 in

Transportation, 545 in Trade and 154 in Services. As measured by book assets
                                       -9-


(the only size measure available to us), this represents 61 percent of the

universe for Manufacturing, 49 percent for Mining, and 76 percent for

Transportation. For the remaining industries, however, the sampling is

considerably worse: 24 percent for Trade, 19 percent for Services, 15 percent

for Construction, and 4 percent for Agriculture. Overall, the firms in our

sample account for 53 percent of the universe of nonfinancial corporate book

assets, and a somewhat larger percentage of those in the universe of firms

with assets over 10 million dollars.

     The Treasury model is built primarily from the Annual IRS Statistics of

Income Corporation File. A subset of the income, tax and balance sheet items

reported by each corporation on its annual federal income tax return (form

1120) are recorded each year.   For our purposes, however, the data possess

certain limitations. First, they do not contain revised tax returns that were

filed in cases where firms carried back losses or credits. Second,

corporations are not required to report the magnitude of losses carried

forward, only those deducted in a given year. Together, these limitations

prevent immediate inference of the loss carryforward or loss carryback that

each firm has in a given year. These variables are of interest in their own

right, and are also necessary for the calculation of effective marginal tax

rates. For example, a firm reporting negative taxable income could be

carrying losses back, or carrying them forward, or both. In the first of

these cases, it would be fully taxable on marginal income, while in the second

and third cases it would pay no additional taxes.

     To correct this omission, we employ an algorithm to simulate the

evolution of each firm's tax status, comprising its tax loss carryforward
                                     -10-


stock and its potential for carrying back. The algorithm, which is described

in more detail in Appendix A, uses the period 1971-75 as a base period from

which to derive initial conditions which are updated according to each

subsequent tax return. In some cases, no special assumptions are necessary.

For example, a firm with taxable income and no net operating loss deduction in

1973, 1974 and 1975 begins in 1976 with no loss carryforward and the carryback

potential equal to the previous three years' income. In other cases, however,

some assumption about years before 1971 is necessary. For example, if the

firm had income without loss deductions in 1971 and 1972, followed by three

consecutive years of losses, one cannot know how much of these losses were

carried back without knowing the carryback potential offered by taxable income

in 1970. In this case, we assume that 1970 offered no such potential,

although we did experiment with other assumptions.

     In all, we classified firms into one of four mutually exclusive

categories based on tax data for 1971-75, using assumptions about earlier

years where necessary to generate 1976 initial conditions. Varying our

assumptions about earlier tax years did not appear to exert a significant

impact on our results.

     Once each firm's 1975 carryforward/carryback potential has been

established, the algorithm takes reported taxable income in each subsequent

year and updates the firm's tax status. Accurate calculation required

incorporation of relevant tax code changes, such as the extension in 1981 from

five to fifteen years of the maximum period for all tax loss carryforwards

then on the books (dating back to 1976) and the extension in the same year of

the period for all credit carryforwards (dating back to 1974), also to fifteen

years.
                                     —11—


     A second tax code change concerns the rules governing carrying back.

Since 1976, firms with net operating losses have had the option of

relinquishing the entire carryback period. As discussed above, the major

factor motivating firms to eschew carrying back is the potential displacement

of investment tax credits whose use could then be jeopardized. Determining

whether firms face this situation requires the integration of data on

investment tax credits, credit limitations and investment tax credit

carryforward vintages with the data on losses and taxable income. Due to the

complexity of doing this, we experimented with different simple behavioral

assumptions about when firms choose to carry back. The two that seemed to

perform best were that firms always carry back when possible, or carry back

only if they were unconstrained in each of the three preceding years. For

each firm, we simulated the path of tax payments and net operating loss

deductions for 1976-82 deriving from these two alternative behavioral

assumptions, and chose the method that minimized the sum of absolute

deviations of predicted from actual net operating loss deductions for that

firm. Of the 2,808 firms, 178 were estimated to use the first method (always

carry back) and 65 the second method (carry back only into years without loss

or credit constraints on the initial tax returns). The remaining 2,565 firms,

many of which never had any losses, gave the same results under each

assumption.

     Unlike loss carryforwards, investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards are

reported on corporate tax returns. Thus, we know immediately whether the

firms faced limitations on the use of credits in each year.3 While we do not

observe foreign tax credits carried forward, we can identify those firms
                                       —12—


carrying them forward because of domestic losses. These are firms who offset

all of their taxes before credits with foreign tax credits.

     In the aggregate, our simulations track the net operating losses of

individual firms quite well. There are persistent errors in some cases,

however, leading to an underprediction rate averaging about 6 percent per year

with no obvious trend.

     There are many possible explanations for this underprediction.      Many of

the NOL deductions we miss appear to come from firms which continually report

loss deductions far below their taxable income. Normally, this should not

happen in consecutive years. A small NOL deduction in one year should

indicate that the stock of carryforwards has been exhausted, and our algorithm

is structured to assume this. One possible reason for the observed pattern is

the presence of firms whose records consolidate the returns of several

subsidiaries, some with losses and some with taxable inconie. A second cause

could be the acquisition of firms with tax losses. Our information does not

allow us to determine the relative importance of these potential sources of

observed prediction errors. A third source of error is our algorithm, which

assumes that firms follow a fairly simple decision rule about whether to carry

losses back. As we already indicated, one could, in theory, use information

on the size of taxable income and tax credits in each year to determine a more

complicated decision rule, but this would be a difficult procedure to

implement. This underprediction of net operating loss deductions suggests

that we will slightly underpredict the value of tax losses carried forward, as

well. This is worth keeping in mind when we present our estimates for tax

loss carryforwards in the aggregate.

4.   The Importance of Tax Constraints

     Table 1 presents the results of our calculations for 1976—82. The top

panel shows the unweighted fraction of the firms in our sample facing no

constraints ("taxable"), loss and credit constraints ("nontaxable"), and

taxable but facing credit constraints ("credit constrained"). As above, we

refer to these as states 0, 1 and 2, respectively. State 1 includes those

firms that report positive taxable income before tax credits but offset all

taxes with foreign tax credits. The fraction of the sample in this subregime

is listed in parentheses next to the state 1 sample fraction. Fairly stable

for the period 1976—80, the fraction of firms in the nontaxable state did fall

somewhat during the expansion of the late 1970s and increase in the recession

year 1980. It then rose noticeably in 1981 and especially in 1982. Note

that, except in recent years, a greater fraction of the sample firms were in

state 2 than state 1, emphasizing the importance of taking credit constraints

into account. The fraction of firms with negative taxable income that carry

losses forward, and hence are in state 1, ranges between .52 and .60,

suggesting that the opportunity to carry losses back is also important.

     The results change markedly once one weights by firm asset size. Until

1981, the weighted percentage of firms in state 1 is well below the unweighted

percentage, meaning that losses were concentrated among smaller firms.

However, this pattern changes in 1981, and by 1982 over 22 percent of the

sample assets are held by nontaxable firms.4 Another significant effect of

weighting is the increased importance of foreign tax credits as a cause of

firms being nontaxable. In the 1980s, over 5 percent of the firms (asset

weighted) have positive taxable income before foreign tax credits but pay no
                                     -14-


taxes at all. The most significant effect of weighting, however, is on the

size of the state 2 population. Once weighted by assets, the fraction of

firms that pay taxes and have ITC carryforwards increases to a range of

between 27 and 35 percent.

     As discussed above, firm size is a major factor explaining inclusion in

our data panel. Since size is also related to firm tax status, the results

for the sample are not necessarily representative of those for the universe of

nonfinancial corporations. Therefore, we impute values of the tax loss

carryforward for the remaining nonfinancial corporations with assets over 10

million dollars for each of the years 1980, 1981 and 1982, and use the imputed

values, along with information on foreign and investment tax credits, to

classify firms by state. Because unexplained variation in attrition may be

correlated with tax losses, we include a correction for sample selection bias,

following Heckman (1979). To minimize attrition from the panel, we base our

1980 and 1981 imputations on panels of firms with complete data through 1980

and 1981, respectively. Further details are provided in Appendix B.

     The last panel in Table 1 gives the resulting estimates for universe

population fractions for each state, weighted by assets, for the years

1980-82. The results do confirm our prediction that losses are more prevalent

in the universe than in our panel, but the differences in fractions are small.

     The results in Table 1 lead to a number of important conclusions. First,

the number of nontaxable firms increased markedly in the early 1980s. Second,

the distribution of unused tax losses, foreign tax credits and investment tax

credits is strongly related to firm size. Finally, by 1982 about half the

nonfinancial corporate assets were held by firms that were not fully taxable.
                                     - 15-


     Though the picture emerges that losses alone affected a relatively small

minority of firms, even in 1981 and 1982, the incidence of losses is not

spread evenly across different industries. This is demonstrated in Table 2,

which gives the asset-weighted universe calculations for 1980-82 corresponding

to the aggregate statistics in the last panel of Table 1, repeated at the top

of Table 2. The manufacturing firms in our sample are slightly more likely to

have experienced losses than other firms, but also more likely to be fully

taxable. The oil industry was less likely to be nontaxable, during this

period, while the other three industries experience was quite different. By

1982, only between 13 and 21 percent of the assets in Airlines, Railroads and

Steel were held by firms not carrying forward losses or credits.

     Having explored the pervasiveness of constraints on tax losses and

credits, for the nonfinancial corporate universe, we turn next to an

evaluation of the overall magnitude of these unused tax benefits.

     The results of our calculations are presented in Table 3. Also presented

are estimates of end-of-year investment tax credit carryforwards, provided by

the Statistics of Income Corporation Tax Returns volumes. We present three

sets of estimates of tax losses. Those in parentheses are for firms in the

1971-80 panel, and are provided to indicate the trend in losses through 1980.

Clearly, losses were increasing in importance even as the economy improved

through the late 1970s, and jumped in the recession year of 1980.

     The column labelled "no correction" gives estimated loss carryforwards

for the universe of nonfinancial corporations (above 10 million in assets)

with values imputed for firms not in the panel but without any correction for

sample selection bias. The third column give universe estimates that
                                         -16-


 incorporate such a correction, which is extremely important for 1981 and 1982.

 Other evidence supports the explosion in tax losses depicted here.    Using

 published aggregate statistics, one can determine the current losses of the

 nonfinancial corporate sector. By subtracting from these the losses carried

 back (which are available only for the corporate sector as a whole, and hence

 slightly overstated), one obtains an estimate of the flow added to the stock

of losses carried forward. This is an absolute lower bound on the stock

 itself. For the years 1980, 1981, and 1982, this lower bound is 36.6 billion

dollars, 51.1 billion dollars, and 75.6 billion dollars, respectively,5

suggesting that even our corrected numbers are too low for 1980 and, perhaps,

1982.

        Since the revenue cost of tax deductions is obtained by multiplying these

deductions by the corporate tax rate, which was .46 during this period, we may

conclude that the value of tax losses being carried forward exceeded that of

unused investment tax credits in the early 1980s, as the combined stock of

carryforwards grew to a level that in 1982 exceeded annual corporate tax

collections.

        In concluding our discussion of the numbers in Table 3, we note how much

the stocks of carryforwards have risen in recent years relative to the

fraction of the corporate population facing constraints. This suggests that

the importance of the problem facing constrained firms may have increased, in

that firms may be less likely to work of f such large accumulated tax losses

and credits over a short period.     We now develop a methodology for estimating

the impact of prolonged presence in a tax constrained state.

5.   A Model of Tax Status Transitions

     In order to estimate the effective marginal tax rate that a firm faces in

a given year, information is necessary not only about its current state, but

also the prospective future ones. A firm in state 1 (nontaxable) this year

clearly has a zero current marginal tax rate on additional income, but this

understates the present value of taxes associated with that income, since the

income will reduce losses carried forward and result in an increase in tax

payments in the year that the firm exhausts its loss carryforwards and resumes

payment of taxes. On the other hand, the current tax on a taxable firm's

marginal income overstates the present value of taxes associated with that

income, since the increased tax also increases the potential f or carrying back

future losses to offset the tax. The extent of these adjustments for future

taxes depends on the transition patterns among the three states defined above

(taxable, nontaxable, credit constrained). For example, if firms move quickly

out of the nontaxable state, the effective marginal tax rate may be close to

the statutory rate.

     To estimate such transition patterns in a short panel such as the one we

have, one can assume that the evolution of the firm's state is determined by a

low order stochastic process. Using a two-state model (which grouped together

fully taxable and credit constrained firms) Auerbach andPoterba (1987a) found

that a first-order transition process could be statistically rejected in favor

of a second-order process, where the current transition probabilities depend

on the current and previous year's state.

     The rejection of a first-order process is not surprising, since one would

expect heterogeneity among firms in a given state relating to the length of
                                        -18-


time spent in that state. Being nontaxable for a long time may indicate that

the firm began with a very large tax loss carryforward which made transitions

unlikely, or that the firm has had continually poor performance. Either of

these explanations would predict that firms would be more likely to remain

nontaxable if they had been so for the past two years rather than just the

most recent year, which is what Auerbach and Poterba found. Their solution

was to model transitions as a second-order process, which can be extended in

the current three state model.

     Once the model has been estimated, it can be used to estimate effective

marginal tax rates for firms in different states regarding current tax status.

Under the assumption that the estimated transition probabilities apply to the

representative, optimizing firm, we may use them to estimate the path that a

marginal accrued tax liabilility would take starting from any initial state.

Doing so leads to the computation of "shadow" values of future tax liabilities

associated with current tax accruals.

     This approach of using transition model estimates to calculate shadow

values was developed by Auerbach and Poterba, but the current extension

involves substantial complication, not only because there are more states to

consider, but also because the source of a change in accrued tax liability

(ordinary income or tax credits) matters once the separate constraint on

credits is included in the analysis.

     We begin with some notation. Let ijk be the probability that a firm now

in state j, and in state i during the previous year, will move to state k next

year. For simplicity, we may also refer to the current state as ii and next

year's state as jk. Let a be the fraction of taxes, before credits but after
                                     -19-


accounting for loss carryforwards and carrybacks, that by law may be offset by

credits, credit carrybacks and credit carryforwards.

    Three general comments are in order before discussing the derivation of

the shadow values from estimates of ijk• First, as already mentioned, the

shadow values will differ according to whether the marginal income change is

associated with ordinary income or credits. Second, the state the firm was in

during the previous year will affect the current shadow value, given this

year's state, because future transition probabilities depend on both years'

states in the second—order transition model. Third, the shadow values to be

derived apply symmetrically to positive and negative marginal tax changes. If

we wish to trace through the impact of a change in tax credits accrued today,

it doesn't matter whether this change is positive or negative. For example,

if the firm is carrying credits forward, an increase in credits will increase

the stock carried forward and reduce the tax payments when the firm reaches

state 0; a decrease in credits will reduce the carryforward and increase taxes

by the same amount in state 0. The key is that we are concentrating on

marginal changes that do not affect the transition probabilities themselves.

     Consider now the shadow values of tax payments accrued by a firm in a

state in which the taxes must be carried forward. For tax credits, this is

states 1 and 2, since an increase (decrease) in tax credits in either state

simply increases (decreases) the stock of credits being carried forward.

These marginal credits will affect the firm's tax liability only when it

reaches state 0 and is fully taxable at the margin.

     Let PRC(t) be the probability that the firm starting in state ij

(j=1,2) first enters state 0 from state 1 and after t years. PRC(t) is

the probability that it first enters state 0 from state 2 and in year t. The

derivation of these "probabilities of becoming taxable" is discussed below.
                                      -20—


Letting IC be the maximum number of years that credits may be carried forward,

we obtain the following expression for the shadow value of credits accrued in

state ij:


(1)         wc.. =                       +
                     Et(PRC(t)(1_vc10)       PRC(t)(1-vc20)]   (1=0,1,2; j1,2)


where    is the nominal, after-tax discount factor and vc10 is the shadow value

that a change in tax credits has in state 10 in terms of the change in

subsequent carryback potential. These terms appear because the use of the

accrued credits will offset income that could, potentially, have permitted a

carryback of subsequent losses or excess credits. The year limit IC appears

since a change in credits carried forward will have no impact if credits at

the margin expire anyway.6

      A change in ordinary tax liability (i.e., taxes before credits) will, as

with a change in credits, be charged immediately if it occurs in state 0 and

carried forward if occurring in state 1. In state 2, however, it will affect

both current taxes and tax credits carried forward. A decline of one dollar

of ordinary tax liability will force the firm to use a fewer dollars of tax

credits. Hence, we may view a reduction in tax liability as being partially

realized (at rate 1-a) with the rest (a) being "converted" to credit

carryforwards. An increase in tax liability works symmetrically, with credit

carryforwards being reduced but some tax paid.

      Letting PR(t) be the probability of a firm starting in state ii first

leaving state 1 in year t and into state 0, and PR(t) be the probability

of the same firm first leaving state 1 in year t and into state 2, we may

express the shadow value of a dollar of ordinary taxes accrued in state ii as:
                                      —21—




(2)        w. =
                  titt)       (1-v10)+PR(t)(awc12+(1-a)(1-v12)]}    (i=O,1,2)



where I is the number of years that losses can be carried forward and v is

the shadow value of ordinary tax payments in state ii.

      Next, consider the shadow values v and vc13. In computing them, we

note that firms are permitted to carry losses and credits back three years.

As discussed above, firms have had the option since 1976 of not carrying

losses back. Initially, however, we will assume that losses are always

carried back when this is possible. If firms follow this policy, then a

firm's presence in state I or state 2 means it has already exhausted its

ability to carry back losses or credits, respectively.

      The shadow values vc10 are associated with credits used in state iO

(i=O,1,2). A decrease in credits will permit additional carrying back of

losses or credits in the first year of the following three that the firm

passes into state 1 or state 2. These credits will then not be carried

forward. If the firm passes into state 2, a credit that otherwise would have

been carried forward can be carried back. If it passes into state 1, then it

will reduce the current credits displaced and carried forward when the losses

were carried back from state 1. However, it is possible that no such

displaced credits were carried forward. When losses carried back displace

previous credits, the firm may, in turn, carry these credits back another

three years. This is not possible for the firm in state 10 or 20, for it came

into the current year facing credit constraints. However, some firms in state

00 might have had sufficient capacity to carry back every displaced credit,

making the reduction in such displacement valueless. For simplicity, we
                                           —22—


assume this to be the case for all firms in state 00. Thus, we may express

the shadow values associated with credits as:


 (3.a)        vc10 =
                        (p.01+2P.00p001+3p.00p000p001)(1-wc01)
                        +                                                 (i=1,2)



(3.b)         vc00 =    (1+p000+2Pg00)p002(1-wc02)

         We next consider the shadow value of ordinary tax payments that the firm

makes in state 0. These can have value if the firm moves into state 1 or 2 in

the next three years. In addition, if the firm passes into state 2 and then

state 1 within the three year period, it first carries back credits to offset

a of the additional income, and then carries back losses offsetting all of the

income but displacing credits initially carried back. Taking all these

possibilities into account, we have:


(4) v10 = (P01(1—w01)+ap102(1-wc02)]

              +

              +
                  3P100p000[p001U-w01)+ap002(1-wc02)]
                  +
                      (P02P022P221+P00p002p021)((1—w21)—a(1—wc21)]
                  +
                      p102p020p201101101)]}                            (i=O, 1,2)


     An extra dollar of taxes paid in state 2 is the result of an increase in

tax liability before credits of 11(1-a) dollars and an increase in tax credits

of a/(1-a) dollars. A carryback to this state can occur only from state 1. If

it does, it will offset the taxes before credits and displace the credits.

Thus, we have:
                                             —23-


(5)   (1—a)v12

                  *1 (1—w21)—a(1—wc21)]

                  +                                                   (i=O,1,2)
                      3P122P220P20i+P20P200P001][(1—w01)-a(1—wc01)]

This completes the specification of the shadow values. To obtain a system of

equations for the shadow prices in terms of the transition probabilities

alone, however, it is necessary to express the "probabilities until taxable"

PR and PRC in terms of the transition probabilities p. This may be done

recursively, with initial conditions determined by the firm's initial state.

We briefly sketch the procedure. In year 1, we have (suppressing the

superscripts on PR and PRC):


(6)         PRCko(1) =   0P00   +             +                         (k=1,2)


where q13=1 if ij is the firm's initial state (indicated by the superscript of

PRC) and 0 otherwise. Defining the auxiliary probability PRCkm(t) as the

probability of the firm going from state k to state m in year t without having

passed through state 0 between date 0 and date t-1, we have, for year 1:


(7)        PRCkm(l) =           +             +                       (k,m=1,2)

For t >   1, we then have the recursive expression starting with the year 1 values
defined in (6) and (7):


           PRCkm(t) =                    +                            (k,m=1,2)
(8)
                         PRClk(tl)Plkm       PRC2k(tl)P2km

      For the probabilities PR, we have in period 1 (once again suppressing

superscripts):
                                        —24—


                                +       +                               (k=0,2)
(9)         PR1k(l) =   01P01

where, again, the state indicator       equals 1 if and only if the firm's

initial state is ij, and zero otherwise.

       Note that the probability of continuing in state 1 through year 1 is:


(10)        PR11(1) = q01p011 + q11p111 +


For t > 1, we have the recursive expression starting with the year 1 value

defined in (10):


(11)        PR1k(t) =   PR11(t—l)pllk                                 (i=0.l,2)


       Expressions (6)-(11) provide solutions for the vectors PR and PRC in

terms of the transitions probabilities p. as was desired. Thereafter, we have

a system of 18 linear equations ((1)—(5)) in 18 unknown shadow values (v0,

v12, vc10, w11, wc1 wc, i=0,1,2). Though tedious, the solution is

straightforward.

       The algorithm developed thus far is based on the assumption that firms

always carry back losses and credits where possible. As indicated above,

however, we also consider the possibility that a firm carries back only when

it faced no constraints during the prior three years. This would change

expressions (3)-(5) for the shadow values of tax payments. The alternative

versions of these expressions are derived in Appendix C.

6.   Transition Probabilities and Marginal Tax Rates

     In this section of the paper, we present second-order transition

probabilities for the three-state model developed above, estimated from our

1971-82 panel of firms taken from the Treasury tax model. We then use the

shadow value algorithm developed in the previous section to estimate the

shadow values of tax payments and loss and credit carryforwards. These shadow

values have several useful applications, of which we demonstrate two. First,

we estimate the average effective marginal tax rate at which firms deduct

interest payments. Then, in section 7, we estimate the effective tax rates

that firms in different initial states face on marginal investment projects

with different real and tax attributes.

     Table 4 presents estimates of the transitions matrix for the 1971—82

panel of firms for the full sample period (1976-82). Though estimates using

firms weighted by asset size are presented, those based on the unweighted

sample were similar.

     As suggested above, a first-order transition process is unlikely to be

very accurate in predicting the movement of firms across states. For example,

a firm in state 00 is much more likely to stay in state 0 than firms in states

10 and 20. This is to be expected, since presence in state 0 for two

successive years indicates more "distance from the constrained state. A

somewhat different persistence pattern is observed for firms in states 1 and

2. For each state, a firm that has been in that state for two years is more

likely to persist in that state than a firm that previously entered that state

from state 0. That is, P111 > P011 and P222 > P022.      However, P122 > P222 and

     >           suggesting that there may be substantial mobility among the
         P011,
                                     -26-


constrained states I. and 2. Once again, this confirms the importance of

considering state 2 distinctly rather than grouping taxable credit-constrained

firms with those in state 0.

     The table indicates a fair degree of persistence in state 0. Over 80

percent of all firms unconstrained for at least two years could be expected to

remain so for another year. There is also a lot of persistence in state 1.

Again nearly 80 percent of the firms not taxable for at least two years are

not taxable for at least one more year. The estimates suggest presence in

state 2 is somewhat less long-lived, as one might expect given its

intermediate position between taxable and not taxable. In general, firms that

transited to or from state 0 in the previous year are more likely to transit

again than those in the current state for at least two years. Indeed, firms

in state 02 are more likely to return to state 0 than they are to stay in

state 2, confirming the view that there is less "permanence" about this state.

     The transition probabilities in Table 4 may now be incorporated into the

shadow pricing algorithm presented in the previous section to derive shadow

prices of tax payments and carryforwards in different states. The

calculations apply to a representative firm facing the transition matrix in

every year. As we have discussed, there is substantial heterogenity in the

sample with respect to the incidence of tax constraints, and the transition

probabilities change over time. Taking full account of these variations would

involve the use of imprecisely estimated transition probabilities (based in

many cells on very small samples) and a substantially more sophisticated model

than the already complex one introduced in the last section. Calculations

based on sample averages are still quite useful in determining the overall

impact of tax status transitions.
                                     —27-


     Table 5 presents the shadow values estimated for the 1982 tax rules under

the assumption that firms always choose to carry back losses when possible.8

We assume a nominal after—tax discount rate (1/-1) of 7 percent. The first

two columns present shadow values for tax payments associated with the

potential carrybacks facilitated. These act to reduce the effective marginal

tax rates for taxable firms. The last two columns give the shadow values for

firms not paying the accrued taxes, indicating the present value of each

dollar of these taxes that is carried forward. Not every cell in the table

has an entry. There are no taxes carried forward from state 0, and no taxes

paid -in state 1. State 2 is a hybrid, since credits are carried forward but

the firm does pay some taxes on ordinary income.

     As one would expect, the shadow value for ordinary tax payments made in

state 0 is smallest in state 00, and largest in state 10. That is because the

firm in state 10 is more likely to return to a constrained state and benefit

from the ability to carry losses or credits back. Income taxes associated

with a reduction in tax credits generally have a higher shadow value because

of their greater ability to absorb tax credit carrybacks in the future. On

the other hand, tax credits accrued in state 1 have less value than additions

to ordinary tax losses, since their subsequent use is subject to the

additional restriction on the use of credits to offset taxable income. In

state 11, for example, each dollar of credits carried forward has a present

value of only 35.2 cents. Credits carried forward from state 2 have much

greater value than those carried forward from state 1 because of the much

greater likelihood of the firms entering state 0 from state 2 than from

state 1.
                                         —28-


       The figures in the table indicate that, despite the persistence noted in

Table 4, there is enough movement into and out of state 0 to impart a high

shadow value to tax payments in that state. Even a firm that has been fully

taxable f or at least two successive years can expect to recoup 16 percent of

its tax payments, in present value, by carrying back subsequent net operating

losses and excess tax credits. Combined with the shadow values of

carryforwards in state 1, this implies a narrowing of the gap between the

different states in effective marginal tax rates, compared to the

contemporaneous gap between the full corporate rate and zero.

       Given our shadow values, it is simple to construct these effective

marginal tax rates. For a taxpaying firm, the tax rate equals the tax on an

extra dollar of ordinary income less the shadow value that income generates.

For a firm in state 1, the tax rate equals the shadow value of a dollar of

ordinary losses carried forward. That is, the effective marginal tax rate in

state ij is the statutory tax rate, T, multiplied by 0, where:


            0 =
(12)              (F-vo)                                         (i0,1,2; j0)

                                                                 (i=0,1,2 j=1)

                  ((1—a)(1—v12)+awc12]                           (i=O,1,2; j=2)


       It will also be useful for subsequent calculations to compare the value

of 0 for tax payments associated with investment tax credits, rather than

ordinary income. We would expect this to be lower for three reasons. First,

unlike losses, credits cannot be used at all in state 2. Second, credits

carried forward cannot be used at all in a future state 2. Third, tax

payments associated with credits have a higher shadow value than those
                                       -29-


associated with ordinary income, since they can be offset completely by future

excess credits, not just at rate a.9 We have;


               =                                                (i0,1,2; j0)
(13)               (1—vc0)

                   wcj1                                         (i=O,1,2; j1)

                   wc12                                          (i0,1,2; j2)


       The second panel in Table 5 presents estimates of the values of these

marginal "effective inclusion" rates, 0 and 0 based on the shadow values in

the table. The effective tax rate on ordinary income equals the value of 9

multiplied by the statutory tax rate. At the 1982 statutory tax rate of 46

percent, the effective marginal tax rates for corporations vary from a high at

38.6 percent in state 00 to a low of 18.9 percent in state 11, a difference of

19.7 rather than 46 percentage points.

       These marginal tax rates on ordinary income are those that are relevant

for determining the corporate tax advantage from borrowing. As stressed in

our introduction, one of the most important effects attributed to the limited

loss offset present in the tax system is that it could conceivably explain the

existence of interior debt-equity ratios as an optimal policy of the firm.

The argument is extremely simple. Despite the apparent tax advantage to

borrowing, firms might reach a point where marginal interest deductions

receive such a small deduction, in present value, that other factors, such as

the personal tax advantage to equity (via the treatment of capital gains)

balances what remains of the advantage of interest deductibility, Clearly,

the restrictions are more important for the firm in state 11 than the firm in

state 00. One measure of its overall importance is the average of the
                                     -30—


different marginal tax rates across the different tax states, weighted by

assets of firms in the different states. The last row in Table 5, gives such

averages, based on the average state population fractions for the entire

sample period.10 The implied average marginal rate of deduction for interest

payments is 31.8 percent. This is quite close to the estimate by Cordes and

Sheffrin (1983) (who reported a value of .31 for a 1978 sample based on 1983

law) but considerably below those of Auerbach (1983) and Auerbach and Poterba

(1987b). It suggests that the combination of all tax constraints, including

investment and foreign tax credits, must be considered in any model attempting

to explain corporate borrowing decisions.



7.   The Effective Tax Rate on Investment

     As in previous studies (Auerbach 1983, Auerbach and Poterba 1987a), we

may also consider the impact of loss and credit restrictions on the incentives

for firms to invest. This is more complicated than the marginal tax rate

calculations just presented for several reasons.

     First, an investment project generates tax liabilities over several

years. In order to estimate the impact of the tax code, one must arrive at a

method of aggregating these tax payments into a single statistic. The

standard approach is to calculate an "effective tax rate," equal to the

proportional difference between the project's internal rates of return before

and after taxes.

     A second difficulty is that, in the current context, the firm's marginal

tax rate depends on its state, and this state is likely to change over time.

For example, a firm currently in state 00 is not certain to remain there over
                                     —31—


time. As time goes on, there is an increasing probability that it will

experience state 1 or state 2. Likewise, the "loser" in state 11 will, with

some probability, reach state 0 or state 2. To account for this we must, when

evaluating the marginal tax rate on tax accruals at different future dates,

apply the probabilities of each state occurring at each date, conditional on

the state observed initially at date 0. As in earlier work, we estimate these

future state probabilities by applying the estimated transition matrix

recursively to the initial state distribution of the firm. Given our

modelling of transitions, this means that the effective marginal tax rates

over time for different firms will converge, as the initial state condition

becomes less important.

     The final problem introduced by loss and credit limitations is one

ignored in earlier studies. For a given state, the effective marginal tax

rate a firm faces depends on whether the accrued tax liability is associated

with ordinary income or credits. For example, investments in equipment have

traditionally received the investment tax credit in the year of investment,

along with a substantial first-year depreciation allowance. Given the

additional limitations on the use of credits, however, it is likely that the

credit is less valuable than a deduction of equal, after-tax value. This is

easily accommodated by our analysis, since we have calculated separate shadow

values for the two different types of tax accruals.

     Our approach to estimating the impact of the tax system on the incentive

to invest proceeds as follows. First, we posit an asset with an associated

cash flow stream and tax accruals determined by the tax code. Second, we

posit the firm's state at date 0, and calculate the state probability
                                      -32-


 distribution at each subsequent date. Third, we estimate the average

 effective marginal tax rate on credit-type and ordinary income at each date,

 using this conditional state probability distribution and the shadow values

estimated above. Fourth, we apply these effective marginal rates to the

accrued tax payments calculated for each date in the first step. Finally, we

estimate the effective tax rate on the investment as the proportional

difference between the before-tax internal rate of return and the internal

rate of return of expected cash flows, after-tax.

     Table 6 presents estimates of the effective tax rates on investment for

firms in three different states as well as the average effective tax rates

over all nine states. Also presented for comparison are the effective tax

rates that would prevail under a system with full loss and credit offset. Two

assets are considered. One is a representative piece of equipment, qualifying

for the full investment tax credit and having an exponential depreciation rate

of 12.25 percent. The other is a representative building, which does not

receive the investment tax credit and depreciates exponentially at 3.61

percent.11 Both assets are assumed to deliver a real, certain return, after

depreciation, of 6 percent, and are assumed to be financed entirely by equity

(and hence generating no additional interest deductions). We apply the

provisions of the 1982 tax law, with a corporate tax rate of 46 percent, the

Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) for both equipment and structures, and

a 10 percent investment tax credit for equipment.

    As is well known, ACRS lowered effective tax rates (ignoring loss and

credit constraints) substantially. This is quite evident from the negative

tax rate on equipment under a hypothetical system of full loss offset. This
                                     -33-


negative tax rate simply indicates a present value of depreciation deductions

and investment tax credits in excess of the taxes due on the asset's gross

quasirents.

     The effects of tax constraints are to lower the average effective tax

rates for structures but to raise them slightly for equipment. To understand

this result, consider the effective tax rates for firms in selected states for

each of the assets. We choose the three states where the firm has been

taxable for two years, nontaxable for two years, and credit-constrained for

two years, respectively.

     As is evident from the table, the tax system's constraints affect

different firms in quite different ways that depend on the investments chosen.

The taxable firm encounters the lowest effective tax rate on equipment, the

nontaxable firm the highest. For structures, however, tax status is of little

importance, despite the fact that firms in each state face lower effective

rates than under a full loss offset system. This pattern is consistent with

earlier findings for two-state models by Auerbach (1983) and Auerbach and

Poterba (1987a). It is explained by the presence of two offsetting effects of

tax constraints.

     On the one hand, the presence, or prospect of, tax constraints reduces

all tax payments in present value by pushing them forward in time. On the

other hand, this reduction is greater in the early years for nontaxable firms,

and less for taxable firms, before the different firms converge to the same

long run state distribution. For assets with large immediate tax benefits,

that make early year tax accruals negative, such as equipment, the advantage

goes to the taxable firm. For other assets, such as structures, the advantage
                                       -34-


is neglible. That, for structures, the tax rates of all firms are below the

nominal rate simply reflects the importance of the first effect of tax

constraints just alluded to, the pushing back of positive tax payments. For

equipment, however, the tax rate is actually higher for firms in state 1,

since the effects of pushing back early, negative tax payments outweighs the

tax reduction gained by pushing back later, positive ones. This explains why

the average effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate for

structures, and, given the sample population weights, is slightly higher for

equipment.



8.      Conclusions

        In this paper, we have presented results based on a large panel of actual

corporate tax returned concerning the importance of tax loss and credit

constraints on the behavior of U.S. corporations. Among our findings have

been:

(1) Taking account of constraints on the use of investment tax credits, a

        significant fraction (about , weighted by book assets) of firms in the

        nonfinancial corporate sector have unused tax benefits that must be

        carried forward.

(2) This fraction increased substantially in 1981 and 1982 to unprecedented

        level s.

(3) The incidence of tax constraints varies by firm size. Larger firms are

        more likely to have positive taxable income but also more likely to have

        unused foreign and investment tax credits.

(4) The average marginal rate of deduction for interest payments in the early
                                     -35-


     1980s was just over two-thirds the statutory rate, a fact that could help

     justify theories of an optimal interior debt—equity ratio based in part

     on the limited deductibility of interest payments.

(5) The presence of tax constraints does not, in itself, imply the

     discouragement of investment. We estimate that, on average, it actually

     reduces substantially the effective tax rate on some investments.

     There are obviously many ways in which this study could be extended. One

that we attempted ourselves was to see how much of the increased incidence of

tax losses in 1981 and 1982 was due to the change in the tax law in 1981

allowing more generous depreciation benefits. Unfortunately, not all the data

from the corporate tax returns (form 1120) were available on the Treasury tax

file. Our attempts at inferring the extra depreciation allowances due to the

change in tax regime produced imprecise estimates. It is still worth

reporting, however, that though actual depreciation exceeded what would have

been predicted on the basis of pre-1981 experience, there was virtually no

change in the number of firms with tax losses associated with this shift. On

this point, one should also cite the evidence presented by Auerbach and

Poterba (1987a) that the major factor behind the reduction in corporate tax

revenues that occurred during this period was a significant decline in the

rate of profit.

     The panel data we have used ends in 1982. This is all that is currently

available to us. The addition of more years to the existing panel would

enable us to determine whether the striking increase in loss and credit

carryforwards that occurred in 1981 and 1982 has continued during the recent

economic recovery. At least after the fact, this will aid in the evaluation

of the recently enacted reform of the corporate tax.

                                       Appendix A


     In Section 3 above, we described the data used in this paper, pointing

out that raw tax return data do not contain direct information on the presence

and size of tax loss carryforwards. To obtain this important information, we

used the first five years of tax information (1971-75) to establish initial

tax conditions, from which complete information for all subsequent years could

be inferred by applying provisions of the tax code to the data provided.

     In each year, we have two relevant pieces of information for each firm:

its taxable income (before credits and net operating loss deductions, but

after deductions of intercorporate dividends), TI, and its net operating loss

deductions, NOLD. Net operating loss deductions cannot exceed taxable income,

when TI is positive. When taxable income is negative, the net operating loss

is zero. Therefore, there are four possible combinations for these two

variables:


             A: TI > NOLD = 0

             B: TI <   0;   NOLD = 0

             C: TI = NOLD > 0

             0: TI > NOLD > 0


Case A is the most common. These are firms with positive income and no net

operating loss deductions. We may infer that they have no tax losses being

carried forward. Case B firms are those with negative taxable income, and

hence no NOLD. These firms may or may not have a tax loss carryforward,

depending on whether the losses can be fully carried back to the three
                                        —37—


previous tax years. This means that, to determine the carryforward for such

firms, we will need information on potential carrybacks, as well. Firms in

case C are those who are offsetting taxable income to the maximum extent.

These firms have tax loss carryforwards, but the size cannot be inferred

without an examination of their history. Firms in case 0 are those who are

"using up" their tax loss carryforward: since they could take a larger

deduction, we infer that they have no more to take.

        Our strategy is to use data for the years 1971—75 to establish either

vintages of tax loss carryforwards or vintages of potential carrybacks for

each firm. We choose the five year period because, at that time, losses could

be carried forward at most five years. Thus, no losses from before 1971 could

be carried forward into 1976. For the majority of firms, we have sufficient

information to deduce the initial conditions without making any assumptions.

For some firms, however, assumptions are required. Where this is so, we

experimented with different assumptions. In most cases, the choice of

assumption made little difference. Where it appeared to matter, we chose the

assumption that gave the best prediction of net operating losses taken after

1975.

        As indicated in Section 3, we assigned to firm to four mutually exclusive

classes for calculation of initial conditions. We now discuss the algorthm

used for each of these classes.


        I.   Firms in case A f or three consecutive base period years.
             (1626 firms)

             These firms were inferred to begin the subsequent year with no
             tax loss carryforward and a potential carryback equal to the
             three years' taxable income.
                                -38-


II. Firms who fall into case 0 during the base period.
     (720 firms)

     These firms were inferred to start the following year with no
     tax loss carryforward and a potential carryback equal to the
     difference between taxable income and the net operating loss
     deduction for the case 0 year.

     As mentioned in the text, we did observe firms with
     consecutive years of case 0. This occurrence could result
     from the continual acquisition of smaller loss firms, or from
     the consolidation of separate returns, some in case A and some
     in case 0. This is probably the major reason for our
     understatement of net operating loss deductions in the period
     after 1976.



III. Firms experiencing at least one year (but fewer than three
     consecutively) of positive income without NOLOs (case A)
     during the base period.
     (198 firms)

     Many of these firms had losses in the base period before the
     case A year but, we may infer, had sufficient carryback
     reserves that the losses were carried back to the period
     before 1970. For these firms, we start history with the first
     case A year in the base period. This has the effect of
     assuming that no further carry back to the pre-1971 period
     would be possible. In most cases, this is not restrictive.
     For example, a firm with losses in 1971 and 1972 and taxable
     income without at net operating loss deduction in 1973 would,
     for any losses incurred subsequently, be able to carry back no
     earlier than 1973. However, in a few cases, our approach may
     slightly understate the ability to carry back. For example, a
     firm taxable income in 1971 and 1972 and a loss in 1973 might
     be able to carry part of the 1973 loss back to 1970.




IV. Firms experiencing no years of case A or case 0 during the
     five-year base period.
     (264 firms)

    These are firms that spent the entire base period losing money
    (case 6) or sheltering taxable income fully (case C). They
    paid no taxes in any of the years. We assumed that all net
    operating loss deductions in the base period came from losses
    incurred before 1971. This means establishing a tax loss
    carryforward at the end of 1975 equal to the sum of losses
                                    —39-.



          incurred in the 1971-75 period. An alternative assumption
          tried was to start history with the first year of losses and
          assume that subsequent base period net operating loss
          deductions came from these, and not pre-1971 losses. This
          leads to a 1975 carryforward equal to base period losses net
          of intervening net operating loss deductions. We opted for
          the first assumption on the basis of performance after 1975.


    A final imputation that was necessary was the investment tax credits

carried forward at the end of 1982. Our aim here is to determine only whether

they are present, not their size, since aggregate statistics on investment tax

credits carried forward are already provided by the Internal Revenue Service's

Statistics of Income Division.

     To infer the presence of tax credit carryforwards at the end of 1982, we

used the following algorithm. Firms which carried credits forward at the end

of 1981 and had tentative ITCs in 1982 in excess of those taken were inferred

to be constrained at the end of 1982 as well. Those who were not constrained

at the end of 1981, but had tentative ITCs in excess of those taken, carried

some credits back. To determined whether they were able to carry all excess

credits back, we assumed that firms which had carried credits back in the

previous year would not be able to carry all their credits back during the

current one as well.

                                    Appendix B


     The paper reports estimates for 1980, 1981 and 1982 of state populations

and aggregate tax loss carryforwards for the entire nonfinancial corporate

sector, excluding only firms with less than 10 million dollars in assets in

the respective year. This appendix describes the derivation of these

estimates.

     We begin with the panel of firms with complete data from 1971 through the

year in question. These panels have 3343, 3086 and 2808 firms for the periods

1971-80, 1971-81 and 1971-82, respectively. For each year, we then add that

year's tax return data for all other corporations above 10 million in assets

to obtain a universe of all firms. We then take out all those firms for whom

we would know from a single year's tax return that the firm has no tax loss

carryforward, including those in state 1 because they offset all taxable

income with foreign tax credits.

     We divided the remaining firms into three classes: those with negative

taxable income, those with positive taxable income equal to net operating loss

deduction, and those with taxable income greater than the (positive) net

operating loss deduction. Firms in this last class should normally be taxable

but, as discussed above, we turned up several cases in studying the panel in

which this appeared not to be so.

     For each year, and each of the three classes, we then estimated an

equation relating the ratio of tax loss carryforward to assets to several

explanatory variables taken from that year's tax return, using all firms from

that year's complete panel in that class. (Where the tax loss carryforward
                                       -41—


was zero, we followed the approach in Auerbach (1983) and included the f-irm's

potential carryback multiplied by -1.) Among the explanatory variables were

assets, sales, foreign tax credits, investment tax credits, ITC carryforward,

and taxable income. We then used these equations to impute the tax loss

carryforward for firms not in the complete panels and assumed those firms were

in state 1 if the imputed values were positive.

     To correct for sample selection bias, we first estimated a probit

equation for sample inclusion before performing the regressions. We added to

the list of explanatory variables the firm's tax return filing date, which

proved to be a significant explanatory variable, consistent with our view that

data problems are an important reason for absence from the panel. We then

constructed and used the appropriate Mills ratio corrections in the

regressions based on firms in the panel and the imputations for firms not in

the panel.

     A minor complication is involved in classifying a small number of taxable

firms into state 0 or 2. Firms with tentative investment tax credits in

excess of those claimed, but no investment tax credit carryforward from the

previous year, are in state 2 if they cannot carry all the excess credits back

but remain in state 0 if they can. This classification problem was

encountered for the panel for the last year, 1982 (see Appendix A), but we

cannot use the classification algorithm employed there with only one year of

data. Therefore, we calculate upper and lower bounds for the state 2

population by assuming all or none of these firms are in state 2, and take a

simple average. The difference between the two estimates of the state 2

population is typically quite small.
                                          -42-


                                       Appendix C


         Section 5 of the text presents expressions for the shadow values of tax

payments under the assumption that firms always carry losses and credits back.

In this appendix, we show how these expressions must be amended when firms

only carry losses back when the carry back period contains no years in which

they already faced constraints. The expressions affected are (3)—(5).

       First, firms will never carry losses back into state 2. Since they

cannot carry credits back to this state in any event, we have:


(5')         v12 = 0                                                       (1=0,1,2)


       Second, tax payments in state 0 will not be used to offset tax credits

and, in subsequent years, the tax losses, since this would involve carrying

the losses back to a state 2 year. For a firm in state 10 or state 20 (i.e.

currently taxable but not fully taxable in the previous year), losses will be

carried back to the current year only if the firm is in state 0 for the next

two years as well. Other wise, the three-year carryback period will include

the previous year in which the firm was not in state 0. Thus, for states 10

and 20, (4) in the text is replaced by:


(4.a')       v.0 = (P102+2P100p002+3P100p000p002)a(1-wc02)

                   +
                       3p100p000p001(1-w01)                                  (i=1,2)


Firms initially in state 00, however, will carry back to the current year if

state 1 occurs two years hence (after state 0), since by then the three

previous years would all have been state 0.         If the firm reaches state 1
                                              -'43-



immediately, however, we must allow for the fact that it could have been in

state 1 or state 2 two years before the current one. For the firm currently

in state 00, the probability that 'it was also in state 0 two years ago is:


(Bi)        Pr(000IxOO) =
                                 (q00p000)/(q00p000+q10p110+q20p200)

where q is the population weight of state ij. Thus, for state 00, (4) in

the text is repIacd by:


                                    22
(4.b')      v00 =   (1+p000+$        p000)p002a(1-wc02)
                    +
                            $(Pr(000Ix00)+p000+2p00)p001(1-w01)

       A similar argument affects the value of taxes associated with changes in

tax credits. For i=1 or 2, expression (3.a) in the text becomes:


(3.a')     vc.0 = (p02+$2P00p002+3P100p000p002)(1—wc02)

                        +                                                (i1,2)
                            3p100p000p001(1-wc01)

Since, as discussed above, losses carried back into state 00 are already

assumed to produce no shadow value for a reduction in tax credits, there is no

change in the shadow value of a change in credits in state 00 caused by the

change in assumption about when firms carry losses back (i.e. (3.b) is

unchanged).

                                  Footnotes


1.   Since 1986, a strengthened corporate alternative minimum tax acts as a

second level, parallel tax system, but the minimum tax in place during our

sample period was much less important.

2.   Our universe also contains Subchapter S Corporations, which are taxed as

partnerships. Since they represent just over 1 percent of corporate assets,

their inclusion should have an insignificant impact on the results.

3.   Actually, each year's return reports the carryforward from the previous

year. Thus, carryforwards from 1982 are not directly available from 1982 tax

returns; to estimate these, we used an algorithm described in Appendix A.

4.   Our weighted and unweighted percentages for firms in state 1 for 1981 and

1982 (the only years of overlap) are substantially higher than those found by

Auerbach and Poterba, even if we substract firms in state 1 due to foreign tax

credits. This suggests that losses are more prevalent among the firms with

poor public accounting data that were omitted from their sample.

5.   Further details of the method and data source used for this calculation

is provided by Auerbach and Poterba (1987a).

6.   This may slightly overstate the average length that marginal changes in

tax credits can be carried forward from state 2.   If the firm is in the

process of reducing, rather than increasing, its stock of unused tax credits,

the marginal tax credit in the carryforward stock may have been accrued in an

earlier year. This would make the appropriate expiration date in expression

(1) earlier than IC. A similar issue arises with ordinary losses carried

forward. There does not seem to be any simple way of correcting this rather
                                     -45-


minor error.

7.   The annual transition patterns vary quite substantially, but we focus on

the sample average to reduce sampling error and because we are interested in

the long run transition patterns.

8.   This presents a small problem, because a small number of firms in the

sample on which our transition matrices are based were assumed to follow a

policy of only sometimes carrying losses back. For such firms, the shadow

value algorithm is slightly different (see Appendix C). However, the

difference and the number of firms involved are so small that estimation using

separate transition matrices did not seem worthwhile. All subsequent

calculations also are based on the "always carry back" algorithm given in

section 5.

9.   Offsetting these effects is the fact that credits accrued in state 00 may

have reduced value under the assumption, which we have made, that firms will

be able to carry any displaced credits back an additional three years. This

explains why, in table 5, the shadow value of credits is lower in state 00

than the shadow value of ordinary tax payments.

10. The sample state population weights are: 00: .439, 01: .033, 02: .098,

10: .004, 11: .075, 12: .023, 20: .101, 21: .031, 22: .195.

     We would prefer to use universe state weights, but we have estimates only

of the state 0, 1 and 2 populations and not the additional breakdown within

each of these states. The major state fractions for the universe, given in

Table 1, are quite close to those calculated for the sample, so the

differences should be small.

11. These depreciation rates are those for general industrial equipment and

industrial buildings estimated by Hulten and Wykoff (1981).

Notes: For ordinary income, effective tax rate is computed by multiplying
        the effective inclusion rate by the statutory marginal tax rate.

        For tax credits, the effective credit rate equals the effective
        inclusion rate multiplied by the statutory rate of tax credit.
