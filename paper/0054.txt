               BILATERAL TRADE AS A L.EVELOP1ET I:;S:RUMENT
                     UNDER CLO3AL TRADE RESTRICTIO:S




                                    by
                            Karim   A. Nashashibi
       In their striving toward development a number of less developed countries

have espoused bilateral trade as yet another policy instrument allowing them

to increase their acquisition of foreign resources. indeed, bilateral trade

agreements   became a salient feature of    trade flows throu;hout the l96Cs and

recent    developments point to an increase in bilateral      trade's share of   world
trade.
       This has been particularly true of the trade of India, Pakistan,      and

Ept, on which scm useful empirical studies have been conducted (6,7,10).
On the whole, however, the economic literature seems to have allocated '-ery

little theoretical   attention to the problem even       though this type of trade
was widespread   in the 1930s. (1). Holzman and Wiles (5,11) view        biiateraii
in the context of centrally planned econcmies and attribute its raison           d'etre
to   the rigidities inherent in them (e.g., inconvertibility, carry—over from

internal   balance methods,   and so forth). No attempt, however, is made to

analyze bilateral trae systematically in the context of specific targets             and

rigidities which characterize all trading alternat.ves.

     The target we are interested in is not trade eficiericy as an end in
itself, but growth. And for a number of countries the ability to grow depends
very   much on the ability to ipDrt. Hence, it is in        terms of this target that
we propose   to evaluate the efficiency of bilateral trade as a policy instrument

and   to exaine a number of related issues, such as the terms of trade, trade
diversion, and its     :';Z   n   resource allocation.

       A   brief description of bilateral trade areemerits starts our discussion,
 followed by a three—country model as a theoretical formulation of the problem.
Finally, several imulictions will be derived in relation to the issues
mentioned above.
       What distinihes          bilateral trade from multilateral trade or state
trading     is    the built—in mechanism which promotes exports in payment fcr imports.
 Imports   and exports need not balance in any           given   year but the agreement moves

the two countries toward balance over a period of time (usually, three to five

years).          In case one of the partners shows a deficit, a "swing credit" is

provided by the        surplus country to finance it. If the          deficit country exceeds

its credit ceiling a settlement of the balance is provided within a certain

period of time (usually six months). Such settlements usually consist of an

additional flow of        exports,   although the deficit could be settled with      :cnvertible
foreignexchange. Since the two modes of settlement are not cualitatiely different

as   will be shown     below -   we start by assuming that the trade is to be commodity—

balanced.

The model

       It is pointless to discuss bilateral trade in comparison to multilateral

trade without pcsing           ecific restrictior,s since in a standard theory of trade

approach bilateral trade would           appear   both primitive and inefficient. Sufficient

to say that       under   multilateral trade and perfect market conditions a country

would, sell its      commodities to the highest bidder and buy from the cheapest source
cver the largest set of buyers and sellers. Hence it would reap the highest terms

of trade. Multilateral trade is also compatible with all kinds of restrictive

practices such as price discrimination, state trading and export taxes which

tend to maxim!se a country's benefits from trade whenever it ceases to be a

price talcer (2).         In this sense a unilateral' moncpoly is superior to bilateral
                                            —3—

 monopoly. In:case a chronic deficit in the balance of payments develops,

 an adjustment in its exchange       rate   together with the manipulation of its
 monetary anifcal instrurents should restore equilibrium.

        In order to pose the problem it is necessary to specify a set of

 conditions which, when they arise, reduce the effectiveness of multilateral

trade and invaliaate some of its advantages. : the 1930s these conditions

were the acu;e shortage of international liquidity which resulted from the

collapse   of the gold      standard and the need to push employment through exDorts

in    the wake of the     depression and reparation payments (3).     Today, while

under—develcied countries do not face the problem of a depressed aggregate

demand they nevertheless want to stimulate theirrow-th: on the one hand they

have high import requirements necessary to realize investments which would help

them break away from the low—growth traditional structure of troduction; On

the   other hand   this   traditional structure is incapable of suDlying the kind

and amount of exports necessary to pay for the required imports (with the

exception of oi. producers). if sufficient means of payment were vailable by

international oranizatjons such development could be financed, prcvi-ed credit

is extended over a period long enough to lead to the emergence of a new vintage

of exports which would be sufficient to pay for the present and future imports.
                                                         fulfilling
However, such eans of payment fall far short of/sound investment possibilities

and most underdeveloped countries are forced to finance their irts thrcugh
their   exports.       This usually means to restrict their imports to the level of

exports the country can sell ccsetitive1v abroad at             goingexchane rate.
Such export basket is mostly composed of primary ccmmodities (raw         materials   and

tood) and simple manufactures in which these countries developed a comparative

advantage. The first group of cc.modities has frequently encountered sluggish



 1/     Wiles,   (8)   p.271.
 growth and downward sloping demand curves while th second has been strongly
 resisted by buyer countries    in protection of their own   inefficient industries
 (textiles,   leather goods).

      Eence, le:.s developed countries engaged in bilateral agreer-ents view

 this trade as an oçDortunity of accuiring additional imports necessary to

 their developnentai process without agravatin their balance       of payent probls,
 thanks to an increase in their exports,   particularly the "nontraditional"

 coodities.

     To derive the properties of bilateral trade under policy target, which

attempts to satisfy a certain import bill and the trading restrictions which

prevail in world markets, we shall set up the following model:

     Let us call our less developed country, country III and let us assume

it has only two trading partners: country II with which it trades on a bilateral
basis — we shall refer to it as a "tied market" or "II" — and
                                                              country I      with
which it trades only for convertible currency (free market). II and I have

many trade partners other than III and any amount of a commodity exported by

them to III only forms a small proportion of their total exports of that

commodity. Hence, we consider III as a price taker on the import side.         The

prices quoted by the free market serve as "world prices" for country III. Clearly,

there is no a priori reason why prices quoted from II should be higher or lower

than those quoted by I. These would vary for each commodity according to its

export availabilities and cost conditions as well as its assessment of III's

relative need of the commodity, its ability to purchase from the free market

and so forth. Hence, while the free market quotes a single world price for

each commodity, the tied market can practice price discrimination vis—.—vis

its trading partners.

    However, even if export prices under bilateral agreements do not exceed

the cheapest alternative source of supply the purchasing power of the proceeds
                                                    —5—

from   the exports is limited by the choice set of exports offered by country                      II

to   III. This choice rait differ substantially from                 the   commodities which

rank high among III's import priorities. Hence, the "real" price received

for III's exports is lower than its ncina1 value. In this case a simple

comparison of prices quoted from the free market, and from tied narkets is not

sufficient, since the means of payment             differ.   ''e   shall attempt in this     model

to bring     out with some degree of precision the real returns that our less de-:elcped

country reaps when it trades its exports against a set of specific imports

rather than for convertible exchange. We would want to comtare a hyotheticai

situation where all the exports are paid for in convertible currency to the

real situation where only part of the export's proceeds are in convertible

currency while the rest are to be chosen from a set of potential imports.

       Suppose III's totcal export availabilities can be denoted by a SUiY

vector s 3(sii .. .s .. .s.     ) where each variety or zrade of a product is treated
                    3j
as a distinct corr.modity (j =      i. .. .n).     From it country    I    will draw a set of

exports denoted by vector E1 and II will draw a set of exports E2.                    To          and

     will be attached price vectors              and R2 respectively. Hence the total

proceeds from     exports    will be:

       (1)               +
               V3=R1E1
       Vectors R1and R2 are denominated in a cor.vertible currency, say dolars.
However, while the amount R1E1 wcu.ld be actually transferred to III and can be

disposed of at wi11,             represents simply a credit to the account of              III,
which can cniy be used for an equivalent purchase of exports from II. It
should be stressed at this point that a less developed country cannot sell as

much as it would want to country I out of its export basket. Indeed,                   the    free

market will distribute its        purchases among the nuerous sources             of supply which

can quote roughly the sameworid price on a c.i.f. basis and among                   thcse   with
                                                   —6—


whom   it entered into      soe preferential agreement. Hence, unlike the perfect

market   model where a large demand            for a product  is translated into horizntal
demand   curves fr a multitude           of   sellers, differences in c.i.f. import costs,
in    product varieties and       the   prevailance of auantitative restrictions viii

result   in a ezan curve          which will rapidly        slope downward past a certain .uantity
sold. Thus, country III will ta:e 1E1 as given arid attempt to expand its
exports towards country II.
       Furthermore, II      vililiave a vector           denoting its import requirements
for the forthcoming planning period. These could be derived from various
investment appropriaticns and various disaggregated import functions. To this
vector   is associated a weight vector W which will indicate III's preference

for each of its inport requirements.                 These weights could be akin tc dual

variables derived from a global programming                 model a la Frisch and   reflecting

the   net increase in    the value of a welfare function resulting from an addition

of   a unit   of   expenditure on a particular import. Or more simply, they can
roughly indicate a ranking          of   import priorities among various investment g.ods,
raw material and consumer goods.'
       Country     III will choose its imports from two supply vectors (or export

availabilities) S and S2, offered by countries I and II. To theoe are attached

price vectors P1 and               From these supply vectors, country III will have to

pick two import vectors             and        in such a way as to get as close as possible

to its import requirements M under the constraint of its foreigh exchar.ge

resources V3. In addition, any quantity imported of a particular commodity from

a given source cannot exceed the availability of that commodity for export by

the same source (e.g.                         ).

This result hinges, however, on the uniticity of the maximum reached over each

Therefore the real     return   which country III receives for its exports from

(normalized).     To normalize         we set the following equation.

      A small illustration reveals here the preferential market nature of

bilateral trade. Since the two trading partners may offer competing sets of

exports, a possible import combination for country III can be represented by

two intersecting sets B1 and B2.




            Imports                                         Imports
            from country I                                  from country II

                                           — 12    —




The intersection of the two sets (E1fl B2) encom;asses those cotic

which are competitive from the two countries (on a c.i.f. import           basis)   and

bear the same weight. Hence, a Driori, the function would be indifferent

as   to whether they are i::ported from countr- I or        country II. However, in the

process    of finding a maximum and as restrictions (2d) become binding, the
functions will shift co:4eting impcrts to the imDort vector from the biaterai
trade partner. :ence, country II is a preferred market of country I by virtue
of   the   fact that any increment of Imports from II can be matched by exports
from   III,   while the level of imports   from     I does not bear such a relation.
Notice     that this can occur over a certain range without efficiency lOSS as

the shift of all competing imports to II does not affect max.*

       However, as other imports begin to move to II under the convertible exchange

constraint,     max.* starts to fail along the path of max .
                                                                +
                                                                     It simply means that
the cost of transforming domestic resources into foreign resources has riser..

Nevertheless, this cost might still be lower than the alternative offered by

multilateral markets. The relatively higher terms of trade which can be

fetched in the bilateral market would result from a higher demand elasticity

facing the products     marketed. And this        for two reasons:

i) on account of the preferential treatment the demand curve            facing   country IIIs

product in the protected bilateral market will be more elastic than in the free

market where all competitors have equal access. This can be demonstrated within

the framework of Sweezy's diagram (9):




                                    A
                                       — 13   —




We   have two dcmand curves: A is drawn on the assumption that only country

III can reduce the price of a given ccmmodity, while its competitors hold

their own; B is drawn on th assumption that all competing countries to III

reduce their price of that commodity.         Clearly a preferential treatment

allows country III to move along curve A while multilateral trade would move

it along   the   far less advantageous curve B.

ii) It is presumed that the elasticities of substitution among consumption

goods for the countries engaged in bilateral trade would be higher than for

developed countries engaged in multilateral trade.        This results from the

foreign exchange constraint under which tied markets oterate and hence the

lower order of preferences they would have for quality refinements, model

changes and pure consumer choice.'

Comlenent an ty

      The advantages which III can reap from bilateral trade depends very much

on the export basket II has to offer. One would want vector            (the optimum

import vector to be drawn from the tied market) to have as many positive

elements in it as possible and be weighted as heavily as possible. This would

occur when II is both able to offer the commodities which meet III's itort

requirements and to do it at competitive prices (world prices or better).

       In a sense, a high degree of complementarity of II's export basket to III's

import requirements would reduce the possibility of R1E1 being binding and

would tend to make A small in case             does hold as a constraint. When one

of the bilateral partners is industrially advanced and large, implying varied

export and import baskets, such a comleentarity might naturally occur.
  1/ Tourism is a case in point. Whereas residents of Western Europe can choose
any country where to spend their vacations, tourists of Eastern European countries
often have their choices restricted to those countries with whom they have bilateral
agreemnts.

On the other hani,       za11     countries may experience larger values of X

resulting       from the disparity between their demands and their partner's supply

availabilities. This ci be rnedied if the ex-Dort availabilities to each

partner are increased and if the new export availabilities are competitive.

Whereas       this is difficult   to do for any single country within a short period of

time,    it   can be easily   done within a group of       countries   which opt for the
convertibility of their currency (within the group). Thus each ccuntry
will now face the export availabilities of all the other mbers of the
group which will both increase cozplenentarity and the competitiveness of

the bill of imports offered. This "multilaterally balanced trade" is now

being applied .thin Fastern Europe through ruble convertibility within the

Comecon and would approach Frisch's ideal (14).

Trade Diversion and Long-Term Ecuilfbriurn

        Since, as we have seen above, export returns are in general icuer under

bilateral than under multilateral trade, it would be in the interest of

country III to sell everything it can in free markets at the going price and

then allocate the remainder of its export availabilities to tied arkets.

This would maxiizze the terra             in equation (1) hence re:Iucing the size

of the constraint (2d) and help minimize               .   It   is likewise in the interest

of the partner country (country II) to have a set of imports facing it which

would be as close to its import priorities as possible. For instance,

country II would want to buy on a bilateral basis certain primary comodities

or food items such as rice, rubber or tea to which it attaches a high pricr'y

and which it would otherwise buy for convertible exchange. Hence the r.agni—
                                             —15 —



tude of the variable             for each of the trading partners becomes a matter of

bargaining arid subject to economic and political influence. Under this

bargaining s:me trade could be diverted from free markets into tied markets

so as to reducethe divergence between import needs and export availabilities

which   might arise more acutely for one of the partners. For instance,
Erpt is a    price taker in rab markets for rice. evertheless, it might
be    forced to divert part cf these potential sales for convertible exchange

to Eastern European countries in order to diversify its limited list of

exports. Starting from (1) our new export equation will be:


(6)       V't =
                  R1
                       (14) E1    +   (i—)   R2E2'

where (1          is   a diagonal matrix denoting for each.. the proportion of

e1 which    has been diverted into       e2. (where E2 +       E").   Clearly

a lower R1E1 will restrict            even further and hence would increase X     to A
Hence, trade diversion in this case reduces the ai'ount of convertible exchange
available for imports from free markets which in turn worsens the term of

exchange with tied markets. Conversely, it imporves the relative terms of

trade of the bilateral partner. Therefore, it is equivalent to the settlement

of a deficit sustained by         one of the parties to a trade in convertible foreign

exchange.

       Aside from this deliberate trade diversion arising out of the bargaining

process between the two partners some trade diversions may occur as a result

of a general slackening of efforts in preserving market shares obtained in

convertible currency areas, let alone gaining additional markets.




                                                                             .1
                                              —16—

This process might         be further encouraged by the price illusion fostered by

the nominal export price vector                Hence the total revenue from trade when

the country only trades on a multilateral basis might substantially exceed

what is actually sold on free nrkets           when it   also engaged in bilateral trade.

If the country fetches a hypothetical g in foreign exchange when it trades

solely on a multilateral basis its net gains in export returns from bilateral

trade will be:

(7)       b    V" —   g
       Both trade diversion and the value of         X can    be reduced by   simply
lowering the overall volume of export and import which enter under the bilateral

agreement. This can stem from a lower level of optimum (!&1M2)*            or    conversely

by restricting import requirements M or adapting them to the availabilities

of the bilateral partner through a different W. In any case, it becomes a

question of trading off a higher fulfillment of on&s import requirements

against a higher domestic resource cost of one's exports, implied by a higher

equilibrium would be reached at a point j\* where the marginal efficiency of

an    additional   unit    of   foreign resources acquired through trade equals the

marginal domestic resource cost of paying for it.

        Over some time horizon a process of adjustment will take place both to

eliminate trade diversion and to maximize profits from experts. For trade
diversion need only occur in an initial period when the country is not adjusted
to    the bilateral/multilateral allocation. ill         the longer run, provided the supply

of exports is elastic, such trade diversion can be eliminated.
     Likewise with respect to A. if trade is to be fair between the two
partners, we       would
                           have*      =
                                       \*, provided they are derived frorn the same
system of     weights.      Hcwever, it would be purely coincidental if        =
                                                                                1,,    2
                                               — 17 —


Hence, the movement towards such an equality can only be achieved through

time      as the appropriate adjustments are made in         the export    and   import vectors

of   the    two trading partners.

Allocative       effects of bilateral trade
          Some of the literature ccncerr.ed with trade among East European contries

often brinout the possibility of trading in the                 "wrong" cczzcdity, i.e.,
where a commodity which should have been imported is exported at a loss.' How-
ever, it would be          misleading      to associate this possibility to the practice of

trading on a bilateral basis. For it would always be to the country's interest

to offer those commodities in which it has a comparative advantage.'                      Those

commodities which are priced above the world price will either be rejected by

the trading partner of if               accepted would tend to increase his        making this
bilateral       trade less attractive to him and forcing eventually a reallocation
of imports and exports. However, if a country will not produce a "wrong"
commodity as a result of bilateral trade it might increase the production of
those commodities which are highly desired by the bilateral trading partners or

thea to his specifications.

          On   the   import side, the reallocation of      resource   might still he rore pro-

nounced. Investment allocations among industries as well as the choice of

techniques involved rright be decided by the             bill   of goods offered as imports

by    the   trading partner. This investment reallocation would increase the weights

In favor of the bilateral partner and hence reduce the value of                      -   cuever,

a part from the cornplex questicn pertaining to the overall cost of such a

reallocation (from an efficiency point of view) it brings out the problem

of economic dependence which may become severe for a small country adapting

its import and export bills to a large bilateral partner.

Aid   throuh trade
        It   is cconly agreed that aid through trade consists in granting credit

to   an underdeveloped country        for the purchase of imports to be repaid at a

later    date   with exports. This is a form of bilateral trade where one party

fulfills the agreement at a later date against the payment of interest. In

this framework, however, the element of time (deferred payment) need not be a

necessary characteristic of aid. Let us define, at any point in time, a purely
                                                                          1/  —

    2\           This   is   a form of aid which is frequently overlocked for it is not

       to specific projects but applies to regular yearly flcvs        of imports and

exports.

       With     respect to aid which is project    tied there is some confusion in each

case    as to the exact amount of aid provided. A full easure of such aid should
take into account the following three factors.
        1. Difference in interest rate between that which is charged by the
              donor country and the equivalent going market rate.
        2. Difference in prices charged by the donor country on the ecuipment
              specified in the aid agreement    and the   going world prices for equi-
              valent equipment.
        3.   Difference in the weighted value of the goods sent as repayment to
             the donor country and the goods which the donor country would have
             bought had it received convertible exchange.

    1/ We assume the weichting systems used for the two sets of import requirements
        to be the same.
                                           —19-

        Factors 1 and 2 can be measured in isolation of the annual bilateral trade

flows with the donor country. For instance, the difference in prices in factor

2 can be expressed as a percentage of the total value of equipment arid added to

the nominal interest rate. Factor 3, however, is a function of the absolute

level of bilateral trade flows between the two countries. Indeed, bilateral

trade flows would have already encompassed for the donor country its preferred

imports from the aid receiving country. Hence, any additional imports would

have relatively lower weights attached to them. The proper method fcr the donor

country to easure          would be first to cc.pute          would reflect the relative

deterioration   in   the weighted value of the goods used as repayr.ents by the aid

receiving country. This deterioration in the terms of trade plus the interest

foregone on the financing of the imports will represent to the dc.nor country           the
cost of providing the aid. The same procedure could be applied to the aid

receiving countries, and as it often happens in aid programming the value of

the aid to the receiving country may diverge substantially from the cost of aid

to the donor country.

       We can now surarize the conclusions shown from our model:

1.     Bialteral trade is essentially a preferential trade agreement, where ccmmoditie

of the two trading partners receive a preferential treatment, in their respective

markets. From a two—country point of view and under market restrictions governing

multilateral flows it is trade creating and need not involve any loss factors

as long as it is limited to the exchange of competitive comiodities.           From a

                          has                                         1/
world point of view it          the limitations   of any   tariff club.—   when pushed

beyond the exchange of competitive commodities, bilateral trade involves a

loss factor since rettirns from exports to the trading partners become restricted



     1/ The limitations are brought out by the Theory of Common arkets, see (3).
                                           — 20   —




 to    a set of imports which gradually exceed world prices, (the acceptance of

 produdts which depart from certain sDecification requirements is another

 dimension of price). This in effect reduces the real value of export returns

 received from the bilateral partner. owever, since world prices are cften

 exogenously given and may include excess profits to the exporter, the loss

 factor can Simply be viewed as a discount factor which takes advantage of

elastic demand curves for the cocodity traded in their privileged markets.

Hence, on one hand the terms of trade under bilateral agreement tend to improve

on account of the preferential factor but on the other hand they tend to worsen

under the restriction which bilateralism imposes on the import set of each partner.

2.      The more complementary the two partners in their import—export bundles          the
greater the efficiency of bilateral trade. Hence, the inclusion of additional

partners will broaden the variety cf goods to be traded and            a   common currency

area    with an overall balance between imports and exports for each trade partner
will    be more efficient than bilateral trade ficus.

3.      Trade   diversion   from multilateral markets to bilateral markets is not an

inherent feature of bilateral trade by a temporary measure intended to provide

adequate payment to a high level of the bilateral partner. Basically, it a:onts

to the settlement of a deficit in the trade flows with convertible foreign exchange.

However, as the country adjusts in its allocation of resources to an optimum level

of the bilateral trade, such diversion need not occur.

i.e.    Aid through trade is viewed in this framework as a sequential balancing of

bilateral trade where the aid component of tho donor country consists of net

interest foregone on the transaction and          the   loss factor involved in a repayment

which consists in commodities rather than convertible exchange.
