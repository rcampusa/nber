"The Potential Global and Developing Country Impacts of Alternative Emission Cuts and
Accompanying Mechanisms for the Post Copenhagen Process
Huifang Tian and John Whalley
NBER Working Paper No. 16090
June 2010, Revised June 2010
JEL No. F01,F51,Q54

                                              ABSTRACT

We report numerical simulation results using a multiyear global multi country modeling framework
which we use to assess the impacts of alternative emissions cuts which will likely come under consideration
for the process to follow the December 2009 UNFCCC negotiation in Copenhagen. The Copenhagen
Accord sets out prior country unilateral commitments, and provides a framework for further negotiation
of mutually agreed cuts. We also consider possible financial transfers under the Adaptation Fund and
possible trade linked border measures against non participants. Countries are linked not only through
shared impacts of global temperature change but also through trade among country subscripted goods.
We can thus evaluate the potential impacts of either explicit or implicit accompanying mechanisms
including funds/transfers, border adjustments, and tariffs. We calibrate the model to alternative BAU
damage scenarios largely as set out in the Stern report. The welfare impacts of both emission reductions
and accompanying measures are computed in Hicksian money metric equivalent form over alternative
potential commitment periods: 2012-2020, 2012-2030, and 2012-2050. We consider different depth,
forms, and timeframes for reductions by China, India, Russia, Brazil, US, EU, Japan and a residual
Row. Given the damage estimates we use all countries lose from joint reductions since their foregone
consumption is more costly than saved damage from reduced climate change. With the use of larger
damage estimates this reverses the depth of cut and allocation of cuts by country cause large differences
in impacts by country, while differences in form of cut (intensity, embedment) matter less. Accompanying
mechanisms also can make a large difference to participation decisions and especially for large population,
low wage, rapidly growing non OECD countries, but are costly for the OECD countries. This all suggests
that the bargaining set for the post Copenhagen process is very large, making an eventual jointly agreed
outcome difficult to achieve.

1 Introduction and policy context

       Negotiations on climate change arrangements as part of the shaping of a post
Kyoto/ post 2012 world concluded in Copenhagen in December 2009 in a 2 week end
to a negotiation initiated in Bali in late 2007 but are now scheduled to continue in
Mexico in late 2010. The result has been the Copenhagen Accord which only lists
prior unilateral commitments and attempts to move to a joint verification process,
but which also commits countries to further negotiation on deeper cuts. What is
involved is effectively the second round of negotiations under the 1994 United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which in the first round
produced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.2
       The post Copenhagen process will likely attempt to take this structure
significantly further through deeper cuts (25% ‐40% by 2020, and 80%‐95% by 2050
were indicated in the 2007 Bali meeting which launched the negotiation); a
broadened coverage to also include adaptation, mitigation, and finance; and all in an
effort to produce a fully inclusive outcome incorporating the large population, rapidly
growing economies of China, India, and Brazil who now, unlike in Kyoto, would also
take on commitments. These economies are large and with rapidly growing emissions
(and China poised to become the world’s largest emitter) are seen as key to global
mitigation. In the group of BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) they
played a key role in negotiating the Accord jointly with the US prior to its adoption
more widely.
       These countries have consistently argued both that as rapid growers and
relatively new to industrialization they should be treated differently from more
mature OECD countries, and that this was committed to under the Principle of
Common But Differentiated Responsibilities in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and also underlies the Annex 1 / non Annex
1 categorization in Kyoto. As a result, a range of proposals have emerged as to what
form any special developing country treatment should take as far as emissions
reductions are concerned. One is that any emissions reductions targets by countries
should be based on a single global target allocated to countries on a cumulative basis
rather than the current Kyoto annual emissions basis. Their argument is that
emissions in the upper atmosphere have mostly originated from OECD countries over
many years, and that emissions targets by country should reflect this. Another
argument is that emissions reduction targets should focus on reducing emissions
intensities (emissions/dollar of GDP) rather than emissions levels so as to allow more
2
  The Kyoto Protocol is relatively simple in structure. Countries are divided into two groups A and B; signatory
countries in Annex 1 agreed to reduce emissions by 2012 relative to 1990 base date emissions; Non Annex 1
countries (developing) took on no commitments. There were then accompanying emissions trading arrangements
(Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)) involving both groups.

                                                                                                               3
room for growth by rapidly growing developing countries. Yet another is that
emissions targets should be based on the carbon content of consumption of goods in
countries rather than geographical location of production. Under this approach,
exports (which embed carbon) would be deducted from GDP and imports added to
give the basis for country allocations of emissions reductions. Where countries run
large trade imbalances, such as the US and China, this could yield a potentially
significant difference. Finally, some developing countries argue that Common But
Differentiated Responsibilities implies preferential and lower emissions reduction
targets for them relative to OECD countries.
       But other features of potential joint emissions reductions also enter which can
also impact differentially on individual countries. A key one is the choice of base date
for calculating reductions with 1990 (the Kyoto data) being strongly preferred by
Russia (and the EU) due to negative (slow) growth between 1990 and today, and
2012 being strongly resisted by China for the opposite reason. And details within
issues such as with the use of intensity target, how GDP is calculated (using market
exchange rates or PPP for conversion into US$) matters.
       Finally, there is the use of accompanying financial arrangements through the
Adaptation and Innovation Funds, as well as possible trade measures against non
participants which can affect outcomes. Developing countries, as represented by the
GTT, consistently argued in Copenhagen for a large Fund to help them adapt to
climate change, at the top end of $300 billion per year by 2013. The Accord as agreed
talks of “working towards” a climate change Fund for developing countries of $100
billion per year by 2020. On the trade front, both the US (through the
Waxman‐Markey Bill) and the EU have in place legislation proposals for the use of
carbon emission based tariffs and export rebates affecting trade with non participant
countries.
       There is little or no quantitative model based evaluation work on the potential
welfare and other impacts of both these different proposals for mitigation. Here, we
report results on the impacts of these proposals on both the large population rapidly
growing economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil and the major OECD economies
of the US, the EU, and Japan using an N country N good modeling framework used
earlier by Cai, Riezman, and Whalley (2009). Their original use of the framework was
only used to explore whether international trade makes participation in climate
change negotiations more likely. Here we extend it to capture both different
mitigation targets and potential accompanying financial and trade related
mechanisms.
       In this framework, countries can set aside part of their potential consumption
available under a no mitigation business as usual (BAU) scenario and lower global


                                                                                      4
temperatures giving a utility gain, but at a utility cost in terms of foregone
consumption. We specify a temperature change function linking global temperature
change to emissions, and an abatement cost function which captures the marginal
cost of mitigation which, in turn, implies country resource or abatement costs of
emission reduction. This structure goes beyond the one good structure of the PAGE
model referenced in the Stern (2006) report which simply imputes an isoelastic
intertemporal utility function to forecast GDP damage. Unlike PAGE, the modeling
framework we use here enables us both to evaluate the effects of different
mitigation negotiation proposals using the model in counterfactual mode, and also
evaluate the potential impacts of accompanying inducements or penalties which
involve trade. We thus also include another side of special treatment for
developing countries in the post Copenhagen process, since the negotiation contains
both explicit elements and implicit indications as to how countries may be treated if
they do not fully participate in proposed emissions reductions.
       We use calibrations to alternative business as usual (BAU) scenarios, for
periods out to 2020 and 2030. We first use annual data for 2006 which we project to
synthetic (nonobserved) 2012 base data using 2000‐2006 country growth rates. We
then calibrate a temperature change function to Stern like BAU damage estimates of
both damage and temperature change out to 2050 and adopt abatement cost
estimates.
       Our results on these emissions reduction proposals suggest that given the
damage estimates from climate change the countries we consider will both
individually and collectively all lose from the climate reduction initiatives under
discussion in Copenhagen and so the issue for them is which form of mitigation
minimizes country losses. If we calibrate to larger damage cost estimates the pattern
changes to joint gains, but the relative picture across countries is much the same.
Our results emphasize the wider range of potential outcomes depending on the
formulae used to allocate cuts to countries, and hence a large bargaining set for the
post Copenhagen process which may make it difficult to conclude. The differences
between country allocations of emissions reductions based on cumulative and
annual emissions are especially large and this would seemingly continue to be a
major issue in negotiation. Other issues such as consumption or production as a basis
for cuts on the use of intensity targets have smaller but still pronounced impacts. The
same is true of a 1990 versus a 2012 base date for certain countries (Russia (1990),
China (2012), EU (1990)). Finally comes the issue of the relative depth of emissions
reduction between developed and developing countries. Here our results indicate
that each percentage point differentiation in cuts between developing and developed
countries significantly benefits developing countries.


                                                                                      5
       Our results on accompanying mechanisms suggest that the current indications
of size of accompanying funds are critical for developing countries. An Adaptation
Fund of $100 billion a year seems insufficient to induce participation, while $200
billion/year does seem sufficient. The costs to the developed countries, however, are
also large. Money, therefore, will be a key element in a joint arrangement, and the
ranges again are large. Border tax adjustments emerge as quantitatively relatively
less significant in impact. Here, effects depend on the size of border adjustment and
who undertakes them. Finally, trade sanctions (tariffs) can also have significant
effects but typically need to be large to convert loses from participation into country
gains from avoiding the sanction.
       The bottom line from these calculations would seem to be that while we use a
simple modeling structure and parameters are uncertain the potential ranges of
impacts of adopting alternative formula cuts, or using accompanying Funds or trade
mechanisms are very large. This points to a negotiation which may be difficult to
conclude, although the large political momentum behind the drive globally to
respond to climate change may be enough to reach conclusions despite this.




                                                                                      6
2. The Copenhagen Accord and the Post Copenhagen Negotiation to Come
      The current UNFCCC negotiations on climate change are the latest continuation
of a climate change negotiating process which has its origins in the UNFCCC, and
which evolved from the Earth Summit in 1992. The UNFCCC has only a vague
mandate for negotiation which only focuses on achieving the participation of
individual countries in joint discussions on climate change. These are thus few or no
constraints through agreed rules on the form that any mitigation takes. One concrete
element is the principle of ‘common yet differentiated responsibility’ for developing
countries, although the precise interpretation of this has remained vague, which has
also created later problems in the ongoing negotiation process (Tian & Whalley,
2008).
     Kyoto represented the first negotiating round within the overarching
constitutional mandate provided by the UNFCCC, much as the trade negotiating
rounds under the GATT from 1947 onwards built upon the constitutional structure
which the GATT provided. But unlike the GATT, there are no detailed articles
providing firm, clear rules for climate arrangements such as MFN and national
treatment. The vagueness of the negotiating mandate is something which has been
pointed to by many as an impediment to further agreed modification of emissions by
participating countries. It is also not clear within the UNFCCC structure how the
UNFCCC secretariat can move to a final determination of compliance with Kyoto
provisions. There are notifications of emissions by countries and discussions with the
UNFCCC, and the process can simply continue on with no mechanism for a firm
determination of emissions levels.
     Out of the initial Kyoto process, however, has emerged a follow on negotiating
process now focused on a post‐2012 regime, sometimes referred to as the post
Bali‐roadmap negotiations because of the meeting which took place in Bali which
launched these negotiations in December 2007. This occurred in COP13, with an
intermediate meeting of a COP14 in Poznan in the fall of 2008, and with the COPI5
negotiation held in December 2009 which produced the Copenhagen Accord. This
process aim to generate arrangements for a global environmental regime after 2012
for a extended period of time, possibly to 2020 or 2020 or even 2050. The December
2009 Copenhagen Accord has three central elements; a listing of unilateral
commitments by countries (to be completed within 2 years), a process of joint
verification (yet to be defined), and a commitment to work towards a climate change
Fund by 2020 to provide around $100 billion per year to developing countries. Some
see the agreement as lacking in firm commitment, but it also specifies an ongoing
negotiating process to achieve firmer commitments for a post 2012 world.
           As agreed in Bali, there are four elements to the continuing negotiation.


                                                                                     7
One is emissions reduction and mitigation, determining both the form and depth of
emissions reduction commitments. Another is adaptation mechanisms expanding
greatly on the existing Adaption Fund to facilitate the adaptation of the economies of
UN members to climate change. Third is innovation, expanding on a further fund to
promote the development of emissions reduction technologies either through
renewables or through more carbon‐efficient energy generation processes. Fourth is
trade and finance. This is, in principle, built around various estimates of the amount
of funding needed to achieve emissions reductions of the type foreseen, with a
central estimate of $45 trillion in financing required to cut emissions by 50% over the
implementation period out to 2050 produced by the International Energy Agency
(IEA) (IEA, 2008) for the 2001 Bali meeting. There are no formal negotiating elements
involved in trade and finance, although the border tax adjustment issues which are
discussed later fit within this broad rubric. The negotiation involves a COP negotiating
structure similar to the previous rounds of negotiation within the UNFCCC, and was
to be concluded in the two weeks of negotiation in Copenhagen which generated the
Accord, but now continues on to Mexico.
           This negotiation has faced and continues to face difficulties not only
because of the ongoing vagueness of the mandate and the imprecision of issues, but
also the sharp differences between developed and large developing countries in
terms of potential growth performance, their differences in historical rather than
annual emissions, and their developmental aspirations. A central issue in mitigation
is the depth of emissions cuts involved. There were efforts made by the EU in Bali to
build into the negotiating mandate precise figures, but these were left on a
recommended basis as a footnote suggesting possible ranges of 25‐40% cuts by 2020
and 80‐95% by 2050 to keep global temperature rises below 2°C as advised by IPCC.
But developing countries claim rights to growth and development and argue that
emissions reductions should not overly constrain their growth, and that any
emissions reductions should be asymmetric between the developed and the
developing countries.
         China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, as the larger of the emerging
economies and the more rapidly growing ones, were out of the negotiation in Kyoto
from which the Annex 1, Non Annex 1 structure emerged. The pressure has been on
these countries to be part of the post Bali process because they are the most rapidly
growing emitters and China is poised to become the world’s largest emitter of carbon.
This, in turn, has led to discussion of the basis for cuts as well as the depth of cuts, in
addition to cumulative vs annual emissions and the historical basis for cutting
developed countries want to continue to use annual emissions much as in the Kyoto
structure.


                                                                                         8
        There have been debates on the issue of intensity vs level calculations of
emissions. Intensity targets refer to calculations of emissions intensity relative to GDP,
the argument being that the use of emissions intensity as targets would allow room
for developing countries to grow, whereas level targets for rapidly growing
economies are inappropriate. China’s unilateral commitments are for a 40‐45%
reduction in intensity of emissions by 2020.
        A further issue involves the use of consumption rather than production as a
basis for emissions reductions, reflecting the Chinese focus on so‐called embedment.
The Chinese claim that perhaps 35% of emissions are already embodied in exports
and should be treated as emissions of importing countries rather than China.
        Behind these debates are differences in the interpretation of ‘common yet
differentiated responsibilities’ for emissions reduction, with sharply differing
interpretations circulating. Some of the developing countries argue that they should
be entitled to rights to growth and development, and if they undertake climate
commitments they should be compensated through financial transfers. Another
interpretation is that there should be differing forms of commitment for different
types of countries, perhaps with the developed countries taking on level
commitments and the developing countries taking on intensity based commitments.
        There are also issues circulating relating to contingent rather than firm
commitments. Chancellor Merkel, for instance, has suggested that there be targets
established for maximum temperature change, and whatever emissions reductions
are necessary to live within the targets for temperature change be implemented. She
has suggested that temperature change be restricted to no more than 2 degrees C by
2050 from the base year of 1990.
        Another set of negotiating issues involve enforcement and concerns raised by
the developing countries about the credibility of a second round of negotiation when
perhaps as many as 15 developed countries will be in violation of their first round
Kyoto commitments. This raises two issues: one is the determination of compliance
or non‐compliance, on which the present mandate is vague, and the second is how
any overhang of unfulfilled commitments from Kyoto will be dealt with post 2012.
The use of enforcement mechanisms including possibly a large fund has been
suggested which would be held in escrow, with contributions from countries only to
be returned to them once determinations have been made as to compliance, raising
issues of who makes such determinations and what data will be used. Other
proposals involve the entering of commitments into domestic law granting rights
allowing private parties to sue on the basis of violations of commitments.
        Trade and border tax adjustment issues enter these negotiations through
implicit linkage, with claims for their use coming from countries which see


                                                                                        9
themselves as going faster and further than other countries on climate change action,
particularly the EU and ,increasingly, the US. One argument is that some form of
compensation mechanism should be available for domestic producers because of the
cost disadvantages they face. The recent Waxman‐Markey bill in the US congress
would require exporters to the US to buy emission allowances if imports enter from
countries not matching US commitments. There are also issues of so‐called leakage,
other countries increasing emissions with the room created by countries taking on
more stringent commitments. The mechanisms under current discussion involve
trade barriers on imports from low commitment countries and subsidies on exports
to these countries to offset the cost differentials involved for domestic producers.
Some discussion has, however, gone beyond border adjustments with export rebates
to focus solely on tariffs based on carbon content. These are then defended as
consistent with the WTO exception (Article 20) for trade measures which defend
human life.
         Because of all the elements involved and the depth of country differences on
them and the sizes of potential impacts involved, the negotiation in Copenhagen was
difficult, and the resulting Copenhagen Accord facilitates the continuation of
negotiation. For the large developing economies, and particularly China and India,
the issue is which elements of these proposals they should concentrate on. Is it the
country allocation of reductions, the depth of reduction, the degree of asymmetry in
any commitments, or the form commitments take that is the most important? And
how severe are costs they face of potential penalties from their non participation
relative to the costs of compliance? And what size of financial compensation through
Adaption Funds might induce their participation?




                                                                                  10
3. A Modeling Framework for the Evaluation of Post Copenhagen Emissions
Reduction Options

        To analyze the potential impacts of the various negotiating possibilities we set
out in the preceding section, we have adapted a modeling framework used earlier by
Cai, Riezman, and Whalley (2009) and Tian and Whalley(2010) to analyze linkages
between trade, trade policy and climate change arrangements. Here we take this
framework further and use it to evaluate the impacts of alternative emissions
reduction mechanisms such as using a cumulative or annual emission basis, emission
intensity or emission level targets, carbon content of consumption or geographical
location of production, and focus the analysis on the large population rapidly growing
developing economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil. We also explore whether
border taxes, tariffs, and/or transfers and at what level make participation in these
climate change negotiations more likely.
3.1 Temperature change and top level country utility functions
        We analyze a single period of a number of years during which each national
economy is assumed to grow at a compounding constant rate3. Each country is
assumed in the period to be able to consume or export have one country
heterogeneous good whose potential consumption (or use) grows at this rate in the
base case. We assume that consumption of the good either by the country directly or
by others through trade generates emissions of carbon which in turn raise global
temperature. Countries receive positive utility from consumption, but negative utility
from temperature change. Countries export their own good and import other
country goods. If countries are small, their own actions have little or no effect on
temperature change. Countries have an upper bound on the use of their own good
reflecting a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario. If they use (consume or export) less
than the upper bound they experience less temperature change, as do all other
countries. The amount of resources needed to be put aside to achieve given
reductions reflects abatement cost estimates.
        As we will later work with the impacts of agreements to reduce carbon
emissions over a given period of time, we take the single period to cover alternative
horizons from 2012 out to 2020, 2030 or 2050. These reflect possible commitment
periods for a UNFCCC Agreement on a post 2012 world. In this multi year period, we
focus on changes in consumption (use of own and foreign goods) and utility, and
measure changes in these variables relative to the outcome of zero growth over the
period. We report changes in utility in money metric (Hicksian) form in US$ amounts.

3
   Because the model uses a single period, discounting does not formally enter the analytic structure. Discounting
does, however, arise with the use of a discount rate in calculating the discounted present value of GDP over the
model period. We consider cases in sensitivity analysis with a common discount rate of 1% across all countries,
since the growth rates of key OECD countries (EU, Japan) are low. See also the discussion of discounting and
climate change policy in Weitzman (2007) and Dasgupta (2008), and the key role discounting plays in the
conclusions of the Stern (2006) report.

                                                                                                               11
        The utility of each country over the period is reflected in a utility change
function relative to utility under zero growth with arguments given by its own
country change in composite consumption as well as the temperature change of the
world. The utility function is thus defined over multi year changes in consumption
and temperature change. Potential use of each country good thus reflects changes in
potential output from the economy over the same period. We first analyze a business
as usual (BAU) scenario which reflects current observed growth rates remaining
unchanged over the model period, and with no global or single country emissions
limitation initiatives in place.
        We initially assume the utility change function for each country has the form
                                                                   
                                           H  T 
         U i  U ( RCi , T )  RCi *  (     )                         (1)
                                             H    
        In this specification, ΔRCi represents the change in consumption for each
country i over the period. This is a composite of their own good and other country’s
goods which they acquire by importing other country’s goods and exporting their
own good. This provides the crucial link between trade, tariffs and sanctions and
emission reduction incentives used to explore the possible impacts of accompanying
measures for a UNFCCC post 2012 package.
        In this form, H can be thought of the global temperature change at which all
economic activity ceases (say 20oC). As ΔT approaches H, utility goes to zero and ΔT
goes to zero there is no welfare impact of temperature change. Utility change over
any model period increases as temperature change falls.
        The share parameter β determines the severity of damage (in utility terms)
from any given temperature change. We later calibrate the model to various damage
estimates from business as usual global temperature change reported by Stern (2006)
and Mendelsohn (2007), and this procedure determines β. For simplicity, we assume
β is the same value across countries.
        Global temperature change, in turn, is determined by the change in carbon
emissions over the period across all countries in the model. We adopt a simple
temperature change function and assume that emissions by each country equal the
change in consumption times country emissions intensity (emissions/GDP) so as to
allow for differing emissions intensities by country. Defining the emissions intensity
of country i as ei, we use a power function (2) for global temperature change due to
changes in emissions by all countries over the model period.

good for each country i. 4 In the central case formulation of the model, ei is

  Ideally, this power function should have the property that there is increasing marginal impact on temperature
change for progessive increases in consumption, i.e., b > 1. We however calibrate this function to estimates of
temperature change of 3oC by 2030 and 5oC by 2050 given in the Stern (2006) report, which jointly implies b < 1.

                                                                                                               12
exogenous and fixed at its 2006 base case levels. Consumption of each country good
by all countries is less than or equal to ΔRSi; and ΔRSi is less than or equal to the
upper bound RSi associated with the base case scenario since countries can
choose to participate in emission reductions initiatives. The typical scenario we
consider is where countries in the model can commit to emission reductions which
are a given percentage of their RSi . We thus also conduct sensitivity analyses in
which the ei change over time to reflect increased efficiency of energy use over
time. When we also consider accompanying trade and finance mechanisms,
developing countries then have the option of joining with the same or differentially
negotiated percentage reduction (and also possibly receiving transfers) or not joining
(and possibly facing border adjustments and/or tariffs).




                                                                                    13
3.2 Composite consumption goods by country
        In this structure, a carbon reduction commitment by a single country implies
a reduction in composite consumption, and this has both negative and positive
effects on utility change for all countries over the model period. On the one hand, a
reduction in consumption lowers utility for the consuming country, but on the other
hand, country consumption reductions lower global emissions and hence world
temperature change, and increase the utility both of the country reducing emissions
and all other countries.
        The composite consumption good RCi is a CES function of domestic and
imported consumption goods, similar to that used in nested CES Armington trade
models (see Whalley (1985)). The model is thus effectively an Armington N good N
country pure trade economy in which the endowment is variable.
       The RCi are determined by solving the country optimization problems.

          The composition of M i is determined by a third level of nesting in the
model, and pim is a price index of seller’s prices piw (see equation (9)). I i is
country income and is given by sales of own good RSi at the world price piw .
Unlike in a conventional Armington trade model, RSi is endogenous and also the
outcome of a discrete choice optimization problem involving participation or non
participation in the climate change agreement.

3.3 Composites of Imported Goods
       The CES import composites M i are composites of imported goods from
each supplying country. Given that each country has one good it can sell, but N‐1
goods it imports, the CES composite of other goods define the import composite, and

3.4 Trade Equilibrium
       Given values of RSi , a trade equilibrium is given by prices p1w ,..., pNw for
which global markets clear, i.e.

        j i

       The RSi take on the values RSi in the base case and one of two values
in counterfactual analyses. RSi can be the implied reduction in RSi for
countries meeting emissions reduction commitments. Alternatively, RSi is equal
to RSi for non OECD countries if they do not participate.
         In this structure, when countries participate in a global climate agreement, if
they reduce emissions by reducing GDP there will be general equilibrium
implications for all prices and quantities. Importantly, if there are accompanying
mechanisms, tariffs against countries will cause the price of their own good i to fall
giving a terms of trade loss for the country not making the emission reduction. This
will, in turn, increase the willingness of countries to participate in global emission
reductions negotiations. Transfers do not exert this direct term of trade effect
through a relative price intervention, but as countries receiving transfers spend most
of their income on their own good, in the calibrated Armington structure a terms of
trade effect will come into play through income effects.
3.5 Costs of Mitigation
      A further key element in the model is the cost of mitigating damage from
climate change through emission reduction, or abatement costs. We capture these in
a simple mitigation cost function where country mitigation costs are a linear constant
marginal cost function of use of own good (consumption plus export). Stern (2006)


                                                                                                                                            15
places these costs for a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 at 1% of GDP±3%. We
use a central case estimate of 2.5% and then use sensitivity ranges for this key
parameter. The mitigation (abatement) cost function can be written as;
              (Ei  Ei )
    MCi                  RSi                                            (11)
                 Ei
where MCi are the mitigation costs of country i for emissions mitigation of an
amount given by ( Ei (base case) ‐ Ei (new emission)). Ei are the new
emissions implied by the reduction and Ei are the emissions changes along the
            (Ei  Ei )
BAU path.                is thus the proportional change in emissions.  is the
               Ei
emission reduction cost factor linking the proportional change in emissions to use of
resources. We set  equal to 0.025 in the base case, and conduct the sensitivity
analyses with parameter values of 0.01 and 0.04.
3.6 Model Extensions
       We use the model to analyze different counterfactuals relative to the BAU
scenario. For emissions reductions of various forms we compute counterfactuals over
the chosen period.
       There are, however, some experiments we conduct with the simulation
structure which require extensions to the basic model form. One arises where we
evaluate the impacts of using intensity targets in a simple uncertainty extension of
the model, since in the certainty case the two instruments are typically equivalent in
impact. We also incorporate trade policies and transfers to evaluate the possible
impacts of accompanying trade and/or finance mechanisms and modify the model
appropriately.
Uncertainty
      The model captures uncertainty in a simple way by considering three alternative
growth scenarios: high growth, low growth and BAU growth and computing a
different base case (no emission reduction) scenario for each. For each scenario we
first compute utility and consumption of goods by region. We then introduce
different level and intensity emission targets for the various growth scenarios. We
first treat an emission level target case as a given percentage reduction in use of own
good in the country making the emission reduction, and then compute an equivalent
country emission intensity reduction which gives the same expected emission
reduction under the emission level target, given the BAU output of each country. We
can then compute the model utility change under high, low and BAU growth
scenarios respectively for each of the emissions targets, and compare expected utility
for high and low growth scenarios across the two targets to assess the impact of
using intensity targets. This extension allows us to analyze the relative country
attractiveness of intensity versus level targets for emissions reduction given that in

                                                                                     16
the certainty case they are equivalent.
Trade Related Penalties and Financial Incentives for Countries to Participate in
Negotiations

       The model can also be extended to capture border tax adjustments, tariffs,
and financial transfers as penalties or inducements to participate in negotiations.
The size of transfers, either as a percentage of recipient country GDP or of donating
country GDP, or as an amount in $ transferred from developed countries is treated as
exogenous, but can be varied in counterfactual analyses. Tariffs and border
adjustments apply to the prices of goods crossing national borders and generate
revenues. Trade imbalances (including transfers) are exogenous in the model.




                                                                                   17
4. Data and Model Calibration
      We use calibration to a temperature change function for prospective changes
in temperature under business as usual scenarios, out to 2020, 2030 and 2050. These
correspond to possible commitment periods in a UNFCCC agreement. In this, we use
varying estimates of associated damage over the ranges reported by Stern (2006) and
Mendelsohn (2007) and abatement cost estimates as in Stern (2006). We use an 8
country grouping, of Brazil, Russia, India, China, US, EU, Japan, and the Rest of the
World (ROW). We construct a BAU growth profile using forward projections of 2006
data, and model calibration to this profile determines key model parameters.

4.1 Data Sources
     We use GDP growth as the measure of potential change in consumption by
country over the period of analysis. Because of our analysis of intensity as well as
level targets we use three growth scenarios: high, BAU and low growth rates. We first
assume that under the different (BAU, high, low) growth scenarios, country growth
rates in the period 2006‐2050 remain unchanged over the whole period. Data for
2012 are forward projected based on the basis of data for 2006 and provide the
reference base case. We use averaged data between 2000 and 2006 as country
growth rates. We have three components in our data for each growth scenario:
projected base case data in 2012, cumulative data for 2020, 2030, 2050 given high,
BAU and low growth rates, and cumulative data over the period relative to the base
year for the same three growth scenarios.
     China, India, Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and the Rest of the World (Row) are
assumed to have BAU growth rates of 0.09, 0.07, 0.07, 0.032 0.026, 0.020, 0.17, and
0.30 respectively, given by average growth rates of 2000 to 2006 (data from World
Bank website). We then use the BAU growth path data to calibrate the temperature
change function using estimated BAU temperature change over the period drawing
on key literature sources, including Stern (2006) and Mendelsohn (2007). This implies
that in high growth scenarios emissions are larger and also temperature change is
higher. Table 1 reports the 2006 output and emissions data used in our projections,
and the growth rates used.
     Preferences towards goods and temperature change are determined for each
country using alternative damage estimates from the same sources.

4.2 Calibration of Model Parameters
     We use data on consumption and trade for OECD and BRIC economies and along
with country growth profiles analyze various damage and temperature change
assumptions as business as usual (BAU) scenarios. We undertake numerical
investigation with our analytical structure using calibration to determine model
parameters values followed by counterfactual analyses of various forms. The base
data are for 3 different periods 2012‐2020, 2012‐2030 and 2012‐2050 with assumed
yearly growth rates over the period.
    We first discuss the calibration of preference parameters. According to the Stern
Review (2005), Mendelssohn (2006) and other literature, the damage cost from
emissions on BAU paths range from 1 to 20% of GDP out to 2050. We treat damage
from climate change in the model as a utility change of the same proportion over the
same time and use it to calibrate the preference parameters in the model.
    Without temperature change, the utility function is:
              Ui*  RCi                                         (12)
     And with damage we have :
                            H  T 
             U i* / U i  (       )                           (13)
                              H
    With temperature change, there will thus be a utilities loss from damage. We
can thus calibrate  using equation (13) above for given different values of H. For
illustration purposes, in Table 2 we report calibrated  values for a time period of 50
years as the base case. In our simulation analysis, we use H=10 as the base case, and
perform sensitivity analysis with H=20 and H=30.
     The temperature change function is written as a function of emission changes
                                                                                                             19
over the same period, and we treat it as a power function of total emission (not
output) change for the world:
             T  a ( Ei )b                        (14)
                             i

    Based on the findings from Stern (2006), we assume the BAU path of emissions
will lead to about 3 degree temperature increases around the year 2030, and near 5
degree by around 2050. For simplicity, we assume that zero growth in the global
economy will lead to no temperature change.
      With the data on growth rates and emission intensities for each country under
the BAU growth scenarios, we can then calibrate the parameters a and b. We have
data for year 2006 and projections of emissions and output data for 2030 and 2050.
We choose 2006 as the base year, and assume that 25 years later, that is by 2030, the
global average temperature will increase by 3 degrees, and 5 degrees by 2050. We
assume that the BAU path implies output growth for each country comparable to
that of 2000‐2006, while emission intensities are unchanged from 2006. Table 2
reports the calibrated values of a and b.6
      We are able to relax this assumption to allow for autonomous (exogenous)
improvements in energy efficiency (intensity) overtime.

4.3 Emissions Reductions
      Table 3 reports the percentage emissions reductions over the commitment
period 2012‐2020 implied by different allocation rules, as well as projected 2020
emissions. In the case of cumulative emissions based reductions, we use an upper
bound on emission reductions of 50%. Given China’s high growth, China accounts for
over 50% of global emissions by 2020, and so how different reductions affect China is
critical. Large difference occur using cumulative rather than annual emissions with
only small differences with consumption. The choice of a base data of 1990 over
2012 also makes a large difference.

        5. Model Results on Impacts of Emission Reductions
            We evaluate the impacts of alternative emissions reductions. We first consider
       cases involving all countries under the different apportionment of global reductions
       set out in Table 3. We then later consider accompanying mechanisms being used in
       which we assume participation of the OECD countries and with participation of non
       OECD countries linked to trade sanctions, border tax adjustment or financial transfers.
       This enables us to assess how large these have to be to induce participation.
             We first use the modeling framework set out above to make calculations of the
       welfare impacts of emissions reductions in Hicksian money metric form (in $billion
       over the commitment period) by country. These are reported in Table 4 for a 30%
       equip report and reduction by all countries by 2020 and a 30% reduction by 2030. In
       these results, given the damage cost estimate of 5% by 2050 used from Stern (2006)
       all countries lose from participation in climate arrangements for all three periods out
       to 2020, 2030 and 2050. For reductions out to 2020 the largest losses occur for the
       US and ROW, followed by the EU and Japan. For 50% reductions by 2030 losses
       increase for China due to their higher growth rate, but fall for the US and the EU due
       to restrained growing emissions in China and India.

      Table 5 then reports welfare impacts by country for similar global 30%
proportional cuts in emissions by 2020 but withy changed model assumptions. We
first change the assumed BAU damage cost estimates used in model calibration. If we
lower damage cost estimates to 5% of GDP from 10% of GDP country losses increase
as consumption losses remain, but benefits of slowed global warming fall. If we
increase climate change estimates to 20% of GDP, gains accrue to all countries as the
benefits of slowed global warming increases. If we lower assumed temperature
change, the benefits of slowed global warming fall. If we discount GDP growth at 1%
and 0.5% for non OECD and OECD respectively, losses fall as the size of economies
shrinks. Using PPP measures for GDP increases losses in China and India as their
economies are proportionally larger.

          In Table 6 we report the impacts of alternative country allocation procedures for
          emissions reductions which keep the same global total of a 30% global emissions
          reduction by 2020. The results indicate sharp changes by country in impacts as
          different allocations are used. Changes to 1990 have nearly doubled the losses of
          both China and India as the high growth economies, while losses of slower growing
          US and EU fall sharply. Using historical emissions over the period 1900‐2012 makes a
          dramatic difference to both India and China whose losses nearly disappear. Losses to
          the US and the EU both nearly double. Changing to a consumption basis from
          production makes relatively little difference to country impacts. The use of
          differential cuts for OECD and non OECD is progressively more advantageous to China,
          India, Brazil and Russia and disadvantageous to the US and the EU.
               In Table 7 we report the sensitivity of model results as to welfare impacts by
          country for a 30% proportional cut in emissions. We vary alternative sets of key
          model parameter values. Varying trade elasticities for all countries together has little
          impact on model results. Varying damage costs, as above has larger impacts and with
          a 20% damage cost estimate losses become gains. Varying the temperature change
          upper bound has little impact.

Table 8 reports the impacts of 30% proportional cuts by 2020 and 50% proportional
cuts by 2030 on country GDP and country imports. The impacts on country GDP
reflect the cost consumption due to emissions reductions. Under a 30%
equi‐proportional cut the percent reductions in consumption are similar. Changes in
country imports mirror these falls since in this model countries only trade a single
good and so relative price effects of carbon pricing on energy intensive non intensive
goods are excluded.

Table 9 reports results for the welfare impacts over the period 2012 to 2020 of
alternative accompanying funds of varying sizes which accompany the emissions
reductions. These funds are assumed to be transferred over the period 2012 to 2020.
With transfers of approximately $150 billion per year totaling $1.2 trillion over the
eight year period losses of India disappear and for China, Russia and Brazil losses
become negligible. Losses to the US, EU and Japan who finance the transfer double.
Even larger redistributions occur when transfers at a rate of $200 billion per year
occur over the same period. These results thus highlight the critical role that can be
played by transfers of resources in facilitating developing country participation in the
post Kyoto process.

             Table 10 presents results which report welfare impacts by country of 30%
        equiproportional emissions reductions being accompanied by alternative trade
        related mechanisms involving tariffs and export rebates in the OECD. The first row
        reports welfare impacts from a case where emissions reductions are limited to the US,
        EU, Japan and the ROW. In these cases China, India, Russia and Brazil all benefit from
        slowed climate change.
             These gains then fall as various measures of increasing severity are applied
        against them. 20% and 30% tariffs induce China to participate by inflicting net losses,
        all 10% and 30% tariffs play the same role for Brazil. Impacts of border adjustments
        are less pronounced due to the export subsidy rebates involved.

        6. Concluding Remarks
             This paper presents numerical simulation results for a multi‐country model
        which allows the analysis of country welfare impacts of global carbon emission
        reduction situations which may follow in the post Copenhagen process of negotiating
        a post Kyoto/post 2012 world. In the model goods consumption and temperature
        change both enter utility functions, and countries jointly benefit from the emissions
        reductions of others. Trade effects enter through the heterogeneity of country goods,
        and consumption reducing emissions reductions have terms of trade effects.
             The model is calibrated to alternative Business as Usual (BAU) scenarios out to
        2020 and 2030. Counterfactual exercises are then conducted around these various
        BAU scenarios. Results stress the large changes which occur in country impacts as
        alternative formulae are utilized. This indicates a large bargaining set for the post
        Copenhagen negotiation. Further results highlight the role to be potentially played by
        financial transfers and trade based sanctions.
