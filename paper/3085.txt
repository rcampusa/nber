     EVALUATING PENSION POLICIES IN A MODEL WITH ENDOGENOUS CONTRIBUTIONS


                                     ABSTRACT

    A model of the firm and its pension plan is used to simulate the first

round effects of pension policies.    Pension policies create an imbalance in

the pension fund which affects the level of pension contributions and

ultimately wages.   Changes in the differential between compensation and

productivity for individual workers alter the distributions of compensation

and of incentives for retirement, mobility and effort.    Policies

investigated include those regulating vesting, pension calculations for

early leavers, early retirees and late retirees, maximum service credits,

liabilities at termination, and funding practices.
