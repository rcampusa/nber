The "Thin Film Of Gold": Monetary Rules and Policy Credibility In Developing Countries

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper asks whether developing countries can reap credibility gains from submitting policy to
a strict monetary rule. Following earlier work, we look at the gold standard era (1880-1914) as a "natural
experiment" to test whether adoption of a rule-based monetary framework such as the gold standard
increased policy credibility. On the basis of the largest possible dataset covering almost sixty independent
and colonial borrowers in the London market, we challenge the traditional view that gold standard
adherence worked as a credible commitment mechanism that was rewarded by financial markets with
lower borrowing costs. We demonstrate that in the poor periphery -- where policy credibility is a particularly
acute problem -- the market looked behind "the thin film of gold". Our results point to a dichotomy:
whereas country risk premia fell after gold adoption in developed countries, there were no credibility
gains in the volatile economic and political environments of developing countries. History shows that
monetary policy rules are no short-cut to credibility in situations where vulnerability to economic and
political shocks, not time-inconsistency, are overarching concerns for investors.

Monetary policy can be used to achieve short-term objectives such as boosting economic

activity, lowering unemployment or financing budget deficits. If the market anticipates policy

makers’ temptation to resort to surprise actions and doubts the commitment to sound policies, it

will rationally demand to be compensated for this risk. In an environment of low policy

credibility, interest rates will be higher than they ought to be. This is a short version of the well-

known time-inconsistency theorem of monetary policy first pointed out by Kydland and Prescott

(1977) and elaborated by Barro and Gordon (1983). On the other hand, if policy credibility is

high, the expectations of the public remain well anchored even in the face of adverse conditions

as markets will not expect policy makers to put medium-run macroeconomic stability at risk.

Achieving and maintaining policy credibility is hence a crucial task for monetary policy-makers

around the world.

       While the advantages of credibility are evident, it is much less clear how credibility can

be built in developing countries whose economies are often subject to shocks and have little

reputational track record to build credibility on. A theoretically appealing solution in such cases

is to pre-commit policy to a binding rule. Such a policy rule would tie the hands of politicians

who might otherwise be prone to use monetary policy for short-run gains in output or to run

excessive fiscal deficits. In this line of thought, the adoption of a currency board or a comparable

rule-based framework would reduce the risks faced by investors, encouraging them to lend more

at lower rates. In particular, policy makers in the developing world could enhance credibility in

the eyes of international markets by importing stability from abroad (Velasco, 2000). In the past

decade developing countries have often been advised to opt for a ‘hard peg’ or a free float to

avoid the credibility pitfalls of intermediate currency regimes (Calvo and Mishkin, 2003).

       Bordo and Kydland were the first to argue that in the first era of financial globalization,

between 1880 and 1914, the gold standard worked as a binding policy rule (Bordo and Kydland,

1995) – subject to certain contingent escape clauses. The testable hypothesis derived from this
                                                1
new interpretation of the gold standard was that countries that had adopted the gold standard

should, ceteris paribus, have been charged lower interest rates in the international capital market.

A well-known empirical study confirmed this proposition (Bordo and Rockoff, 1996). The key

finding was that the market considered adherence to the gold standard as a sign of financial

rectitude – a credible commitment to “good [financial] housekeeping” – and charged lower risk

premia on the foreign loans of gold standard countries than on the loans of countries not on gold.

Lower risk premia in turn went hand in hand with massive capital flows from the center to the

periphery (Obstfeld and Taylor, 2004; Schularick; 2006). Another recent study by Obstfeld and

Taylor summarises this view of the gold standard as a successful policy rule:

        Gold was apparently a good enough seal of approval by itself, and risk was priced

        without much reference to public debt levels, the terms of trade, or whether the country

        was part of the British Empire. (Obstfeld and Taylor, 2003b, p. 260)

        However, until now the empirical defense of rule-based solutions to credibility problems

comes mainly from economic history. Contemporary tests of the credibility effects of hard pegs

have brought mixed results. While Carlson and Valev (2001) underline the positive effects in the

case of Bulgaria, other authors have pointed out that the effects vary according to political and

economic conditions (Guidotti and Vegh, 1999; Mulino, 2002; de la Torre et al., 2003; Blomberg

et al., 2005).

        In this paper, we shall test the hypothesis that the gold standard era demonstrates the

beneficial effects of rule-bound monetary policy, using a new and comprehensive data set. Our

particular emphasis will be on developing countries, where credibility problems tend to be most

acute and where policy advice is most problematic. The present paper hence relates closely to

two strands of the recent literature in international economics. First, we aim to contribute to the

debate on the credibility of hard currency pegs in developing countries (Carlson and Valev,

2001, Feuerstein and Grimm, 2006; Blomberg et al., 2005). Second, we also reconsider the role

of the gold standard and other factors as the drivers of financial globalization and massive capital
                                                2
flows from rich to poor economies before 1914 (Ferguson, 2004; Flandreau and Zumer, 2004;

Clemens and Williamson, 2004; Mitchener and Weidenmier, 2005; Ferguson and Schularick,

2006). Our key question is: Did the gold standard indeed work as a monetary policy rule with

significant positive effects on policy credibility in the periphery?

          We follow previous studies by looking for credibility effects in country risk premia in the

international market before and after adoption of the gold standard.1 We regress country risk

premia on a series of economic and political indicators for creditworthiness and look to a gold

standard variable to determine whether gold adoption had statistically significant effects on the

risk perception of international investors. The paper makes a number of new contributions to the

debate.

          First, we have assembled the most comprehensive database to date covering almost the

entire universe of developing country borrowing in the London capital market before 1914. Our

sample is about three times larger than those of previous studies. The dataset, which was

assembled by hand from contemporary publications, covers interest rates and economic control

variables for close to sixty borrowers in the London capital market between 1880 and 1913. In

contrast to previous datasets that focused on the narrower Atlantic economy, ours allows us to

pay special attention to the experience of developing countries (as defined by their relative state

of economic development). Second, we reconsider, integrate and move beyond the methodology

of previous studies. We are able to reproduce some earlier results, but also cover two neglected

issues. We single out countries that moved from a paper standard to gold, as opposed to

“switching” from silver (or bimetallism) to gold. We also ask if the market rewarded gold

adherence not immediately, but only after a period of successful adhesion. Third, while ensuring

comparability of our econometric approach with previous studies, we propose to move beyond

  An analysis of the interest rate spread between foreign and local currency bonds can be found in Mitchener and
Weidenmier (2007). Their (preliminary) results suggest that local and foreign rates did not converge after gold
adoption, hence currency risk remained prominent. However, the assumption of identical default risk on local and
international debt is debatable.

standard static panel models and estimate a dynamic system generalized methods of moment

(GMM) model, which allows us to model risk-perception as a Bayesian updating of country risk

while taking account of potential endogeneity of some regressors.2

        Our investigation proceeds in four steps. The first section reviews the original hypothesis

that adherence to the gold standard worked as a credible commitment mechanism and describes

the criticisms it has encountered. Section 2 presents our dataset and introduces the estimation

strategy. Section 3 contains the empirical heart of this paper. We first reproduce the findings of

some previous studies, before moving on to new estimations for our complete sample and for

various sub-samples of developed and developing countries. Our findings here suggest that the

market’s assessment of gold standard adherence as a “good housekeeping seal of approval”

varied between country groups. Most importantly, there is no evidence that the gold standard

offered a short-cut to policy credibility for the poor periphery. While we confirm a modest gold

effect in the core economies, in developing countries the market looked behind “the thin film of

gold”.3 Section 4 asks why gold standard membership did not work as credible commitment

mechanism in the periphery. We argue that in view of the economic and political instability of

poor economies the market anticipated that the rule was not likely to be sustained in view of

adverse economic and political circumstances. Section 5 concludes that earlier doubts on the

credibility effect of the hard currency peg expressed, inter alia, by Eichengreen and Hausmann

(1999), Ferguson (2003b), and Flandreau and Zumer (2004) were partly justified. The

explanation for the low risk premia charged to developing borrowers in the sovereign bond

market before World War One must go beyond monetary commitments to include not just

economic fundamentals but also the political determinants of creditworthiness.



2
  An exception here are Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) who estimated a model using the Arellano-Bond difference
estimator, whereas we propose the newer system estimator by Arellano and Bover (1995) who alleviates some of the
shortcomings with regard to instrument validity using the difference estimator.

  The phrase is J. H. Clapham’s, quoted in Sayers, Bank of England, vol. I, p. 9. Clapham was referring to the small
size of the Bank of England’s gold reserve, but the phrase is suggestive of a wider point, namely that the gold
standard’s credibility depended on much more than formal commitments by monetary authorities.

                         I. The “good housekeeping” hypothesis and its critics



The degree of financial integration reached before 1914 was truly impressive. In the decades

before World War I, Britain exported on average between four and five percent of her gross

national product abroad, while capital-importing economies could run current account deficits of

even higher magnitudes for many years, even decades. Foreign investments in relation to gross

domestic product (GDP) in 1913 stood at about 200 percent in Argentina, Chile and South

Africa, and at or above 100 percent in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, and Malaysia –

about twice as high as the corresponding figures today (Twomey, 2000). About 40 percent of the

total volume of British capital flows between 1880 and 1913 went to countries other than the

comparatively rich settler economies. Today, by contrast, only 10–15 percent of global capital

market flows reach countries classified as less developed by the World Bank (Schularick, 2006).

        It seems likely that the spread of globalization and the deepening of capital markets in

this period was, in other words, at least partly due to perception of low country risks by

European financial investors.4 Following the pioneering study by Bordo and Rockoff in 1996,

students of the pre-World War I global financial market have argued that the credibility (and

hence risk-reducing) effects of hard-currency pegs were part of the success story. After

controlling for other determinants of the risk perception of investors, Bordo and his collaborators

found that being on gold conferred a significant credibility bonus. Based on the experience of

nine non-Western European countries and colonies, Bordo and Rockoff showed that “all other



4
  A more general “push-side” argument stresses the positive effects of the international gold standard on capital
market integration. By decreasing exchange rate volatility in the core, the gold standard reduced uncertainty and
transaction costs and led to deeper financial markets, see Bordo and Rockoff (1996) and Ferguson (2003b). The gold
standard also reduced inflation expectations and thus led to very low nominal long-term interest rate levels in the
core. The focus here is on the gold standard as a commitment mechanism in the recipient countries, hence as a
“pull” factor.
                                                       5
things equal, the rate on a gold bond would be 40 basis points lower if the country were on the

gold standard” (Bordo and Rockoff, 1996, p. 413). The market’s preference for the gold standard

thus provided an incentive to join the gold standard and stick to it, thereby contributing to the

dynamic extension of the gold standard (Meissner, 2003).

        Another recent test of the Bordo-Rockoff hypothesis has been carried out by Maurice

Obstfeld and Alan Taylor (Obstfeld and Taylor, 2003b). With yield data for 21 borrowers, their

findings rely on a larger sample than that of Bordo and Rockoff. In their empirical analysis of

yield spreads they find gold standard adherence to have cut spreads by up to 30 basis points

before the war. Moreover, Obstfeld and Taylor find that the credibility effect of gold adherence

was strong enough to overrule even the most important solvency indicator – the relative burden

of public debt:

        In the sovereign bond market before 1914, the gold standard did indeed confer a “seal of

        approval”, whereas two key macro fundamentals, the public debt and the terms of trade,

        seem to have mattered little, if at all.(Obstfeld and Taylor, 2003b, p.275)

        Other authors, however, have arrived at different conclusions. Using a dataset of 17

mostly European countries, Marc Flandreau and Frédéric Zumer “rejected the conventional view

that the exchange rate regime (participation to the gold standard) mattered in facilitating the

global circulation of capital in the late 19th century.” (Flandreau and Zumer, 2004, p.56) Their

gold dummy was either statistically insignificant or had the “wrong” sign, suggesting that the

enlargement of the gold club played little, if any, part in the interest rate convergence of the pre-

1914 period.5 But what mattered to investors if not gold? According to Flandreau and Zumer, the

answer is a combination of fiscal policy and economic “fundamentals” – to be precise, public

debt service as a ratio of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation (in sum, the real debt




5
  However, Flandreau and Zumer include a variable for exchange rate volatility. It is not implausible to assume that
this variable was highly correlated to the gold standard variable.
                                                       6
burden).6 In their study on the impact of colonial affiliation on risk perception, Ferguson and

Schularick (2006) also found no significant risk reduction attributable to gold standard

adherence. Mitchener and Weidenmier (2007), too, found little evidence that gold standard

adherence lowered the currency risk implied by differences between interest rates on local and

foreign currency denominated debt.

        How can we account for such divergent empirical interpretations? Three possibilities

come to mind. An important part of the problem could simply be the gold “coding” issue; quite

apart from methodological differences, there are simple disagreements about when a particular

country was actually “on gold”. For example, it is far from clear even in the cases of well-

researched economies such as Austria and Italy, both of which “shadowed” the gold standard

without having fully convertible currencies. It is even harder to be sure for smaller economies for

which there is less readily accessible evidence about convertibility clauses and exchange rates.

There is therefore a subjective element to retrospective identifications of “on gold” and “off

gold” countries, especially when these are inferred ex post from exchange rates.

        The empirical specification could also be at the roots of disagreements. In the absence of

a well-specified model including an appropriate set of control variables, the gold standard

dummy may simply be a proxy for other omitted variables. The Japanese gold adoption in 1897

provides an illustration of this problem.7 Conventional current-yield data show a reduction of

more than 200 basis points between 1896 and 1897. As other fundamentals such as public debt,

the budget deficit or the level of development remained by and large the same, a regression will

give the full credit of that reduction to the gold standard variable. However, the year of the

adoption of the gold standard was also the culmination of a long process of political and

economic reform in the Meiji era, the success of which was demonstrated by Japan’s military



6
  This interpretation is not wholly incompatible with the one put forward by Bordo and Rockoff. If gold standard
adherence worked as an incentive mechanism for sound policy, it may also have contributed to improvements in
fundamentals. However, doubts about the disciplining effect on policy are expressed in Mosley (2003).

  For a detailed discussion see Sussman and Yafeh (2001) and Flandreau and Zumer (2004, p. 24).

victory over China in 1895. The same year saw a successful debt conversion. Arguably, these

factors could have mattered more than the switch to gold convertibility in driving down Japanese

yields.8

        Previous studies have included quite different sets of control variables. Some authors

have opted for a “historical” approach relying only on data available to contemporaries

(Ferguson, 2001; Flandreau and Zumer, 2004). Others have preferred a “modern” approach

incorporating later data reconstructions such as GDP and ratios of public debt to GDP. The

underlying methodological question is whether market risk perception should best be modeled

inductively on the basis of indicators that were available to contemporaries, or deductively

according to the predictions of today’s economic models – on an “as if” basis, so to speak – at

the risk of anachronism.

        Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is the question of sampling. Previous studies

relied on data for a relatively small number of countries – nine in the case of Bordo and Rockoff,

17 for Obstfeld and Taylor, 21 for Flandreau and Zumer) – whereas more than sixty independent

states, dominions and colonies had hard-currency government bonds listed at the London Stock

Exchange between 1880 and 1914. At the same time, the samples in previous studies were

geographically diverse, being either predominantly “Atlantic” (Bordo and Rockoff) or skewed

towards the European periphery (Flandreau and Zumer). The inclusion of colonies alongside

independent countries is another important issue. It is, for example, not obvious why gold

standard adoption should be assumed to have had the same impact on a British colony – where it




8
  A common problem underlying all previous (and our own) is that of regime selection. The decision to introduce a
monetary regime like the gold standard may have been endogenously determined, that is, dependent on certain
fundamentals that needed to be in place before a country could adopt the gold standard. The impact of gold adoption
should thus be interpreted cautiously. It is not independent of other factors, “but merely a partially unconditional
average benefit accruing to countries in a position to adopt the gold standard.” (Obstfeld and Taylor, (2003b). Yet in
many respects the question whether a tangible economic benefit from gold adoption could be derived for the
relatively large pool of countries whose economies fulfilled the basic prerequisites for gold standard adoption
remains interesting in its own right. In practice, a rule bound monetary regime is often implemented under dire
circumstances, so that the problem of regime selection could be less prevalent.

often came as by-product of a de facto currency union with the United Kingdom – as on an

independent Latin American state.




                                        II. Data and estimation strategy



To solve these empirical puzzles, it is necessary to have an encompassing dataset with a broad

range of control variables, including those of previous studies. With spreads of gold- or sterling-

denominated sovereign bonds for 34 independent countries and 23 British colonies at annual

frequency as well as almost all the economic controls used in previous studies, our dataset is the

most comprehensive that has yet been constructed.9 The yield data for the period 1880–1913

were collected by hand from The Investor’s Monthly Manual and The London Stock Exchange

Weekly Intelligence, and refer to long-term (typically over ten years) bonds that were actively

traded in the secondary market and had quotations for at least three years in a row.10 The bulk of

the historical economic control variables was also collected by hand from contemporary

publications such as The Statesman’s Yearbook, Fenn’s Compendium, and the Annual Reports of

the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders.11 We used some data from modern statistical

compilations (such as Mitchell’s volumes), but only when those were also available to

nineteenth-century investors. However, since we also wanted to test whether the incompatible

findings of previous studies were due to the choice of “historical” vs. “modern” indicators, our




9
   The absence of gold or sterling-denominated bonds for France, Germany, Holland and Switzerland forced us to
eliminate these four countries in order to avoid the inclusion of currency risk premia. In all, fewer than ten countries
that were left out because of absent control variables. These included small Caribbean borrowers and a few colonial
issuers such as Barbados and Trinidad. The group of British colonies includes the individual Australian and South
African provinces before unionisation.
10
   In line with previous studies, we excluded all observations with spreads of more than 1000 basis points, since all
these referred to bonds that were in default for many years, full repayment of which was considered unlikely.
11
   We also rely on material collected and kindly shared by other authors, in particular on the datasets of Obstfeld and
Taylor (2003b) and Clemens and Williamson (2004). For a detailed discussion of contemporary country risk
indicators see Flandreau and Zumer (2004). See also Ferguson and Schularick (2006).

database also includes modern GDP estimates and related ratios.12 Despite this effort, data are

not available in all years in our panel. Nevertheless, we have nearly three times as many

observations and countries as the widest-ranging previous study.

           Table I summarizes our dataset. What can be seen at a glance is that the choice of the

economic control variables has a strong impact on the number of observations and on the number

of countries in the sample. The main reason is that GDP reconstructions are only available for a

limited number of countries.

        Other than quantitative economic control data, we constructed a number of dichotomous

dummy variables. As is conventional, we included a dummy variable for countries that were not

honoring their repayment obligations, in other words defaulters. To ensure consistency, the

information was taken solely from the Annual Reports of the Corporation of Foreign

Bondholders, which contain detailed information on countries that did not pay the amounts due




                                             11
to bondholders.13 Since one could expect that the market punished previous defaulters, a

“memory” variable was given the value of one for ten years after a default occurred (following

Flandreau and Zumer, 2004). Two political variables capture the potential effects of international

war and civil unrest on market risk perception.

        There are two different approaches when it comes to coding dummies for gold standard

adherence: de iure and de facto membership. In the first instance, we regarded countries as being

“on gold” only if convertibility was formally legislated as well as maintained in practice. But we

also tested the sensitivity of our results to two alternative codings. First, following Flandreau and

Zumer, we also counted the de facto adherents as being “on gold”. Second, we double-checked

the sensitivity of our results with the gold matrix from Meissner (2005), which gives slightly

different dates for gold adoption.

        A significant challenge concerned the appropriate way to control for asset market shifts

that might affect spreads over time. Two options are at hand: first, simple time-dummies that

capture such movements in global risk appetite over time that are not accounted for by the

variation in country fundamentals; second, a specification inspired by the international capital

asset pricing model (CAPM), namely the correlation of individual assets with the market-wide

risk (with country-specific slopes or “betas”). With the latter approach, there is again a problem

of anachronistic modeling. The CAPM had not been invented at the time. In addition, the

empirical support for CAPM remains rather weak (Fama and French, 1992). On the other hand,

one can argue that there is no reason to believe that nineteenth-century investors were indifferent

to the systematic risk of their investments. In the interest of comparability with recent studies, we

report our regressions in the CAPM specification.14 For this purpose, we constructed a global




13
   Unlike Obstfeld and Taylor (2003b) we do not distinguish between partial and full defaulters, since we saw no
objective method to classify systematically the individual cases. We reckon that the bond market would react to any
payment problem.
14
   However, simple time-dummies lead to almost identical results. The distinction is more problematic with regard
to colonies which had very “low betas”, see Ferguson and Schularick (2006).

spread as the debt-weighted average of country spreads over the risk-free British benchmark

bond known as the “consol”.15

        Finally, we moved beyond previous analyses in two ways. First, we focused specifically

on countries that went on the gold from a previous paper standard. Following the time-

inconsistency literature, one could expect a larger credibility gain arising from a switch from

paper to gold than from silver to gold. Second, we introduced a “probation variable” in order to

see if the market rewarded gold adherence only in the case of faithful compliance over time. We

experimented both with three- and five-year periods, but obtained similar results and therefore

present only the results for the five-year probation period.

        In our econometric approach, our overarching goal was to ensure comparability with

previous studies. To control for heterogeneity in our panel, we opted for a standard fixed effects

model, where individual country dummies capture the effects of time-invariant but unmeasured

economic characteristics such as geography or culture. Like previous authors, we found evidence

of serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in our large panel, which makes ordinary least

squares (OLS) problematic. Both feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) and panel-corrected

standard errors (PCSE) are alternatives. In both variants, serial correlation can be accounted for

via a country-specific AR(1) term.16 Both estimators generally yield similar results, but we chose

to present the potentially more robust PCSE estimates, as the number of groups is large relative

to the number of years in our full sample (58/33). In such cases, FGLS produces overconfident

test statistics (Beck and Katz, 1995a,b).17 However, the key findings of this paper are



15
   We also experimented with an unweighted average without finding any significant differences to the results stated
below. The same is true for a GDP-weighted world return, which comes at the cost of a smaller sample.
16
   We also tried a common AR(1) for all panels, but obtained similar results.
17
   Obstfeld and Taylor (2003b) as well as Flandreau and Zumer (2004) employed a fixed-effects FGLS model, while
Bordo and Rockoff (1996) chose a SUR (seemingly unrelated regression) approach. A possible caveat is that FGLS
needs two crucial data transformations in order to produce an estimate of the unknown variance-covariance matrix
of the disturbances. It is certainly superior in “asymptopia”, but was found to perform poorly when applied to finite
real world samples, especially if the number of countries grew large relative to the time-periods (Beck and Katz,
1995a,b). This would seem to call for the less demanding PCSE method which was found to perform well in
comparable research situations and has emerged as a quasi-standard in “large N, smaller T” cross-country studies in
comparative political economy; see Beck and Katz (1995a). We thoroughly tested both variants but the core findings
                                                       13
independent of the FGLS/PCSE estimation methods. As part of our sensitivity checks, we also

considered a logistic default probability – an assumption not often seen in historical research so

far, but suggested by contemporary research on spread determinants (Eichengreen and Mody,

1998; Kamin and Kleist, 1999).

        In our baseline model, we regressed the annual risk premia, i.e. the interest rate

differential between the yield of a gold (or sterling) bond of an issuer and the yield on the risk-

free British consols, in a fixed-effects framework on a vector of economic controls (X) and the

world spread (S):




 Yieldi,t – YieldUK,t = αi + βiSt + γXi,t + ui,t                                                               (1)



To test the robustness of our analysis we also estimated a dynamic panel model. By integrating

the lag of the dependent variable (s) this allowed us to model country risk perception as a

Bayesian updating process. Deviations from steady state country risk can persist longer than in

classical AR(1) models. However, because fixed effects models with lagged dependent variables

bias OLS estimates, we opted to use a generalized methods of moment (GMM) framework. This

allowed us to address the potential endogeneity of some regressors by using internal instruments.




do not materially change. In order to save space, we chose to present only the PCSE estimates. In addition, neither
the country-specific betas and rhos nor the up to 57 unit effects are shown. All additional results are available from
the authors on request.
                                                       14
The system GMM estimator, introduced by Arellano and Bover (1995), combines the standard

set of equations in first differences with suitably lagged levels as instruments, with an additional

set of equations in levels with suitably lagged first differences as instruments.18 We examined the

validity of the internal instruments (Hansen test) and tested for serial correlation of the error

term. The dynamic panel regression model of the first order takes the following form:




Yieldi,t – YieldUK,t = αsi,t-1 + βiSt + γXi,t + ui,t                                                 (2)




                              III. The gold standard hypothesis re-estimated



Our empirical analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we aim to reproduce the results of previous

studies. The second step is to enlarge the sample to cover all 58 countries. Finally, we look more

closely at sub-samples of developed and developing economies.



1. Reproduction of the findings of previous studies (table II)

As our data were collected from a number of different sources, a natural starting point is to see if

we can replicate the findings of Bordo and Rockoff as well as Obstfeld and Taylor. Both studies

found evidence of a significant bonus for gold standard countries of 20 to 40 basis points.

Regressions (1–2) restrict our data to the Bordo and Rockoff and Obstfeld and Taylor samples.

Table II demonstrates that we are able to confirm their findings. Controlling only for gold

standard membership and correlation with market risk, our data show a spread reduction of 30 to

40 basis points, almost identical to the benchmark figure Bordo and Rockoff arrived at earlier.



18
  We use the “xtabond2” routine in Stata written by Roodman (2005). The one-step robust estimator is applied,
two-step estimation yielded analogous results.
                                                       15
       However, these regressions omit a number of important risk determinants. As discussed

above, there are two different ways to model nineteenth-century risk perception: a modern but

anachronistic version, and one relying only on historical data. We first took the modern path and

denominated the debt burden, exports, the public deficit and the trade balance by GDP and

included real GDP per capita (in logs) to control for the income level. Then we took the

historical route, scaling the debt burden by revenues and denominating the budget deficit by total

revenues, indicating how much more a country’s government spent than collected. We applied

the same logic to the trade balance. To control for openness and income level, we used exports

per capita, an indicator that contemporaries are known to have relied on (though we calculated

exports per capita in logs).

       Starting with the “modern” specification (3), the regressions again neatly reproduce the

findings of Obstfeld and Taylor. (Our country sample was similar, but not identical, as we were

                                                 17
able to add two more countries, Russia and Denmark.) Gold cuts off about 20 basis points in

spreads, but is only slightly above conventional significance thresholds. Using the identical

sample of 20 countries, we then looked at the “historical” specification as described above. This

was to see whether or not the difference between the “modern” and “historical” approach

actually matters. Interestingly, regressions (4) yields a similar result to the “modern”

specification used before: gold standard membership remains worth about 15 basis points. The

other coefficients also resemble their “modern” counterparts. We interpret this as an indication

that the preference of historical over modern specifications may in fact be less important than has

sometimes been suggested. Both sets of indicators seem to capture the same reality behind the

numbers and approximate the risk perceptions of nineteenth-century investors reasonably well.



2. Full sample regressions (table III)

Regression (5) profits from the full wealth of our dataset, which (for the reasons given above)

can be estimated only with the “historical” risk model. The estimation offers the weakest

possible support for the “good housekeeping” hypothesis. In regression (5) gold adherence is

worth about eight basis points, but is nowhere close to statistical significance, though it is still

correctly signed. The estimation amply documents the importance of economic fundamentals for

spreads. The debt-to-revenue ratio is significant, both statistically and economically. The same is

true of exports per capita. High exporters, it seems, enjoyed much lower spreads. Defaulters, by

contrast, were heavily punished, and previous defaulters had to pay a significant premium. The

deficit to revenue ratio and the trade balance seem to have played a less important role. Finally,

political instability was clearly a point of concern for investors as internal crises raised country

risk by about half a percentage point.

Regression (6) employs a different denominator for the debt burden, namely the debt service-to-

revenue ratio, as advocated by Flandreau and Zumer (2004). But this modification does not yield

a meaningfully different result from the debt-to-revenue ratio, which we preferred as the most

frequently cited indicator in financial publications of the time and less affected by endogeneity

than the debt service ratio. Do differences in the coding of gold standard countries affect the

results? We tested this by using the “de facto” gold coding from Flandreau and Zumer and the

classification from Meissner. But the results hardly changed. The gold standard dummy remains

correctly signed, but statistically insignificant.19

           The following regressions look at two potentially important omissions in the previous

literature. First, regression (7) adds a “probation dummy”, to see whether the market rewarded

god standard adherence only after a period of faithful compliance with the rules. The result is

unconvincing, both statistically and economically: Even after five years of rule-bound monetary

policy, the credibility effects as measured by country risk spreads were tiny and statistically not

robust. Regression (8) focuses on countries that joined the gold standard from a paper standard

and excludes those that simply “switched” from silver or bimetallism to gold. The idea is that the

credibility effects associated with a “hard peg” might already have been reaped with the adoption

of silver convertibility (Mexico and India being the most prominent examples) so that the gold

effect might be more obvious in countries that made the transition directly from paper to gold.

However, the results documented in table III do not support this idea. We find a statistically

insignificant 10 basis points reduction in country risk for economies that adopted gold coming

from a paper standard.

       Regressions (9) and (10) present a different model, namely a dynamic panel model which

includes the lagged dependent variable as a regressor and hence models country risk perception

as a Bayesian updating process. By using internal instruments, we were also able to control for

the potential endogeneity of some of the regressors such as the debt ratio. Despite the different

estimation strategy the results are consistent with our previous results. According to the GMM

estimation (9), gold standard adherence has a slight positive effect of around eight basis points,

but again fails to pass standard significance tests. In the case of countries that made the transition

directly from paper to gold (10), the effect becomes slightly negative, adding more doubts to the

robustness of the “good housekeeping” argument.

       In sum, while we were able to reproduce earlier findings of a gold effect using previous

smaller samples, the gold effect tended to become less visible in our much larger country sample.

Though still correctly signed, the gold dummy was no longer significant, even when we varied

the gold coding criteria or looked only at countries that made the paper-gold transition. As this

seems to underline the importance of sample selection, the logical next step was to look more

closely at sub-samples.



3. Individual sub-samples (table IV)

An important feature of our full sample may be the presence of twenty-three British colonies.

Colonial bonds were treated as a different asset both on account of their lower spreads and their

much lower correlation with market risk (Ferguson and Schularick, 2006). Some colonies were

effectively in a currency union with the United Kingdom. Moreover, colonies tended to have

above-average trade openness, as well as British-style fiscal and legal institutions.

       As a first step, we used a Chow-test to find out, whether there were significant structural

differences, i.e. unequal coefficients, between independent countries and British colonies. The

resulting F-statistic is far above the critical value, so that we reject the idea that both groups had

equal coefficients. Regression (11) confirms that colonies were treated differently from
                                          21
independent borrowers when they entered the capital market. Debt and income levels did not

matter for risk premia, while exports per capita have the wrong sign, implying that poorer

colonies paid lower interest. The gold dummy is statistically and economically insignificant. In

short, colonies could borrow cheaply because they were colonies. The monetary regime did not

matter.20

  Most colonies in Asia and Africa switched to a gold-exchange standard shortly before or after 1900. The case of
India is a well-known example. Yet some colonies like Hong Kong remained on silver throughout.

        What happened when we looked only at the determinants of bond spreads of independent

borrowers? In contrast to colonies, fundamentals re-appear as important drivers of risk

perception in regression (12). The effect of debt and income level on risk premia is particularly

large, while the value of gold is very small and again – by a substantial margin – statistically

insignificant. The question hence remains why the gold effect is much weaker in our sample

compared to previous smaller samples. A brief look at the list of countries we added – such as

Turkey, China, Persia, Siam, the Balkan states, and, besides Mexico, a number of smaller Latin

American countries – suggests that the gold effect may lose significance as the number of

capital-poor independent countries grows relative to more advanced “Atlantic” economies.



4. Developed vs. less-developed economies (table V)

Were poor countries different in that gold adherence did not bring any tangible credibility gains

in the eyes of international capital markets? We performed another Chow-test, splitting the

sample into a poor country sample and a rich country sample to see if there are structural

differences between the two. Countries with a GDP per capita of less than one third of the UK

were classified as poor developing countries.21 Again, a Chow-test led us to reject the

assumption that both groups have equal coefficients.

        We were now left with two groups, consisting of 16 relatively developed independent

countries (DCs), mainly belonging to the “Atlantic” economy, and a group of 22 independent,

but less developed countries (LDCs) from Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Running a

separate regression for the 16 developed countries in the sample, we found a surprising result.

For the developed (non-colonial) economies, the gold standard hypothesis seemed to hold:


21
   The GDP per capita threshold is 1,500 US-dollars (1990 prices, PPP) in 1900 according to Maddison (1995)
which is roughly equivalent to one third of British GDP per capita at the time. The regressions yielded the same
result when we split the sample at 2,000 and 1,000 dollars, and also a geographic split (all countries outside Western
Europe and North America being classified as developing countries) led to identical conclusions about the
indifference of the market to monetary commitments in poor countries.
                                                       24
joining the gold club brought a statistically highly significant reduction of risk premia of up to 50

basis points, just as the early study by Bordo and Rockoff had found. Yet a separate regression

for the 22 less developed countries yielded an equally clear result: Adoption of the gold standard

did not bring credibility gains. The gold variable was incorrectly signed and insignificant in any

specification, whether we used a static (14) or dynamic specification (15), CAPM-betas or time-

dummies, de iure or de facto coding. The market, we infer, did not confer a “good housekeeping

seal of approval” on poor peripheral countries merely because they adopted the gold standard.

Many peripheral countries tried but few, if any, reaped the benefit of enhanced credibility

supposedly associated with gold standard membership.

         This, then, explains why previous studies could not agree on the importance of the gold

effect. In those studies where country risk perception was modeled on the basis of GDP

reconstructions, the data availability led to the selection of a relatively wealthy country sample.22

But the gold standard hypothesis vanishes if the whole population of foreign borrowers in

London is taken into account. The market, it seems, did not reward gold adherence in poor

countries and rich countries equally. Credibility gains associated with gold convertibility were

limited to countries above a certain state of economic development.

         Given the potential implications of this finding for the hypothesis of gold as a credible

commitment mechanism and potential policy implications for developing countries, we finally

looked more closely at the determinants of risk pricing in the poor periphery, including some

potential risk factors that had not been considered before. In particular, we focused on countries

that transitioned directly from paper to gold. Regression (17) includes all poor economies,

sovereign states and colonies, while regression (18) restricts the sample to independent

developing economies. It can be seen from table V that, in both cases, gold standard adherence

had no effect on country risk. There is virtually a zero-impact in the first regression, and in the

  Our results in table 2 above show that the different modelling of risk pricing (modern vs. historical) does not drive
the results.

second gold adherence even takes the “wrong” sign. Regression (19) adds the share of primary

products in exports, the average tariff rate and the terms of trade. The key finding remains

unchanged: gold adoption did not lead to credibility gains for poor countries. We obtained the

same result when we took the dependent variable in logs (19).

       Last but not least, we again moved beyond previous models by specifying dynamics

models for all LDCs (including poor colonies) and independent LDCs. Both dynamic models

confirm the results obtained before (18), namely that the gold standard coefficient is not only

insignificant, but also takes on a positive sign. In sum, rule-bound monetary policy as implied by

gold standard adherence did not convey tangible credibility benefits on poor countries.

                            IV. Policy credibility in the poor periphery



Whatever its significance for relatively rich independent countries, gold adoption made little, if

any, difference to the perceived country risk of two important sub-groups within our global

sample: British colonies and poor independent countries. It is questionable whether the positive

effects that are evident for the top third of countries on the pre-1913 income ladder should

therefore be interpreted as evidence of a rule of the sort proposed by Bordo et al., or as

exceptions to a more general rule that monetary regime-changes by themselves do little to

enhance credibility. Below a certain income threshold, policy credibility remained by and large

unaffected by changes in the monetary regime. For a poor country seeking to borrow in London

at sustainable rates, we are tempted to suggest, it made more sense to become a British colony

than to join the gold standard.

       Why did bond market investors reward gold standard adherence in more developed

countries, but disbelieve promises of “good housekeeping” in less developed countries? We

propose two explanations that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Both focus on

characteristics of developing countries that reduce the probability that a commitment to a

currency peg will have a durable disciplining effect on policy-making. First, as Drazen and

Masson (1994, 736) have pointed out, the credibility of policies and the credibility of policy-

making are two different things. The market is unlikely to find the promise of “tough” policies

equally credible in all circumstances. Like Drazen and Masson, we are uncomfortable with the

dogma that “tying one’s hands” is automatically rewarded by the market, because it implies –

wrongly in our view – that investors do not think about the likely sustainability of the “promise

of self-restraint”, which is highly contingent on a country’s economic and political situation and

prospects. Even if economic policy-makers before 1914 were more insulated from popular
                                         28
political pressures than would be the case after 1918, other factors remained that affected the

probability of their sticking to their gold-standard commitments in the face of adverse

conditions. Poor countries, because of their backward economic structures, were more exposed

than most rich countries to shocks – to the vagaries of world agricultural markets, sudden

changes in terms of trade and growth trajectories. Agrarian lobbies, with their fondness for

currency devaluations and low interest rates, were even more powerful in poor countries than in

rich precisely because the interest-groups supportive of gold commitments (notably bankers and

bourgeois rentiers) were much smaller and weaker. A rational investor had good reasons to

believe that Sweden would be less likely to suspend convertibility than Siam or Venezuela.

       Table V compares a number of plausible factors that contributed to the market’s

assessment of the “promise of self-restraint”. It shows that the more advanced countries, on

which gold adherence seems to have conferred a credibility bonus, were also special in other

respects: they were twice as open, they traded about twice as much with other gold standard

countries, their exports were less dominated by primary products and they were better integrated

into world markets as measured by their considerably smaller shipping distances from London.

Their income levels, in other words, can be seen as a proxy for a number of other characteristics

that were likely to bolster market confidence in their long-run commitments to gold. For the

great majority of developing countries, however, the gold commitment was a rule that could be

overthrown at relatively low cost and one that was therefore quite likely to be challenged in a

crisis. It would be surprising if it had been very credible.

       Our second explanation is purely political. In the eyes of the market, the credibility gains

through gold standard adoption may have been low in poor countries simply because political

instability was high. In other words, where the political and social fabric of a country is still

crisis-prone, its monetary regime is likely to be a second-order concern for the market. As

political conflict is typically more heated, the rules of the political game are rewritten much more

often in poor countries than in developed ones. Yet if constitutions change frequently, investors

have good reason not to put too much faith in the durability of one particular law that requires

monetary policy to follow a strict rule. Investors in Colombian, Greek, or Persian bonds were

most of the time concerned with permanent threats to internal or external security that could have

ruined the credit of the country. Monetary clauses mattered much less in such cases. That would

seem to be confirmed by the fact that the contemporary British press dwelt extensively on the

                                               30
political developments in these countries, but rarely (if ever) referred to convertibility

arrangements. We cannot help feeling that, if the City had been as interested in currency clauses

as some have claimed, financial journalists would have written a good deal more about them.

       Our results suggest that the potential time-inconsistency of monetary policy was not the

dominant concern of investors in developing countries before 1914. Their vulnerability to

economic and political shocks was far more important. The same may apply today, in the most

recent era of globalization. Feuerstein and Grimm (2006) have shown in a recent article that a

hard exchange rate peg is not the optimal monetary solution if vulnerability to shocks, not time-

inconsistency, is the dominant problem. As policy can react to shocks only after a delay, even the

threat of a shock can make the abandonment of the peg more likely ex ante. In a similar vein,

Guidotto and Veigh (1999) have argued that the credibility of hard pegs falls quickly after an

initial stabilization period as the underlying economic weaknesses come to the fore again.

Although theoretically appealing at first glance, our empirical results show that pre-committing

policy to a binding rule was also not a good remedy for the economic ills developing countries

faced in the first era of globalization.



                                           V. Conclusion

The hypothesis that gold standard membership conferred a “good housekeeping seal of

approval” on international borrowers before 1914 is not wholly without empirical foundation.

There clearly was some kind of benefit in the form of reduced risk premia – but only for certain

countries that went onto gold. Yet even this limited vindication of the “good housekeeping”

hypothesis requires qualification. In those relatively advanced countries for which the hypothesis

seems to hold, the gold dummy may merely be a proxy for fundamental improvements not

properly reflected by other covariates; or it may merely capture the effect of relatively low

transaction costs. Unilateral promises of exchange rate stability and of complementary economic

policies may have provided additional credibility, but only in special circumstances.
                                             31
       By applying the full range of available empirical techniques to our expanded sample of

sovereign and colonial borrowers, we have shown that there were no benefits of going on gold

for the majority of less developed economies before the First World War. If the international

gold standard performed any service for such countries, it was by minimizing inflation

expectations in rich countries, and thus contributing to the low and stable long-term interest rates

in the core that were so crucial for encouraging capital flows to the periphery. In the last era of

globalization, as today, investors priced country risk on the basis of a complex mixture of

economic fundamentals and political factors such as colonial status. In this sense, it may make

more sense to think of the gold standard less as a “seal of approval” and more as a kind of “thin

film”, behind which investors were wise to look. The key historical lesson from the “natural

experiment” of the gold standard era is that in the poor periphery – where policy credibility is a

particularly acute problem – rule-bound monetary policy did not result in credibility gains. In

volatile economic and political environments, monetary policy commitments are no short-cut to

credibility. Vulnerability to economic and political shocks, not time-inconsistency, were and

remain the overarching concerns for international investors.
