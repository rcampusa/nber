                    SCHOOLING AND THE GREAT MIGRATION


                                ABSTRACT




     In   1900 90 percent of   mericas black population          lived in

the South and only 4.3    percent   of those born in the region         era
living elsewhere.    By 1950 the proportion of blacks living            in the

South had declined to âB percent and 19.o percen'            of those born

in the region had left it.       Using samples drawn from the public

use tapes of the 1900, 1940, and 1950 censuses          I   show that

better—educated diacks were far more likely to leave the South
than less—educated ones.       There was, as well, a feedback effect

black school   enrollment increased in states that had previously

experienced high rates of black out—migration. Econometric
analysis of the determinants of black out—migration suggests that
the better—educated were more likely       to   migrate because schooling
lowered the costs of migrating,      possibly by increasing awareness
of distant   labor market opportunities and the ability to

assimilate into a different social and economic environment.

     In 1900 90 percent of flmericas black population lived        in

the South and only a tiny proportion (4.3 percent)       of those born

in the region had left it.      By 1950 the proportion of blacks

living   in the South had declined to 68 percent, and 19.6 percent

of those born in the region were living elsewhere (see Table I).

     Over the same period the average educational attainment of

southern blacks increased dramatically. Despite setbacks in the

quality of schooling during the disenfranchisement era and
persistent discrimination in the allocation of school budgets in
the first half of the twentieth century, the percentage of

southern black children ages S to 20 enrolled in school rose more
than 30 points between 1900 and 1950.       The high levels of adult

illiteracy that inhibited the economic advancement of southern
blacks in the early twentieth century had virtually disappeared

by World War Two, and racial differences in educational
attainment among younger cohorts diminished sharply (see, for

example,   Robert Higgs, 1982; my 1984 paoer; James Smith,     1984).

     The movement of blacks out of the South, the so—called

 Great   Migration,u and the rise in black schooling are widely
believed to account for    a   significant fraction of the long—term
increase in the black—white income ratio (Finis Welch and James
Smith.   l97; United   States Commission on Civil Rights,    1986).

Because wages were far lower in the South1 a black man could
increase his lifetime earnings by moving out of the region.

Pccording to one calculation,     racial   differences in region and

schooling explain roughly a third of racial differences in
                                                                            2

earnings among males ages 25—34 at any point between 1940 and
1980 (United States Commission on Civil Rights,        1986, pp. 168,

194).

        Research on the evolution of racial income differences has
tended to treat the trends      in migration and schooling as

independent      historical processes, for example, as independent

variables in an earnings function.       This paper argues that it is

a mistake to do so, because the trends in migration and schooling

were causally related.       Using samples of individuals taken from
the 1900, 1940, and 1950 census public use tapes,        I   show in
section    1   of the paoer that better educated blacks were more

likely to leave the South than their less educated counterparts.
Had the long—term increase in black schooling been smaller, fewer

blacks would have left the South and the long—term rise in the

black—white income ratio would have been reduced. Furthermore,
not only were the better—schooled more likely to migrate, the

existence of black out—migration helped to raise black schooling

levels in the South.       In section 2 1 document   this feedback
effect of migration on schooling using state—level data on black

school enrollment.      Other things equal, black school enrollment
was significantly higher in states that had previously

experienced high rates of black out—migration.
        Section 3 examines the migration—schooling relationship in
the context of an econometric version of Larry       Siaastads     (1962)

model of migration.       The results are consistent with the

hypothesis that better—educated blacks were more likely to leave
                                                                       3

the South because schooling lowered       the costs of migrating,

possibly by increasing      the blacks   awareness of distant labor
                                                     into a
market opportunities and their ability to assimilate
different social and economic environment.  Section 4 concludes

                                             fincngs   for previous
by considering the implications of the
                                                   evolution of
research on the Great Migration and the historical
racial income differences.



I.   Schooling and Great Migration


     Historians of the Great Migration have documented quite
                                     its timing, but have
adequately the scope of movesent and
                                                           of the

                                                   1969; Flora Gill,
migrants (see, for example, William Vickery,
1979; Daniel Johnson and Rex Campbell,       1981; and Peter Gottlieb,

1987).    Lack of data is the primary reason.      Prior to 1960 the
                                               the
published censuses are of little use. In most,
                                                           from
characteristics of migrants were never compiled separately
                                                   of migrant
those of non—migrants, or the cross—classification
status    characteristics is too limited for statistical
         by

analysis.' Here      I   surmount the problem by relying on samples of

individuals drawn from the public use tapes of the 1900, 1940,
and 1950      censuses.
       4 meas re of migration that is conceptually consistent
                                           information on state
across the samples can be constructed from
                                                         to have
of birth and state of residence. 4 person is considered
                                                                       4

migrated out of the South if the person was barn in the South but
resided outside the region when the census was taken.
     The defects of the measure are well—known.     Location is
identified at only two points in time and except for certain

types of households (for example, families with children living

at home),   multiple or return migration cannot be determined.

Nothing is known about the location of birth other than the
state,   and except for children living with their parents, almost

nothing is known about family background.
     The measure of schooling differs across the samples.     In
1900 literacy was reported for persons iO and older.    In 1940 and
1950 the measure is educational attainment, as indicated by the

highest grade attended (1940) or completed (i950).     No adjustient

is made for various biases that have been identified in the 1940

educational attainment data.'
     Table 2 reports basic evidence from the samples on schocling
and black migration from the South.    The analysis is restricted

to persons who, in principle, could have entered the labor force:

age 10 or or older in 1900 and age 14 or older in 1940 and

l950.
     The probability of migration rose sharply over time, but at

any point in time, the chances of having left the South were

higher among the better educated.     In 1900, for example, literate

blacks were 3.4 times as likely to have migrated than were

illiterate blacks;   in 1940, persons who had attended high school

(9—12 years) were twice as likely   to have migrated than persons
                                                                                   5

with no or very limited (1—4 years)             schooling.      In 1940 and 1950

relationship is U—shaped; that is, the migration rate first rises
and then levels off or falls at the highest schooling levels.

        How important        were changes over time in schooling levels         in

raising    the black out—migration rate? The answer is given in

Table 3.        Column   1   of Table 3 gives the changes in the migration

rate between decades predicted by the changes in schooling levels

that occurred, based on the migration probabilities in Table 1.

Column 2 gives the actual change in the migration rate, and
cclumn 3    (     column 1/column 2) gives the percentage of the actual

change that can be explained by the change in schooling levels.
        The effect of schooling on migration was clearly enormous

before 1910. Between 1900 and 1910 the migration rate was

oredicted to rise by 0.9 points, based on the increase in
literacy rates that occurred in the decade.                 The actual change in

the migration rate was 0.& points.              Hence the change in literacy

rates can entirely explain the change              in   migration from 1900 to

1910.

        Egually clear is that the effect of schooling on migration
diminished sharply as the century progressed,                 presumably as a

result    of other       factors that accelerated        the rate of black

migration after 1910 )see section 4). From 1910 to 1930 the
predicted change in the migration rate was 0.8 points, or 9.7
percent of the actual change of 8.7 points. Between 1940 and                    190
the predicteo change in the migration rate was 0.9 points,

compared with an actual           increase of   '4.3    points. The change
                                                                         6

in schooling explains 81 percent (0.9/4.3) of the increase in

black migration between 1940 and 1950.

     As compelling as this simple evidence is,          there are a number

of reasons why the schooling—migration relationship might be more

apparent than real.     The relationship could be confounded with

age, gender,    family structure, cohort and distance effects on

migration.     Older youths and young adults who had completed their

schooling would be more likely to migrate than children living at
home and still enrolled in school.t Persons in large families

and females in general may have been less likely to migrate than

persons in smaller families and males in general. On the other

hand, older adult cohorts had less schooling than younger
cohorts.     That is, average schooling levels rose over time, but

so did the probability of out—migration. Schooling levels were

lower in the Deep South, but one might expect migration to the

North to vary with distance.

     The various points argue for     a   multivariate analysis of

schooling and migration.    Accordingly, column     I   of table 4

reports schooling coefficients derived from probit regressions of

migration,   with independent   variables constructed from the
information available in the samples.         For ease of comparison

with the bivariate analysis in Table 2, column 2 of table            4

reports schooling coefficients from probit regressions in which

schooling is the only independent    variable.    A more detailed

analysis of the determinants of migration appears in section 3;
here the issue is simply whether the effects of schooling are
                                                                            7

robust when other factors affecting migration are controlled for.

       In all the regressions the effects of schooling on migration

are positive and statistically significant.         Furthermore,    the

partial effects of schooling on migration (the dp/dX's) when
other factors are controlled for, are larger than the partial
effects when schooling is the only independent         variable.

Schooling was positively associated with the probability a
southern black would migrate from the region,         independent   of

other factors that affected the decision.

      A subtler concern     is that schooling is a proxy for some

unobserved characteristic that positively influenced the

probability of migration.       In particular,    schooling might be a

proxy for urban residence prior to migration. Urban blacks had
better access to information      (for example,   newspapers)   about the
North than rural blacks did, but urban school         levels were higher

than rural   schooling levels.     The appendix demonstrates, however,

that even under      the most favorable assumptions such a bias can

explain only a small portion of the schooling—migration
relationship.


B.   Black School Enrollment and Lagged Migration



      Section   1   established that a positive association existed
between scnooling and black migration from the South, and that

changes in schooling explain a significant portion of decadal

changes in black migration. One problem with the latter
                                                                              e

calculation,     however, is the implicit assumption that the charges
in schooling were exogenous to the changes in nngration.          Here    I

examine the assumption,       showing that there was a positive
feedback between lagged migration rates and black school
enrollment    -in the   South. Other things equal, black school
enrollment rates was higher in -southern states that had

previously experienced high rates of black out—migration. South.
Had black out—migration been smaller, the increase in black

schooling levels over time would have smaller as well.
     The rationale for a feedback effect involves the distinction

between general    and-   specific human capital.   Other things equal,

persons expecting to migrate should invest more heavily in types
of human capital, such as schooling, which enable the person to

adapt more readily to a different social and economic

environment, than in types of human capital whose returns are

specific to the region of origin (such as growing cotton).e          As

more blacks migrated from the South, migration became a more
common and feasible life—cycle choice, and black school

enrollment rose in response.

     An ideal test for a feedback effect is to examine the

determinants of schooling at the individual level, including in
the analysis variables measuring the degree of contact between

the individual    and others who had previously migrated from the

South——for example, friends, relatives, and so on.        Although
information   on school attendance is reported in the public use

samples,   no information is available on the mtgration decisions
                                                                               9

of friends and relatives.

        As a substitute for an appropriate sample of individuals,          I



use state—level     data on southern black school enrollment (ages 5

to 20) for the census years 1910 to 1930.         The dependent variable

is the age and gender—specific enrollment rate in state          i    in year

t.   The migration variable is the proportion of blacks born in

the state residing outside the South,        lagged ten years.       The

other independent     variables are dummy variables for age, gender,

state,    year,   and whether the state had a compulsory schooling law

in effect;    the proportion of males ages    3   to 44 who were

             the proportion of homeowners;     the proportion urban; the
literate;

number of teachers per 1000 children of school          age; and the

length of the school year.

        The results aopmar   in Table S. The coefficient of lagged

out—migration is positive and statistically significant.              Other

things equal,      enrollment rates were higher in states in which
                                                               or
larger proportions of blacks had previously left for the North

West.     The remaining coefficients are broadly consistent with

previous findings on the determinants of black school attendance
in the early twentieth       century South (see my 1987 paper).

ttendance varied with        age, first rising,   and then falling among

those aged 15 to 19, while females had slightly higher enrollment

rates than males. The availability of schooling, as measured the
teacher—child ratio and the lenqth of the school, was positively

and significantly related to school       attendance.     States with

compulsory schooling laws had higher enrollment rates, although
                                                                                10
 the size of the effect was relatively small.           An increase in the

adult literacy rate or the proportion urban was associated with

higher enrollment,       although neither coefficient    was significant

at conventional levels.

        The positive coefficient
                              of lagged migration suggests that
some of the increase over time in black schooling was
                                                      endogenous
to the changes in black out—migration.          How large was this

endogeneity effect?       Between 1900 and 1920 the migration rate
rose 3.8 percentage points (see Table         1).   Using the coefficient
from the regression (0.29), the change in lagged migration alone
would have resulted in an increase of 1.1 (= 0.29          x 3.8)   points
in the black enrollment rate between 1910 and 1930, compared with

an actual      increase of 14.9 points.     Hence the increase in

migration explains 7.4 percent (= 1.1/14.9) of the increase in
the black enrollment rate between l9lO and 1930.                       —

        Although   not trivial, the effect of lagged migration on

schooling is small enough so as not to change the substantive
conclusions of section      1.   The results, however, raise the

question of why the schooling—migration relationship existed,              to

which    I   now turn.



3. Explaining the Schooling—Migration Relationship



     Most economic models of migration begin with Larry

Sjaastads       (1962) formulation.   In   Sjaastads modeL   an individual

migrates from one area to another if the expected benefits of
                                                                                           11

doing so exceed the costs.                      The benefits and costs are pecuniary—

—for example, the present value of gains in income or wealth——and

non—pecuniary——for example,                     the pyschic costs of leaving family,

friends,       and a familiar environment.

        Within the context of the Siaastad model the schooling—

migration relationship among southern blacks can be explained in
two ways.           The first hypothesis is that the economic benefits of

migrating were simply greater for the better educated.                              The

second hypothesis is that the costs of migrating were lower for

the bette— educated.               According to many scholars, schooling is
that it enhances a             persons ability           to find out about

opportunities that are far away in social and economic distance,
and to adapt          quickly     to a new and        unfamiliar environment (2ba

8chartz,        1973; Michael Greenwood, 1975; Axel Borsh—Sucan,

1987)    tC'


        Here    I   develop and estimate an econometric model that can

determine the relative significance of the second hypothesis.
The model       consists of three eouations:


                ln    w,,   = x3,,,+       e.                            (3.1)

                ln    w,,   = X(3-. + s                                  (3.2)

                N     = So +     :6    +   p(ln      —
                                                         lnw-,( +   v    (3.3)

           Equation 3.3 determines whether the person migrates (I'Q)
or not          (1<O).         Following Sjaastad, the earnings differential (in

differential mattered in the decision to migrate, then p>O. The
variable S is schooling;                   a   positive and significant   value of S is
consistent with the hypothesis that schooling lowered the costs
of migration.              The    Zs   are factors other than the earnings

differential            or schooling           that influenced the decision to

migrate,         and    e(,.   is the error term specific to the migration

decision. 11

           Estimation          of equation 3.3 is complicated by the fact that

the dependent variable in equation 3.1 (in                     w.,)   is observed for

migrants but not for non—migrants. Similarly, the dependent
variable in equation 3.2. (in w,) is observed for non—migrants
but not for migrants.                  The problem cannot be solved by applying

ordinary least squares separately to samples of migrants and non—

migrants, because such a procedure would ignore the possibility
of selectivity bias (see, for example,                     Robert A. Nakosteen and

Michael         Zimmer,        1980; Chris Robinson and Nigel Tomes9         1982).

Equation 3.3 can, however, be estimated in                     a   multi—step procedure
(see 5.5. Madalla, 1983, pp.                     236—240).     In step one, a reduced—
                                                                              13

form probit on migration is estimated. Next, the reduced—form

probit coefficients are used to construct variables that correct
for selectivity bias.             Equations 3.1 and 3.2 are then estimated,

including the selectivity—bias variables as independent
variables.          The estimated (l's are then used to predict in   w,.,   and

ln     w   for all persons in the      sampie   Finally, equation 3.3 is

re—estimated, including the predicted earnings differential (in
w,-,   —In w,) as an independent       variable.

        Equation 3.3 was estimated in this manner, using a sample of
1,147 southern—born black males ages 14 and over drawn from the

1940 census tape, 384 of whom were migrantm.tr Because income

refers      to    wace and salary income in 1939, the sample is
necessarily restricted to persons with positive wage and salary
incomes.          The dependent    variable in the earnings functions

(equations 3.1. and 3.3) is the logarithm of the persons weekly

wage.t€+         The independent   variables in the earnings function (the
X's) are a proxy for labor market experience (experience            = age—

schooling—a),         experience squared, years of schooling, dummy
variables for broad occupational group (white collar, blue

collar, unskilled),         a dummy variable indicating the person worked

in manufacturing, and interaction           terms betaeen experience,

experience squared, schooling, and the occupation and

manufacturing dummy variables.tn
        The results of the structural probit estimation, shown in

Table      6,    are consistent with the Sjaastad mcdel.ba    The

probability of migrating out of the South was positively ano

significantly affected by the difference in earnings between the
South and the non_South.t Controlling for the difference in

earnings, however, the better—schooled were significantly more

likely to be migrants, consistent with the hypothesis that

schooling reduced the costs of migrating.
     The coefficients of the other independent    variables
correspond well with prior expectations. The probability of

migrating rose with age, suggesting that the costs of migrating
fell with age.    Persons who were widowed or divorced, or living

in small households (for example, single males)   were more likely
to have left the South.   Distance appears to have mattered, even
as late as 1940. Persons born in the West South Central states or

the Deep South in general, were less likely   tohave migrated   from

the region than persons born in the South Atlantic, East South

Central,   or the upper South in general.



5. Conclusion



     There are few events in modern American history whose social

and economic repercussions are as profound as the Great

Migration.   What factors explain the scope and timing of the

movement of blacks out of the South?   Although acknowledging the
importance of information flows between the South and other

regions——letters from migrants, Northern labor agents, and black
newspapers like the Chicago Defender-—historians have tended to

emphasize short—run factors, against a backdrop of the long—term
                                                                              15

equalization of regional income differences and the development
of national labor marIets.           In the late nineteenth and early

twentieth century incomes in the South were far below the

national    average.        But southern blacks did not migrate to the

North    in large numbers until the supply of immigrants was

diminished by nativist legislation,          and the insatiable demands of

a wartime economy allowed them to           get a foot in the door."

Southern blacks also sought to escape the virulent and state—

sanctioned white suoremacy of the ex—Confederacy,             a

oiscriminatory environment          that worsened after the turn of the

century     (C.   Vann Woodward, 1954; Morgan Kousser,        1974; my 1985

book;    Robert    Higgs,    lE).
        There is no doubt that short—run factors were central ta the
Great Migration, although the relative importance of oarticular

events may be over—rated."'            What this paper has shcan is that a

rising    rate of black out—migration was inevitable,             driven by the

steady ino"ease over time in southern black schooling.

Furthermore, as average black schooling levels rose, so too did
the aggregate responsiveness of southern labor markets to inter—

regional differences in factor prices and to national economic
trends     (Gavin Wright,      i°86; Robert Higgs,   1999).

        The results of this paper would come as no surprise to white

southerners of the Jim Crow era.           Fond of the saying       that

 education spoils a good field hand,           white—oominated school

boards willfully and flagrantly violated the doctrine of

 separate_but_equal in allocating school budgets betseen the
races.    Keenly aware that an education was a ticket out of the

county,   and eventually the region, white planters and employers
were largely successful in restricting educational opportunities

for black children, thereby maintaining their traditional supply

of low—wage labor well into the twentieth century (Gavin Wright,

l99á).    Their inability to completely eliminate such

opportunities is partly explained by the ability of black
families to vote with their feet, if not at the ballot box (see

my 1988 paper)    I have   shown elsewhere (l986b, 1987) that lack of
enforcement of Plessy vrs. Feriuson in southern schools slowed
the eradication of black illiteracy and lowered     the rate of black

school attendance.    Had the seoarate—but—equal decision been

enforced the Great Migration would have been greater still.t
                                                                                                 17

                                         APPENDIX



        The appendix evaluates the hypothesis that the schooling—

migration relationship              is a proxy far a relationship between

migration and prior urban residence. That                       is,       urban    blacks were

mare likely         to leave the South than rural blacks,                    but urban

                                                                                     In this
literacy ratem were higher than rural literacy rate.
case the effect of schooling on migration would be over—stated,

because the probit regressions (Table 4) do not control for prior
urban residence.

        I   begin by examining the possible bias in 1900.                           Suppose

that (a) the true effect of literacy on the probability of out—

migration were zero           (b)    the out—migration rate of rural blacks

were zero         Ic>   urban residence prior to migration is unobae-ved.

What would then be the observed difference in out—migration rates

between literate and illiterate blacks?

        The following two equations can be used to answer                            this

question:


                        m(L.) +   m(IL>(l—o)   =    m                      l)
                        m(L)/Cm(L) ÷    (s/l—a)m(IL)]              (I      (E


where m(L)         =    observed migration rate          of literates.            m(IL) =

observed migration            rate of illiterates,           m =        overall   migration

rate,       a =   proportion      literate,   and   >1   =   observed proportion            of

migrants anD were literate.               Note that the observed effect of
                                                                                                  18

literacy on migration is simply m(L)                       -   m(IL).    The parameter a

and the out—migration rate m can be calculated from the 1900

census sample: a =              0.47 and m    =    0.053       (see Table 2).          From
assumptions       (a)        and (b), above,       it   follows that         (3    is the literacy

rate of urban residents at risk of out—migration prior to 1900.
An estimate of          (3    (calculated   from the 1900 census tape) is the

proportion of urban blacks in the South in 1900 who were
literate: a =         0.61.       Inserting       the values of a,(l, and m into

equations       (1)   and (2) gives m(L) —              m(IL)    =   0.03,        or 50 percent of

the difference in the out-migration rates of literates and

illiterates (0.06) reported in Table                      2.    Furthermore,          it is   clear
that 50 percent must be an upper bound of the &ias:                                  the true
value of   (1   was less than assumed in the calculation (because

black literacy rates were rising over time the literacy rate of

the population at risk of migrating must have been lower than

0.61) and black migration from rural areas was non—zero.

     The procedure can be repeated for 1940 and 1950, and the

results (available on request)                 indicate         that the bias in those

years is at most eaual to 25 percent of the effect of schooling
on migration reported in Table 2.                       Hence the conclusion in the

text: the schooling—migration relationship among southern blacks

cannot merely be a proxy for an unobserved relationship between

migration and prior urban residence.
                                    FOOTNOTES


1. See    William Vickery (1969), pp. 144—147.       Samuel Bowles (1970)
used aggregate census data on migration between 1955 and 1960 to

demonstrate that better educated blacks were more likely to leave

the South.     The results of this paper complement Bowles             analysis
for the earlier period.

2.   The 1900, 1940, and 1950 public use tapes are representative

samples of the United States population.         The tapes were made

available to me by the Inter—University Consortium for Political
and Social Research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

The 1940 and 1950 tapes are arranged into 20 independent random

samples.     The analysis in the paper is based on the first random

samples on both tapes.          Stanley Leiberson (1979) applied forard
survival techniques to aggregate census data from 1890 to 1950 to
show that net migration rates of southern blacks were higher

among    literates than illiterates.      My analysis differs from

Leibersons     in two ways: the measure of migration is gross and

the data refer to individuals.         The latter difference     is most

important,    because   I can   control simultaneously for factors other

than schooling influencing migration (see Tables 4 and 6), which

cannot be done with aggregate data.

3. A further issue      is caused    by the cross—sectional nature of the

census samples: the migration data are censored. What            is    observed

for non—migrants is an estimate of what could be called an

incomplete spell of "years living in the South.           What    is
                                                                         20

observed for migrants is that they lived outside the region, not

when they migrated.   Duration methods could be used to analyze
the data, but because such methods are likely         to be sensitive to

the fact that return migration cannot be identified         (that is9   the

apparent length of the incomplete residence spell may be much

greater than the true length)   I rely    instead on simpler

techniques (probit analysis).
4. See my 1986a paper.   It is likely that the 1940 and 1950

educational attainment data overstate true schooling levels among
southern blacks born in the late nineteenth century, which would

bias downward the measured effects of schooling on migration in a

multivariate analysis.   The bias is probably srtali, however,

because migrants were disproportionately young.
S. These were the ages useo by the census to determine labor

force status.

a. Some persons in the sample presumably migrated from the South

at an early age and attended school      elsewhere.    But it is

unlikely that such a pattern was typical because the migration
rate of young children in school   was far below the average in all

the samples. For example,   in 1940 the     migration rate of children
in school was 8 percent, less than a third of the overall rate

(see Table 2).

7. The variables in 1900 are age, age squared, sex, literacy,

famtly si:e. relationship to head of hcusehold, marital status,

reqion of birth within the South, and whether the persons
parents were interstate migrants.     The variables in 1940 and 1950
                                                                     21

are the same, except for the following differences.      In 1940 and

1950 the schooling variables are years of schooling and years

squared, and parents interstate migration is excluded.       In 1950,

the   persons veteran status   is added.   The substantive results
are not affected if family size, relationship to head of

household, and marital status (which, for migrants, are observed
after migration took place) are excluded.
8. See Farley Grubb   (1987, p. 71) for a similar argument in the

context of European migration to colonial America.
9. One can think of the relationship between the enrollment rate

and its determinants as an aggregate approximation to outcomes at

the household level; see my 1987 paper.

10.   A probit regression on interstate migration within the South

(available on request) produced an insignificant    schooling
coefficient.    Thus the positive effect of schooling on black

migration was apparently confined to long—distance migration,
consistent iith Schwartzs (1973) argument.
11. For applications of this model to modern data see Robert A.

Nakosteen and Michael Zimmer    )1980), Chris Robinson and Nigel

Tomes (1982), and George 8joras (1987).

12. Although the multi—stage procedure produces unbiased

estimates of the structural coefficients, the standard errors are

biased.   Asymptotic corrections to the standard errors are
derived in 8.5. Madalla (1983, pp. 252—256).
13. The sample was restricted to males to avoid considering a

second selectivity bias due to labor force participation
                                                                              22

deciscons of females.        The substantive results are not affected

if    thesample     is restricted to somewhat older males        (for example,

ages 18 and over).

14.   Theideal variable      is the   present value of the persons
lifetime earnings from the point of migration, but such a

Variable cannot be calculated from the census samples.               The

substantive results are not affected if annual earnings are

substituted for weekly earnings.
15.    Identification of equation t.3 requires that at least one of

the variables included in X not be included in 2.              Variables

included in 2 are age, family size, relationship to head of

nousehold, and region of birth in the South.               rn principle the

inclusion of experience squared         in X would   identify equation L13,

but    it   provd necessary   in practice to include the interaction

terms as well.

là. The earnings functions displayed evidence of positive

selection bias.        Positive selection bias is consistent with e.
and   e being positively correlated;        that is, unobserved factors

that caused     a   black male to have higher (or iower( than ave'aqe

earnings if he migrated also caused higher           (or    lowar( than

average earnings if he did notmigrate.           Exploratory estimations
revealed that the positive selection bias lessened as schooling

increased.      Since the unschooled were more likely to be

unskilled, an appealing interpretation of the result              is that

schooling reduced the importance of an unobserved factor              like

physical strength that influenced unskilled wages regardless of
region.
17.   Similar results were obtained by Vickery (1969), Bowles

(1970),   and Gill (1979), all of whom, however, used aggregate

data and did not correct for selectivity bias.
16.   For example,   Vickery (1969) argues that increases in labor
demand in the North during the two world wars have been over-

rated compared with the underlying differences in income between
the South and Non—South.

19.   For a similar conclusion see   I-4iggs   (199).
