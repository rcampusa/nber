                                         ABSTRACT

The seasonal influenza virus afflicts millions of people in the U.S. population each year,
imposing significant costs on those who fall ill, their families, employers, and the health care
system. The flu is transmitted via droplet spread or close contact, and certain environments, such
as schools or offices, promote transmission. In this paper, we examine whether increases in
employment are associated with increased incidence of the flu. We use state-level data on the
prevalence of the flu from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In our preferred
specification, we find that a one percentage point increase in the employment rate increases the
number of influenza related doctor visits by about 16 percent, and these effects are highly
pronounced in the retail sector and healthcare sector, the sectors with the highest levels of
interpersonal contact.

1    Introduction

The seasonal influenza epidemic imparts surprisingly large costs on the economy. According to

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu infects between 9 and 35 million

people each year, resulting in between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations, and between 12,000

and 56,000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018a). Estimates of the economic

burden of the flu range from 34.7 billion dollars to nearly 90 billion dollars per year (Molinari et al.,

2007; Rothman, 2017).

    The flu is transmitted from sick to well individuals when a healthy person either touches a

surface containing the flu virus or inhales the virus after an infected person coughs or sneezes. As

we discuss in detail below, many of the characteristics or environments associated with modern

daily work life may encourage the transmission of the flu. These characteristics include commuting

via public transportation, working in climate controlled indoor offices, sharing workspaces, and

placing young children in daycare. If the features of the working environment promote the spread

of the flu, then being out of the labor force and away from these environments could help reduce

the spread of the flu.

    This paper explores the proposition that employment levels affects the spread of the flu. We

use data from the CDC on the incidence of the influenza virus for the 2010/2011 to 2016/2017 flu

seasons in conjunction with an employment rate constructed from data from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS). Using dynamic panel data models to account for the infectious nature of the flu,

we find evidence that increased employment indeed aids the spread of the flu. In our preferred

model, we find that a one percentage point increase in the employment rate will lead to about a 16

percent increase in flu prevalence. Since the average average absolute change in the employment

rate from one month to the next in our sample is 0.31 percentage points, an average monthly

increase in the employment rate increases the flu incidence by about five percent.

    We also examine the relationship between employment and flu prevalence at the sector level,

hypothesizing that sectors with more personal contact should be more related to the flu. We con-

struct a measure of interpersonal contact levels for each industry sector using data from O*Net. We

find that employment changes in the retail and healthcare sectors, the two sectors with the highest

levels of interpersonal contact, drive the aggregate results. Moreover, we find that employment


                                                   2
changes in the construction and manufacturing sectors, the two sectors with the lowest levels of

interpersonal contact, are not associated with statistically significant changes in flu prevalence.



2        Background

There are four types of influenza viruses, A, B, C, and D although only types A and B are responsible

for the seasonal epidemics in humans (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018e). Within

types A and B there are different strains of the virus.1 The virus mutates at a very rapid rate,

resulting in an ever changing combination of active strains. The constant and rapid evolution

of new strains means that people cannot become indefinitely immune to the virus from adaptive

immunity or through vaccination (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018c). Having

recovered from a past flu infection or having been vaccinated against known strains of the flu does

not protect against infection from new strains of the virus. Occasionally an abrupt change in a type

A virus can occur, leaving the majority of the population with little to no immunity against the

novel strain. This can lead to flu pandemics, during which widespread infection, hospitalization,

and death are common.

        Influenza epidemics are seasonal, occurring mainly in the winter months. The CDC actively

monitors flu activity during the flu season, defined by the CDC as between October and May

(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018c). There is no consensus among the scientific

community as to why flu outbreaks occur mainly in the winter months (Cox and Subbarao, 2000).

Since the 1982-1983 flu season, the peak month of flu activity occurred in February nearly half

of the time. However, the peak month of activity can occur as early as November, and regularly

occurs in March.

        The mechanism for flu spread is sick-to-well transmission. That is, healthy people become

infected with influenza by coming into contact with infected individuals. According to the CDC,

the transfer of the virus occurs through droplet spread. The influenza virus is present in the saliva

and mucus of infected individuals, and when an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus is

introduced into the air in aerosol form. The virus can either be inhaled when airborne, called
    1
     There are multiple subtypes of influenza A, of which two are commonly found in humans. A(H1N1) was responsi-
ble for the “swine flu” pandemic in the 2009/2010 flu season, and A(H2N3) was largely responsible for the particularly
severe 2017/2018 flu season. Each subtype of influenza A has multiple strains. Influenza B has no subtypes, but
multiple strains.


                                                          3
aerosol transmission, or introduced into the body after touching a surface containing the droplets

(and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth), called close contact transmission. Experimental

evidence suggests that, under laboratory conditions, aerosol transmission is the most successful

mechanism of infection (Tellier, 2006). However, the virus can only survive for 16 hours in aerosol

form. On the other hand, the virus can survive for up to 48 hours on a non-porous, dry surface. This

evidence, coupled with experimental evidence showing up to 60 percent of the objects surrounding

an infected person have an infectious concentration of the virus, leads some researchers to believe

close contact transmission is the primary mechanism of flu spread (Brankston et al., 2007; Tellier,

2006).

   Schools and workplaces both offer the close contact between individuals and commonly touched

surfaces conducive to the spread of influenza. Cox and Subbarao (2000) report that the highest

attack rates of influenza occur among school-age children, and that school absenteeism is typically

followed by work absenteeism. Individuals in families with school-age children (or children in

daycare) are more than twice as likely to become infected with influenza, which suggests schools

are a primary environment for the spread of the flu (Cox and Subbarao, 2000). But because

schooling is compulsory, the large variability in flu incidence between regions and both within and

across flu seasons is unlikely to be explained by school enrollment.

   Employment provides an analogous environment for adults, and employment rates vary signifi-

cantly across regions and time. A person who is employed could be much more likely to come into

close contact with the influenza virus than individuals out of work or out of the labor force. Since

employed people typically commute to and from the workplace, they are more likely to use public

transportation or car pools, which are favorable environments for flu transmission. According to

the 2016 American Community Survey, over 7.6 million Americans commute using public trans-

portation and another 13.6 million commute by carpool. This puts roughly 14 percent of working

Americans at risk of catching the flu in these manners. Moreover, the majority of Americans work

indoors. Working environments like offices are ideal for both aerosol and close contact transmission

of the influenza virus. In addition to the close proximity of workers, Tellier (2006) reports that

the influenza virus in aerosol form survives better in low humidity environments. Thus, a climate-

controlled office building would be a conducive environment for aerosol transmission. Commonly

touched surfaces, such as keyboards, water coolers, and communal restrooms, also promote close

                                                 4
contact flu transmission. Finally, employed individuals may be more likely to put young children

in daycare, and as noted above, school and daycare are fertile environments for the spread of the

flu.

       It is worth noting that there are alternative (though not generally accepted) views concerning

influenza transmission. This literature suggests that influenza does not behave like a typical in-

fectious disease, and sick-to-well transmission may not adequately explain the epidemiology of the

flu. One theory suggests epidemics of the flu are due to vitamin D deficiency and its importance

to innate immunity (Cannell et al., 2008).2 Although this theory of flu transmission is very dif-

ferent from the generally accepted view, influenza transmission could still be highly influenced by

the work environment. Since the majority of Americans work during the daylight hours, which

limits sun exposure, it follows that vitamin D deficiency may increase in prevalence during times of

increased indoor employment. Additionally, person-to-person contact is still necessary for the flu

spread, even if it is not responsible for the outbreak of an epidemic. Thus, in the event that this

theory of flu transmission has more substance than is currently attributed to it, we should still see

an effect of employment on flu rates.

       The above discussion points to a possible strong positive relationship between periods of high

employment levels and high rates of the flu. However, an alternative relationship should be con-

sidered where high unemployment and recessions more generally are associated with high rates of

flu cases. This idea is elucidated by Cornwell (2012). He hypothesizes that higher levels of unem-

ployment are associated with increases in flu activity through the mechanisms of financial strain,

lack of access to health care and low vaccine rates, and stress which can increase susceptibility to

viral infections. To test this hypothesis, he regresses state-level data on the probability of observing

“widespread” or “widespread/regional” levels of flu activity on the state unemployment rate. Using

a lagged dependent variable panel data model, he finds support for his hypothesis, although the

estimates are likely biased since he ignores the endogeneity of the lagged dependent variable.

       There is certainly validity to the argument that high levels of unemployment can have detri-

mental effects on overall health and it is reasonable that one might expect to see higher levels

of flu cases as a result. However, the mechanisms here are more distal than that of the oppos-

ing hypothesis where higher levels of human interaction that go along with employment promote

the transmission of the flu. Ultimately, it is an empirical question. However, we argue that the

unemployment rate is not an ideal measure to use to answer this question. First, it is unclear

whether unemployed workers are regularly engaged in the employment search activities that would

contribute to the spread of the flu. The employment to population ratio does not suffer from this

ambiguity. Second, the unemployment rate can change because of workers switching status or by

entering or exiting the labor force. These transitions have different implications for the stress and

financial strain stories. For example, the unemployment rate can rise as people enter the labor

force during an economic recovery and this may be accompanied by reduced stress and increased

hopefulness among previously discouraged workers. Again, the employment to population ratio is

a much cleaner measure and easier to interpret.

       This paper also adds to the literature concerning the effect of macroeconomic conditions on

health. The bulk of this literature relates local unemployment rates to a variety of health outcomes.

For example, Ruhm (2000) finds that higher state-level unemployment rates are associated with

decreased mortality rates, including deaths from influenza and pneumonia (in direct contrast to

the results by Cornwell (2012)). Interestingly, Ruhm (2015) revisits the question and finds that

over time, mortality shifted to being weakly or even unrelated to unemployment, but he does

not examine influenza in this newer article. Also, Gerdtham and Ruhm (2006) find that a one

percent increase in national unemployment rates among OECD countries are associated with a 1.1

percent rise in deaths from influenza and pneumonia. There is some evidence to suggest that these

types of analyses may be sensitive to the business cycle measure used (Gerdtham and Johannesson,

1999).3 In work related to this paper, Adda (2016) estimates the effect of various types of economic

activity in France on the spread of viral diseases, including influenza. He finds that influenza

spread is positively related to inter-regional trade, but finds mixed effects for unemployment.4 Our

paper helps sort out the divergent results from the existing papers that have included a measure of

influenza as an outcome. We also focus on the employment to population ratio as opposed to the

unemployment rate, which as previously discussed, is not an ideal measure and is hard to interpret
   3
     A number of other studies examine how various health behaviors and health outcomes vary with unemployment
rates including a series of papers by Ruhm (Ruhm and Black (2002), Ruhm (2003) Ruhm (2005), and Ruhm (2007)).
We refer the reader to papers by Currie et al. (2015) and Ruhm (2016) for comprehensive reviews of this literature.
   4
     Another related paper is Stoecker et al. (2016), who show that traveling to a Super Bowl event dramatically
increases incidence of the flu in the travelers’ home counties. Our study differs by focusing on economic activity as
the conduit for increased interpersonal contact and flu spread, rather than travel.

in the context of a communicable disease.

    While our paper is not the first to link business cycles to health, our focus on a common

communicable disease in the United States adds a new dimension to the discussion. Most of

the previous literature relies on changes in individual health-related behaviors as the mechanisms

behind the observed relationships between either mortality or health status and unemployment.

These can vary dramatically among individuals and among circumstances, and as previously stated,

the relationship appears to be changing over time (Ruhm, 2000, 2015). Communicable diseases are

different. The human-to-human transmission mechanism of the flu is well established and likely not

to vary over time. Also, while it is interesting from an academic perspective to know whether we can

expect lower mortality or improved health status during a recession, from a policy perspective, little

can be done to alter these outcomes via changes in the business cycle. The results of our study are

more concrete and can help predict when a flu season will be “bad”. This is particularly important

since, as Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC states, “...flu is incredible difficult to predict.”5 Barring

major economic shocks, there tends to be strong month-to-month persistence in employment trends

so when we find ourselves in expansions, our results predict higher rates of flu cases. This knowledge

can help public health practitioners prepare. For example, the 2017-2018 flu season was particularly

severe. Hospitals found themselves unprepared and struggling to keep up with the influx of patients.

The ability to predict the potential severity of an upcoming flu season would be vital information

for hospitals and public health officials.



3     Data

3.1   Employment Data

We construct state-level monthly employment rates using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Each month, Census workers interview people in 60,000 households about their labor market activ-

ities during the week that includes the 12th day of the month. These values are adjusted for sample

demographics and extrapolated to state-level or region-level employment figures.6 From these sur-

veys, we construct an employment rate measuring the percent of the civilian population currently

                                                    7
working. The employment rate is the employed population divided by the non-institutional civil-

ian population multiplied by 100. We use this employment rate rather than the more well-known

unemployment rate because the unemployment rate denominator is the labor force and not the

working-age population. As mentioned above, since the unemployment rate denominator fluctu-

ates as people enter or exit the labor force, the unemployment rate will not fully capture the changes

in the percentage of the population working.

   We use unadjusted employment data rather than seasonally adjusted numbers. In our context,

seasonally unadjusted employment data is preferable to the seasonally adjusted series. The sea-

sonally adjusted series, by design, diminishes month-to-month variation, making it hard to identify

any effect of the seasonally adjusted employment rates on outcomes that vary monthly. Also, the

seasonally adjusted series removes the seasonal component of employment. Since our interest is in

the spread of the flu related to movements in and out employment for any reason, the unadjusted

number is preferable.


3.2   Flu Data

The measure of flu prevalence comes from the CDC. The CDC heads an influenza surveillance sys-

tem comprised of, among other surveillance measures, an Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Network

(ILINet). The ILINet consists of some 2,800 health care providers across all fifty states and Wash-

ington D.C. Each week during the flu season, providers voluntarily submit the number of patient

visits for all causes and the number of patients with an influenza-like illness (ILI). The symptoms

necessary for an ILI diagnosis include a fever greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a cough and/or

sore throat, and a lack of a known cause besides influenza. Starting with the 2010-2011 flu season,

the CDC reports the ILINet data at the state level (prior years were at a regional level only), so we

begin our sample with this flu season and continue it through the 2016-2017 flu season. We drop

the state of Florida because they do not report ILINet data, and we additionally exclude Alaska

and Hawaii because the ILINet data includes only the contiguous 48 states plus Washington D.C.

   There are some potential pitfalls with this flu measure. First, the location and coverage of

the health providers is unknown. There may be a bias towards urban locations and larger, well-

staffed medical providers. Second, the reporting may not accurately reflect the severity of the

flu. It may be that people visiting the doctor with flu-like symptoms are more from populations

                                                  8
at risk from serious complications arising from the flu, such as children, the elderly, and people

with concurrent illnesses. Since these populations are less likely to work, it may bias our estimates.

Doctors’ reactions may also change based on the severity of the flu. It may be that doctors diagnose

and report patients with the flu more often during the height of the flu season. As long as the

measurement error from reporting is not systematically related to employment, our estimates will

be unbiased, but the standard errors will rise.

    Since the flu data are reported on a weekly basis and our other variables are reported on a

monthly or quarterly basis, we aggregate the flu variable to a monthly level by taking the average

of all the weekly observations during that month. According to the CDC, an infected person may

not show symptoms for up to four days after infectious contact and is capable of infecting others

for up to a week after symptoms start. There is also some lag between when symptoms start and

when that person visits a physician regarding his or her illness. Given these timing issues, it seems

likely that a few weeks or more would pass before the effect of a change in employment could alter

flu prevalence as recorded by ILINet. Thus, we lag our employment variables by one month. Since

the employment variables are measured over the week containing the 12th day of the month and

the flu is measured during the next month, the measurement of the flu starts two to three weeks

later on average.

    Table 1 shows summary statistics from our sample. Our main analysis sample contains 2,688

state-month cells (48 states x 7 flu seasons x 8 months in each flu season). Our measure of the flu

from the CDC indicates that during the flu season, about two percent of physician visits are flu-

related. The employment to population ratio is just under 60 percent. Unsurprisingly temperatures

tend to be in the lower ranges during the flu season, and almost 85 percent of our state-month cells

have average temperatures less than 60 degrees. Average precipitation levels are generally lower

than seven inches for most state-year cells.



4    Methodology

We exploit variations within states across time in both influenza incidence and labor market activity

to test the theory that increases in employment levels increase individuals’ risk of exposure to the

influenza virus. We examine the spread of the flu during the flu season, which we define as running


                                                  9
from October through May of the next year. We only focus on the flu season because there is

minimal flu activity during the summer. Since influenza is a communicable disease, the number of

individuals that will be infected depends on the number that were previously infected. Arellano-

Bond tests for autocorrelation suggests that the rate of current influenza infection is significantly

correlated with the past three months’ infection rates. Therefore, for state s, flu season y, and

month m, we first estimate the following panel data model with a lagged dependent variable:

                                  3
                                  X
               ln(Fsym ) = α +          ρi ln(Fsym−i ) + βEsym−1 + γXsym + σsy + µsm + sym ,                       (1)
                                  i=1


In Equation 1, the dependent variable is the natural log of a measure of flu prevalence, ln(Fsym ).7

The right-hand side variable of interest is the employment to population ratio, lagged by one month,

Esym−1 . We also include three lags of the flu prevalence on the right hand side, Fsym−i , given the

results of the autocorrelation tests.8 The vector Xsym accounts for other factors likely related

to the spread of the flu. First, Xsym includes the natural log of state per-capita income reported

quarterly from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which clarifies the interpretation of our parameter

of interest. We want to capture how changing employment conditions affect the spread of influenza,

not how changes in income, which may be related to health behaviors and health resources, affect

the spread of influenza. Additionally, since research suggests the spread of the flu is related to

temperature and humidity, Xsym also includes temperature and precipitation data for each state

from the ηClimDiv dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.9 Finally,

we control for state by flu season and state by month fixed effects, given by σsy and µsm . We

cluster the standard errors at the state by flu-season level to account for the possible intraseasonal

correlation within states in the error term.

       Other variables of potential relevance are only available annually and likely do not vary much

within a flu season. Variables such as the average education level, the percent of the population

with health insurance, the percent immunized against the flu, the percent of the population living
   7
     There are four observations which have a flu measure of zero (two in Delaware and two in Montana, all four in
the month of May), so we add 0.01 to every flu measure before taking the natural log.
   8
     Versions of these tests can be seen in Table 2 and show that once three lags of the flu variable are included, only
lags one and two are significantly correlated with the dependent variable, which is what we would expect if our errors
were uncorrelated after the inclusion of the lags.

in rural areas, and the age distribution, may all contribute to the spread of the flu and will be

captured by the state-by-flu season fixed effects.

   The omission of two of these excluded variables, the percent of the population with health

insurance and the percent of the population immunized against the flu, may be of some concern.

Excluding monthly health insurance data from the analysis could bias results due to the correla-

tions with both employment and physician visits. However, employment and health insurance are

positively correlated, while the correlation between health insurance and influenza rates is negative

or zero. Thus if bias is introduced to the estimates by excluding a health insurance variable, the

bias is likely driving our results toward zero.

   Regarding the influenza vaccine, a vaccination is designed to protect an individual for an entire

flu season. That is, it is likely the case that the benefits from the vaccination are not seen in the

same month (or even adjacent months) in which the vaccine is received, assuming that the vaccine

is a good match. Estimates of the seasonal effectiveness of the vaccine range from 10 to 60 percent

(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018d). In the most recent U.S. flu season, the vaccine

effectiveness was 36 percent in 2017-18 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b). It is

therefore unlikely that monthly vaccination data would add to the analysis. The state by flu season

fixed effects absorb the impact of different vaccination rates each season in each state, which is

likely a more informative control than any monthly data that may exist.


4.1   Endogeneity in Dynamic Panel Data Model

Equation 1 may generate biased and inconsistent coefficients. As Nickell (1981) points out, when

variables are effectively transformed to be deviations from their mean in a fixed-effects model,

the lagged-dependent variable is correlated with the error. This inconsistency will translate to the

coefficients of other regressors that are correlated with the lagged-dependent variable. This problem

becomes more severe in instances where the number of cross-sectional observations is small (Beggs

and Nerlove, 1988). In order to deal with the problem, we first use the Anderson and Hsiao (1981)

first difference two stage least squares estimator. Anderson and Hsiao (1981) first difference all

           sym−1 ), ∆ln(Fsym−2 ), and ∆ln(Fsym−3 ) are instrumented for with ln(Fsym−4 ), ln(Fsym−5 ),

and ln(Fsym−6 ). Equation 2, while consistent, is possibly not efficient. Arellano and Bond (1991)’s

dynamic panel data model uses further lags of the dependent variable in a “difference GMM” frame-

work. However, one issue with the first-difference transformation is that it increases the number

of missing observations. Arellano and Bover (1995) suggest using “forward orthogonal deviations,”

where each observation is subtracted from the average of all available values of that variable.10

Thus, our final model implements an orthogonal forward deviations model as described in Arellano

and Bover (1995). We show that this model is robust to a number of specification tests.



5        Results

Table 2 displays our main regression results. Starting from left to right, we first examine a fixed-

effects model without incorporating lags of the flu prevalence, then estimate a lagged-dependent

variable model, then an Anderson and Hsiao (1981) style first-difference 2SLS model, and finally an

Arellano and Bover (1995) style orthogonal forward deviations GMM model. In the first column,

a one percentage point increase in the employment rate will lead to about a 27 percent increase

in flu prevalence. However, accounting for the communicable nature of the flu through lagged

dependent variables reduces the size of the employment coefficient. In our preferred specification

in Column (4), a one percentage point increase in the employment rate increases the flu prevalence

by 16 percent.11 The coefficient for the first-difference 2SLS model is consistent with that of the

Arrelano-Bover model, but is imprecisely estimated.12
    10
     See Arellano and Bover (1995) and Roodman (2009a) for more information.
    11
     The autocorrelation tests in Column (4) show that only lags one and two of the dependent variable are correlated
with the contemporaneous dependent variable, which suggests that the errors of our lagged model are not serially
correlated. We examined the robustness of changing number of lags which are included in the Arrelano-Bover model.
Including two lags of the dependent variable (instead of three) did not change the size or statistical significance of
the coefficient on employment, but autocorrelation tests from this model suggested that more lags of the dependent
variable were needed to account for autocorrelation. We additionally examined including four lags of the dependent
variable. The size of the coefficient on employment became somewhat smaller (0.13) but is still statistically significant
at the five percent level.
  12
     This is likely due to the inefficiency of the first-difference 2SLS estimator, which we discuss in Section 4.1



                                                           12
       To put the 16 percent effect into context, the average ILI measure is just over two percent.

Thus, a one percentage point increase in the employment rate translates to an average marginal

increase in flu prevalence of about 0.35 percentage points, or 3.5 additional flu-related doctor visits

per 1000 doctor visits for all causes. Moreover, a one percentage point change in employment over

the course of a month is quite large. The average absolute change in the employment rate from

one month to the next in our sample is 0.31 percentage points, so an average monthly increase in

the employment rate increases the flu incidence by one case per 1000 doctor visits. On average,

approximately 5,000 out of every 100,000 people visit a general practitioner every month (Centers

for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Thus, of the newly employed, we expect 18 additional

flu-related doctor visits above the mean, or a new total of 557 cases for the 100,000 individuals.


5.1      Robustness Checks

Next, we demonstrate that our results are robust to estimation with different dynamic panel data

model specifications. Table 3 reestimates our results from Column (4) in Table 2. A common

concern with models derived from Arellano and Bond (1991) is overidentification. In the main

specifications, all possible lags of the dependent variable are used as instruments which generates

42 instruments. In the first four columns, we undertake various strategies to reduce the number of

instruments, highlighted in Roodman (2009a). First, we limit the number of lags to one, instead of

using all available lags. This reduces the instruments to 24 (one for each lag for each of the eight

months we estimate our regressions). Next, we use principal components to reduce the instruments,

following Roodman (2009a), Bai and Ng (2010), and Kapetanios and Marcellino (2010). Finally, we

collapse the instrument matrix (Roodman, 2009b). In the final column, we show that our results

are robust to using the more standard first differences transformation, instead of the orthogonal

deviations in our main results. Across all the columns, we still see a positive and statistically

significant effect of employment on the flu.13

       Despite controlling for trends in flu incidence through state by month fixed effects, one might

worry that the positive relationship we find between employment and the flu reflects a spurious

relationship reflecting concurrent trends in the series. For example, a positive but spurious cor-
  13
    We also tested the robustness of our results to not using the logged flu rate, logging the employment rate, and
lagging the other controls (per-capita income and temperature/precipitation). These results, available upon request,
continue to show a positive, statistically significant relationship between employment and the flu.


                                                        13
relation might occur if the flu incidence increases in the early winter months at the same time

employment increases during the Christmas shopping season. An inspection of the data, however,

reveals a different story. Employment figures typically peak in the summer and fall throughout the

autumn and winter months. There is usually a slight rise in employment around December due to

the Christmas season, but the downward trend continues thereafter, typically until February. On

the other hand, flu cases rise during the fall and winter months, and nearly always peak around

February, which is usually the trough of the employment trend. In fact, the raw correlation between

the two time series is negative (r=-0.12). Thus, a positive coincidental seasonality of employment

and influenza is not of particular concern. If this phenomenon is biasing our results, it is driving

them toward zero.

       Another potential problem with our dependent variable is that labor market conditions may

affect the rate at which people go to the doctor.14 If people go to the doctor less when they are

unemployed, the number of flu-related physician visits could be likewise affected. To check, we

ran a regression of the log of the number of physician visits on the employment rate and other

controls. We found that as employment activity increases, the number of physician visits increases

by a very small, not statistically significant, amount. Our base models account for this potential

bias by using as the denominator for the dependent variable the number of physician visits rather

than the population. Thus, both the numerator (number of flu-related physician visits) and the

denominator (total number of physician visits) are affected by a change in insurance prevalence in

the population. We investigated the potential bias by regressing the log of the number of flu-related

physician visits on the variables in our preferred model, but adding in the log of the total number

of physician visits as an explanatory variable. The coefficients on the employment rate remain

positive and statistically significant and nearly identical to our main results.


5.2      Results by Industry Sector

The degree to which increased employment contributes to the spread of the flu is likely influenced

by heterogeneity in person-to-person exposure in different types of employment. That is, we expect

that industries with frequent interpersonal contact, like retail sales, should promote flu spread.
  14
    Another potential problem is that the spread of influenza may affect employment status. For example, someone
may be fired for being sick too often, or someone may leave their job to take care of a sick parent, spouse or child.
In the aggregate, these sources of bias are likely to be small.


                                                         14
Likewise, we may expect jobs that limit the employees’ exposure to people, like manufacturing,

to have an insignificant or negative effect on flu prevalence. The results of total employment will

reflect a combination of the effects in the different sectors. To see these differential effects, we

run models focusing on specific industries that are especially likely or unlikely to contribute to flu

prevalence, based on their levels of interpersonal contact.

       We use data from O*Net, which classifies occupations and occupational characteristics, and

measure the level of activities relating to interpersonal contact for each occupation.15 We calculate

the mean levels of how often each occupation engages in interpersonal contact activities (measured

on a scale of 1 to 7). Next, we match occupations to industries using the share of each occupation

in each industry according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Industry-Occupation Matrix.16 Table

4 shows the results of this analysis. The retail trade and healthcare sectors have the two highest

average measures of interpersonal contact while the manufacturing and construction sectors have

the two lowest average measures of interpersonal contact.

       We re-estimate our regressions from Table 2, Column (4) (the Arellano and Bover (1995) speci-

fication), replacing the aggregate employment rate with the employment rates from the sectors with

the highest and lowest levels of interpersonal contact. We expect that sectors with more personal

contact will be more positively related to the spread of the flu. Results from these regressions are

found in Table 5. We find that the retail sector and health sectors are positively and statistically

significantly related to the flu, with larger coefficients than in our results in Table 2. The coefficients

for employment in the manufacturing and construction sectors are much smaller in magnitude (and

negative for the construction sector), and are not statistically significant.
  15
      Specifically, we use 13 employment activities: “Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates,” “Com-
municating with Persons Outside Organization,” “Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships,” “As-
sisting and Caring for Others,” “Selling or Influencing Others,” “Resolving Conflicts and Negotiating with Others,”
“Performing for or Working Directly with the Public,” “Training and Teaching Others,” “Guiding, Directing, and
Motivating Subordinates,” “Coaching and Developing Others,” “Provide Consultation and Advice to Others,” “Per-
forming Administrative Activities,” and “Staffing Organizational Units.”
   16
      We first map the occupations in O*Net to occupations in the Bureau of Labor Statistics using a crosswalk lo-
cated here: https://www.onetcenter.org/taxonomy/2010/soc2018.html. The Bureau of Labor Statistics Industry-
Occupation Matrix is located here https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/industry-occupation-matrix-industry.

6    Conclusion

This paper examines whether labor market conditions affect the spread of the flu. Labor market

based activities, such as using public transportation and carpools, working in offices, putting chil-

dren in daycare, and having frequent contact with the public, are likely conducive to the spread of

the flu. We hypothesize that increases in the numbers of people working increase the spread of the

flu. We test our theory using state-level data on flu prevalence from the CDC and the employment

rate calculated from the BLS. We find evidence that the spread of the influenza virus is linked with

higher employment, particularly in industry sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact.

Specifically, we find that a one percentage point increase in the percent of the population that is

going to work will increase the prevalence of the flu-related physician visits by about 3.5 flu-related

physician visits per 1000 physician visits for all reasons. Our results are robust to changing both

the empirical strategy and the specification of the model.

    These results are relevant for several reasons. First, employment conditions can be forecast, to

a fairly accurate degree, several months in advance. This information could be used by the public

health community to plan for the severity of an upcoming flu season. For example, if the economy

is on an upswing, the public health community should plan for an above normal increase in flu

incidence. Furthermore, our results imply that employment in service industries—particularly the

retail and health care—is a particularly strong mechanism for flu spread. If our economy continues

to shift to more service oriented employment, the results presented here suggest there is greater

potential for flu spread in the future. Therefore, we suggest that monitoring shifts in employment

from goods producing jobs to service jobs could help officials plan for the severity of flu incidence.

    These results are also of interest to firms concerning productivity during the flu season. Em-

ployers should consider differences in the lost productivity from many employees becoming infected

with influenza versus the lost productivity from a few infected individuals taking sick leave. Work-

ers concerned about missing pay or losing their jobs as the result of staying home from work due

to illness will be less likely to heed early signs of influenza infection and stay home. Since a person

may be infectious while experiencing mild symptoms, this greatly increases the probability that

the virus will spread to other workers in the firm. This implies that firms should consider more

generous “sick day” policies, particularly during the flu season.


                                                  16
   Future research should concentrate on more micro-level data or testing this relationship inter-

nationally. Individual level data will allow a more direct estimation of the impact of employment

status on the incidence of flu. Additionally, this will allow the determination of what types of jobs

are most likely to aid in the spread of the flu virus.

Notes: Data from the CDC ILI, the O*Net Database (version 22), the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau
of Economic Analysis, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All models are run for the
2010/2011 to 2016/2017 flu seasons, which span from October to May. The dependent variable is the logged
rate of flu diagnoses from the CDC. Each model is estimated with Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data models
including two lags of the dependent variable. In addition the coefficients shown, all models include state by
flu season fixed effects and state by month fixed effects. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. The AR
Test statistics are p-values corresponding to Arrelano-Bond tests for first, second, third and fourth degree
autocorrelation. Stars denote statistical significance levels: ∗ : 10%, ∗∗ : 5%, and ∗∗∗ : 1%.
