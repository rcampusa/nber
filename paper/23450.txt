                                        ABSTRACT

We explore the effects of recent Medicaid expansions on Medicaid-financed prescriptions for
evidence-based smoking cessation medications. We estimate differences-in-differences models
using administrative data on the universe of prescription medications sold in retail and online
pharmacies for which Medicaid was a third-party payer. Our findings suggest that expansions
increased smoking cessation prescriptions by 36% with heterogeneity across medication class.
We provide evidence that these prescriptions were primarily financed by Medicaid programs and
not patients, and that our estimates reflect increases in prescriptions among newly eligible
populations and not other populations that enrolled in Medicaid due to Affordable Care Act-
related changes. Overall our findings suggest that the recent Medicaid expansions allowed newly
insured low-income smokers to access efficacious cessation medications.

1. Introduction

        Smoking is the largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States,

leading to more than 480,000 deaths each year and accounting for 30% of all cancer deaths

annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017). Despite the well-established health

harms of smoking, the adult smoking rate remains stubbornly high at 15% (National Center for

Health Statistics 2017). There is socioeconomic disparity in smoking: lower income groups are

more likely to smoke than higher income groups (National Center for Health Statistics 2017). In

particular, within Medicaid, a public insurance program that finances healthcare services for low-

income individuals, the smoking rate is 30% (National Center for Health Statistics 2017).

        This high smoking rate within the Medicaid population is troubling from a public finance

perspective as smoking-attributable Medicaid costs (e.g., cancer treatments, chronic bronchitis,

and emphysema) will be borne predominately by taxpayers. These costs are non-trivial:

smoking-related diseases accounted for 15%, or $45B, 1 of annual Medicaid expenditures

between 2006 and 2010 (Xu et al. 2015). Smoking cessation has been shown to both improve

health and reduce healthcare expenditures (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010,

Warren et al. 2014, Richard, West, and Ku 2012), suggesting that promoting cessation within

Medicaid broadly could confer substantial benefits to both government payers and enrollees.

        Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided enhanced federal matching

funds for states to expand their Medicaid programs to low-income (up to 138% of the federal

poverty level [FPL]), non-elderly, non-disabled adults. 2 For all enrollees, the ACA requires

Medicaid programs to cover Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription

 For states that expanded Medicaid, the federal government financed 100% of the costs for newly eligible
beneficiaries between 2014 and 2016. After that time, the federal contribution declines to 90% by 2020 and remains
at that level (Kaiser Family Foundation 2014).

                                                        2
cessation medications with little to no cost-sharing (DiGiulio et al. 2016). These medications are

efficacious (Biazzo et al. 2010, Ruger and Lazar 2012, Zhu et al. 2000, Aubin et al. 2008,

Cummings and Hyland 2005, Stead et al. 2012). For instance, a recent meta-analysis found that

prescription cessation medications helped 50-80% smokers quit versus a placebo (Cahill et al.

2013). While efficacious, these medications are expensive: prices range from $100 to $500 per

prescription for an uninsured smoker. 3 Low income uninsured smokers may have limited ability

to access to these medications. Indeed, Lillard et al. (2007) show that uninsured smokers are less

likely to use cessation medications in quit attempts than privately insured smokers.

         Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility was generally limited to children, poor parents,

pregnant women, and the disabled (‘traditional populations’). The newly eligible – primarily

low-income, non-disabled, and childless adults – have higher smoking rates and less experience

with the healthcare delivery system than traditional populations (DiGiulio et al. 2016, National

Center for Health Statistics 2014), 4 suggesting that the newly eligible may benefit from coverage

obtained through the ACA-related expansions. Recent estimates show that 2.3 million newly

eligible smokers gained access to Medicaid through the ACA expansions (DiGiulio et al. 2016),

which implies that the expansions have substantial scope to reduce smoking.

         We examine the effect of ACA Medicaid eligibility expansions to newly eligible

populations on utilization of Medicaid-financed prescription medications for smoking cessation

  We conducted a non-systematic review of online sales of these medications for an uninsured smoker to retrieve our
price estimates (e.g., https://www.goodrx.com/zyban; https://www.goodrx.com/chantix;
https://www.goodrx.com/nicotrol; accessed April 26th, 2017).

  According to the National Center for Health Statistics official estimates, in 2013 (in advance of January 1st, 2014
when the majority of expansion states expanded Medicaid) the Medicaid smoking rate was 30%. This number
should predominately reflect the smoking rate among traditional Medicaid eligible populations. DiGuilio and
colleagues estimate a smoking rate of 38% among newly eligible enrollees. We note that these estimates are from
different sources: the 2013 estimate is based on the National Health Interview Survey and the post-ACA estimate is
based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey combined
with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System.

approved by the FDA. To this end, we draw administrative data from the Medicaid State Drug

Utilization Database (SDUD) between 2011 and 2015. These data cover the universe of

prescription medication claims purchased from retail and online pharmacies for which Medicaid

was a third-party payer. While prescription fills do not directly capture medication use, previous

research documents that fills are a reliable proxy (Lehmann et al. 2014). Moreover, fills are

common proxies within economics (Richards et al. 2017, Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 2017).

       We contribute to the small literature that examines the impact of expanding access to

efficacious cessation medications within Medicaid in five important ways. (i) We examine the

effect of expanding coverage to newly eligible Medicaid populations, which have very high

smoking rates and have had little access to insurance previously. (ii) Our use of the SDUD

offers us access to the universe of Medicaid-financed prescription medications sold through retail

and online pharmacies, while previous studies have relied on survey data, which are vulnerable

to measurement error, or claims data that lack detailed payer information. (iii) Our data contain

information on Medicaid payments which we leverage to explore whether changes in

prescriptions were financed by Medicaid or patients. (iv) Because the medications we study

require a formal prescription from a healthcare provider, we are able to indirectly explore the

newly Medicaid-eligible smokers’ ability to access primary care services and to navigate the

changing U.S. healthcare delivery system, with which they have little experience. (v) We study

an important behavioral intermediary outcome: use of prescription cessation medications. The

literature on the smoking effects of ACA Medicaid expansions, which has examined self-

reported smoking in survey settings, is decidedly mixed (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017,

Courtemanche et al. 2017a), perhaps because cessation takes time and studies rely on, at most,

two years of post-2014 data. If cessation medications are a mechanism through which these



                                                 4
insurance expansions assist smokers quit, then we should observe changes in prescriptions prior

to changes in reported smoking status. Further, when assessing the value of a large-scale policy

intervention such as the ACA, understanding how the intervention affected healthcare service

use is important independent of intervention benefits (i.e., cessation).

       Our results suggest that expanding Medicaid to newly eligible populations increased

utilization of smoking cessation medications: post expansion Medicaid-financed prescription

medications for smoking cessation increased by 36% in expansion states relative to non-

expansion states with effects driven primarily by Zyban; the lowest cost FDA-approved

prescription medication for cessation. A dynamic model documents that effects increased over

time, which implies that we may observe more definitive evidence of smoking reductions

attributable to Medicaid expansion as time passes. Further, we document that these cessation

medications were primarily financed by state Medicaid programs and not patients. Finally,

prescription effects appear to be driven by increases in newly eligible populations and not other

groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related policy changes.

       This manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the Medicaid

program, outlines a conceptual model, and discusses the related literature. Data, variables, and

methods are presented in Section 3. Main results are reported in Section 4, and extensions and

sensitivity analyses are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 provides a discussion.

2. Medicaid, conceptual framework, and prior literature

2.1 The Medicaid program

       Medicaid finances healthcare services, including cessation services, for low income

people. Medicaid is a federal and state program, with states establishing policies within a set of




                                                  5
federal laws. Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly adults in most states was

limited to people with disabilities, pregnant women, and parents of poor children.

         The ACA originally mandated all states expand Medicaid or lose federal Medicaid

funding. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to expand eligibility to

retain federal funding. This ruling left Medicaid expansion optional to states. The decision to

expand Medicaid was largely determined by the party controlling the state’s lower legislative

chamber (Sobel 2014, Courtemanche et al. 2017b).

         Starting in 2014, the federal government generously subsidized states’ expansions of

Medicaid eligibility to most residents with incomes below 138% of the FPL; the threshold is

133% and there is an additional 5 percentage point disregard in both expansion and non-

expansion states. 5 By 2017, 32 states, including the District of Columbia, had expanded their

Medicaid programs under the ACA, and adults covered under this provision are referred to as

‘newly eligible.’ For non-expansion states, starting January 1st, 2014, the 5 percentage point

disregard (‘disregard’) increased income eligibility thresholds for traditional groups by 5

percentage points of FPL over the state’s March 2010 income thresholds. Populations that

gained coverage through this increase are not termed newly eligible.

         Prior to the ACA, states had substantial discretion in deciding what services to cover in

their Medicaid programs, and coverage of cessation products varied considerably (Singleterry et

al. 2014). Starting in January 2014, section 2502 of the Act required states to cover FDA-



5
  In most states, childless adults of any income level were not eligible for Medicaid prior to the ACA. In early 2010,
only 6 states (Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont) used federal waivers to offer
full Medicaid benefits to childless adults, and although 12 states offered limited benefits to this population, many of
these latter programs were closed to new applicants (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2009).
Using the early expansion option of the ACA, 5 additional states (California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey
and Washington) expanded eligibility to childless adults before 2014. In 2010, the District of Columbia, however,
was the only jurisdiction to use the early expansion option to provide for full benefits to 200% of FPL; others had
income thresholds below 138% FPL or limited eligibility to adults who were in older state-funded programs.

                                                          6
approved cessation products, both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, for all

Medicaid enrollees. These products include the prescription cessation medications

Zyban/bupropion (‘Zyban’) and Chantix/varenicline (‘Chantix’), and nicotine replacement

therapies (NRT) such as patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays, and inhalers (Food and Drug

Administration 2015). NRTs are available OTC and through formal prescriptions: patches, gum,

and lozenges are available OTC while nasal sprays and inhalers require a prescription. The ACA

does not regulate utilization management techniques for these medications but the Act does

encourage removing cost-sharing (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2012).

        The ACA Medicaid changes most relevant to our study are the increased number of

enrollees and improved coverage for prescription cessation medications. These changes have

implications for a study of ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking among the newly eligible.

        Increases in the number of Medicaid enrollees are attributable to coverage increases in

three groups: newly eligible adults, previously eligible individuals who opted to take up

Medicaid post-expansion; i.e., ‘welcome mat’ effects (Sonier, Boudreaux, and Blewett 2013),

and individuals who became eligible in non-expansion states due to the disregard. Our data –

administrative counts of Medicaid-financed prescription medications – do not allow us to

distinguish between these groups, but we attempt to isolate newly eligible effects. 6 We next

review the available evidence and our approaches to isolating newly eligible effects.

        Frean, Gruber, and Sommers (2017) show that welcome mat effects are similar across

expansion and non-expansion states. Our empirical model (differences-in-differences) can

account for common shocks to expansion and non-expansion states through inclusion of period

fixed effects. Under the assumption that welcome-mat effects are common across states, we are


6
 This limitation is common within the ACA-Medicaid expansion literature that relies on administrative or survey
data (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, Miller and Wherry 2017, Wherry and Miller 2016, Wen et al. 2017).

                                                        7
able to empirically account for these effects. 7 Because the income disregard changes affect

populations at different levels of the income distribution (i.e., within 5 percentage points of the

state’s March 2010 income eligibility threshold), these effects are not subsumed by the state or

period fixed effects included in our differences-in-differences models. Hence, our baseline

regression model cannot discriminate between newly eligible and those individuals who became

eligible due to the income disregard changes.

        To dig deeper into this question, we estimate three extensions to the main analysis.

Specifically, we (i) estimate a triple difference-style model that leverages variation in pre-ACA

Medicaid total enrollment and post-ACA newly eligible enrollment to isolate effects for the

newly-eligible from other groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to the ACA; (ii) separately study

managed care (MC) Medicaid financed prescriptions as the newly-eligibles are disproportionally

enrolled in MC plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2016); 8 and (iii)

select a sample of states for which we can separate newly eligible effects from income disregard

effects. While each of these explorations of the data has important limitations and caveats,

collectively the results generated in these extensions imply that our results are primarily

attributable to changes in prescription medications within newly eligible enrollees.

        The ACA increased coverage for cessation services in states that had limited coverage of

these services before the Act was implemented. For traditional populations, increased coverage

for cessation medications plausibly increased service use. These changes, if present, imply that

our estimates will capture both increased utilization among the newly eligible enrollees and

among traditional enrollees that gained improved coverage for cessation services. We address


7
  Moreover, Frean, Gruber, and Sommers (2017) show that the ACA Medicaid expansions did not lead to
measureable crowd-out of private insurance.
8
  For instance, in 2017 27 expansion states had MC plans and in 25 of these states, 80% or more of the newly
eligible were enrolled in MC plans and in 17 states over 90% were enrolled in MC plans (Paradise 2017).

                                                         8
this issue by focusing on states that experienced no change in coverage for these medications

during our study period; thus effects in this sample should largely reflect effects for populations

that enrolled in Medicaid and not previously eligible populations that gained improved coverage

for cessation services. We find that our results are not sensitive to this sample selection, which

suggests that our findings are not fully explained by continuously enrolled populations. 9

        In summary, while we cannot fully rule out the possibility that our estimates of newly

eligible effects are contaminated by other groups affected by ACA Medicaid changes, we

contend that our estimates largely reflect changes among the newly elgibles.

2.2 Conceptual framework

        The Grossman (1972) model of the demand for health and healthcare services motivates

our study. In the Grossman model consumers do not demand healthcare services per se, but

instead they demand the health improvements attributable to utilization of such services.

        In our study, consumers seeking to improve health by quitting their smoking addiction

could plausibly demand smoking cessation prescription medications. Consumers maximize a

utility function given the price of healthcare services and other goods, preferences, a health

endowment, a health production function, other factors that determine health, and a budget

constraint. Consumers are assumed to respond to healthcare price changes in a manner

comparable to other goods and services. We investigate the effect of recent Medicaid

expansions on demand for smoking cessation medications. Medicaid – by reducing the out-of-

pocket price – should increase the quantity of cessation medications demanded by consumers.




9
  A comparable concern is that early expansion states (Table 1) were not required to cover cessation services
between their expansion date and January 1st, 2014. As discussed later in the manuscript, we have excluded these
states from our analysis and results are not appreciably different (see Table 16).

                                                        9
        There are several factors unique to either Medicaid or addictive goods such as cigarettes

which may mute price effects. (i) Insurance does not always reduce out-of-pocket prices as

many providers do not accept Medicaid, indeed a major concern among ACA policy makers was

lack of provider participation in Medicaid (Decker 2012). (iii) Ex ante moral hazard suggests

that, by lowering smoking-attributable healthcare costs, insurance may incentivize individuals –

who no longer face the full costs of their health behaviors – to delay or deter smoking cessation

(Klick and Stratmann 2006). 10 (iv) If insurance acts as an in-kind income transfer to the newly

eligible, and if smoking is a normal good (Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban 2014), the newly

eligible may in fact increase smoking. (v) Finally, other ACA-related changes (e.g.,

communication efforts, simplification of the enrollment process) may amplify Medicaid effects

through non-price channels (Frean, Gruber, and Sommers 2016).

        The question of whether, and to what extent, ACA Medicaid expansions lead to changes

in prescription cessation medications is ultimately an empirical question. While our differences-

in-differences methods will not allow us to explore these specific pathways, our objective is to

provide evidence on the net effect. Moreover, the decision to expand Medicaid is the most direct

policy lever under consideration among states.

2.3 Literature

        We review literature on the price elasticity of demand for cessation medications and the

related Medicaid literature.

        While there is a substantial economic literature that estimates the elasticity of demand for

cigarettes (Tauras et al. 2016, Maclean, Webber, and Marti 2014, Pesko et al. 2016, Decicca et

al. 2008, Chaloupka and Warner 2000, Gallet and List 2003), a relatively small set of studies has


10
  We note that an ex post moral hazard story would suggest that cessation medication use will increase post-
expansion in expanding states.

                                                        10
estimated price elasticities for cessation medications. These studies are informative for our work

as insurance reduces the out-of-pocket price for cessation medications. Tauras and Chaloupka

(2003) estimate that the average own-price elasticity of demand for a nicotine patches and gum

were -2.3 and -2.5 respectively, suggesting that smokers’ demand for these products is highly

elastic. Paterson et al. (2008) and Marti (2012) show, using choice experiments, that smokers

were less likely to choose a cessation medication when its price was experimentally increased.

While not formally estimating a price elasticity of demand, Keeler et al. (2002) document that

when a cessation medication became available OTC, rather than requiring a prescription from a

provider which is costly to the consumer, the quantity demanded of this product increased.

           Several studies show that pre-ACA Medicaid expansions – which primarily affected

traditional populations – increased utilization of cessation medications and reduced smoking.

The extent to which these findings can generalize to the ACA’s newly eligible adults is unclear.

Liu (2009) documents higher smoking cessation rates among non-elderly adult women residing

in states with a higher composite index of Medicaid coverage for cessation medications. Liu

(2010) shows that Medicaid coverage increased quit attempts while Greene, Sacks, and

McMenamin (2014) find that reduced cost-sharing led to higher cessation rates among Medicaid

recipients. Adams et al. (2013) and Jarlenski et al. (2014) show that Medicaid participation, and

enrollment and coverage policies reduced maternal smoking. Witman (2013) documents that

expanded Medicaid coverage reduced smoking by 6% among low-income individuals who report

ever smoking. Richards et al. (2017) use insurance claims show that coverage increased

utilization by 20 prescriptions for Zyban and Chantix per 10,000 persons. 11




11
     A limitation of the Richards study is that the authors were not able to explore payer source.

                                                            11
        The early literature evaluating the ACA Medicaid expansions finds evidence that

prescription medications increased, but no study examines cessation medications. 12 Medicaid-

financed prescription utilization increased by 19% in expansion states relative to non-expansion

states (Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 2017). Wen et al. (2017) show that utilization of Medicaid-

financed buprenorphine (a medication used to treat opioid use disorder) prescriptions increased

by 70% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. Maclean and Saloner (2017) find

that use of Medicaid-financed medications used to treat a wider set of substance use disorders, all

FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol and drug use disorders (but not smoking cessation),

increased by 43% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. Finally, Maclean et al.

(2017) show that, post-expansion, prescriptions for psychotropic medications used to treat

mental illness increased 22% in expanding states relative to non-expanding states. Importantly,

these papers do not attempt to isolate effects for the newly eligible and, instead, plausibly capture

effects for newly eligible, previously eligible populations that enrolled due to welcome mat

effects, and populations that become eligible due to income disregard changes.

         The effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking are mixed which is not entirely

surprising as studies rely on just two years of post-2014 data and the transition from smoking to

cessation is time-intensive. Longitudinal evidence suggests that a smoker attempts to quit on

average 30 times or more before successfully quitting for 1 year or longer (Chaiton et al. 2016).

Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017) find that Medicaid expansion reduced past 30-day smoking

among childless non-elderly adults by 6% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.




12
  Young-Wolff et al. (2017) use a pre-post design to provide evidence that cessation medication use increased post-
expansion among Medicaid enrollees in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system.

                                                        12
Smoking propensities were not altered by the expansion in any other group. Courtemanche et al.

(2017a), using the same data, 13 find no evidence that these expansions affected smoking.

3. Data, variables, and methods

3.1 Prescription medication data

        We use the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database (SDUD). The SDUD is compiled

by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) from administrative data submitted by state

Medicaid programs and include all states’ data for outpatient prescription medications (initial

fills and refills) covered under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for which Medicaid serves as

a third-party payer (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012). Since 1992, state

Medicaid programs have been required to submit data on the number and type of prescriptions

filled and refilled each quarter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in

exchange for federal matching funds.

        We use data from 2011 to 2015 in our study, and have 20 periods of data for each state:

12 pre-2014 and 8 post-2014. While the SDUD has data from fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid

since 1992, prescription fills and refills obtained through managed care (MC) plans were added

in March, 2010 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012). We use data from 2011

onward to ensure that we are able to include both FFS and MC data (Wen et al. 2017). 14 The

ability to measure MC data when analyzing the ACA Medicaid expansions is imperative as the

majority of the newly eligible are enrolled in MC plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and

   Simon et al use a differences-in-differences model comparable to the one we estimate while Courtemanche et al
take a third difference based on pre-ACA insurance rates within a local area. We are unable to implement the
Courtemanche et al method in our state-level data that focuses on a single payer (Medicaid).
14
   Specifically, we aggregate data from both FFS and MC Medicaid to create a single quarter of data.

the Uninsured 2016). We exclude five states – Arizona, Hawaii, Ohio, Rhode Island, and

Virginia – that display odd data patterns. 15

         We focus on prescription medications approved by the FDA for cessation (Food and

Drug Administration 2015): Zyban, Chantix, and Nicotrol (an NRT with inhaler and spray

versions). 16 We create these categories using crosswalks between National Drug Codes (NDCs)

for brand name and generics obtained from the National Bureau of Economic Research (Roth

2017). 17 Our main analysis combines all medications, but we also study each medication

separately. There are two main limitations of the SDUD data. (i) They capture aggregate counts

of prescription initial fills and refills, and do not provide information on patient or provider

characteristics. 18 (ii) They do not include rebates by manufacturers to the states.

3.2 Medicaid expansion

         Table 1 summarizes our classification of expansion states. The majority of expansion

states implemented their expansion on January 1st, 2014. Two states expanded Medicaid later in

2014 (Michigan and New Hampshire) and five states expanded in 2015 or 2016 (Alaska, Indiana,

Louisiana, Montana, and Pennsylvania) and we refer to these states as ‘late expansion states’.

Prior to 2011, four states (Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont) and the District of

Columbia substantially expanded their Medicaid eligibility to cover both parents and childless

adults with full Medicaid benefits up to 100% FPL or higher and remained open to new


15
   Including these five states does not change our results in a meaningful way. Details available on request.
16
   Specific medication classifications that we use to identify these medications are available on request from the
corresponding author. Zyban can be used for multiple purposes including cessation, depression, attention deficit
disorder, obesity, and substance use (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/ucm089835.pdf (accessed
March 31st, 2017). We wish to focus on Zyban that is prescribed to aid cessation. Thus, in our main analyses we
include the following medications: proprietary name Zyban, Buproban, or bupropion, extended release, with the
strength 150mg. In unreported analyses, we have applied more inclusive definitions which, we suspect, include
Zyban prescriptions for other purposes. Results, available on request, are comparable.

18
   Thus we cannot study the number unique prescription users, because some patients may try more than one
medication. However, we are interested in overall changes in service use.

enrollees. The SDUD data are available at the quarter level, and thus we match Medicaid

expansion dates to this dataset based on state-year-quarter. Our classification closely follows

Wherry and Miller (2016), and Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017).

3.3 Outcome variables

         We construct the number of prescriptions filled and refilled for all three medications. 19

We construct total payments and Medicaid and non-Medicaid payments, which allows us to test

whether Medicaid or patients financed medications. We convert payments to 2015 dollars using

a healthcare cost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator (Dunn, Grosse, and Zuvekas 2018).

For each state, we divide each outcome variable by the total population between the ages of 18 to

64 years age (the group most likely to be affected by ACA Medicaid expansions (Simon, Soni,

and Cawley 2017)) of age using data drawn from the American Community Survey (ACS)

(Flood et al. 2017) and the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center (2016). 20

3.4 Control variables

         We control for a range of state-level variables in our regressions. First, we merge in

tobacco cigarette and electronic cigarette regulations: taxes and bans on use in public places

(restaurants, bars, and private worksites) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

(2016) STATE System. These variables reflect the costs of related goods. We use the tax in

dollars per package of 20 tobacco cigarettes and an indicator for an e-cigarette tax. For public




19
  The specific NDCs used for these outcomes are available on request.
20
  We could have standardized our outcomes by the number of Medicaid enrollees. However, we chose not to use
this standardization as the number of enrollees is clearly influenced by a states’ decision to expand Medicaid. Thus,
we would have an endogenous numerator and denominator which complicates interpretation of our regression
coefficients as there would be two changing objects (cessation medications and enrollees).

                                                         15
use bans, we construct separate variables for tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes that capture the

count of the number of venues in which a state imposes a ban on product use.

        Second, we merge in data on state-level demographics from the Annual and Social and

Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS): average age, sex, race, Hispanic

ethnicity, and education. Third, we link the annual seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the

state from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Database and the poverty

rate (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016) to the SDUD.

        Fourth, we control for state social policies targeting lower income populations. To this

end, we turn to the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center (2016) and we

control for the maximum Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefit for a family

of four, the maximum Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit for a family

of four, and the effective state minimum wage (i.e., the higher of the federal or state minimum

wage). We also include an indicator for a Democratic governor; we treat the mayor of the

District of Columbia as the de facto governor of this locality (Maclean and Saloner 2018). We

convert all financial variables to constant 2015 dollars using the above-noted GDP deflator. 21

3.5 Empirical model

        Our differences-in-differences model is outlined in Equation (1):

(1)      𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛼𝛼2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of prescription fills and refills in state s in period t. 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is an indicator

for whether or not a state has expanded its Medicaid program under the ACA in quarter t. 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is

a vector of state-year level characteristics. 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 and 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 are vectors of state and year-by-quarter

fixed effects. Inclusion of state fixed effects controls for time-invariant state-level unobservable


21
  We do not attempt to control for state-year smoking rates, a determinant of demand for smoking cessation,
because smoking rates are plausibly endogenous to the policy we study (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017).

                                                                 16
factors and implies that our models are identified off within-state variation in Medicaid

expansions. Year-by-quarter fixed effects control for secular trends in cessation medication use

that affect the nation as a whole (e.g., national anti-smoking campaigns) and ACA-related

changes that plausibly apply to all states (e.g., welcome-mat effects). We also include a vector

of state-specific linear time trends (Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ). 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the error term.

        We estimate regressions using unweighted OLS and cluster standard errors around the

state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004). The 46 clusters (after dropping 5 states with

missing data) allow us to consistently estimate standard errors (Cameron and Miller 2015).

3.6 Validity

        A necessary assumption for the DD model to recover causal estimates is that the

treatment group (i.e., states with substantial expansions) and the comparison group (i.e., states

without expansions) would follow the same trend in the post-treatment period, had the treatment

states not been treated. However, this assumption is inherently untestable. We instead attempt

to provide suggestive evidence on this assumption in two ways.

        (i) We examine unadjusted trends in the pre-treatment period in our outcome variables

for the treatment and comparison groups. If we find that the outcomes appear to trend similarly

in the pre-treatment period across these groups, such trends provide suggestive evidence that the

SDUD data satisfy the parallel trends assumption. (ii) Using only pre-treatment data, we

estimate regression models similar to Equation (1), except that we replace the 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

variable with an interaction between the treatment group (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠 ) and a linear time trend

(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 ) Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013). The model is presented in Equation (2):

(2)     𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛾𝛾0 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠




                                                                   17
If we cannot reject the null hypothesis that 𝛾𝛾1 is zero, then this finding provides further support

that our SDUD data can satisfy the parallel trends assumption. In both validity tests, we exclude

states with substantial expansions before 2011.

4. Results

4.1 Summary statistics

       Table 2 reports summary statistics for both expansion and non-expansion states in the

period 2011 to 2013. States with substantial expansions before 2011 are excluded from this

comparison. We also report p-values from t-tests assessing the statistical significance of the

differences between the two groups. The annual number of cessation medication prescription

fills and refills per 100,000 non-elderly adults was 250 per quarter in expansion states and 208

per quarter in non-expansion states. While not identical, the two groups of states are generally

similar across observed characteristics. However, there are some notable exceptions. On

average, expansion states had higher tobacco cigarette taxes, more venue-specific smoking bans,

lower poverty rates, and more generous social policies (e.g., higher effective minimum wages)

and were more likely to have a Democrat governor than non-expansion states.

4.2 Validity

       Figure 1 provides graphical analysis of trends in cessation prescription medication fills

and refills over our study period. We aggregate the data to the year-treatment level to smooth

out noise. In 2011-2013, prescription fills and refills appear to have moved broadly in parallel in

the expansion and non-expansion states, which supports the hypothesis that the SDUD data

satisfy the parallel trends assumption. However, in 2014-2015, we observe that the expansion

and non-expansion states appeared to follow different trends. Overall, expansion states were

relatively stable in terms of the number of prescription fills and refills reimbursed by Medicaid in



                                                  18
the first and second year of the treatment, while non-expansion states appeared to trend

downwards in reimbursed fills and refills in the second year of the treatment.

        We report regression-based parallel trends testing in the left-hand panel of Table 3. We

cannot reject the null hypothesis that expansion states and non-expansion states followed similar

trends in prescription fills and refills in 2011-2013: 𝛾𝛾�1 is not statistically different from zero.

Moreover, the estimate of 𝛾𝛾1 are is small and relatively precise, which allows us to rule out

moderate violations of the parallel trends assumption in 2011-2013. In particular, the estimate of

𝛾𝛾1 is 2, relative to a baseline mean of 250, and the standard error estimate is 2.

4.3 Regression results

        Table 3 (right-hand panel) reports our main DD results for our outcome variables. Post

expansion, we find that expansion states experienced an increase of 89 prescription fills and

refills per 100,000 non-elderly adults per quarter relative to non-expansion states. Compared to

the baseline mean in expansion states before expansion, this estimate reflects a 36% increase.

        We also consider payments – total, Medicaid, and non-Medicaid – for these prescriptions.

As noted earlier in the manuscript, an important limitation of the SDUD is that it does not

include rebates that Medicaid programs receive from pharmaceutical companies. This limitation

is particularly important if expanding Medicaid allowed expansion states to bargain for higher

rebates due to increased market power. However, even given this data limitation, we contend

that this exercise is informative for studying whether Medicaid or patients carried the financial

responsibility for the increase in prescription medications documented in Table 3. 22

        Results are reported in Table 4; the top panel reports regression-based testing of the

parallel trends assumption while the bottom panel reports estimates generated in our DD models.


22
  For example, we contend that it is unlikely that expanding Medicaid allowed state Medicaid programs to negotiate
rebates from pharmaceutical companies that fully offset payments that we observe in the SDUD.

                                                       19
Total payments per quarter on these medications was $15,375 per 100,000 in expansion states.

Medicaid paid the vast majority – 99% in expansion states– of the costs of FDA-approved

smoking cessation medications. The financial responsibility of Medicaid is perhaps not

surprising as the program is characterized by low patient cost-sharing.

       Results suggest that the SDUD satisfy the parallel trends assumption: coefficient

estimates in the top panel are small in magnitude and imprecise in the total and Medicaid

payments regressions. We find evidence that non-Medicaid payments were increasing 2011-

2013 in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, thus we are cautious when interpreting

DD results for this outcome. However, we include state-specific linear time trends in our DD

models which can account for some (linear) differences in pre-trends.

       Turning to estimates generated in our DD model, we observe that in expansion states

relative to non-expansion states, total payments on these medications per 100,000 per quarter

increased by $4,241, or 28% after the expansion. Estimates for Medicaid payments are similar:

post expansion Medicaid payments rose by $4,295 per 100,000 non-elderly adults per quarter, or

28%, in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. The estimate in the non-Medicaid

payment regression is large in magnitude (-$54) but imprecise. Collectively, our findings from

the SDUD show increased cessation prescription use among the newly insured and that the

newly insured were sheltered from bearing the full financial responsibility of these prescriptions.

       There are two somewhat surprising findings generated in our payments analysis. First,

the relative increase in total and Medicaid payments is greater than the relative increase in

prescriptions. However, examination of the lower (upper) tail of the prescription medication

(total/Medicaid payment) 95% confidence interval suggests that the two sets of variables

experienced more analogous changes post-expansion in expanding states relative to non-



                                                 20
expanding states. The lower tail of the prescription medication 95% confidence interval suggests

a 21% increase and the upper tail of the total payments 95% confidence interval suggests a 49%

increase. Thus, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that changes in prescriptions and payments

were comparable post-expansion. Second, Medicaid payments increased by $54 more than total

payments. 95% confidence intervals for these estimates overlap, and therefore we cannot rule

out the possibility that total payments increased more than Medicaid payments.

5. Extensions and sensitivity analyses

       We estimate several extensions to the main analyses and conduct sensitivity analyses.

5.1 Heterogeneity by medication

       The three medications in our analyses vary in how much state Medicaid programs pay

pharmacies – the average cost for Zyban, Chantix, and Nicotrol is $42, $191, and $235,

respectively, per fill or refill in the SDUD during our study period. The medications also have

different efficacy and side effects (Food and Drug Administration 2015). Such differences may

lead to different effects of Medicaid expansion on prescriptions. We next explore heterogeneity

by estimating separate regressions for each medication. Results are reported in Table 5.

       Before we proceed to our heterogeneity analysis, we provide suggestive evidence that the

SDUD can satisfy the parallel trends assumption for each cessation medication separately. We

are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the expansion states and non-expansion states

followed the same trend in these outcomes in the pre-expansion period. Turning to our DD

estimates, we find that, post-expansion, Zyban prescription fills and refills increased 40% in

expansion states relative to non-expansion states. We find no statistically significant evidence

that prescription fills or refills for Chantix or Nicotrol increased in expansion states.




                                                  21
       While our data do not allow us to explore the reasons behind the differential effects by

cessation medication type, there are several possible reasons for this pattern of results. First,

newly eligible smoking patients may be directed, perhaps through the use of differential co-

payments or other forms of utilization management, toward less costly medications (Zyban) and

away from more expensive medications (Chantix and Nictorol). Given the clinical literature

does not suggest that these medications differ substantially in terms of their efficacy, this pattern

of results could imply that the newly eligible are being treated in a cost-effective manner.

Second, despite our efforts to focus on Zyban for smoking cessation rather than bupropion for

depression, it is possible that some of the increase in our Zyban measure reflects it is use as an

antidepressant (Maclean et al. 2017). Other possibilities include patient preferences, provider

preferences for, or knowledge of, medications, or some other factor.

5.2 Event study

       We estimate an event study to explore the possibility of policy endogeneity (Autor 2003).

More specifically, we augment Equation (1) with a series interactions between period indicators

for Q1 2011 through Q4 2015, and an indicator for expansion states (policy leads and lags). Q4

2013 is the omitted period in the event study. We omit the state-specific linear time trends

following Wolfers (2006). We exclude states with substantial expansions before 2011.

       We report event study results graphically in Figure 2; specific coefficient and standard

error estimates are reported in Appendix Table 1. The event study findings are in line with

estimates generated in the DD regression models. The coefficient estimates are small in

magnitude and generally imprecise (95% confidence intervals include zero) before 2014.

Coefficients become positive and precise in Q1 2014, and increase in magnitude over time. The

increasing effect sizes in the post-period are in line with the hypothesis that patients are better



                                                  22
able to access services over time, perhaps as they become aware of their benefits and/or are able

to navigate the healthcare delivery system (e.g., enroll in Medicaid, locate a physician, schedule

an appointment, and fill a prescription). 23 These increasing effect sizes over time suggests that

cessation will also increases as time passes. Given that the ACA Medicaid literature on smoking

effects is decidedly mixed (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, Courtemanche et al. 2017a), our

findings for a mechanism through which insurance may affect smoking is informative.

5.3 Weighting

        There is controversy as to whether weighting is appropriate in studies that seek to

estimate causal effects (Angrist and Pischke 2009, Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge 2015). Given

this controversy, we re-estimate Equation (1) using population weights; we weight the

regressions with the population ages 18 to 64 in each state. Results are reported in Table 6 and

are not appreciably different from the unweighted results generated in our core model (Table 3).

5.4 Counselling services and over-the-counter cessation medications

        Over time states have increasingly covered smoking cessation counseling (Singleterry et

al. 2014); which may change the use of cessation medications, either by substituting for or

encouraging medication adherence. Moreover, Medicaid expansion plans include coverage for

OTC FDA-approved NRTs. Thus, our analysis may be vulnerable to omitted variable bias as we

do not control for these related covered services.

        We re-estimate Equation (1) including an indicator variable for whether a state-year-

quarter covers counselling services (individual or group) or at least one FDA-approved OTC




23
  We note that another common concern in policy analyses is program induced migration. That is, some individuals
may migrate from non-expansion states to expansion states and such behavior will bias regression coefficients
(Moffitt 1992). To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence that the ACA Medicaid expansions induced this
type of cross-state migration behavior (Goodman 2017).

                                                      23
NRT (nicotine gum, lozenge, or patch). Table 7 reports results: coefficient estimates are not

appreciably different from our core findings (Table 3).

        To dig deeper into the importance of OTC NRTs, we re-estimate Equation (1) using the

above-noted FDA-approved OTC NRTs as variables analogous to our prescription medication

variables. 24 We examine common OTC NRTs (e.g., Nicoderm, Nicorette, generic brands for

national box stores such as Walmart’s brand Equate) using the method outlined in Section 3.1.

Results are reported in Table 8. We also report regression-based testing of the parallel trends

assumption in the left-hand panel of Table 8; this analysis suggests that the OTC data are able to

satisfy this assumption. Turning to our DD estimates (right-hand panel), we find no statistically

significant evidence that OTC NRT prescriptions fills and refills increased post expansion.

        It is surprising that we find increases in prescription medications but no corresponding

increases in the OTC NRTs post-expansion. We propose possible reasons. (i) OTC NRTs tend

to be less expensive than prescription medications and OTC NRTs may be more affordable to

uninsured smokers seeking to quit, but when prescription medication out-of-pocket prices

decline with Medicaid coverage smokers switch to the latter, more expensive, product. 25 (ii)

Many states offered OTC NRTs for free or at a heavy discount pre-ACA (Cummins et al. 2007)

and uninsured smokers may have relied on these discounts pre-expansion and may continue to

obtain NRTs outside Medicaid. (iii) The clinical literature suggests that prescription medications

are more efficacious than OTC NRTs, thus newly insured smokers (perhaps in combination with

healthcare providers) wishing to quit their smoking addiction may simply be selecting the



24
   Medicaid programs typically require a prescription for OTC NRTs, hence we are able to study these medications
in the SDUD. For example, see the New York (https://www.nysmokefree.com/subpage.aspx?pn=medications;
accessed August 21st 2017) and Mississippi (https://medicaid.ms.gov/wp-

documentation relating to OTC NRT coverage.

optimal cessation method post-expansion. (iv) Coefficient estimates in Table 8 are positive

while the standard error estimates are relatively large, thus we cannot definitively rule out the

hypothesis that OTC NRT prescriptions increased post-expansion.

5.5 Utilization management techniques

         The ACA did not regulate state Medicaid program use of utilization management

techniques. According to the CDC (2016), the most common forms of utilization management

are copayments, annual duration limits, and prior authorization. There is concern among

healthcare scholars that such techniques may offset expansion effects (McAfee et al. 2015). To

explore this possibility, we estimate a variant of Equation (1) that includes an indicator that takes

on a value of one if the state applies one of the above-noted utilization management techniques,

and zero otherwise. Results (Table 9) are not appreciably different from our core findings (Table

3), and suggest that utilization management techniques do not offset expansion effects. 26,27

5.6 Primary care

         A concern among policy makers is that, post-expansion, the newly eligible will not be

able to access primary care given difficulties, pre-ACA, faced by Medicaid patients in accessing

this type of care (Decker 2012). To explore the importance of access to primary care, where

many of the prescriptions that we study here likely originate, we next estimate separate

regressions for states with relatively high and relatively low access to primary care.

         We combine data from the Area Resource File (ARF) on the number of physicians

delivering primary care and data from CMS on the number of Medicaid enrollees in each state to


26
   In unreported analyses we have used different coding schemes for utilization management and the results, which
are available on request, are not appreciably different.
27
   Using data from the CDC STATE system, we have explored the extent to which expansion states have complied
with the ACA cessation medication regulation that, post January 1st 2014, Medicaid must cover all three medications
that we study here. Overall, states appear to be broadly in compliance with this requirement. However, we did find
evidence that several states were not fully compliant (i.e., did not cover all medications). In unreported analyses, we
excluded non-compliant states from the analysis sample. Results are robust and are available on request.

                                                          25
construct the ratio of physicians who might be delivering patient care to Medicaid enrollees. We

classify states as ‘high access’ (at or above the median value of the primary physician-Medicaid

enrollee ratio for the nation) or ‘low access’ (below the median value of the primary physician-

Medicaid enrollee ratio for the nation). We use ARF and CMS data from 2010, in advance of the

Medicaid expansions we study, to avoid stratifying the sample based on an endogenous variable

(i.e., the number of enrollees). 28 Results are reported in Table 10.

        We find similar effects (i.e., when comparing coefficient estimates to the pre-expansion

means) in the low access sample than the high access sample. This is in line with Abdus and Hill

(2017) who find no evidence of negative spillovers of the expansions on insured populations.

5.7 Isolating effects for the newly eligible

        A limitation of the SDUD data, similar to many survey and administrative datasets used

to study ACA Medicaid expansions, is that the data do not include information on patients to

allow separation of the newly eligible from other Medicaid enrollees. We explore effects in

different specifications and samples to tease out effects among newly eligible enrollees. Each of

these extensions is subject to important limitations, which we outline below. We argue that

considering results generated in these extensions collectively is informative for thinking through

the extent to which we can interpret our main estimates (Table 3) as reflecting effects for the

newly eligible or some combination of groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related

changes; i.e., newly eligible populations, previously eligible populations that enrolled in

Medicaid due to welcome mat effects, and populations that become eligible for Medicaid due to

changes in the income disregard.




28
 We note that the number of physicians is also potentially endogenous to the expansions we study. Indeed, the
ACA allocated resources toward increasing healthcare workforce and infrastructure (Abdus and Hill 2017).

                                                       26
         Our first approach to minimize contamination from welcome-mat and income disregard

effects is to estimate a triple-difference style estimator to isolate effects for the newly eligible.

We augment Equation (1) with a three-way interaction between an indicator for the expansion

period, the post period (this varies across states depending on when the state expanded

Medicaid), and the newly eligible as a percent of increased enrollment. We define the newly

eligible share of increased enrollment between 2013 and each period in the following manner:
                                            𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
(3)       𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇                         ∗ 100%
                                        𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 −𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,2013


Where 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of newly eligible enrollees in state s in period t, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the total

number of enrollees in state s in time t, and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,2013 is the total number of enrollees in state s

in 2013. This variable is coded as zero in all years prior to expansion for expansion states and

for non-expansion states in all periods. We constrain 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 to lie between 0% and 100% in

all years. 29 We exclude early expanding states from this analysis. 30 The Medicaid expansion

indicator captures the effect of Medicaid expansion on all Medicaid enrollees other than the

newly eligible (welcome mat and income disregard) and the three-way interaction captures the

effect for the newly eligible. We do not include the main effect for 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 as it is collinear

with other variables in the regression. A limitation of this analysis is that the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 variable

is likely influenced by Medicaid expansion, hence results generated in this specification may be

vulnerable to over-controlling bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009). We report results in Table 11.




29
   We set 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 to zero for a few states that had declines in total enrollment, perhaps due to the improving
economy over the study period. We capped 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 at 100%, because, in readily available CMS enrollment
summaries, early expansion enrollees were reclassified in 2014 as ‘newly eligible,’ making it appear as though the
newly eligible grew more than total enrollment.
30
   Including these states in the analysis does not alter our results appreciably (results available on request). We
chose to exclude these variables as they did enroll newly eligible prior to January 1st, 2014 but our data source for
enrollees (CMS) began tracking enrollment by newly eligible status in January 1st, 2014.

                                                                           27
        The interaction between the expansion indicator and post is not statistically different from

zero in this specification; the confidence interval is quite wide and thus we cannot rule out

increases in prescriptions for the non-newly eligible Medicaid populations. However, the

coefficient on the three-way interaction is positive and precise. To interpret this coefficient

estimate, we multiply it by the mean value of 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 in the post-period among expansion

states (82.85%). We find that, post-expansion, prescriptions among newly eligible populations

increased by 90 per 100,000 non-elderly residents each quarter (36%). This estimate is very

similar to that estimated in our main specification (Table 3; an increase of 89 prescriptions per

quarter or 36%). We interpret these results to suggest that our findings are primarily attributable

to increases in prescriptions among the newly eligible. This pattern is in line with findings for

primary care visits (Biener, Zuvekas, and Hill 2017), a setting in which cessation medication

prescriptions are likely to be written. The authors show that, post-expansion, primary care visits

increased among newly-eligibles but such visits were not altered among previously eligibles.

        As a second approach, we re-estimate Equation (1) in for prescriptions financed by MC

plans and FFS Medicaid plans separately. Interviews with state Medicaid program directors

reveal that most newly eligibles are enrolled in MC plans while traditional populations are more

likely to be enrolled in FFS plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2016).

We argue that separating the data in this manner can allow us to provide estimates for samples

that better reflect the newly eligible and other populations that enrolled in Medicaid. A

limitation of this extension is that there is not a perfect correlation between newly eligible

enrollees and Medicaid plan (MC vs. FFS); i.e., there are obviously newly eligibles enrolled in

FFS plans, and previously eligibles and individuals who became eligible due to changes in the

income disregard enrolled in MC plans. We are simply relying on the fact that the newly



                                                  28
eligibles are much more likely to enroll in MC plans based on reports by state Medicaid program

directors. For the analysis of MC plans we include only those state/year pairs that have MC data

appearing in the SDUD (not all states have MC programs in all years of our study period) and we

exclude the four expansion states that do not use MC for newly eligibles during our study period

(Arkansas, Connecticut, Montana, and Vermont).

         Results are reported in Table 12. The MC sample produces an estimate very similar to

our main estimates although relative effect size is larger (Table 3). In particular, post-expansion,

the number of quarterly prescription fills and refills in MC plans increased by 62 (55%) in

expansion states relative to non-expansion states. 31 In terms of the FFS sample, we find no

statistically significant evidence that prescriptions financed by FFS Medicaid increased in

expanding states relative to non-expansion states. The effect size (both absolute and relative) is

smaller in the FFS sample than the MC sample. We interpret these findings to suggest that our

main DD estimates primarily capture effects for the newly eligible and not other groups that

enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related changes.

         Finally, we attempt to remove effects attributable those enrollees who became eligible

due to the five percentage point increase in the income thresholds for both expansion and non-

expansion states. This policy change occurred January 1st, 2014 for all states. Hence, for states

that expanded Medicaid on January 1st, 2014, Medicaid expansion and the income disregard

increase are perfectly collinear. To separate these two effects, we re-estimate Equation (1)

excluding all states that expanded January 1st, 2014 and early expansion states (see Table 1). We

exclude the early expansion states as, while these states did have major Medicaid expansions

prior to the ACA-related expansions we study, the ACA expansion substantially increased the


31
 The relative effect size is larger as the baseline number of prescription fills and refills is lower in the MC
Medicaid-financed sample than in the overall sample of prescriptions.

                                                           29
number of individuals eligible for Medicaid. Excluding these states allows us to recover effects

for the newly eligible from effects for those individuals who became eligible due to the income

disregard. However, an important limitation of this approach is that we leverage variation from

the relatively small number of late expanding states (see Table 1). We interpret findings from

this analysis cautiously, and encourage readers to do the same, as the findings could be

attributable to unique attributes of the late expanding states rather than Medicaid expansion.

       Results from this analysis are reported in Table 13. The estimated effects suggest that,

post-expansion, quarterly prescription medications increased by 53 per 100,000 non-elderly

adults in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. The 95% confidence intervals for this

point estimate and our main point estimate (Table 3; 89) overlap. We interpret the similarity in

the point estimates to imply that our main findings are largely attributable to the newly eligible.

       In summary, while our data (administrative prescription counts) do not allow us to isolate

those patients who became eligible due to the Medicaid expansions, findings from estimates

generated in different specifications and samples collectively suggests that our estimates are not

fully attributable to groups other than the newly eligible. These methods could be applied in

other data sets that lack detailed income and demographic information.

5.8 States with no change in cessation medication coverage

       The ACA required that all states cover FDA-approved smoking cessation medications.

For states that did not cover these services prior to this Act, continuously enrolled traditional

Medicaid populations in expansion and non-expansion states gained coverage. Thus, our DD

estimates may reflect the combined effects of Medicaid expansion to newly eligible enrollees

and cessation service coverage gains among the continuously enrolled. To isolate newly eligible

effects we estimate Equation (1) excluding states that changed coverage for any of the



                                                 30
medications we examine during our study period using data from Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention (2016). 32

        Results are reported in Table 14. Estimates generated in this sample are very similar to

our main results (Table 3): post expansion, quarterly prescription fills and refills increase by 72

per 100,000 or 28% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. We interpret these

results to suggest that our findings are primarily attributable to increases in enrollment, rather

than improvements in coverage.

5.9 Controlling for between-state heterogeneity

        In our primary specification, we control for between-state heterogeneity through the

inclusion of time-varying state-level variables, states fixed effects, and state-specific linear time

trends. While this specification is standard in policy analyses (Angrist and Pischke 2009), it

does impose assumptions on the nature of between-state heterogeneity. For example, state-

specific linear time trends can account for state-level unobservables that vary in a linear manner

over time but the true trends in such unobservables may not be linear. On the other hand, if there

are no important time-varying state-level variables, including these time trends ‘throws away’

variation that can be used for identification of treatment effects. Further, some of our time-

varying state-level controls may be outcomes of Medicaid expansion, suggesting that our

estimates suffer from over-controlling bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009).

        To explore the robustness of our findings to different specifications, we next estimate

variants of Equation (1) that sequentially exclude state-specific linear time trends, exclude time-

varying state-level controls, and include state-specific quadratic time trends. Results are reported

in Table 15 and are in line with estimates generated in our main specification. Indeed, 95%


32
 Excluded states include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky,
Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia.

                                                      31
confidence intervals of all point estimates in Table 15 include the point estimate generated in our

primary specification (Table 3, 89). Not surprisingly, coefficients are generally smaller in

specifications that offer more control for between-state heterogeneity.

5.10 Alternative coding of ACA-related Medicaid expansion

         We next report the robustness of our results to alternative approaches to coding ACA-

related Medicaid expansion. First, we adopt the coding of early expansion states in Sommers et

al. (2013) and Maclean and Saloner (2017); second we code states with substantial Medicaid

prior to our study period (early expansion states in Table 1) as expanding January 1st, 2014 in the

spirit of Courtemanche et al. (2017b); third we exclude states with substantial Medicaid

expansions prior to our study period from the analysis sample following sensitivity analyses

outlined by Wherry and Miller (2016), and Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017); 33 and fourth we

exclude California as this state has the largest number of Medicaid enrollees (University of

Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016) and we wish to ensure that our findings are

not driven by one specific state. Results are reported in Table 16. While the point estimates do

vary across the various coding schemes, 95% confidence intervals for all specifications include

our primary point estimate (89; Table 3) and we interpret these findings to imply that our results

are not sensitive to the use of different approaches to coding ACA-related Medicaid expansion.

6. Discussion

         In this study we offer new evidence on the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)

Medicaid expansions, specifically we examine the use of prescription medications for smoking

cessation. The ACA-related expansions increased Medicaid enrollment by 27% (Gates et al.


33
  This check excludes Massachusetts, which implemented a large-scale healthcare reform in 2006 that shares
similarities with the ACA (Gruber 2008) and included smoking-cessation medications coverage for Medicaid
enrollees (Land et al. 2010). Thus, we also explore the possibility that our main point estimates are partially driven
by a previous large-scale healthcare reform.

                                                          32
2016), and 38% of this population may smoke (DiGiulio et al. 2016). The expansions were

therefore targeted at a group of adults with a high rate of uninsurance and smoking risk, and

included a generous set of cessation medications. Our findings imply that, post-expansion,

cessation medication fills and refills for which Medicaid was a third-party payer increased 36%

in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, and this change was primarily driven by

increased prescriptions for Zyban. Zyban is the least expensive prescription medication we

study, which suggests that the newly eligible were being treated in a cost-effective manner, as

the medications we study have similar efficacy. We provide evidence that this estimate is

predominately driven by the newly eligible population and not other groups that enrolled in

Medicaid with the broader ACA roll-out, nor improvements in coverage of prescription cessation

products among populations continuously enrolled Medicaid over our study period (2011-2015).

Increased prescriptions were financed by state Medicaid programs and not patients. Dynamic

models suggest that prescriptions increased over time. Finally, and re-assumingly, our estimates

are stable across numerous sensitivity checks.

       We can compare our findings with previous ACA Medicaid studies that examine

smoking. While Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017) provide evidence that ACA Medicaid

expansions reduced smoking by 6% among childless adults, Courtemanche et al. (2017a) find no

evidence that smoking declined post-expansion among childless adults or any other population.

Given that the effect of ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking remains unsettled, our study of

cessation medications is particularly timely and offers new evidence on this question. Cessation

takes time with the average smoker attempting to quit roughly 30 times before obtaining

abstinence (Chaiton et al. 2016). If increased use of prescription medications is a principle

mechanism through which expansions affect smoking, then – prior to changes in smoking – we



                                                 33
would expect to see changes in medications. Given that we document increases in cessation

medication fills and refills that accelerated over time, our findings suggest that we may expect

more definitive evidence that smoking has declined in expansion states as more post-expansion

data becomes available. Thus, our use of prescriptions facilitates better understanding of the

mechanisms related to ACA Medicaid expansions and behavioral response of lower income

smokers with little experience with the healthcare delivery system who seek to quit their

smoking addiction. Finally, regardless of whether or not ACA Medicaid expansions affect

smoking in the short- or long-run, assessing the effects of these expansions on service use is

critical for understanding the overall value of this major policy shift.

       We can also compare our estimates to three recent studies that have explored the effect of

Medicaid expansion on prescription medication claims. Our finding of a 36% increase in

Medicaid-financed smoking cessation medications is in the middle of estimates for the effect of

the Medicaid expansion on prescription medications in general and specific types of prescription

medications related to treatment of behavioral health outcomes. Our finding is larger than an

increase of 19% found for all Medicaid-financed prescriptions (Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers

2017) and an increase of 22% identified for psychotropic medications (Maclean et al. 2017), but

less than a 70% increase found for prescription drugs used to treat opioid use disorders (Wen et

al. 2017). Our estimate is comparable to a 43% increase found for all FDA-approved

medications used to treat alcohol and drug use disorders (Maclean and Saloner 2017).

       Although several studies suggest Medicaid expansions have led to reductions in

uninsurance, increased healthcare access and service use, improved health, and reduced financial

instability (Miller and Wherry 2017, Wherry and Miller 2016, Hu et al. 2016, Simon, Soni, and

Cawley 2017), the future direction of Medicaid is uncertain. Our study suggests that



                                                  34
constraining Medicaid eligibility for the populations that gained access through the ACA-related

expansions may reduce the use of smoking cessation medications. Reducing the use of such

medications may in turn increase the total economic costs of smoking, currently estimated at

$300B annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017).

       In summary, our findings offer new evidence on the early effects of Medicaid expansions

on smokers. In combination with previous analyses that have explored the effects of expansions

on other behavioral health outcomes, Medicaid expansions appear to have been associated with

increased access to evidence-based services to a particularly policy-relevant group: low-income

Americans who suffer from tobacco use, a chronic, addictive, costly, and harmful condition.
