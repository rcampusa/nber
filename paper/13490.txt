                                             ABSTRACT

Using climate change as a prototype motivating example, this paper analyzes the implications of structural
uncertainty for the economics of low-probability high-impact catastrophes. The paper shows that having
an uncertain multiplicative parameter, which scales or amplifies exogenous shocks and is updated
by Bayesian learning, induces a critical "tail fattening" of posterior-predictive distributions. These
fattened tails can have strong implications for situations (like climate change) where a catastrophe
is theoretically possible because prior knowledge cannot place sufficiently narrow bounds on overall
damages. The essence of the problem is the difficulty of learning extreme-impact tail behavior from
finite data alone. At least potentially, the influence on cost-benefit analysis of fat-tailed uncertainty
about the scale of damages -- coupled with a high value of statistical life -- can outweigh the influence
of discounting or anything else.

      can have strong implications for situations (like climate change) where a catastrophe is

1     Introduction
This paper is about the e¤ects of structural uncertainty on the expected utility analysis of
system-wide potential catastrophes. The key unknown structural parameter in this paper is
a critical multiplier that ampli…es (or scales) an uncertain exogenous shock or impulse to the
system. Very roughly –at a high level of abstraction and without trying to push an imperfect

analogy too far – the role of this uncertain multiplicative ampli…er or scale parameter can
be illustrated by the role of uncertain “climate sensitivity”in discussions of global warming.
Let ln CO2 be sustained relative change in concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide
while T is equilibrium temperature response. Climate sensitivity S is an amplifying
or scaling multiplier for converting ln CO2 into T by the (reasonably accurate) linear
approximation T         (S= ln 2)     ln CO2 . The International Panel on Climate Change
in its IPCC4 (2007) Executive Summary states: “The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a
measure of the climate system response to sustained radiative forcing. It is not a projection
but is de…ned as the global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide
concentrations. It is likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5 C with a best estimate of 3 C, and
is very unlikely to be less than 1.5 C. Values substantially higher than 4.5 C cannot be
excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values.” (For
IPCC4, “likely”is P > 66%, while “very unlikely”is P < 10%.)
    In this paper I am mostly concerned with the 17% of those S “values substantially higher
than 4.5 C”which “cannot be excluded.” Eighteen recent studies of climate sensitivity with
18 probability density functions (PDFs) of S lie behind the above-quoted IPCC4 summary
statement. From Figure 1 in Box 10.2 of IPCC4 (2007), it is apparent that the upper tails
of these 18 PDFs tend to be long and fat. For neatness of its graphical display, Box 10.2
arbitrarily truncates all PDFs at 10 C. But tiny positive tail probabilities in many of the
studies stretch well beyond 10 C because the science makes it di¢ cult to constrain absolutely
the high end. The upper 5% probability level averaged over all 18 studies is S=6.2 C, which
I take as approximately meaning that P [S > 6 C]          5%: For the purposes of this paper
I assume P [S > 8 C]       2%, which is roughly consistent with the averaged upper tails in
Box 10.2. Such numbers are exceedingly crude ballpark estimates of what amounts to huge
climate impacts with tiny probabilities, but the subject matter of this paper concerns just
such kind of situations and my example here does not depend on precise numbers.
    Global average warming of 8 C masks tremendous local and seasonal variation, which
can be expected to produce temperature increases much greater than this at particular times
in particular places. Societies and ecosystems in a world whose mean temperature will have
changed in the course of one or two (or even three) centuries by T > 8 C (for U.S. readers:
8 C = 14:4 F) are located in terra incognita, since such high average temperatures have not
existed for at least tens of millions of years. So much global warming so quickly would
be unprecedented perhaps even on a time scale of hundreds of millions of years. There
exist some truly frightening examples of possible consequences of such magnitude of mean
temperature increases: sudden disintegration of the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheets
with dramatic raising of sea level by perhaps …fteen meters or so, shutdowns or even re-


                                              2
versals of the warming component of large-scale oceanic circulation systems like the Gulf
Stream, major disruptions of large-scale weather patterns like monsoons, highly consequen-
tial worldwide changes in regional freshwater availability, ampli…ed-positive-feedback green-
house warming due to heat-induced (i.e., endogenous, and therefore in addition to climate
sensitivity as conventionally de…ned) rapid releases of the immense amounts of greenhouse
gases currently sequestered in arctic permafrost or (more remotely) in the even-much-vaster
deposits of o¤shore methane hydrates – and so forth and so on. It is di¢ cult to imagine
what T > 8 C might mean for life on earth, but such geologically-instantaneous mean
temperature changes are signi…cantly larger than what separates us now from recent past ice
ages and at a minimum would trigger massive species extinctions and monumental ecosystem
changes. Furthermore, stabilizing anthropogenically-injected GHG (greenhouse gas) stocks
at anything like twice pre-industrial-revolution levels looks now like an extraordinarily am-
bitious goal. Given current trends in GHG emissions, we will attain such a doubling within
about 30-40 years and will then go well beyond that amount unless relatively drastic measures
are taken starting soon. Projecting current trends in business-as-usual GHG emissions, a
tripling of GHG concentrations would be attained relative to pre-industrial-revolution levels
within about a century and a steady-state-equilibrium global-mean-temperature response
might in this case involve for the tail something like P [ T > 10 C] 1% (for U.S. readers:
10 C=18 F).
    All of the above horrifying examples of climate-change mega-disasters are incontrovertibly
possible. They were purposely selected to be especially lurid in order to drive home a valid
point. The tiny probabilities of nightmare impacts of climate change are all such crude
ballpark estimates that there is a tendency in the literature to dismiss them on the “scienti…c”
grounds that they are much too highly speculative to be taken seriously because they are
statistically indistinguishable from zero. By contrast with the conventional wisdom of not
taking seriously extreme-temperature-change tiny probabilities because such crude estimates
are highly speculative and statistically insigni…cant, the purpose of this paper is to prove that
the exact opposite logic is in fact true by giving a rigorous sense in which, other things being
equal, the more speculative and fuzzy are the tiny tail probabilities of high-impact extreme
events, the less ignorable and the more serious is the situation for an agent whose welfare is
measured by present discounted expected utility. The seriousness of such situations comes
from combining strict relative risk aversion with a multiplicative factor having e¤ectively
open-ended uncertainty that ampli…es impulses into bad impacts with long fat tails.
    Oversimplifying enormously, how warm the climate ultimately gets is approximately a
product of two factors –the amount of GHG concentrations and a critical climate-sensitivity
scaling multiplier. Both of these factors are uncertain, but the scaling multiplier is much


                                               3
more open-ended on the high side with a much longer upper tail. This critical scale parame-
ter re‡ecting large scienti…c uncertainty is then used as a multiplier for converting aggregated
GHG emissions –an input mostly re‡ecting economic uncertainty –into eventual tempera-
ture changes. The paper will show that a generalization of this form of interaction can be
re-packaged and analyzed as an aggregative macroeconomic model with essentially the same
reduced form (structural uncertainty about some unknown open-ended scale-multiplying pa-
rameter amplifying an uncertain economic input). This form of interaction (coupled with
…nite data, under conditions of relative risk aversion) can have very strong consequences
for cost-bene…t analysis (CBA) when catastrophes are theoretically possible, because it can
easily drive applications of expected utility (EU) theory much more than anything else.
     When fed back into an economic analysis, the great open-ended uncertainty about even-
tual mean planetary temperature change cascades into yet-greater yet-more-open-ended un-
certainty about eventual changes in utility or welfare. Not only is it very di¢ cult to estimate
tail probabilities of high- T outcomes, but translating this via ambiguous local and sea-
sonal weather consequences combined with unknown adaptation capabilities into aggregated
utility-equivalent units for people living a century or two from now introduces enormous
further fuzziness. When such future utility includes the existence values placed by people
at that time on wild species, in situ conservation, natural or historical habitats, and the
availability of outdoor activities more generally, the already-huge welfare uncertainties are
yet further compounded. Even if climate sensitivity were bounded by some big number, the
value of what might be called “welfare sensitivity”is e¤ectively bounded only by some very
big number representing something like the value of statistical civilization as we know it or
maybe even the value of statistical life on earth as we know it.
     Without further belaboring the point, the overall utility e¤ects of global warming that
might accompany a 2% chance of S > 8 C are su¢ ciently open-ended and fuzzy that it seems
fair to say o¤hand there might be a non-negligible probability of a catastrophe. In his book
Catastrophe: Risk and Response,1 Richard A. Posner de…nes the word catastrophe “... to
designate an event that is believed to have a very low probability of materializing but that
if it does materialize will produce a harm so great and sudden as to seem discontinuous with
the ‡ow of events that preceded it.” Posner adds: “The low probability of such disasters –
frequently the unknown probability, as in the case of bioterrorism and abrupt global warming
–is among the things that ba- e e¤orts at responding rationally to them.” In this paper I
address what a rational economic response in the form of expected present discounted utility
theory might o¤er in the way of guidance for thinking coherently about the economics of
  1
   Posner (2004). See also the insightful review by Parson (2007).   Sunstein (2007) covers some similar
themes from a somewhat di¤erent perspective.

highly-uncertain catastrophes with tiny but highly-unknown probabilities.
    As was pointed out, the prime example of an unsure structural parameter that best
illustrates this paper’s thesis is a standard-deviation-like scale parameter whose mode of
interaction parallels the interaction of a climate-sensitivity amplifying multiplier. Suppose
the true value of this generic scaling parameter is unknown because of limited past expe-
rience, a situation that can be modeled as if inferences must be made inductively from a
…nite number of data observations. At a high level of abstraction, each data point might
be interpreted as representing an outcome from a particular scienti…c or economic study.
(Some of the scienti…c studies of climate sensitivity might actually be examples of this be-
cause they rely on noisy temperature responses from past natural experiments of changed
radiative forcings of unsure magnitude.) The paper shows that having an uncertain scale
parameter in such a setup can add a signi…cant tail-fattening e¤ect to posterior-predictive
expectations, even when Bayesian learning takes place with arbitrarily large (but …nite)
amounts of data. Loosely speaking, the driving mechanism is that the operation of tak-
ing “expectations of expectations”or “probability distributions of probability distributions”
spreads apart and fattens the tails of the reduced-form compounded posterior-predictive
probability distribution.    It is inherently di¢ cult to learn extreme bad-tail probabilities
from …nite samples alone because, by de…nition, we don’t get many data-point observations
of such catastrophes. Therefore, rare disasters located in the stretched-out fattened tails of
such posterior-predictive distributions must inherently contain an irreducibly-large compo-
nent of deep structural uncertainty. The underlying sampling-theory principle is that the
rarer is an event, the more unsure is our estimate of its probability of occurrence. In this
spirit (from being constructed out of inductive knowledge), the empirical studies of climate
sensitivity are perhaps preordained to …nd the fat-tailed power-law-like PDFs which they
seem, approximately, to …nd in practice.
    This paper suggests that standard approaches to modeling the economics of climate
change (even those that purport to treat risk by Monte Carlo simulations) very likely fail
to account adequately for the implications of large uncertain impacts with small probabili-
ties. The overarching general message is that from inductive experience alone one cannot
acquire su¢ ciently accurate information about the probabilities of tail disasters to prevent
the expected marginal utility of an extra sure unit of consumption from becoming unbounded
for any utility function having strict relative risk aversion. To close the model by bound-
ing expected marginal utility below +1 (or expected utility above 1), this paper relies
on a concept akin to the “value of statistical life” (VSL) – except that here it represents
something more like the rate of substitution between consumption and the mortality risk
of a catastrophic extinction of the natural world or civilization as we know these concepts.


                                              5
With this particular way of closing the model, subsequent EU-based CBA will then depend
critically upon an exogenously-imposed VSL-like parameter, which is a generalization of the
value of a statistical human life and is presumably very big. Practically, a high VSL-like
parameter means for situations with potentially unlimited downside exposure (like climate
change) that a Monte Carlo simulation must go very deep into the extreme-negative-impact
fat tail to merit credibility as an accurate and fair CBA. In this sense (by forcing there
to be such utter dependence upon a concept like the value of a statistical life), structural
or deep uncertainty is potentially much more of a driving force than discounting or risk for
cost-bene…t applications of EU theory to open-ended situations with potentially unlimited
exposure. For such situations where there do not exist prior limits on damages (like climate
change from greenhouse warming), expected present discounted utility analysis of costs and
bene…ts is likely to be dominated by considerations and concepts related more to catastrophe
insurance than to the consumption-smoothing consequences of long-term discounting at one
or another particular interest rate.


2     A Disturbing Example
Let C be consumption. Consider a representative agent with a standard CRRA (constant
relative risk aversion) utility function of the form

                                                     C1
                                          U (C) =                                                (1)
                                                     1

for C > 0, which implies that
                                          U 0 (C) = C        :                                   (2)

    Technically speaking, the model of this paper requires only that the coe¢ cient of relative
risk aversion is positive. But the main application here involves a situation where the
value of statistical life is extremely large, which, it will turn out, is essentially only consistent
with > 1. Although the condition > 1 can be derived from the model (and later it will
be), analytically it is easier just to assume it in the …rst place.
    For analytical crispness, the model of this paper has only two periods –the present and
the future. Applied to climate change, the future would be one or two centuries hence.
Instead of working directly with C, in this paper it is more convenient to work with (and
think in terms of) ln C. If present consumption is normalized to unity, then the growth of
consumption between the two periods is

                                            Y        ln C;                                       (3)

                                                 6
where in this model Y is a random variable capturing all uncertainty that in‡uences fu-
ture values of ln C. For the purposes of this paper, Y includes not just economic growth
narrowly de…ned, but also the consumption-equivalent damages of adverse climate change.
Actually, this paper is mostly concerned with the extraordinarily-small probability of an
extraordinarily-large negative realization of Y that might accompany extreme climate change.
(Note: here the “bad”tail of Y is its lower tail.)
   The “stochastic discount factor”or “pricing kernel”is an expression of the form

                                                       U 0 (C)
                                     M (C) =                                                (4)
                                                       U 0 (1)

for time-preference parameter (0 <        1). When (2) holds, then from (4) the amount
of present consumption that the agent would be willing to give up in the present period to
obtain one extra sure unit of consumption in the future period is

                                  E[M ] =     E[exp(           Y )];                        (5)

which is a kind of shadow price for discounting future costs and bene…ts in project analysis.
    Throughout this paper I use the price of a future sure unit of consumption as the single
most useful overall indicator of the present cost of future uncertainty. Other like indicators –
such as welfare-equivalent deterministic consumption –give similar results, but the required
analysis in terms of mean-preserving spreads is slightly more elaborate and slightly less
intuitive. Focusing on the behavior of E[M ] is understood in this paper, therefore, as being
a metaphor for understanding what drives the results of cost-bene…t or welfare analysis more
generally in situations of potentially unlimited exposure to catastrophic impacts.
    Using standard notation, let lower-case y denote a realization of the upper-case random
variable Y . If Y has PDF (probability density function) f (y), then the price of future
consumption (5) can be written as

                                             Z1
                                                        y
                                 E[M ] =           e        f (y) dy;                       (6)
                                              1


which means that E[M ] is “essentially”the Laplace transform or moment-generating function
of f (y). This is helpful because the properties of the expected stochastic discount factor are
the same as the properties of the moment-generating function of a probability distribution,
about which a great deal is already understood. For example, if Y      N ( ; s2 ) then plugging
the usual formula for the expectation of a lognormal random variable into (6) gives the

familiar expression
                                                                     1   2 2
                                   E[M ] = exp                   +       s     ;                              (7)
                                                                     2
where = ln is the instantaneous rate of pure time preference. Expression (7) shows
up in innumerable asset-pricing Euler-equation applications as the expected value of the
stochastic discount factor or pricing kernel when consumption is lognormally distributed.
Equation (7) is also the basis of the well-known generalized-Ramsey formula for the riskfree
interest rate
                                                     1 2 2
                                    rf = +                s;                                 (8)
                                                     2
which (in its deterministic form, for the special case s = 0) plays a key role in recent debates
about what social interest rate to use for intergenerational cost-bene…t discounting of policies
to mitigate GHG emissions. This intergenerational-discounting debate has mainly revolved
around choosing “ethical” values of the rate of pure time preference , but this paper will
demonstrate that, for any >0, the e¤ect of in formula (8) is theoretically overshadowed
by the e¤ect of an uncertain scaling parameter s.
    Although not phrased in this way, the existing literature already contains an example
that can be interpreted as showing a sense in which EU-maximizing agents are signi…cantly
more averse to structural “uncertainty” (meaning here a situation where the structure of
the data generating process is unknown and must be estimated statistically) than they are
to pure “risk” (the structure of the data generating process is known, but future stochastic
realizations are unknown –as in (8) where Y       N ( ; s2 ) with both parameters known). The
example used here to convey this basic idea is a relatively simple speci…cation consisting
of the workhorse isoelastic or CRRA utility function (1) along with familiar probability
distributions: lognormal, Student-t, gamma.2 One may then ask whether the insight that
structural “uncertainty”has potentially more impact on EU analysis than pure “risk”is due
here to the particular quirks of this relatively simple example or, alternatively, it represents
a generic insight of broader scope. The answer, given in the next section, is that the result
is generic (or at least much broader than the example). The relatively simple formulation of
this section will then help to motivate the subsequent development of a more general theory
of catastrophic change involving structural uncertainty about the true value of the relevant
   2
     An example with these particular functional forms leading to existence problems from inde…nite expected-
utility integrals blowing up was …rst articulated by Geweke (2001). It subsequently was independently
rediscovered in a context of discounting by Weitzman (2007a), who further developed its meaning and
implications for asset pricing in a nonstationary setting. Even earlier, in a very di¤erent context, Schwarz
(1999) introduced a similar point to the main theme of this paper (and a generalization of Geweke’s example)
involving tail-thickening of posterior-predictive distributions into power-law tails under general conditions.
Mathematically, this entire set of issues is closely related to the classical generalizations of the central limit
theorem by Gnedenko and Kolmogorov (1949) to cover random variables having heavy-tailed distributions.

    Throughout this paper, the structural scale parameter controlling the tail spread of a
probability distribution is the most critical unknown. For convenience in the super-simple
example of this section, it is assumed that Y         N ( ; s2 ) where the mean is known but
the scale parameter s is unknown. In an extremely loose sense this unknown structural
scale parameter is a highly-stylized abstraction of the e¤ect that is embodied in an uncertain
climate-sensitivity amplifying multiplier, which was discussed previously in the introduction.
With this rough analogy in this super-simple example, Y $ A B T , where A and B are
positive constants.
    The structural uncertainty concerning s is modeled here as if this scale parameter is
a subjectively-distributed random variable (denoted S) whose PDF must be inferred by
inductive reasoning from n observed data points. At a very high level of abstraction, these
data points might be interpreted as outcomes from various economic-scienti…c studies very
roughly akin to the eighteen climate-sensitivity studies discussed in the introduction. Let
y = (y1 ; :::; yn ) be a sample of n i.i.d. random draws from the data-generating process of the
normal distribution whose PDF is

                                            1            (y         )2
                             h(y j s) = p       exp                      :                  (9)
                                            2 s               2s2

The sample variance is
                                             1X
                                                n

                                      n            (yj    )2                               (10)
                                             n j=1

and the likelihood function for the random variable S here is

                                              1          n n
                                 L(s; y) _       exp         :                             (11)
                                              sn         2s2

    In a Bayesian framework, deriving the agent’s posterior distribution of S requires that
some prior distribution be imposed on S.       The choice of a “noninformative” prior in the
most general case represents a thorny issue within Bayesian statistics. However, for the
particular case of a one-dimensional scale parameter, which is the case here, practically all
de…nitions of a “noninformative”prior give the same PDF. This traditional reference prior
forms the Bayesian mirror image of classical linear-normal regression analysis. This prior
(called Je¤reys prior, which is explained in any textbook on Bayesian statistics) is a di¤use
or uniform distribution of ln S on (0; 1), meaning that the (improper) prior PDF expressed
in terms of s is
                                                   1
                                         p0 (s) _ :                                      (12)

   The “precision,” , is commonly de…ned to be the reciprocal of the variance, so that

                                                         :                                (13)

    The posterior probability density is proportional to the product of the prior p0 (s) times
the likelihood L(s; y). When the change of variables (13) is plugged into the product of
(12) times (11), the posterior becomes conveniently expressed in terms of by the gamma
distribution

   After integrating out the precision from the conditional-normal distribution (9), the un-
conditional or marginal posterior-predictive PDF of the growth rate Y is

                         f (y) _          exp(        (y             )2 =2) ( ) d :       (19)
                                   0


   Straightforward brute-force integration of (19) (for (14), (15), (16)) shows that f (y) is
the Student-t distribution with n degrees of freedom:

                                                                      (n+1)=2
                                              (y             )2
                              f (y) _      1+                                   :         (20)
                                                n       n


(Any Bayesian textbook shows that a normal with gamma precision becomes a Student-t).
Note that, asymptotically, the limiting tail behavior of (20) is a fat-tailed power-law PDF

                                                 10
whose exponent is n + 1. In the next section of the paper, this same kind of power-law-tail
result will be shown to hold much more generally than the particular example of this section.
   When the posterior-predictive distribution of Y is (20) (from s being unknown), then (6)
becomes
                                      E[M ] = +1;                                        (21)

because the moment-generating function of a Student-t distribution is in…nite. What ac-
counts technically for the economically-stunning counterintuitiveness of the …nding (21) is
a form of pointwise but nonuniform convergence. When n ! 1 in (20), f (y) becomes
the familiar normal form exp( (y         )2 =2 21 ), which then, as y ! 1, approaches zero
faster than exp( y) approaches in…nity, thereby leading to the well-known …nite formula
(7) for E[M ]. Given any …xed n, on the other hand, as y ! 1 expression (20) tends to
zero only as fast as the power-law polynomial ( y) n 1 , so that now in formula (6) it is the
exponential term exp( y) that dominates asymptotically, thereby causing E[M ] ! +1.
    Something quite extraordinary seems to be happening here, which is crying out for further
elucidation! Thousands of applications of EU theory in thousands of articles and books are
based on formulas like (7) or (8). Yet when it is acknowledged that s is unknown (with a
standard noninformative reference prior) and its value in formula (7) or (8) must instead be
inferred as if from a data sample that can be arbitrarily large (but …nite), expected marginal
utility explodes in (21). The question then naturally arises: what is EU theory trying to
tell us when its conclusions for a host of important applications –in CBA, asset pricing, and
many other …elds of economics –seem so sensitive merely to the recognition that conditioned
on …nite realized data the distribution implied by the normal is the Student-t?
    I want to emphasize as emphatically as I can at this relatively early stage of the paper
that the problem (both here and throughout the rest of the paper) is not a mathematically
illegitimate use of the symbol 1 in formula (21), which incorrectly seems to o¤er an easy
way out of the dilemma that E[M ] ! +1 by somehow discrediting this application of EU
theory on the narrow grounds that in…nities are not allowed in a legitimate theory of choice
under uncertainty. It is easy to put arbitrary bounds on utility functions, or to truncate
probability distributions arbitrarily, or to introduce ad hoc priors that arbitrarily cut o¤ or
otherwise severely dampen high values of S or low values of C. Introducing any of these
changes formally closes the model in the sense of replacing the symbol 1 by an arbitrarily-
large but …nite number. Indeed, the model of this paper will be closed later in just such a
fashion by placing a lower bound on consumption of the form C D, where the lower bound
D( ) > 0 is de…ned indirectly by a “value of statistical life”parameter . However, removing
the in…nity symbol in this or any other way does not eliminate (or even marginalize) the
underlying problem because it then comes back to haunt in the form of an arbitrarily large

                                              11
expected stochastic discount factor, whose exact value depends hypersensitively upon obscure
bounds, truncations, severely-dampened or cut-o¤ prior PDFs, or whatever other tricks have
been used to banish the 1 symbol. One can easily remove the 1 in formula (21), but one
cannot so easily remove the underlying economic problem that expected stochastic discount
factors – which lie at the heart of cost-bene…t, asset-pricing, and many other important
applications of EU theory – can become arbitrarily large just by making what seem like
unobjectionable statistical inferences about limiting tail behavior. The take-away message
here is that reasonable attempts to constrict the length or the fatness of the “bad”tail (or to
modify the utility function) still can leave us with uncomfortably big numbers whose exact
value depends non-robustly upon arti…cial constraints or parameter settings that we really
do not understand.
    What is happening in this example is a particular instance of a general idea. To repeat:
the core underlying problem is the di¢ culty of learning limiting tail behavior inductively from
…nite data. Seemingly thin-tailed probability distributions (like here the normal), which are
actually only thin-tailed conditional on known structural parameters of the model, become
tail-fattened (like here the Student-t) after integrating out the uncertainty. This core issue
cannot be eliminated in any clean way, and of necessity it must in‡uence any utility function
that is sensitive to low values of consumption. Utility isoelasticity per se is inessential
to the reasoning here (although it makes the argument easier to understand), because the
expected stochastic discount factor E[M ] is +1 in this setup for any relatively-risk-averse
utility function satisfying the curvature requirement: inf [ CU 00 (C)=U 0 (C)] > 0.
                                                        C>0
    The Student-t “child” posterior-predictive density from a large number of observations
looks almost exactly like its bell-shaped normal “parent” except that the probabilities are
somewhat more stretched out, making the tails appear relatively fatter at the expense of
a slightly-‡atter center. Intuitively, a normal density “becomes” a Student-t from a tail-
fattening spreading-apart of probabilities caused by the variance of the normal having itself
a (inverted gamma) probability distribution. It is then no surprise from EU theory that
people are more averse qualitatively to a relatively fat-tailed Student-t posterior-predictive
child distribution than they are to the relatively thin-tailed normal parent which begets it.
A perhaps more surprising consequence of EU theory is the quantitative strength of this
endogenously-derived aversion to the e¤ects of unknown tail-structure. The story behind
this quantitative strength is that fattened-posterior bad tails represent structural or deep
uncertainty about the possibility of rare high-impact disasters that –using colorful language
here –“scare”any agent having a utility function with strictly positive relative risk aversion.
One obvious technical way for the model to contain this scary “Student-t explosion” (or,
more generally, “power-law-tail explosion”) is to exclude it a priori by imposing some kind


                                              12
or another of an absolute lower bound D > 0 on allowed values of C D.
    The next issue to be investigated is the extent to which this particular example gener-
alizes. It turns out that there is a rigorous sense in which this scary fattened-posterior-tail
e¤ect holds for (essentially) any probability distribution characterized by having an uncer-
tain scale parameter. When indeterminateness is compounded by probability distributions
themselves having probability distributions, then posterior-predictive tails must inevitably
become fattened, with potentially strong consequences for some important applications of
EU theory –including the economic analysis of climate change.


3     The General Model
In order to focus sharply on structural parameter uncertainty, the model of this section is
patterned closely as a generalization of last section’s example and is deliberately sparse.
To create families of probability distributions that are simultaneously fairly general and
analytically tractable, the following generating mechanism is employed. Suppose Z repre-
sents a random variable normalized to have mean zero and variance one. Let (z) be any
piecewise-continuous PDF with
                                       Z1
                                          z (z) dz = 0                                 (22)
                                        1

and with
                                       Z1
                                            z 2 (z) dz = 1:                               (23)
                                        1

   It should be noted that the PDF (z) is allowed to be extremely general. For example,
the distribution of Z might have …nite support (like the uniform distribution, which signi…es
that unbounded catastrophes will be absolutely excluded conditional on the value of the
…nite lower support being known), or it might have unbounded range (like the normal,
which allows unbounded catastrophes to occur but assigns them a thin bad tail conditional
on the variance being known). The only restrictions placed on (z) are the extremely
weak regularity or technical conditions that (0) > 0 with (z) being continuous in an open
neighborhood of z = 0, and that

                                 Z1
                                      exp(     z) (z) dz < 1                              (24)
                                  1


for all   > 0, which is automatically satis…ed if Z has …nite lower support.

   With s > 0 given, make the change of random variable of the linear form y = sz + ,
which implies that the conditional PDF of y is

                                                         1


and
                                               Z1
                         s2 = V [Y j s] =           (y           )2 h(y j s) dy:          (27)
                                               1

    For this paper, what matters most is structural uncertainty about the scale parameter
controlling the tail spread of a probability distribution, which is the most critical unknown
in this setup. This scale parameter s may be conceptualized extremely loosely as a highly-
stylized abstract generalization of a climate-sensitivity amplifying or scaling multiplier. (In
this crude analogy, Z $ ln CO2 = ln 2, SZ $ T , Y $ A B T .) Without signi…cant
loss of generality, it is assumed for ease of exposition that in (25) the mean is known, while
the standard-deviation scale parameter s is unknown. The case where and s are both
unknown involves more intricate notation but otherwise gives essentially identical results.
    The point of departure here is that the conditional PDF of growth rates h(y j s) given
by (25) is known to the agent and, while the true value of s is unknown, the situation is as
if some …nite number of i.i.d. observations are available on which to base an estimate of s
by some process of inductive reasoning. Suppose that the agent has observed the random
sample y = (y1 ; :::; yn ) of growth-rate data realizations from n independent draws of the
distribution h(y j s) de…ned by (25) for some unknown …xed value of s. An example relevant
to this paper is where the sample space represents the outcomes of various economic-scienti…c
studies and the data y = (y1 ; :::; yn ) are interpreted at a very high level of abstraction as
the …ndings of n such studies, so that n here is then a measure of the degree of inductive
knowledge of the situation.
    From (25) the relevant likelihood function of s is

                                                Y

                                                j=1




                                               14
    The prior PDF of S is taken to be a generalization of (12) of the form

                                         p0 (s) _ s        k
                                                                                            (29)

for any number k. As k can be chosen to be arbitrarily large, the non-dogmatic prior
distribution (29) can be made to place arbitrarily small prior probability weight on big values
of s. It should be appreciated that any invariant prior must be of the form (29). Invariance
(discussed in the Bayesian-statistical literature) is considered desirable as a description of a
“noninformative” reference prior that favors no particular value of the scaling parameter s
over any other. For such a noninformative reference prior, it seems reasonable to impose a
condition of scale invariance that might be justi…ed by the following kind of reasoning. If
the action taken in a decision problem should not depend upon the unit of measurement,
then a plausible principle of scale-parameter invariance might ask of a complete-ignorance
prior that
                                       p0 (s) _ p0 ( s);                                    (30)

and the only way that (30) can then hold for all > 0 and all s > 0 is when the (necessarily
improper) PDF is of the form (29).
   The posterior probability density pn (s jy) is proportional to the product of the prior p0 (s)
from (29) multiplied by the likelihood L(s; y) from (28), which here yields

                                                    Y

4     The Key Role of a “VSL-like Parameter”
To jump ahead of the story just a bit, the general model of Section 3 has essentially the same
unsettling property as the disturbing example of Section 2 –namely that E[M ] is unbounded.


                                               15
Technically, for the analysis to proceed further some mathematical mechanism is required to
close the model by bounding E[M ] . A variety of bounding mechanisms are possible, with
the broad general conclusions of the model not being tied to any one particular mechanism.
In this paper I close the model by placing an ad hoc positive lower bound on consumption,
which is denoted D (for “death”). This lower bound D is not completely arbitrary, however,
because it can be related conceptually to a kind of “value of statistical life”(VSL) parameter.
This has the advantage of tying conclusions to a familiar economic concept whose ballpark
estimates can at least convey some very crude quantitative implications for the economics of
climate change. In this empirical sense the glass is half full. However, the glass is half empty
in the empirical sense that an accurate CBA of climate change can end up being distressingly
dependent on some very large VSL-like coe¢ cient about whose size we are highly unsure.
    The critical coe¢ cient that is behind the lower bound on consumption is called the VSL-
like parameter and is denoted . This “VSL-like parameter” is intended to be akin to the
already-somewhat-vague concept of the value of a human statistical life, only in the context
here it represents the yet-far-fuzzier concept of something more like the value of statistical
life on earth as we know it, or perhaps the value of statistical civilization as we know it.
In this paper I am going to take to be some very big number that indirectly controls the
convergence of the integral de…ning E[M ] by implicitly generating a lower bound D( )>0
on consumption. An empirical …rst approximation of (normalized per capita) might be
given by conventional estimates of the value of a statistical human life, which may be too
small for the purposes at hand but will at least give some crude empirical idea of what is
implied numerically.
    The parameter that is being used here to truncate the extent of catastrophic damages
is akin to the “fear of ruin” coe¢ cient introduced by Aumann and Kurz (1977) to charac-
terize an individual’s “attitude toward risking his fortune” in binary lotteries. Foncel and
Treich (2005) later analyzed this fear-of-ruin coe¢ cient and showed that it is the same thing
analytically as VSL. The particular utility function I use here is essentially identical (but
with a di¤erent purpose in a di¤erent context) to a speci…cation used recently by Hall and
Jones (2007), which, it was argued by them, explains broadly an array of stylized facts about
health spending while being roughly consistent with empirical VSL estimates.
    The basic idea in terms of an application to my model here is that a society trading
o¤ a decreased probability of its own catastrophic demise against the cost of lowering the
probability of that catastrophe is facing a decision problem conceptually analogous to how
people might make private trade-o¤s between decreased consumption as against a lower
probability of their own personally-catastrophic end – which they do all the time. In this
spirit, suppose for the sake of developing the argument that the analysis is allowed to proceed


                                              16
as if the treatment of the most catastrophic conceivable impact of climate change is very
roughly analogous to the simplest possible economic model of the behavior of an individual
who is trading o¤ increased consumption against a slightly increased probability of death.
    Suppose D is some disastrously low value of consumption, conceptualized as representing
some kind of an analogue of a starvation level, below which level the individual dies. Let
the utility associated with death be normalized at zero. The utility function U (C; D) is
chosen to be of the analytically convenient form

                                                 C1          D1
                                  U (C; D) =                                            (34)
                                                      1

for C > D, and
                                         U (C; D) = 0                                   (35)

for 0 C D.
    Without loss of generality, current consumption is normalized as it was before at C = 1.
For simplicity, suppose the agent begins with something close to a zero probability of death
in the current period. Let A(q) be the amount of extra consumption the individual requires
to exactly compensate for P [C D] = q. In free translation, q is the probability of death.
From EU theory, A(q) satis…es the equation

                            (1     q) U (1 + A(q); D) = U (1; D):                       (36)

   Di¤erentiating (36) with respect to q and evaluating at q=0 gives

                                  U (1; D) + U 0 (1; D)A0 (0) = 0:                      (37)

   The “value of statistical life” (or, in the terminology here, the “VSL-like parameter”) is
de…ned as the rate of substitution between consumption and mortality risk, here being

                                                 A0 (0):                                (38)



    Equations (37), (38) can be inverted to give the implied lower bound on consumption D
as an implicit function of the VSL-like parameter . Proceeding this way for the isoelastic
utility function (1) yields, after manipulation, the equation

                                                             1=(   1)
                                 D( ) = [1 + (        1) ]              :               (39)



                                               17
   In this paper I am interested in analyzing what happens for very large values of . In
order for equation (39) to make sense in such situations by ensuring D( ) > 0 requires here
that
                                    1+(       1) > 0;                                  (40)

which can “essentially” (up to limiting measure zero) hold for arbitrarily large values of
only if
                                           > 1:                                         (41)

In other words, for what it is worth the theory here is telling us that the large empirical
values of statistical life (relative to consumption), which seem to characterize our world, are
“essentially”compatible only with the strict relative risk aversion implied by (41).
    Very rough ballpark estimates of the per-capita value of a statistical human life might
be of the order of magnitude of a hundred times per-capita consumption.3 From a wide
variety of empirical studies in disparate contexts, a plausible value of the coe¢ cient of relative
risk aversion might be two.4 For =2, the value              100 plugged into formula (39) gives
D(100)      :01. An interpretation of as a parameter representing the per-capita value
of statistical civilization or the value of statistical life on earth (as we currently know or
understand these concepts) may very well involve higher values of than 100 and lower
values of D than :01. In any event, I note here for further reference that a Monte Carlo
simulation assessing the EU impacts of losing up to 99% of consumption in the far-distant
dark reaches of a bad fat tail is very di¤erent from any simulations now being done with any
existing empirical model or study of the economics of climate change.
    Let E[M j ] represent the expected value of the stochastic discount factor for M (C)
given by formula (4) when C > D( ) and for M (C)=0 when 0                 C     D( ). The next
section explores what happens to E[M j ] for extremely large values of .


5       The Dismal Theorem
The following “Dismal Theorem” (hereafter sometimes abbreviated as “DT”) shows that
E[M ] ! +1 under quite general circumstances when there is structural uncertainty con-
cerning the unknown scaling parameter s –and when might be very big.
    3
     For this particular application of using a VSL-like parameter to analyze the extent of the worst imaginable
climate-change catastrophe, I think that the most one might hope for is accuracy to within about an order
of magnitude –anything more being false precision. Even the empirical estimates for the value of a much-
better-de…ned statistical human life have a disturbingly wide range, but         100 is roughly consistent with
the meta-analysis in Bellavance, Dione, and Lebeau (2007) or the survey of Viscusi and Aldi (2003).
   4
     This is the point estimate selected by Hall and Jones (2007) in a conceptually-similar model and defended
by them with references to a wide range of studies on page 61.

implying that expression (44) also approaches +1 as ! 1, which concludes this basic
sketch of a proof.
    The underlying logic behind the strong result of Theorem 1 is described by the limiting
behavior of (45) for large values of s. Given any values of n and k, the probability of a
disaster declines polynomially in the scale s of the disaster from (45), while the marginal-
utility impact of a disaster increases exponentially in the scale s of the disaster. It is intuitive,
and can readily be proved, that the tail of the random variable Y essentially behaves like
the tail of the random variable S. Therefore, irrespective of the original parent distribution,
the e¤ect of an uncertain scale parameter fattens the tail of the posterior-predictive child
distribution so that it behaves asymptotically like a power-law distribution whose power
coe¢ cient from (45) is n+k. In this sense, power-law tails need not be postulated, because
they are essentially unavoidable in posterior-predictive distributions. No matter the number
of observations, the race to the bottom of the bad tail between a polynomially-contracting
power-law probability times an exponentially-expanding marginal utility impact is won in
the limit every time by the marginal utility impact, so long as there is positive relative risk

aversion.5
    In the model of this paper, people are averse to two types of indeterminacy –what might
be called the “risk” of not knowing y given s, and what might be called the “uncertainty”
of not knowing s. The Dismal Theorem can be interpreted as providing a rigorous sense
in which aversion to structural or deep “uncertainty” (in the form of not knowing the scale
parameter s) is potentially far greater than aversion to the pure “risk” of not knowing the
realized value of the growth-rate random variable y (but when s is known). However, it is
also true that the interpretation and application of Theorem 1 is sensitive to a subtle but
important behind-the-scene tug of war between pointwise-but-nonuniform limiting behavior
in and pointwise-but-nonuniform limiting behavior in n.
    To see more clearly how the issue of “risk” vs. “uncertainty” plays out in determining
E[M ] under pointwise-but-nonuniform convergence, suppose that, unbeknownst to the agent,
the true value of s is s . Since the prior p0 (s) de…ned by (29) assigns positive probability
to an open interval around s , the imposed speci…cation has su¢ cient regularity for large-
sample likelihood dominance to cause strong (i.e., almost sure) convergence of the posterior
distribution (31) of S to its true data-generating value s = s . This in turn means that
the posterior-predictive distribution of growth rates (32) converges strongly to its true data-
generating distribution h(y j s ) and E[M ] converges strongly to its true value:

                                                          Z1
                                                                   y   1   y

                                                            1


    Condition (46) signi…es that for any given < 1 (which via (39) puts a positive lower
bound D( ) on C, and thereby a …nite upper bound on M ), in the limit as full structural
knowledge is approached (because n ! 1) pure “risk” is more important than structural
“uncertainty.” What is happening here is that as the strength of inductive knowledge n
is increasing in the form of more and more data observations piling up, it is becoming in-
creasingly apparent that the probability of C being anywhere remotely as low as D( ) is
ignorable –even after taking into account the possible EU impacts of disastrously-low utili-
ties. A conventional pure-risk-like application of thin-tail EU theory essentially corresponds
to a situation where there is enough inductive-plus-prior knowledge to identify the relevant
structure because n+k is reasonably large relative to the VSL-like parameter –and relative
   5
    As stated here, DT depends upon a prior of the polynomial form (29), but this is not much of a
limitation because k can be any number. To undo the in…nite limit in (42) requires a prior that approaches
zero faster than any polynomial in 1=s (as s ! 1). In this case the limit in (42) is a …nite number, but its
(potentially arbitrarily large) value will depend critically upon the strong a priori knowledge embodied in
the presumed-known parameters of such a prior –and the prior-sensitivity message that such a formulation
ends up delivering is very similar to the message delivered by the model of this paper.

to the much-less-controversial parameters and .
    Concerning the conventional parameters and , we have at least some very rough idea
of what kinds of numbers might be empirically relevant. (For example, reasonable point
estimates might involve values of consistent with          99% per year and consistent with
   2.) In complete contrast, any discussion about climate change concerning the empirically-
relevant value of the nonconventional VSL-like parameter (relative to n+k) belongs to a
much more abstract realm of discourse. It is therefore understandable to want climate-
change CBA to be restricted to dealing with worst-conceivable damages of, say for example,
  25% of consumption (equivalent to picking D 3=4) –with anything worse than this being
disregarded (as being “too speculative”or “not based on hard science”) by chopping o¤ the
rest of the bad tail, discarding it, and then forgetting about it. This is actually the de facto
strategy employed by most of those relatively few existing CBAs of climate change that even
bother to concern themselves at all with uncertainty regarding high-impact damages. Alas,
to be con…dent in the validity of such a cuto¤ strategy in a situation where we are grossly
unsure about or D (relative to n+k) e¤ectively requires uniform convergence of E[M ] for
all (conceivable) values of or D. Otherwise, for any given level of inductive-plus-prior
knowledge n+k, a skeptical critic could always come back and ask how robust is the CBA
to the highly-unsure truncation value of D( ). Similar robustness questions apply to any a
priori presumption or imposition of thin-tailed PDFs.
    In the spirit of the above discussion, it is critical here to note that with (46) the a.s.
convergence of E[M j ] to its true value is pointwise but not uniform in n. No matter how
much data-evidence n exists –or even can be imagined to exist –DT says that E[M j ] is
always exceedingly sensitive to very large values of . In this sense, structural “uncertainty”
always has the potential to trump pure “risk”for situations of potentially-unlimited downside
exposure when no plausible bound D( )>0 can con…dently be imposed by prior knowledge.
Here “risk” means that the data generating process is known exactly (only the outcome
is random), while “uncertainty” means that (as well as the outcome being random) the
parameters of the data generating process are unknown and must be estimated statistically.
    This paper has stressed repeatedly the basic theme that no …nite sample can accurately
assess relative probabilities or magnitudes of the most extreme disasters lurking in the dark-
distant tails of distributions. The dominant statistical-economic truth behind DT is that
the expected utility of a Bayesian agent with strict relative risk aversion may be driven
to an arbitrarily large extent by this seemingly unavoidable limitation of learning-inference
unless potential exposure is somehow limited by prior information. The Dismal Theorem
can therefore be interpreted as implying a spirit in which it may be unnecessary to append
to the theory of decision making under uncertainty an ad hoc extra postulate of “ambiguity


                                              21
aversion.” At least for situations where there is fundamental uncertainty about catastrophes
coexisting with a fear of ruin, EU theory itself already tells us precisely how the “ambiguity”
of structural-parameter uncertainty can be especially important and why people may be
much more averse to it than to pure objective-frequency “risk.”
     The Dismal Theorem has both a general point and a particular application to the eco-
nomics of climate change.         The general point is that Theorem 1 embodies a very strong
form of a “generalized precautionary principle” for situations of potentially unlimited ex-
posure. From experience alone one cannot acquire su¢ ciently accurate information about
the probabilities of disasters in the bad tail to make the expected marginal utility of an
extra sure unit of consumption become independent of the VSL-like parameter – thereby
potentially allowing this VSL-like-parameter aspect to dominate cost-bene…t applications of
EU theory. To drive home the main theme of this paper yet again, the underlying general
problem that DT is illustrating concerns a fundamental limitation on the ability of empirical
learning or inductive knowledge to shed light on extreme events. Even in a stationary world,
it is not possible to learn enough about the frequency of tail events from …nite samples alone
to make expected stochastic discount factors be independent of arti…cially-imposed bounds
on the extent of possibly-ruinous disasters.
     The part of the distribution of possible outcomes that can most readily be learned (from
inductive information that comes in a form as if conveyed by data) concerns the relatively-
more-likely outcomes in the body of the distribution. From previous experience, past ob-
servations, plausible interpolations or extrapolations, and perhaps even the law of large
numbers, there may be at least some modicum of con…dence in being able to construct a
reasonable picture of the middle regions of the PDF. As we move towards probabilities in
the periphery of the distribution, however, we are increasingly moving into the unknown
territory of subjective uncertainty where our probability estimate of the probability distrib-
utions themselves becomes increasingly di¤use because the frequencies of rare events in the
tails cannot be pinned down by previous experiences or past observations. Climate change
generally and climate sensitivity speci…cally are prototype examples of this general principle,
because we are trying to extrapolate inductive knowledge far outside the range of limited
past experience from natural forcing experiments. Since the unknown scale parameter S
(whose uncertainty drives the economic analysis) is an abstract generalized version of an
amplifying multiplier whose role is very crudely analogous to the role of open-ended climate
sensitivity, it is then perhaps no accident or surprise that the empirical PDF of climate sen-
sitivity (which is, after all, based on inductive information from data and studies) seemingly
has a thick power-law-type tail.

    The degree to which the kind of “generalized precautionary principle” embodied in the
Dismal Theorem is relevant for a particular application must be decided on a case-by-case
“rule of reason” basis. It depends generally upon the extent to which prior -knowledge
(and prior k-knowledge) combine with inductive-posterior n-knowledge in a particular case
to fatten or to thin the bad tail. In the particular application to the economics of climate
change, with so obviously limited data and limited experience about the catastrophic reach
of climate extremes, to ignore or suppress the signi…cance of rare tail disasters is to ignore
or suppress what economic-statistical decision theory is telling us here loudly and clearly is
potentially the most important part of the analysis.
    Global climate change unfolds over a time scale of centuries and, through the power of
compound interest, a standard CBA of what to do now to mitigate GHGs is hugely sensitive
to the discount rate that is postulated. This has produced some sharp disagreements among
economists about what is an “ethical” value of the rate of pure time preference (and the
CRRA coe¢ cient ) to use for intergenerational discounting in the deterministic version
(s = 0) of the Ramsey equation (8) that forms the analytical backbone for most studies of
the economics of climate change.6 For the model of this paper, which is based on structural
uncertainty, arguments about what values of to use in equation (7) or (8) translate into
arguments about what values of to use in the model’s structural-uncertainty generalization
of the Ramsey equation, which is the expectation formula (33). (A zero rate of pure time
preference = 0 in (8) corresponds to = 1 in (33).) In this connection, Theorem 1 seems
to be saying that no matter what values of or are selected, so long as > 0 and > 0
(equivalent to < 1), any big- CBA of GHG-mitigation policy should be presumed (until
shown otherwise empirically) to be a¤ected by deep structural uncertainty.
    Expected utility theory is telling us here analytically that the debate about discounting
may be secondary to a debate about the open-ended catastrophic reach of climate disasters.
While it is always fair game to challenge the assumptions of a model, when theory provides
a generic result (like “free trade is Pareto optimal” or “steady growth eventually outstrips
one-time change”) the burden of proof is commonly taken as residing with whoever wants to
over-rule the theorem in a particular application. The take-away message here is that the
burden of proof in the economics of climate change is presumptively upon whoever wants to
model or conceptualize the expected present discounted utility of feasible trajectories under
   6
     While this contentious intergenerational-discounting issue has long existed (see, e.g., the various essays
in Portney and Weyant (1999)), it has been elevated to recent prominence by publication of the controversial
Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change (2007). The Review argues for a base case of preference-
parameter values      0 and       1, on which its strong conclusions depend analytically. Alternative views
of intergenerational discounting are provided in, e.g., Dasgupta (2007), Nordhaus (2007), and Weitzman
(2007b). The last of these also contains a heuristic exposition of the contents of this paper, as well as giving
Stern some credit for emphasizing the great uncertainties associated with climate change.

greenhouse warming without considering that structural uncertainty might matter more than
discounting or pure risk per se. Such a body-of-the-distribution modeler should be prepared
to explain why the fattened bad tail of the posterior-predictive distribution is not empirically
relevant and does not play a signi…cant role in the analysis.


6    Concluding Discussion
A common reaction to the conundrum for CBA implied by the Dismal Theorem is to acknowl-
edge its mathematical logic but to wonder how it is to be used constructively for deciding
what to do in practice. After all, horror stories about theoretically-possible speculative
disasters can be told for many situations without this aspect necessarily paralyzing decision-
making (or freezing the status quo by e¤ectively blocking all progress whenever there exists
a theoretical possibility of severe downside risks).
    The Dismal Theorem says that in the limit as the VSL-like parameter becomes very
large, agents will pay virtually any price to eliminate deep uncertainty –a vexing idea that
is di¢ cult to wrap one’s mind around. Is this an incompleteness result showing that the
familiar ordinary form of CBA based on EU theory with known thin tails is somehow nulli…ed
by a severe restriction on what inductive information can teach us about basic structural
uncertainty? Phrased di¤erently, is DT an economics version of an impossibility theorem
which signi…es that there are fat-tailed situations where economic analysis is up against a
strong constraint on the ability of any quantitative analysis to inform us without committing
to a VSL-like parameter and an empirical CBA framework that is based on some explicit
numerical estimates of the miniscule probabilities of all levels of catastrophic impacts up
to absolute disaster?         And if ordinary thin-tailed CBA is thereby constrained, then
what are we supposed to use in its place? Even if it were true that DT represents a valid
economic-statistical precautionary principle which, at least theoretically, might dominate
decision making, would not putting into practice this “generalized precautionary principle”
freeze all progress if taken too literally? (Should we have foregone the industrial revolution
because of the GHGs it generated?) With such a severe barrier to what we are able to say
in a situation of deep structural uncertainty (when it is combined with practically unlimited
potential for downside exposure), what should we do when some kind of a policy response
to a complex chaos-prone dynamic system like climate change is required?
    I simply do not know the full answers to the above wide range of legitimate questions
that DT raises. I don’t think anyone does. But I also don’t think that such questions can
be de‡ected aside in good conscience. When uncertainty is considered at all in climate
change, the arti…cial practice of using thin-tailed PDFs –especially the widespread practice

                                              24
of imposing de mimimis low-probability-threshold cuto¤s that casually dictate what part
of the high-impact bad tail is to be truncated and discarded from CBA – seems (to me)
arbitrary and problematic.7
    Any interpretation or application of the Dismal Theorem is rendered exceedingly tricky
by the unusual (for economics) nonuniform convergence of E[M ] or E[U ] in all of its other
parameters relative to the key VSL-like parameter . This nonuniform convergence enables
E[M ] or E[U ] to explode (for any other given parameter values) as ! 1. One might try
to argue that the values of E[M ] or E[U ] are ultimately an empirical matter to be decided
empirically (by analytical formulas or simulation results), with relevant parameter values
of , n, k, , , and so forth being taken together as an empirically-plausible ensemble.
The idea that the values of E[M ] or E[U ] should depend on empirically-reasonable values
of and the other parameters is, of course, right on some level –and it sounds reassuring.
Yet, as a practical matter, the fact that E[M ] and E[U ] are so sensitive to large values
of (or small values of D, about which we can have little con…dence in our own a priori
knowledge) casts a very long shadow over any empirical CBA of a situation to which DT
might apply. In ordinary run-of-the-mill limited-exposure thin-tailed situations, there is at
least the underlying theoretical reassurance that …nite-cuto¤-based CBA might (at least in
principle) be an arbitrarily-close approximation to something that is accurate and objective.
In fat-tailed unlimited-exposure DT situations, by contrast, there is no such theoretical
assurance underpinning the arbitrary cuto¤s, which is ultimately due to the lack of uniform
convergence of E[M ] or E[U ] with respect to or D.
    One does not want to abandon lightly the ideal that CBA should bring independent
empirical discipline to any application by being based upon empirically-reasonable parame-
ter values. Even when the Dismal Theorem might apply, CBA based upon empirically-
reasonable parameter values (including ) might reveal useful information. At the same
time, one does not want to be obtuse by insisting that DT per se makes no practical dif-
ference for CBA because the VSL-like coe¢ cient is in any event just another parameter
whose value is to be determined empirically and then simply plugged into the analysis along
with some guesses about “the damages function” for catastrophes (combined with specula-
tive extreme-tail probabilities). So some sort of a tricky balance is required between being
overawed by DT into abandoning CBA altogether and being underawed by DT into insisting
that it is just another empirical issue to be sorted out by business-as-usual CBA.
    There exist perhaps half a dozen or so serious “nightmare scenarios” of environmental
disasters comparable in conceivable worst-case impact to catastrophic climate change. These
  7
    Adler (2007) sketches out in some detail the many ways in which de mimimis low-probability-threshold
cuto¤s are arbitrary and problematic in more-ordinary regulatory settings.



                                                  25
might include: biotechnology, nanotechnology, asteroids, strangelets, pandemics, runaway
computer systems, nuclear proliferation.8 It may well be that each of these possibilities of
environmental catastrophe deserves its own CBA application of DT. Even if this were true,
however, it would not lessen the need to reckon with the strong potential implications of DT
for CBA in the particular case of climate change.
    Perhaps it is no more than just an intuition, but for what it is worth I somehow don’t feel
that the handful of other conceivable environmental catastrophes are as critical as climate
change. Let me illustrate some of what I have in mind with the speci…c example of the
widespread cultivation of crops based upon bioengineered genetically-modi…ed organisms
(GMOs). At …rst glance, the two situations might appear casually similar. In both
cases, there is deep unease about arti…cial tinkering with the natural environment, which
can generate frightening tales of a world turned upside down and a planet that has been
ruined by human activity. Suppose for the sake of argument that in the case of GMOs the
overarching fear of disaster concerns the possibility that widespread cultivation of so-called
“Frankenfood”could somehow allow bioengineered genes to escape into the wild and wreak
havoc on delicate ecosystems and native populations (including, perhaps, humans), which
have been …ne-tuned by millions of years of natural selection. At the end of the day I think
that the potential for environmental disaster with Frankenfood is somewhat di¤erent from
the potential for environmental disaster with climate change –along the lines of the following
loose reasoning.
    Theorem 1 and the subsequent discussion of nonuniform convergence in and n imply
that deep uncertainty about the unknown scale of a disaster has the potential to dominate
EU cost-bene…t calculations when the amount of prior-plus-inductive knowledge k+n is
small relative to the VSL-like parameter of such disasters. I think that in the case of
Frankenfoods interfering with wild organisms that have evolved by natural selection, there
is at least some basic underlying principle that plausibly dampens the extent of catastrophic
jumping of arti…cial DNA from cultivars to landraces. After all, nature herself has already
tried endless combinations of mutated DNA and genes over countless millions of years, and
what has evolved in the …erce battle for survival is only an in…nitesimal subset of the very
…ttest permutations. In this regard there exists at least some inkling of a prior argument
making it fundamentally implausible that Frankenfood arti…cially selected for traits that
humans …nd desirable will compete with or genetically alter the wild types that nature
has selected via Darwinian survival of the …ttest. Wild types have already experienced
innumerable small-step genetic mutations perhaps comparable to large-step human-induced
arti…cial modi…cations –and these natural small-step modi…cations have already been shown
  8
      Many of these are discussed in Posner (2004), Sunstein (2007), and Parson (2007).


                                                     26
not to have survival value in the wild. I think that analogous arguments may also apply
for invasive “superweeds,”which (at least so far) represent a minor cultivation problem and
have not displayed any ability to displace landraces. Besides all this, and importantly in
this context, safeguards in the form of so-called “terminator genes”can be inserted into the
DNA of GMOs, which directly prevents GMO genes from reproducing themselves.
    Contrast the above discussion about the plausible limits of disaster (and the limits of a
precautionary principle) in the case of genetic engineering with the lack of any such prior
limitations on the magnitude of disasters possible from climate change. The climate-change
“experiment,” whose eventual outcome we are trying to infer now, concerns the planet’s
response to a geologically-instantaneous exogenous injection of GHGs. Such a “planetary
experiment”of an exogenous injection of this much GHGs this fast seems unprecedented in
Earth’s history stretching back perhaps even hundreds of millions of years. Can anyone
honestly say now, from very limited information or experience, what are reasonable upper
bounds on the eventual global warming or climate change that we are currently trying to
infer will be the outcome of such a …rst-ever planetary experiment? What we do know
about climate science and extreme tail probabilities is that planet Earth hovers in an un-
stable climate equilibrium9 , chaotic dynamics cannot be ruled out, and all eighteen current
studies of climate sensitivity cited by IPCC4 taken together are estimating on average that
P [S >6 C] 5%. To my mind this open-ended aspect makes GHG-induced global climate
change vastly more worrisome than global cultivation of Frankenfood.
    I think this example perhaps suggests that it may (barely) be possible to make a few
meaningful distinctions among the handful of situations where the Dismal Theorem might
conceivably apply seriously. While my discussion here is hardly conclusive and we surely
cannot rule out a biotech disaster, I would say on the basis of this line of argument that
it seems to me very very unlikely, whereas a climate disaster seems to me “only” very
unlikely. In the language of this paper, synthetic biology seems to me more like a high-
(k+n) situation relative to climate change, which by comparison feels to me more like a
low-(k+n) situation. It is true that a climate-change catastrophe develops more slowly than
some other potential catastrophes and there is perhaps somewhat more chance for learning
and mid-course corrections relative to, say, biotechnology. So the possibility of “learning by
doing”may be a more distinctive feature of climate change disasters than other disasters and
should be part of an optimal climate-change policy. This being said, the climate response to
GHGs has tremendous built-in inertial lags and I don’t think there is a smoking gun in the
biotechnology scenario –or in most other catastrophe scenarios –quite like having average
expert assessment in climate change be that P [S >8 C] 2%.

    I have tried to make an example contrasting climate change with synthetic biology and
I have tried to argue that the latter feels less dangerous than the former. However, this
is ultimately a subjective assessment intended only to illustrate a possible thought process.
The applicability of DT to each catastrophe scenario must be decided on a case by case basis.
To repeat, the fact that DT might also apply to some other environmental catastrophes, like
biotechnology, is not a valid reason for excluding it from applying to climate change.
    Many situations have natural limited-exposure-like bounds on the possible damages that
might materialize, for which the theory of this paper may be less relevant or perhaps even
have no relevance. When a particular type of idiosyncratic uncertainty a¤ects only one small
part of an individual’s or a society’s overall portfolio of assets, exposure is naturally limited
to that speci…c component and tail fatness is not such a paramount concern. But a few
very important real-world situations have potentially unlimited exposure due to structural
uncertainty about their potentially open-ended catastrophic reach. Climate change poten-
tially a¤ects the whole worldwide portfolio of utility by threatening to drive all of planetary
welfare to disastrously low levels in the most extreme scenarios. This paper shows that the
EU analysis of those relatively few deep-uncertainty situations with potentially catastrophic
reach – like climate change – can give very di¤erent conclusions than what might emerge
from a typical CBA of a more ordinary limited-exposure situation. The conclusions can
even be very di¤erent from what would come out of a conventional Monte Carlo simulation
of a model whose core structure resembles the model of this paper but with a discrete-grid
approximation or with a …nite number of runs. The dismal outcome embodied in Theorem
1 of this paper can be approached by a Monte Carlo simulation only as a double limit where
the grid size and the number of runs both go to in…nity.
    A so-called “Integrated Assessment Model” (hereafter “IAM”) for climate change is a
multiple-equation computer-simulated model that combines dynamic economics with geo-
physical and geochemical circulation dynamics for purposes of analyzing the economic im-
pacts of global climate change. An IAM is essentially a model of economic growth with a
controllable externality of endogenous greenhouse warming. IAMs have proven themselves
indispensable for understanding the economics of climate change – if for no other reason
than being able to describe outcomes from a complicated interplay of the long lags and big
inertias that are involved. Most existing economic analyses of climate change treat central
forecasts of damages as if they were certain, or, if they address uncertainty at all, use thin-
tailed PDFs including, especially, truncation of PDFs at an arbitrary level. When viewed
in the light of the Dismal Theorem, therefore, most conventional climate-change IAMs may
have limitations that have not yet been su¢ ciently recognized or acknowledged.
    Samplings based upon conventional Monte Carlo simulations of the economics of climate


                                               28
change with any existing IAM may give a very misleading picture of the EU consequences of
alternative GHG-mitigation policies.10 The core underlying problem is that while it might
be true in expectations that utility-equivalent damages of climate change are enormous, when
chasing a fat tail this will not be true for the overwhelming bulk of Monte Carlo realizations.
To see this most clearly in a crisp thought experiment, imagine what would happen to the
simple stripped-down model of this paper in the hands of a Monte Carlo IAM simulator.
    A …nite grid may not reveal the true expected stochastic discount factor or true expected
discounted utility in simulations of this model (even in the limit of an in…nite number of runs)
because the most extreme negative impacts in the fattened tails will have been truncated
and evaluated at but a single point representing an arti…cially-imposed lower bound on the
set of all possible values of consumption-equivalent outcomes from all conceivable negative
impacts. Such arbitrarily-imposed de minimis threshold-cuto¤ truncations are typically
justi…ed (when anyone bothers to justify them at all) on the thin-tailed logic that probabilities
of extremely rare events are statistically insigni…cantly di¤erent from zero –and hence can
be ignored. This logic might conceivably su¢ ce for known thin tails, but the conclusion is
highly incorrect for the rare and unusual class of fat-tailed potentially-high-impact economic
problems to which climate change seemingly belongs. Back-of-the-envelope calculations
cited earlier in this paper appear to indicate that the validity of a Monte Carlo simulation of
the economics of climate change requires seriously probing into the implications of disastrous
temperatures and catastrophic impacts in incremental steps that might conceivably cause up
to a 99% (or maybe even more) decline of welfare-equivalent consumption before the modeler
is allowed to cut o¤ the rest of the bad fat tail and discard it. This paper says that any
climate-change IAM that does not go out on a limb by explicitly stating and including in a
Monte Carlo simulation the ultra-miniscule but fat-tailed probabilities of ultra-catastrophic
impacts (down to about one percent or so of current welfare-equivalent consumption) is in
possible violation of best-practice economic analysis because (by ignoring the extreme tails)
it could constitute a serious misapplication of EU theory. The policy relevance of such a
model might then remain under a dark cloud until this fat-tail issue is addressed seriously
and resolved empirically.
    An additional consideration is that a …nite sample of Monte Carlo simulations may not
reveal true expected utility in this model (even in the limit of an in…nite grid) because
the limited sample may not be able to go deep enough into the fattened tails where the
most extreme damages are. Nor will typical sensitivity analysis of Monte Carlo simulations
  10
    Tol (2003) showed the empirical relevance of this issue in some actual IAM simulations. I am grateful
to Richard Carson for suggesting the inclusion of an explicit discussion of why a Monte Carlo simulation
may fail to account fully for the implications of uncertain large impacts with small probabilities.



                                                   29
necessarily penetrate su¢ ciently far into the fattened-tail region to represent accurately
the EU consequences of disastrous damages. For any IAM (which presumably has a core
structure resembling the model of this paper), special precautions are required to ensure that
Monte Carlo simulations represent accurately the low-utility impacts of fat-tailed PDFs.
    Instead of the existing IAM emphasis on estimating or simulating the economic impacts
of what are e¤ectively the more plausible climate-change scenarios, to at least compensate
partially for …nite-sample bias the model of this paper calls for a dramatic oversampling
(relative to probability of occurrence) of those strati…ed climate-change scenarios associated
with the most adverse imaginable economic impacts in the bad fat tail. With limited sam-
pling resources for the big IAMs, Monte Carlo analysis could be used much more creatively
– not to defend a speci…c policy result, but to experiment seriously with what happens to
the outcomes with fat-tailed uncertainty in the limit as the grid size and number of runs
simultaneously increase. Of course this emphasis on sampling climate-change scenarios
in proportion to marginal-utility-weighted probabilities of occurrence forces us to estimate
subjective probabilities down to extraordinarily tiny levels and also to put utility weights
on disasters with damage impacts up to perhaps being welfare-equivalent to losing 99% of
consumption –but that is the price we must be willing to pay for having a genuine economic
assessment of potentially-catastrophic climate change.
    In situations of potentially unlimited damage exposure –like climate change –a reframing
of the focus of economic analysis might be appropriate, with more emphasis on even a slightly
better treatment of the worst-case tail extremes (and what might be done about them, at
what cost) relative to re…ning the calibration of merely-likely outcomes or arguing over
discount rates. A clear implication of this paper is that greater research e¤ort is relatively
ine¤ectual when it is targeted at describing and estimating the central tendencies of what
we already know fairly well about the economics of climate change in the more-plausible
scenarios. A much more fruitful goal of research in my opinion is to aim at understanding
even slightly better the deep uncertainty (which potentially permeates the economic analysis)
concerning the less plausible scenarios located in the bad fat tail. I also believe that an
important complementary research goal is to comprehend much better all of the options
for dealing with high-impact climate-change extremes, which should include undertaking
well-funded detailed studies and experiments about the feasibility and cost-e¤ectiveness of
geoengineering options to slim down the bad fat tail quickly in case of emergency.11
  11
    It is a secret well kept within the climate-change community of scholars that (with the unfortunately-
limited information we currently possess) geoengineering via injection of stratospheric sulfate aerosol precur-
sors looks at …rst glance now like an incredibly cheap and e¤ective way to slim down the bad fat tail quickly.
For more on the economics of geoengineering, see Barrett (2007). In my opinion there is an acute – even
desperate – need for much more extensive research on (and experimentation with) various geoengineering



                                                      30
    When analyzing the economics of climate change, perhaps it might be possible to reason
somewhat by analogy with insurance for extreme events and to compare, say, a homeowner’s
cost of buying …re insurance or a young adult’s cost of buying life insurance with the cost
to the world economy of buying an insurance policy going some way towards mitigating the
extreme high-temperature possibilities. On a U.S. national level, rough comparisons could
perhaps be made with the potentially-huge payo¤s, small probabilities, and signi…cant costs
involved in countering terrorism, building anti-ballistic missile shields, or eliminating hostile
dictatorships that might harbor weapons of mass destruction. A crude natural metric for
calibrating cost estimates of climate-change environmental-insurance policies might be that
the U.S. already spends approximately 3% of national income on the cost of a clean environ-
ment.12 All of this having been said, the bind we …nd ourselves in now on climate change
starts from a high- , low-k situation to begin with, and is characterized by extremely slow
convergence in n of inductive knowledge towards resolving the deep uncertainties –relative
to the lags and irreversibilities from not acting before structure is more fully identi…ed.
    The point of all of this is that economic analysis is not completely helpless in the presence
of deep structural uncertainty and potentially unlimited exposure. The analysis is more
frustrating and more subjective – and it looks a lot less conclusive – because it requires
some form of speculation (masquerading as an “assessment”) about the extreme bad-fat-tail
probabilities and utilities. Compared with the thin-tailed case, CBA of fat-tailed potential
catastrophes is inclined to favor paying a lot more attention to learning now how fat the bad
tail might be and – if the tail is discovered to be too heavy for comfort after the learning
process –is a lot more prone to investing big-budget real money on mitigation measures to
slim it down. This slimming-down of overweight tails is likely to be a perennial theme in
the economic analysis of catastrophes. The key economic issues here are: what is the cost of
such a tail-slimming weight-loss program and how much of the bad fat does it remove from
the overweight tail?
    The above attempts at doling out constructive suggestions notwithstanding, it is painfully
apparent that the Dismal Theorem makes economic analysis trickier and more open-ended
in the presence of deep structural uncertainty –and there is no sense pretending otherwise.
The economics of fat-tailed catastrophes raises di¢ cult conceptual issues which cause the
analysis to appear less scienti…cally conclusive and to look more contentiously subjective
than what comes out of an empirical CBA of more-usual thin-tailed situations. But if that
is the way things are with fat tails, then that is the way things are, and it is a fact to be lived
options for dealing with potential runaway climate change.

with rather than a fact to be evaded just because it looks less scienti…cally objective in cost-
bene…t applications. A CBA of a situation with known thin tails, even including whatever
elements of subjective arbitrariness it might otherwise have, can at least in principle make
statements of the form: “if the tails are cut o¤ here, then EU theory will still be an accurate
approximation of what is important.” Such accuracy-of-approximation cuto¤ statements,
alas, are far from being out there automatically for fat-tailed CBA. Perhaps in the end the
economist can help most by not presenting a cost-bene…t estimate for a fat-tailed situation
with potentially unlimited exposure as if it is accurate and objective –and not even presenting
the analysis as if it is an approximation to something that is accurate and objective – but
instead by stressing more the fact that such an estimate might conceivably be arbitrarily
inaccurate depending upon what is subjectively assumed about the fatness of the tails or
where they have been cut o¤. This is unsatisfying and not what economists are used to
doing, but in rare situations like climate change where the Dismal Theorem applies we may
be deluding ourselves and others with misplaced concreteness if we think that we are able
to deliver anything much more precise than this with even the biggest and most-detailed
climate-change IAMs as currently constructed and deployed.
    The contribution of this paper is to phrase exactly and to prove rigorously a basic the-
oretical principle that holds under strict relative risk aversion and potentially unlimited
exposure. In principle, what might be called the catastrophe-insurance aspect of such a
fat-tailed unlimited-exposure situation, which can never be fully learned away, dominates
the social-discounting aspect, the pure-risk aspect, or the consumption-smoothing aspect.
Even if this principle in and of itself does not provide an easy answer to questions about how
much catastrophe insurance to buy (or even an easy answer in practical terms to the question
of what exactly is catastrophe insurance buying for climate change or other applications), I
believe it still might provide a useful way of framing the economic analysis of catastrophes.
