What are the effects of school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic on children's education?
Online education is an imperfect substitute for in-person learning, particularly for children from
low-income families. Peer effects also change: schools allow children from different socio-
economic backgrounds to mix together, and this effect is lost when schools are closed. Another
factor is the response of parents, some of whom compensate for the changed environment through
their own efforts, while others are unable to do so. We examine the interaction of these factors
with the aid of a structural model of skill formation. We find that school closures have a large and
persistent effect on educational outcomes that is highly unequal. High school students from poor
neighborhoods suffer a learning loss of 0.4 standard deviations, whereas children from rich
neighborhoods remain unscathed. The channels operating through schools, peers, and parents all
contribute to growing educational inequality during the pandemic.

1   Introduction
Of the many facets of the Covid-19 pandemic, the impact on children’s education
stands out as having particularly long-lasting consequences. Schools were closed
for months in most countries, and early evidence suggests that online education
that was offered as an alternative is a poor substitute. School closures threaten to
widen inequality not only across cohorts but also across socio-economic groups.
For example, online education relies on access to technology like computers and
fast internet that not all families can afford. Likewise, parents’ ability to support
their children’s learning depends on their own knowledge and on whether they
can work from home during the crisis. Because learning is a cumulative process,
part of the effects of the disruption will persist until children reach adulthood,
thereby affecting their future success in labor markets, family formation, and
other dimensions of social life.

How should policy be designed to mitigate learning losses and their effects?
The Covid-19 crisis is still ongoing and unlikely to be resolved for a number of
months. During this time, policymakers must decide whether to continue school
closures, open all schools, or follow a more flexible policy of partial openings.
If partial openings are pursued, they must determine how to target openings.
Another important question is whether additional programs should be offered
after the pandemic subsides and which groups of students deserve special atten-
tion. Given that organizing such programs on a large scale requires planning and
resources, decisions must be taken soon.

For answering these and other related questions, we need to understand both the
size of the problem and the channels through which the crisis affects children.
The fact that online learning is less effective than in-school learning is well recog-
nized. But the accumulation of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills does not
depend on schools alone. Especially for older children, peer interactions are an-
other crucial ingredient, and school closures and lockdown measures during the

                                           1
pandemic drastically change children’s social interactions and peer environment.
The response of parents is no less important: they can complement education in
school, replace some of the inputs usually provided by teachers, and influence
their children in other ways such as through their choice of a parenting style.
Parents’ ability to do all of this interacts with their own exposure to the crisis,
such as whether they lost their job or could work from home during lockdowns.

In this paper, we provide a first assessment of how these channels interact during
a pandemic. We focus on the impact on the education of students in high school,
from grades 9 to 12. We organize our analysis with a structural model of skill
acquisition based on Agostinelli et al. (2020). The model captures how children’s
skill acquisition depends on educational inputs such as the quality of schools,
parental inputs that include educational investments and parenting style, and on
peer groups that are endogenously chosen. We use pre-crisis evidence from the
Add Health data set to discipline the time-invariant parameters of the model.

We model the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic through a set of temporary
changes in the economic environment. First, the switch to remote learning low-
ers the overall productivity of the learning technology. The size of the produc-
tivity loss is chosen to match evidence on lower test score growth during the
current crisis. Second, there are changes to the peer environment: children may
lose contact with some peers, and new peer connections are shaped by the peer
environment in the neighborhood of residence rather than the school. We disci-
pline this part of the model using evidence from Add Health on the impact of
losing peer connections on learning, and on differences in the peer environment
at the level of neighborhoods and schools (which draw students from multiple
neighborhoods). Third, remote learning makes greater demands on parents, who
have to supply some inputs usually provided by teachers and take a greater role
on organizing, inciting, and supporting their children’s learning. This aspect of
the model is matched to empirical evidence on the increase in the time parents
spend on helping their children with school during the current crisis. We also
take into account that parents’ ability to spend time helping their children de-
pends on their own constraints, such as whether the parent is able to work from
home during the pandemic. We use evidence on how the ability to work from


                                        2
home correlates with parental characteristics to quantify these constraints.

Our quantitative model is able to replicate the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on
student’s educational performance and on parents’ time allocation. Our struc-
tural model implies that each channel of change to children’s skill acquisition
contributes to widening educational inequality during the crisis. Beyond the
direct impact of the switch from in-person to virtual schooling, children from
low-income families are also affected by a decline in positive peer spillovers, and
parents in low-income families face greater challenges in supporting their chil-
dren’s learning, in large part because they are less likely to be able to work from
home. In our baseline calibration, these effects combine to generate a skill loss
relative to a counterfactual of no pandemic of 0.4 standard deviations for children
from a census block at the 20th percentile of the income distribution, versus al-
most no losses at all for children from the richest neighborhoods. Learning gaps
are reduced somewhat in subsequent years, but are still large at the end of high
school, when less than half of the gap opened during the pandemic is closed.

We can then use the structure of the model to decompose how different channels
working through schools, peers, and parents contribute to overall learning losses
and to changes in educational inequality. While each channel makes a sizeable
contribution, the peer effects channel turns out to be the most important: in a
counterfactual that keeps the peer environment constant but introduces all other
pandemic-induced changes, the change in educational inequality is reduced by
more than 60 percent.

We also discuss policies that may be used to prevent some of the learning losses
and widening educational inequality predicted by our structural model. Open-
ing schools would be the obvious solution, but clearly educational benefits must
be weighed against repercussions in terms of spreading of the pandemic. Still,
the large detrimental effects on overall skill acquisition and inequality implied
by our analysis can inform tradeoffs faced by policymakers, such as how much
priority to give to opening schools relative to other sectors of the economy. Our
results also highlight which groups of students would benefit most from restor-
ing in-person schooling. Beyond students from low-income families in general,
this also includes students who are already undergoing a change in the peer en-

                                        3
vironment, such as those who enter high school after having completed middle
school, who are especially vulnerable to the detrimental effects of being sepa-
rated from peers. Some of the impact of the pandemic on children’s education
could be mitigated by expanded in-school support once the pandemic is under
control, for example by shortening the summer break in 2021 or offering targeted
services to disadvantaged groups.

Our paper builds on three strands of the literature. The first is the economic
literature on children’s skill formation, including the contributions by Cunha,
Heckman, and Schennach (2010), Del Boca, Flinn, and Wiswall (2014), Agostinelli
and Wiswall (2016), and Attanasio et al. (2020) and recent work considering the
role of parenting styles that is summarized by Doepke, Sorrenti, and Zilibotti
(2019). The second related literature considers neighborhood effects for chil-
dren’s skill acquisition, such as Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016), Chetty and
Hendren (2018a, 2018b), Eckert and Kleineberg (2019), and Fogli and Guerrieri
(2018).1 Finally, our work is part of the emerging literature on the consequences
of the Covid-19 pandemic for families and children. Our work relates in partic-
ular to Fuchs-Schündeln et al. (2020), who also use a structural model to exam-
ine the impact of pandemic-induced school closures on educational inequality.
Their contribution is complementary to ours; Fuchs-Schündeln et al. (2020) ex-
amine on the macroeconomic angle and account for the economic impact of the
crisis, government transfers, and different stages of education, whereas we fo-
cus on the interaction of influences of schools, peers, and parents at the high
school stage and discipline the analysis using data on children’s educational per-
formance and parents’ behavior during the crisis. Alon et al. (2020) also consider
effects of school closures, but with a focus on implications for parents’ labor sup-
ply rather than children’s education. We link our work to additional empirical
contributions specifically on the impact of the pandemic on children’s education
in Section 2 below.

In the next section, we provide descriptive evidence that sheds light on how a

     Within this literature, Calvó-Armengol, Patacchini, and Zenou (2009) consider the role of a
child’s position in her local friendship network (measured by the Katz-Bonacich centrality) on
school performance. More recently, List, Momeni, and Zenou (2019) have documented large
spillover effects (operating through children’s social networks) of programs targeting disadvan-
taged children.

present a structural model of skill acquisition, peer formation, and parenting that
we will take to the data. In Section 4, we calibrate the model to match evidence
on children’s skill acquisition and on the changes brought about by the Covid-19
pandemic. In Section 5, we present our main results on how different changes
during a pandemic affect children’s overall learning and educational inequality.
Section 6 discusses policy implications of our analysis, and Section 7 concludes.


2       Empirical Evidence: How School Closures Affect Children’s
        Education
Our analysis focuses on three channels through which school closures affects
child development and human capital formation. The first is the direct effect
of suspending in-person teaching and replacing it with online instruction. The
second is the change in the peer environment when children stop going to school,
which includes the psychological impact of losing contact with some friends
and a changed pool for making new connections. The third is the parents’ re-
sponse. Parents have to replace some of the inputs usually provided by profes-
sional teachers with their own efforts, subject to the constraints imposed by the
requirements of their own work. We start our analysis by describing evidence
that allows a first assessment of the importance of these channels.

Effect of School Closures in the United States. A benchmark to evaluate the di-
rect effect of the interruption of in-person teaching is what happens during reg-
ular summer breaks.2 A RAND Corporation study from McCombs et al. (2014)
uses results for standardized MAP tests to measure the extent of learning losses.
They document a 4-point drop in the mathematics score on the RIT scale during
each summer break, which compares with an 8-point gains that accrue from sixth
to eighth grade during regular school years. In English, students gain five points
during the school year and lose two points during summer. These figures suggest
that a child who does not engage at all with learning activities during a school
closure lasting three months could lose four points in math and two points in
    2
    The discussion in this paragraph follows Doepke and Zilibotti (2020). For evidence on sum-
mer losses see also Downey, von Hippel, and Broh (2004).

                                              5
English. In comparison, a child who keeps on learning at the usual speed gains
about 2.7 points in math (i.e., a third of the gain during an academic year) and 1.7
points in English during the same period. The achievement gap between these
two scenarios is about seven points in math and four points in English. This is
larger than the typical learning gain during a school year. Therefore, if some fam-
ilies can fully make up for the lack of in-person teaching while others make no
remedy, a gap equivalent of more than an entire year of schooling can arise.3

Effect of School Closures: International Evidence. A number of studies pro-
vide first assessments of the effects of Covid-induced school closures in different
countries. Maldonado and De Witte (2020) compares standardized test scores of
Belgian students attending the last year of primary school who were affected by
school closures (cohort of 2020) with those of previous cohorts. Students exposed
to school closures experience a decrease in mathematics and language scores by
0.19 and 0.29 standard deviations, respectively. These are large effects. More-
over, school closures deepen existing inequality as children from more disad-
vantaged backgrounds experience larger learning losses. Engzell, Frey, and Ver-
hagen (2020) find similar results in the Netherlands, a country with a relatively
short 8-weeks lockdown and high degree of technological preparedness. Their
difference-in-differences finds large learning losses, especially for students from
less affluent families.4 In short, a variety of international studies point at large
effects on learning of school closures.

Time Diaries. Time diaries for children’s activities during the crisis also help
us understand why the pandemic has unequal effects across the socio-economic
ladder. The analysis of a sample of German parents in Grewenig et al. (2020)
suggests that low-achieving students may suffer more from the lack of educator
support during school closures. Compared to high achievers, these students ap-
pear to disproportionately replace learning time with less productive activities
   3
      Kuhfeld et al. (2020a) reach similar conclusions based on the evidence about learning losses
because of absenteeism, summer breaks, and weather-related school closures. Kuhfeld et al.
(2020b) find smaller effects when comparing a cohort of student assessed in the fall 2019 with
that of the cohort of students assessed in the fall 2020. However, the authors acknowledge that
their preliminary results might severely underestimate the effect of the pandemic on students’
achievements due to selective attrition in the studied sample.

such as watching TV or playing computer games. Andrew et al. (2020) reach
similar conclusion for a sample of English children.

Losing Contact with Friends. School closure also affects children’s socializa-
tion with peers. A large literature in economics and developmental psychology
documents large peer effects in education.5 To evaluate the effects of Covid on
socialization, we consider the Add Health data set, which focuses on a repre-
sentative sample of high school students in the United States. One aspect of the
peer-interaction channel is that the forced separation from friends can have psy-
chological effects that hinder the learning process. Detachment from close friends
can be a source of stress and instability. In particular, we study how separations
affect children’s learning in normal (non-pandemic) times. In the Add Health
data set, parents and children are interviewed twice over two different school
years (Wave I and Wave II In-Home). When some children are not in the Wave
II sample, although they were active respondents of the Wave I In-Home survey,
we infer that they have left the school. We can then study the effect of a child
leaving the school on the academic performance of their friends who continue in
the school.

Table 1 provides regression results. For children moving from 8th to 9th grade,
the loss of one friend is associated with a deterioration of more than 10 percent
in growth in the grade point average (GPA).6 The result is robust to controlling
for other determinants of school performance and for school fixed effects, and is
larger for boys than for girls (see Table A-1 in the appendix). The negative effect
is twice as large for children who lose two or more friends relative to those who
lose only one friend. Table 2 shows the result of a specification where separa-
tion is interacted with the pre-separation GPA of the child. The negative effects
are larger for low achievers. In other words, high achievers appear to be more
resilient and cope better with losing contact with friends. Taking stock, there
    5
      See, e.g., Durlauf and Ioannides (2010), Sacerdote (2011), and Epple and Romano (2011) for
extensive reviews on the role of peer effects in education.
    6
      The descriptive analysis in this section ignores important econometric issues in the study of
peer effects. For instance, it is possible that a correlated shock hits the families of two friends,
inducing one of them to move. This shock (e.g., a job loss) could have direct effects on the perfor-
mance of the stayer. For this reason, we refrain from a strict causal interpretation. Note that we
control for school fixed effects that reduces but does not eliminate these concerns.

                                                 7
is evidence that forced separation from friends negatively affects children’s aca-
demic performance, and that this impact is particularly large for children who
are already struggling in school.

Interestingly, the effect of being separated from friends is small and statistically
insignificant in higher grades beyond 9th grade (see Table A-2 in the appendix).
One interpretation of this finding is that children may be especially vulnerable to
changes in their peer environment when they are changing schools (i.e., entering
high school in grade 9 after completing middle school). Older children who con-
tinue in the same school may have already established a stable group of friends
in their new environment, so that losing one or two peers has less of an impact.
This observation suggests that children who switch schools may be especially
vulnerable during the pandemic.7

Changes in the Peer Environment. Beyond losing existing friends, the pandemic
also changes children’s ability to form new peer connections. Schoolmates who
live far away may no longer be potential friends once children stop attending
school in person. Instead, the peer interactions that are still possible happen at
the level of the neighborhood. Even if children are able to make new connections,
this distinction matters because the peer environment may differ at the level of
the school and the neighborhood. To quantify these effects, we suppose here
that when schools close down, children’s peer environment is restricted to the
neighborhood in which they live, which we assume to be the census block of their
residence. The Add Health data allows us to infer the characteristics of census
blocks where each child lives.8 While US school districts are characterized by
a high degree of social sorting by international standards, the extent of socio-
economic segregation is even higher if children’s peer interactions get confined
to the block level. In other words, schools operate as an equalizer insofar as they
mix children from different socio-economic backgrounds.

      The contextual data section in Add Health includes information matched from the 1990 US
Census. We use median household income at the census block to characterize the neighborhood
where children live.

 school to high school. In columns (1)-(2), we interact the number of friends that a child lost with the

ily income at the census block level and the average grade of children attending
the same school (blue) or living in the same census block (red). As expected, the
correlation is positive, namely, children living in richer blocks are exposed to aca-
demically stronger peers. The important observation is that the regression line
is substantially steeper as we move from schools to blocks. For the children of
poorer families, schools provide an opportunity to socialize with children from
more privileged environments (relative to the block where they live). In contrast,
the children of richer families meet children from less affluent families. Thus, the
evidence on the peer environment channel adds to the overall theme that pan-
demic restrictions increase inequality in educational opportunities, here through
the peer groups that children have access to.

Changes in Parenting: Knowledge and Time Constraints. Another channel
through which a pandemic affects learning is through changes in parents’ behav-
ior and parental investment. Virtual schooling places new demands on parents,
from making sure that children have access to the technology they need to replac-
ing some of the tutoring, encouragement, and admonishment usually provided
by teachers. Not all parents are equally able to provide these inputs. In some
cases, knowledge might be a constraint, for example when helping children with
homework in advanced high school math. Time constraints are likely to be even
more important. Most parents have to earn a living in addition to being sub-
stitute teachers, which limits the inputs they can provide. These constraints are
especially binding for single parents with limited resources, and single parent-
hood is more prevalent among parents with less education and lower earnings
prospects. For parents who were employed during the crisis, a key issue was


                                                     11
whether they could do their work from home, such as academics and other of-
fice workers working from their home office, or had to go to another workplace,
such as most workers in manufacturing, supermarkets, and other retail outlets.
Once again, the aspect of working from home introduces an element of inequal-
ity across the socio-economic ladder. Mongey, Pilossoph, and Weinberg (2020)
show that workers with less income and education are more likely to be unable
to work from home during the crisis than others. In our analysis below, we use
survey evidence from Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a, 2020b) to quantify the extent to
which the ability to work from home varies across the income scale.

Changes in Parenting Style. Beyond the the impact of knowledge and time con-
straints, parenting styles tend to adjust to changes in the peer environment. Here
a relevant observation—which is the focus of our previous research in Agostinelli
et al. (2020)—is that parents become more authoritarian when children are ex-
posed to a more unequal environment. In particular, some parents actively dis-
courage their children from interacting with lower-achieving peers, especially
when their children are low achievers themselves. The evidence discussed above
suggests that the peer environment deteriorates for poor families during the pan-
demic. Thus, we expect parents from a lower socio-economic background to turn
more authoritarian during school closure periods. This has two effects. First,
changes in parenting style makes it even harder for the most disadvantaged chil-
dren to interact with stronger peers. Second, an authoritarian parenting style
(albeit rational from the point of view of parents) has a negative direct effect on
the process of skill formation and reduces educational achievement.

Agostinelli et al. (2020) zoom in on a narrower dimension of authoritarian par-
enting, namely, meddling with the choice of friends.9 Figure 2 reproduces Fig-
ure 1 in Agostinelli et al. (2020). It shows how authoritarian parenting varies
across schools with different characteristics. The left panel displays a binned
scatter plot of the relationship between median family income and the fraction
of authoritarian parents at the school level, whereas the right panel shows the

   9
      A parent is considered authoritarian or not depending on how her or his child answers to the
question: “Do your parents let you make your own decisions about the people you hang around
with?” A parent whose child answers “No” is classified as behaving in an authoritarian fashion;
all others are nonauthoritarian.

                                               12
relationship between income inequality (defined as the 90th–10th percentile ratio
of within-school family income) and authoritarian parenting. The figure shows
that across schools, the proportion of parents adopting the authoritarian parent-
ing style is decreasing with the median income and increasing with income in-
equality. Broadly speaking, parents are more likely to meddle in the choice of
friends when there are more children from disadvantaged families present. The
differences are quantitatively large. The same pattern emerges in multiple regres-
sions where we simultaneously include median income and income inequality
and control for parental characteristics.10 The results are robust to within-school
regressions exploiting variations across cohorts.

Taking Stock. The evidence reviewed in this section has established the follow-
ing points.

   1. School closures have a negative impact on children’s accumulation of skills,
   10
     Similar patterns exist when one considers broader definitions of parenting styles. For in-
stance, we consider the answer parents give to the question: “Of the following, which do you
think is the most important thing for a boy/girl to learn? Be well-behaved, work hard, think
for himself, help others, be popular.” We define authoritarian parents as those who choose “be
well-behaved,” authoritative parents as those opting for “work hard,” and permissive parents as
those who choose “think for themselves.” When we use these definitions, we continue to find
that parents tend to be more permissive in wealthier and more equal neighborhoods, while they
tend to be more authoritative and authoritarian in poorer and more unequal neighborhoods.

                                                                                         13
      and learning losses are particularly acute for children from low-income
      families.

    2. Separation from peers reduces children’s learning. School closures and so-
       cial distancing also lead to more segregation in the peer environment for
       children from rich and poor families.

    3. School closures place additional demands on parents, and richer and better-
       educated parents are better positioned to meet these demands. In addition,
       parents’ responses to their children’s environment are likely to lead to more
       authoritarian parenting in less affluent neighborhoods.

We now construct and structurally estimate a model that allows us to quantify
the joint effect of these factors on children’s learning. The theory emphasizes
potential heterogeneous effects across the socio-economic ladder.


3    A Model of Skill Acquisition with Schools, Peers, and Parents
The model is an extension of Agostinelli et al. (2020). We consider an economy
where children live in neighborhood n and attend school s. Human capital accu-
mulation is determined by a technology of skill formation where a child’s skills
θi,t is a state variable whose evolution over time is affected by parental invest-
ments and peer effects. The distinctive features of our technology is that it allows
for interactions between parents’ behavior and peer effects, in the sense that par-
ents can decide to interfere with the process of peer formation. Parental decisions
crucially hinge on the social environment at the school and at the neighborhood
level. In our empirical application the dynamics of the model corresponds to the
four years of high school (grades 9 to 12). We first describe the model setup in
normal times, and then discuss below how the Covid-19 pandemic temporarily
changes the technologies and constraints faced by parents and children.

During normal times, children meet and interact with friends at school. Even
though students live in different neighborhoods n, the neighborhood is not a
relevant state variable during normal times because peer interactions take place
at the school level. A school s is characterized by a set X s of attending children
and their initial (t = 1) skill distribution.

                                         14
The timing of events in each period is as follows. At the beginning of the period,
the child’s current skill level θi,t is realized. Next, the child forms friendships
with some of the other children of the same age in the same school. The char-
acteristics of these friends (which affect skill formation) are summarized by the
variable θ̄i,t . The parent can now make two choices that affect the evolution of
the child’s skills and peers. First, the parent can undertake (authoritative) par-
enting investments Ii,t that affect the child’s skill formation. Second, the parent
chooses her parenting style, Pi,t ∈ {0, 1}, where Pi,t = 1 means that the parent
behaves in an authoritarian fashion by interfering in the child’s next round of
friendship decisions. At the beginning of the next period, the child’s updated
skill θi,t+1 is realized and the new group of friends with the average skill θ̄i,t+1 is
formed. These events are repeated until the final year of high school. Then, the
child enters adult life with skills θi,T +1 .

3.1   Preferences of Parents and Children

Parents’ and children’s preferences are as in Agostinelli et al. (2020), where we
provide a more detailed discussion of the foundations of the preference struc-
ture. We employ the convention that lowercase variables correspond to the child
and uppercase variables correspond to the parent. The individual state variables
for a family are the child’s skills θi,t and the characteristics of the child’s peers
θ̄i,t . An additional aggregate state variable is the distribution of the children X s
in the school over skills at age t, which matters for friendship formation and peer
effects. However, since in our analysis families do not switch schools, the aggre-
gate state is taken as given by each family.

The parent decides on parenting style (Pi,t and Ii,t ), and the child chooses peers,
i.e., who to be friends with. We express the preferences of parent and child with
value functions that summarize utility in a period after the child’s current skills
and peer group have already been realized so that the decisions concern the evo-
lution of these variables into the next period.

The value function for child i in neighborhood n and school s in period t is given
by:
                   vtn,s (θi,t , θ̄i,t ) = max E u(Fi,t+1 )|θi,t , θ̄i,t .
                                                                      
                                                                                (1)

                                          15
Here u(Fi,t+1 ) captures the utility derived from peer interactions with the set of
friends Fi,t+1 chosen in period t, where Fi,t+1 ⊆ X n,s . The friend set Fi,t+1 de-
termines the next period’s peer quality θ̄i,t+1 . The friendship decisions, in turn,
hinge on both the child’s and the parent’s decisions. The expectation in the value
function reflects the presence of taste shocks affecting the process of friendship
formation. Current peer quality θ̄i,t enters the value function because it affects
the evolution of the child’s skills and the decisions of parents.

The parent’s total utility in period t is given by the value function:

  Vtn,s (θi,t , θ̄i,t ) = max E U (Ii,t , Pi,t , i,t )+
                              

                                                               n,s
                                                                                                      
                Z [λũ(θi,t , Pi,t ) + (1 − λ)u(Fi,t+1 )] + BVt+1  (θi,t+1 , θ̄i,t+1 )|θi,t , θ̄i,t       . (2)

Here U (Ii,t , Pi,t , i,t ) is the parent’s period utility, which depends on parenting
style (Pi,t and Ii,t ), chosen optimally by the parent. Utility also depends on taste
shocks i,t , which ensure a smooth mapping from state variables into decisions.
The parent also cares about the child, where Z is the overall weight attached
to the child’s welfare. Parental concern about children has an altruistic and a
paternalistic component. The altruistic component with weight 1 − λ consists
of the child’s actual period utility u(Fi,t+1 ). The paternalistic component with
weight λ is the parent’s own evaluation of the current actions and outcomes of
the child. The paternalistic concern is focused on the child’s accumulation of
skills θi,t , where we allow for the possibility that the parent’s evaluation of the
child’s skill interacts with parenting style Pi,t . Hence, paternalistic utility enters
as ũ(θi,t , Pi,t ). Note that, at time t, the parent takes the quality of the child’s cur-
rent peers θ̄i,t as given, but the parent can influence future peer formation (and
hence future peer quality θ̄i,t+1 ) through the choice of parenting style Pi,t .

The continuation utility at the end of high school is identical to the child’s con-
tinuation utility, and thus depends on θT +1 :

                                        VTn,s    n,s
                                           +1 = vT +1 (θi,T +1 ),


where the function vTn,s+1 (θT +1 ) (corresponding to the child’s utility as an adult) is
taken as given and assumed to be identical across schools.

                                                    16
3.2   The Technology of Skill Formation

The initial distribution of children’s skills is drawn from the distribution F n,s (θi,1 ).
This initial distribution would generally depend on families’ socio-economic con-
ditions, neighborhood effects, and earlier actions by parents and children, but is
treated as exogenous here.

Subsequently, skills evolve as a function of family inputs and peer influences. For
each child i, next period’s skill θi,t+1 depends on the current stock of skills θi,t , a
summary statistic of the quality of peers θ̄i,t (e.g., the average level of skills),
parental investments Ii,t , and the parent’s choice of whether to interfere in the
child’s choice of peers Pi,t ∈ {0, 1}. The technology of skill formation is:

                               θi,t+1 = s(θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t , Pi,t ).                (3)

The direct effect of parenting style Pi,t in Equation (3) captures the impact of the
quality of the parent-child relationship on skill accumulation.

3.3   Endogenous Peer Selection

We model the formation of friendships as a random utility model. Every period,
each child meets all potential peers X n,s in the school and can try to be friends
with some of them. There is no capacity constraint in the number of friends nor
any decreasing marginal utility to the number friendships. The potential utility
fi,j,t+1 that child i would derive from forming a new friendship with j ∈ X n,s is
given by:
                          fi,j,t+1 = g(θi,t+1 , θj,t+1 , Pi,t , ηi,j,t+1 ).     (4)

Here ηi,j,t+1 is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) taste shock that
guarantees that the probability that a friendship is established is a smooth func-
tion of fundamentals. Note that, in general, ηi,j,t+1 6= ηj,i,t+1 , which captures the
common situation where, say, child i wants to be friends with j but not vice versa.
The utility from forming a friendship depends on both the own skill of child i and
the skill of the potential friend j. This specification allows for homophily bias in




                                                 17
terms of skills.11
The parenting style Pi,t affects how much utility accrues to the child when it
forms friendships with children of different skill levels. Since parents want to
encourage skill formation, we assume that an authoritarian parenting style (Pi,t =
1) lowers the utility of befriending a low-skill peer relative to a high-skill one.
This could be done by rewarding the child in some way for making “desirable”
friends or by meting out punishments for befriending less desirable ones.
Friendships are subject to mutual agreement: a friendship between child i and
child j is formed if and only if

                                 fi,j,t+1 > 0 & fj,i,t+1 > 0,                                (5)

where we normalize the value of not forming a friendship to zero. As already
mentioned, Fi,t+1 ⊆ X n,s denotes the set of friendships involving child i in period
t + 1, i.e., the set of j ∈ X n,s for which Equation (5) is satisfied. The friendship
utility u(Fi,t+1 ) that determines the child’s utility (1) is then:
                                                 X
                                 u(Fi,t+1 ) =              fi,j,t+1 .
                                                j∈Fi,t+1



3.4     Friendship Formation in the First and Last Periods

The value functions (1) and (2) in the first period (corresponding to 9th grade)
depend on the initial quality of peers θ̄i,1 . Rather than taking this state variable
as parametric, we assume that only the initial distribution of skills is given and
that friendships are formed through the endogenous process discussed above.
Given data limitations, we assume that parents cannot affect the initial choice of
friends.12
In the last period T = 4 (corresponding to 12th grade), the parental decision
problem is different because the continuation utility VTn,s
                                                         +1 does not depend on
   11
      The homophily bias is a common tendency of people in social networks to be drawn toward
others who are similar to them in some significant dimension (see e.g., McPherson, Smith-Lovin,
and Cook 2001; Currarini, Jackson, and Pin 2009; Jackson 2010, and, in a context similar to ours,
Agostinelli 2018).
   12
      Formally, we set Pi,t−1 = 0 when evaluating Equation (4) and Equation (5) at time t = 1.

                                                18
the quality of peers. This reflects that children have to form new peer groups
after leaving high school, and at any rate these future peers are not observed in
the Add Health data. Setting Pi,T = 1 does not affect future peers’ skills, and
parenting style will be optimally chosen solely based only on the parents’ taste
shocks.

The functional forms for estimating the model in pre-pandemic times are as in
Agostinelli et al. (2020) and are described in Appendix A.

3.5   Covid-19 in the Model: School Closures and Social Distancing

In this section, we discuss the effect of the Covid pandemic in the model. We
model the Covid shock as affecting parameters in a single period (one year of
school). We assume that parents and children correctly anticipate that things will
return to normal in the following year. Even though the shock is temporary, its ef-
fects will be persistent, through the dynamics of a child’s own skill accumulation
and further ramifications through peer effects and parental responses.

To show where the pandemic-induced parameter changes appear in the model,
we first describe the functional forms for the technology of skill formation and
parental utility.

Technology of Skill Formation. The technology of skill formation (3) takes the
following form:

                  s(θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t , Pi,t = p) = Ap,t × Hp (θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t ),

where Ap,t is a total factor productivity term such that

                        Ap,t = −νt + κt · (ψ0 + ψ1 · t) + ψ2 · p,




                                                  19
and the contributions of peers, initial human capital, and parental time to skill
formation enter in a CES functional form:

  Hp (θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t )
                                                                                α4,p
                                                                                       αα5,p
                           α                 α                               α            4,p
         = α1,p θi,t4,p + (1 − α1,p ) α2,p θ̄i,t3,p + (1 − α2,p ) Ii,t − I¯ 3,p α3,p
                                                                             
                                                                                              . (6)



Consider, first, the total factor productivity term Ap (t). In normal times, νt = 0
and κt = 1. When schools are closed (SC), we have νt = νtSC ≥ 0 and κt = κSC <
1. Relative to the baseline case, productivity falls across the board by a factor
1 − κSC . In addition, there is a grade-specific productivity loss νtSC .

Consider, next, the term Hp (θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t ). In normal times, I¯ = 0, while during
school closures, I¯ = I¯SC > 0. The term I¯SC (which is constant across parents)
captures a minimum time requirement before their parental investment Ii,t be-
comes productive. This term captures the basic time cost required to manage
learning at home during school closures and can be thought of as providing in-
puts usually coming from teachers.

Parental Utility. Parents’ period utility function in Equation (2) takes the form:

                  U (Ii,t , Pi,t , i,t , T ) = δ1 ln(T − Ii,t ) + δ2 Pi,t + i,t (Pi,t ).     (7)

In normal times, T = 1 for all parents. In pandemic times, the time endowment
is given by T = T SC ∈ {τ SC , τ̄ SC }, where τ̄ SC > τ SC . Heterogeneity in the time
endowment during the pandemic captures how the ability to work form home
affects parents’ ability to support their children’s virtual learning.

Effect of School Closures in the Model. We now have all the pieces in place
to summarize how the model captures the effects of school closures and social
distancing on children’s skill acquisition. The following changes are imposed in
the pandemic period:


   1. The switch to remote learning lowers the total factor productivity in the

                                                    20
      technology of skill formation (6). This is captured by two shocks. First, κt =
      κSC < 1 for all grades. Second, motivated by the evidence of disruptive
      effects of losing social ties in Section 2, we allow for a grade-specific shock
      νt . In normal times, νt = 0 for all grades. During school closures, νt =
      νtSC ≥ 0.

    2. When schools are closed, peer interactions are confined to the neighbor-
       hood n rather than the school s. The relevant state variable becomes the
       distribution of peer skills in the neighborhood X n .

    3. The switch to remote learning requires parents to spend time on home
       schooling. We model this as a minimum time requirement I¯ in the skill
       formation technology. The time investment Ii,t is productive only as long
                 ¯ In normal times, I¯ = 0.
       as Ii,t ≥ I.

    4. Finally, the time constraints faced by parents change during the pandemic.
       We capture this change by a shock to the time endowment T in the period
       utility function (7). In particular, we normalize T = 1 for every parent in
       normal times. During pandemic times, we allow the time endowment to be
       heterogeneous across parents (T = TiSC ). This feature captures the different
       situations of parents who have a flexible work arrangement and are able to
       work from home during the pandemic (where can they help their children
       with school) versus those that cannot. Work flexibility status is assumed to
       be an individual state variable rather than a choice.


4    Model Estimation: Normal and Pandemic Times
We build our analysis on Agostinelli et al. (2020), who estimate the baseline
model based on the Add Health data set that follows a set of children through the
high school years in the 1990s. We take the estimated model in Agostinelli et al.
(2020) to represent skill accumulation in regular times. We then use additional
evidence to discipline the shocks occurring during the Covid-19 crisis. For over-
all learning losses and inequality, we use information on changes in children’s
test scores during the crisis discussed in Section 2. For changes in the peer envi-
ronment, we use data on differences in income inequality and peer composition

                                         21
at the school and neighborhood levels. We also use the reduced-form evidence on
the effects of losing peer connections on education from the Add Health data, as
described in Section 2. For parental inputs, we use survey evidence from Adams-
Prassl et al. (2020a) on parental time use during the pandemic.

By combining these data sources, our model accounts for up-to-date evidence
on parental behavior and children’s education during the Covid-19 crisis. Doing
this in the context of a structural model then allows us to take additional steps.
First, we can simulate the model forward to project the impact of current changes
on children’s education by the time they finish high school, taking endogenous
changes in peer effects and parental inputs into account. Second, we can use
the structure of the model to decompose the sources of various changes, such as
peer influences, parental influences, and changes to the productivity of schooling
during school closures. Third, we can use our model for policy analysis.

4.1    Properties of the Estimated Technology of Skill Formation

We start by summarizing the properties of the estimated skill formation technol-
ogy in normal times, since these are key determinants of the effect of the Covid
shock.

The technology of skill formation is allowed to differ across parents adopting an
authoritarian (p = 1) or nonauthoritarian (p = 0) parenting style—formally, all
parameters in Equation (3.5) depend on p. Total factor productivity Ap is lower
when parents are authoritarian (A1 < A0 ), capturing the well-documented dis-
ruptive effects of an authoritarian parenting style on the process of skill forma-
tion. Moreover, for authoritarian parents the estimated elasticities of substitution
in the Hp function (6) are close to unity. Hence, Hp is well-approximated by a
Cobb-Douglas production function.

In contrast, the estimated elasticities in (6) are significantly different from unity
for nonauthoritarian parents. The estimates imply that:

      • Parental investment and peer quality are substitutes: nonauthoritarian par-
        ents spend more time with their children when the peer group is weak.


                                         22
      • Parental investment and own child quality are complements: nonauthori-
        tarian parents invest more time when the child has high skill.

These properties of the technology of skill formation imply that when children
face a deteriorating peer environment, parents who adopt a nonauthoritarian
parenting style will spend more time with their children to offset unfavorable
peer effects.

Concerning the choice between being authoritarian or not, parents are prone to
turn authoritarian when the peer environment worsens and when their child’s
own skill goes down.

4.2    Calibration of Covid Effects in the Model

Our calibration focuses on five model features that capture the Covid shock: (i)
the Covid-related learning shock κSC ; (ii) the disruptive effect of losing social
ties at school ν SC ; (iii) the change in peer quality during the school closure; (iv)
the basic time cost for parents required to manage learning at home during the
pandemic I¯SC ; and (v) parents’ heterogeneous time endowments during the pan-
demic TiSC . We assume that the time endowment during COVID can take two
values TiSC ∈ {τ̄ SC , τ SC }, where τ̄ SC > τ SC , capturing the heterogeneity in work
flexibility status among parents.

We divide the calibration exercise into two steps. In the first step, we externally
calibrate the first three elements (i)-(iii) by matching the measured changes in
learning and social interactions associated with school closures. In the second
step of the calibration, we use the simulated method of moments to estimate the
parameters in (iv)-(v) by targeting moments related to changes in parents’ time
allocation during the pandemic.

We carry out our calibration exercise under the assumption that the Covid shock
lasts for one school year. This scenario matches the likely outcome in those parts
of the United States where schools continue to be closed and are unlikely to re-
open before vaccines are widely available in mid-2021. The Covid shock there-
fore changes model parameters for a single period, and subsequently all parame-
ters return to their previous levels for the remaining periods. The one-time shock

                                          23
still has persistent effects due to changes in the children’s skill accumulation and
peer groups.

Calibrating Changes in Learning and Social Interactions during Covid. We
first externally calibrate three new model’s features capturing Covid-19 in the
model.

   • Covid learning shock κSC : we calibrate the learning shock in our model
     based on the results in Maldonado and De Witte (2020), who use test score
     data from Belgium to estimate the impact of the Covid crisis on learning.
     According to their analysis, the 2020 cohort of children leaving primary
     school (grade 6) experienced a learning loss of approximately 0.2 standard
     deviations compared to the previous cohort. This Covid-induced learning
     loss translates into a learning (TFP) shock of κSC =0.5 in our framework.
     Given that Maldonado and De Witte (2020) consider the impact of school
     closures that lasted only a few months, this learning shock is a conservative
     estimate of the potential impact on learning of the entire pandemic. Still,
     erring on the conservative side is appropriate given that virtual instruction
     may have become more effective over time after the initial adjustment.

   • Disruptive effect of losing social ties at school ν SC : we use the estimated
     effects in Table 2 (Column 1) of losing peers in the transition from 8th grade
     to 9th grade. We divide children’s skills during 9th grade into quartiles
     Q(θ) ∈ {4, 3, 2, 1} corresponding to GPA grades A, B, C, and D, and then
     calibrate the disruptive effect as follows: ν SC = −0.314 + 0.086 · Q(θ).

   • Change peer quality during school closure: we calibrate the change in peer
     quality based on the evidence in Figure 1. We translate these findings in the
     following peer quality in the model during the pandemic: θ̄SC = 0.1802 +
     0.0198 · Income Percentile.

Calibrating Changes in Time Endowments and Allocations. We use two sources
to study the change in parental time inputs due to the outbreak of the pandemic.
The Covid Inequality Project described in Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a) provides



                                        24
information on time spent on active childcare and homeschooling for a repre-
sentative sample of US parents during the pandemic. As these data do not con-
tain information for the pre-pandemic period, we complement them with data
on parental time use drawn from the 2019 American Time Use Survey (2019
ATUS-CPS). For the purpose of comparability, we classify as parental time in-
puts the following activities in ATUS: physical care of children, homework and
other school related activities, homeschooling, reading, playing (including arts,
crafts, and sports), other educational activities, talking and listening to children,
organization of activities, looking after children, attending events, picking up,
dropping off or waiting for/with children, providing medical or other health
care to children.13

We focus on two data moments to characterize the change in parental time inputs
due to the outbreak of the pandemic.14 First, we consider on the average num-
ber of daily hours parents spend with children. Parental time with children has
grown by a factor of about four, from an average of 1.26 daily hours in 2019 to
5.15 daily hours during the pandemic in 2020. Second, we focus on the relation-
ship between family income and parental time inputs.15 Wealthier families report
more parental time inputs than their less-affluent counterparts. The positive re-
lation between family income and parental time inputs is apparent both in 2019
and 2020, but it strengthens with the outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis. The income
effect on parental time inputs is almost four times larger during the pandemic
than in 2019.16
   13
      The analysis of parental time inputs should be interpreted with caution as it relies on the
comparison of two different data sets with time variables that are similar but not identical across
the two data sources.
   14
      For the sake of comparability across data sets, parental time inputs refer to weekdays and to
the sample of working parents.
   15
      Due to the role of work flexibility in shaping parental time inputs during the pandemic,
we rely on additional information provided by the Covid Inequality Project research team to
map parental time with children, family income, and work flexibility. We start with additional
evidence of a positive and significant effect of work flexibility on parental time inputs during
the pandemic. Then, we combined the information on the effect of work flexibility on parental
time inputs with the positive relationship between labor income and work flexibility shown in
Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b) (Figure 14-a). Finally, using the Current Population Survey (CPS) for
2019 we convert labor income into family income and estimate the relationship between family
income and parental time inputs during the Covid-19 crisis.
   16
      For completeness, in 2020 the average effect of a $10,000 change in family income on daily
hours spent by a parent in activities with children amounts to 0.06.

Pandemic)

               The table shows both data and simulated target moments for the cal-
              ibration exercise. The first moment represents the ratio of the mean
              parental investments after and before Covid (2020 vs. 2019). The sec-
              ond moment is the ratio of the income gradients of parental invest-
              ments after and before Covid (2020 vs. 2019).


Table 3 shows the two matched moments for this calibration exercise. The cali-
bration recovers two structural parameters associated with the Covid shock: the
basic time cost required to manage learning at home I¯SC , as well as the time en-
dowment for parents who are able to work from home τ SC . We set τ SC = 1,
that is, parents who cannot work from home have the same time endowment as
before the crisis. In contrast, parents who can work from home have a higher
endowment, τ̄ SC > 1. The underlying assumption is that parents who can work
from home have some ability to work and supervise their children’s learning at
the same time, which increase their effective time endowment (as in Alon et al.
2020).

                                                                               Value

          Time Endowment of Work-from-Home Parents τ̄ SC                          2.42
          The table shows the values of the two calibrated parameters: the basic
         time cost required to manage learning at home (I¯SC ), as well as the time
         endowment for parents who are able to work from home (τ̄ SC ).


Table 4 shows the calibrated parameters. We find that approximately 30 percent
of the pre-Covid time endowment needs to be devoted to the child as a basic
parental time cost of remote learning. Moreover, we find that the effective time
endowment available for childcare for parents who work from home is 2.4 times

                                               26
higher than the endowments of parents with in-person jobs.


5   The Effect of a Pandemic in the Estimated Model
Our estimated model matches well the evidence on children’s skill acquisition,
peer formation, and parental behavior during normal times. It also matches well
the evidence on average learning losses, changes in the peer environment, and
differential time constraints across richer and poorer parents during the Covid-
19 crisis. We can then use the estimated model to assess how school, peers, and
parents contribute to educational inequality during the pandemic. We can also
make forecasts for how human capital accumulation and educational inequality
will evolve during the years following the crisis.

Peer Effects. Consider, first, the effect of school closure on peer effects. Figure 3
shows the change in the average GPA of the chosen friends broken down by the
percentile of family income at the census block level. The average GPA falls for
children from low-income census blocks and increases for children from high-
income blocks. This is the result of several forces. First, during the pandemic
there is a general decay in the learning process because of the impact of school
closures on the productivity of the skill formation technology. Second, the effect
varies greatly across the social ladder. Because the peer environment shifts from
the school to the neighborhood level, socio-economic segregation increases, caus-
ing children living in low-income neighborhoods to have lower-achieving peers
than in normal times. Inequality is further exacerbated by the different extent to
which rich and poor parents can use their own time to compensate for the lack of
in-school instruction. This causes an additional deterioration of the peer environ-
ment in low-income neighborhoods, where fewer parents can work from home
and hence have less time to help their children.

Overall, peer effects deteriorate far more in low-income neighborhoods. In the
richest neighborhoods there is no negative effect at all, partly because interac-
tions move to the neighborhood level where children are more assortatively sorted.
In other words, the children from the most affluent families only meet children
with a similar background who on average are highly academically proficient.

  The figure shows the effect of Covid on the endogenous peer quality by neighborhood
  income. The y-axis displays the change in peer quality after the Covid shock (relative to
  baseline). The x-axis represents the income percentile of the neighborhood where children
  live.


Parental Time Investments. Because in our estimated model parental invest-
ments are a substitute of peer effects (see Section 4.1), parents in more disad-
vantaged areas have an incentive to offset a deteriorating peer environment by
spending more time on supporting their children’s learning. Indeed, Figure A-1
in the Appendix shows that, absent other constraints, it is the parents living in
poor neighborhoods who would increase their time investments the most during
the pandemic. However, the pandemic has an additional effect: it frees time se-
lectively for parents working from home. The flexibility of work arrangements
hinges on a parent’s occupation, which in turn is highly correlated with income.

Figure 4 shows the response of time investments for parents of 9th graders, tak-
ing into account the different time constraints people face. The time investment
increases for all parents, largely because during the pandemic parents must de-
vote a certain number of hours to help their children with school-related tasks.

                   The figure shows the effect of Covid on parental investments by neighborhood income.
                   The y-axis displays the change in parental investments after the Covid shock (relative to
                   baseline). The x-axis represents the income percentile of the neighborhood where children
                   live.


However, the response varies across the socio-economic ladder, with a reverse
pattern relative to the case in which parents face uniform constraints. There are
no significant differences across the poorest 80 percent of neighborhoods. How-
ever, authoritative investments increase steeply in income for the top 20 percent.
In the richest neighborhoods, where many parents can work from home, the re-
sponse of parental investments is 50 percent larger compared to average parents,
and 70 percent larger compared to the poorest parents.

One might have expected poorer parents to make up for the learning gap after
the pandemic is over. However, this turns out not to be the case. The right-hand
panel of Figure 4 shows the response when the children move to 10th grade af-
ter the pandemic is over. Changes in parental investments relative to the pre-
pandemic baseline continue being steeply increasing in income. The reason is
that in our estimated model authoritative investments are a substitute for peer
effects but a complement to children’s own skills. For parents living in the poor-
est neighborhoods, there is a discouragement effect arising from the lower at-
tainment of their own children. In addition, when their children return to school,
they are mixed with better peers. Both changes induce parents living in dis-


                                                                                                                                     29
advantaged neighborhoods to cut the authoritative investments relative to the
pre-pandemic baseline. The situation is different for the children of richer par-
ents. The skills of these children did not suffer a comparable setback during the
school closure. Moreover, when they return to school these children interact with
weaker peers. This induces rich parents living in affluent neighborhoods to in-
crease the authoritative investments relative to the pre-pandemic baseline.

Authoritarian Parenting. Another part of the response generated by the Covid
shock is an increase in authoritarian parenting. In the baseline economy, au-
thoritarian parenting is prevalent among poorer families whose children are on
average less proficient, while it is almost absent among richer families. Figure
5 shows that the pandemic exacerbates this pattern. In both grade 9 (during
Covid) and grade 10 (after Covid), the authoritarian parenting style increases in
poor neighborhoods, while remaining unchanged at a low level in richer neigh-
borhoods. The difference in the response is quantitatively large. In the baseline
economy, about 18 percent of parents adopt an authoritarian parenting style. For
the poorest parents, the model predicts an increase in the prevalence of author-
itarian parenting of 14 percentage points. The effect persists beyond the pan-
demic. To understand why the response is heavily skewed toward poor fam-
ilies, note that authoritarian parenting increases when peer effects deteriorate
and when a child’s own skills are lower. Both factors apply to poor families dur-
ing Covid: their children suffer a learning loss and they are more exposed to the
influence of low-achieving peers. While adopting the authoritarian parenting
style is an individually rational choice in the model, it exerts a negative external-
ity on other disadvantaged children, thereby contributing to wider educational
inequality during the pandemic.

Skill Accumulation. Our analysis thus far has highlighted two main channels
leading to skewed effects against the poor. The first is an increase in sorting
associated with the fact that peer interactions move from the school to the neigh-
borhood level. Because neighborhoods are more segregated than schools, the
peer environment deteriorates for children living in poorer neighborhoods and
improves for those living in richer neighborhoods. The second concerns parent-
ing style and parental investments. In poor neighborhoods, parents become more

authoritarian, while in rich neighborhoods parents spend significantly more time
with their children. This is the rational response to different time constraints and
to the change in the peer environment. The pattern persists after schools reopen.

Figure 6 shows the effect of the Covid shock on the skill accumulation of 9th
graders along with the simulated effect for the same children at the end of the
high school. The initial impact in 9th grade is large and skewed. There are no sig-
nificant effects on the skills of children living in the most affluent neighborhoods—
for the top decile of neighborhoods we even observe a slight improvement rel-
ative to baseline. For children living in rich neighborhoods, the negative effect
of school closures is offset by an increase in parental investments along with an
improvement in the peer environment. For children living in the poorest neigh-
borhoods, the skill loss when entering 10th grade amounts to 0.6 standard de-
viations.17 Many poor working parents cannot respond to the lack of in-class
teaching because they cannot work from home. In addition, parents turn more

     In terms of the GPA scale (which ranges from 1.0 for a straight-D student to 4.0 for a straight-
A student) this change corresponds to a decline of almost half a point; for example, a child who
was a straight-B student before would now be getting a C grade in almost half of the subjects.

  The figure shows the effect of Covid on children’s skills by neighborhood income. The y-
  axis displays the change in children’s skills after the Covid shock (relative to baseline). The
  units are in terms of a standard deviation of skills across children. The x-axis represents the
  income percentile of the neighborhood where children live.


authoritarian, which imposes a negative externality on the local environment that
hits the most disadvantaged children especially hard.

Table 5 shows how each of the three channels (schools, peers, and parents) con-
tributes to rising educational inequality during the pandemic. If we remove the
negative learning shock during the pandemic (i.e., the downward shift in the
skill accumulation technology that represents the direct effect of switching from
in-person to virtual schooling) the income gradient in the impact of the crisis on
education would be reduced by about a third. Leaving the learning shock in
place but removing inequality in time constraints across parents (as if all parents
could work from home, regardless of income), reduces the gradient by slightly
more than 20 percent. The change to the peer environment has the largest im-
pact: if we hold peer influences on learning constant at the pre-crisis level, the
gradient is reduced by more than 60 percent.

                                                                                                      32

We can also use the estimated model to trace out how children’s skills evolve
over the remaining high school years. Over time, the negative effect turns both
smaller and less unequal. The children of richer families suffer some losses be-
cause they interact with weaker peers in school. Conversely, as schools reopen
the children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit from returning to school,
which offers a less socially segregated environment and better peer effects than
does the neighborhood. The long-run losses are about half as large as the short-
run losses (in percentage terms). Nevertheless, the outcome continues to be un-
equal. At the end of high school, the average human capital deficit is about 12
percent, ranging from 5 percent in the most affluent communities to 30 percent in
the poorest ones. These are large long-run differences in a society already trou-
bled by dramatic gaps in opportunities.


6   Policy Implications
The severe learning losses already documented during the Covid-19 pandemic
and the prospect of widening educational inequality call for well-designed poli-
cies that can help offset some of these effects. These policy questions are relevant
not just for the ongoing crisis, but also for preparing for the possibility of another
pandemic in the near future. In terms of consequences for education, keeping
schools open during a pandemic would be desirable, but clearly this has to be
weighed against the need to control the pandemic and to stop infections from
spreading. Still, policymakers face tradeoffs even during a crisis, and an analysis
of the consequences of the pandemic for children’s education can help inform
these tradeoffs.

                                              33
A general point about the impact on children’s education is that the impacts are
hard to undo and can have lifelong consequences for children’s future prospects.
Unlike a business that can be compensated for pandemic-induced losses, there
is no magic trick for making up learning losses incurred during the crisis. This
observation suggests that keeping schools open during the crisis should have
a higher priority than, say, opening bars and restaurants that can be supported
with other means. While this is the approach already taken by a number of coun-
tries, other communities, including many US states, have taken the opposite tack
of prioritizing keeping businesses open over schools.

Beyond fully opening all schools, another option consists of partial openings,
with only a fraction of students attending in-person school to allow for better so-
cial distancing. Our analysis can inform which groups would particularly benefit
from in-person schooling. One potential criterion is whether a child’s parents are
able to work from home and support virtual learning. The children of essential
workers who cannot work from home during the crisis are especially vulnerable.
Some countries have already experimented with providing childcare specifically
for the children of essential workers. But the ability to work from home could be
used as a more general criterion for who should attend in-person schooling.

In terms of peer effects, our empirical results suggest that children who already
have to adjust to a new peer environment because they are switching schools are
especially vulnerable to negative repercussions of reduced peer interactions. This
channel would suggest that students who enter high school (9th grade) should
have a higher priority for in-person schooling compared to 10th or 11th graders
who have already established peer networks in high school. The evidence is sug-
gestive that the same would be true for children transitioning from elementary
to middle school, although our data does not directly speak to this issue.

Beyond the specific structure of our analysis, it is also worth asking whether ad-
ditional schooling could be provided at a later time to make up for some of the
learning losses during the pandemic. School children in the United States and
other countries usually have long summer breaks. It now appears likely that by
the summer of 2021 safe, in-person schooling will be possible again. Extending
school throughout the summer at least for the more vulnerable groups of chil-

                                        34
dren might be the last chance to offset at least some of the substantial learning
losses that are otherwise likely to have lifelong effects. Investing in such pro-
grams would be expensive, but not excessively so relative to support already
given to individuals and businesses. Providing a detailed cost-benefit analy-
sis for such programs should be a high priority for researchers in the coming
months.


7   Conclusions
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about the largest disruption to children’s
learning in many countries in generations. Empirical evidence suggests that
learning losses, once accrued, are difficult to fully offset later on, suggesting that
the current crisis will affect the economic opportunities of today’s children for
decades to come. An additional concern is the impact of the pandemic on educa-
tional inequality. As Horace Mann famously put it, in regular times schools play
a role as a “great equalizer”—they provide a single learning environment and
integrated peer groups for children from different backgrounds. The Covid-19
pandemic puts this role of schools at risk.

This paper builds on the observation that children’s learning depends not just on
schools, but also on inputs provided by their parents and on interactions with
their peers. To assess how a pandemic such as the current one affects overall
learning and educational inequality, all three channels should be taken into ac-
count. We provide such an analysis by using a quantitative model of skill ac-
quisition that explicitly models the behavior of parents, children, and children’s
peers. We calibrate this model to match evidence from the current crisis, and use
the estimated model to shed light on how each factor contributing to children’s
overall success in education is modified during the pandemic.

The main conclusion from our analysis is that each of the channels we consider
contributes to higher educational inequality. Children from poorer families do
relatively worse with virtual compared to regular schooling; they are less likely
to benefit from positive peer spillovers during the crisis; and their parents are less
likely to work from home and hence less likely to be able to provide them with
maximum support for virtual schooling. The end result is that learning gaps

                                         35
grow during the pandemic. Our model also predicts that wider achievement
gaps will persist until children finish high school, suggesting that children’s long-
term prospects are at risk.

Our findings suggest that policy options that could counteract some of these
changes, such as extending in-person schooling for at-risk children throughout
the summer months, should be considered. Our findings also call for more em-
pirical and structural research on the education crisis brought about by the pan-
demic. There is now some direct evidence on changes in children’s learning dur-
ing the pandemic, but for other aspects such as changes to peer effects our analy-
sis relies primarily on extrapolation from earlier evidence. More comprehensive
evidence on how children’s peer environments and parental interactions change
during the pandemic will put researchers and policymakers in a better position
to evaluate possible countermeasures.

A     Functional Forms for Estimation
To estimate the model, we impose functional forms and restrictions that allow us to sum-
marize the model by a list of parameters.

Initial Conditions. The initial distribution of children skills within each school s is
drawn from a log-normal distribution. This specification captures the initial (and to us
unobserved) sorting of families into different schools characterized by different initial
distributions of children’s skills. We define the initial conditions for each school s as
follows:
                                            ln θi,1 ∼ N (µs , (σ s )2 ),                                                (A-1)

where µs and σ s represent the school-specific mean and the standard deviation of the
log-skills.

Similarly, initial conditions at the neighborhood level (which are relevant during the pan-
demic are given by:
                                           ln θi,1 ∼ N (µn , (σ n )2 ),                                                 (A-2)

Once the initial heterogeneity of children’s skills within the school is realized, children
select their initial peer group according to their preferences for friends (Equation (4)). At
this stage, the initial vector of state variables {θi,1 , θ̄i,1 } is determined, and the dynamic
parent-child interaction starts according to the model described above.

Technology of Skill Formation. We parameterize the technology of skill formation with
the following nested CES production function:

                        s(θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t , Pi,t = p) = Ap (t) × Hp (θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t ),

where p ∈ {0, 1}, Ap (t) = exp(ψ0 + ψ1 · t + ψ2 · p), and

                            "                                                                                  # α5,p
                                                              h                                       i α4,p     α4,p
                                     α                                 α                          α    α3,p
    Hp (θi,t , θ̄i,t , Ii,t ) = α1,p θi,t4,p + (1 − α1,p ) α2,p θ̄i,t3,p + (1 − α2,p ) Ii,t3,p                          .


Note that all parameters of the skill formation technology depend on p, namely, whether
the parent chooses an authoritarian parenting style. First, this affects the total factor pro-

                                                         40
ductivity Ap (t), capturing the potential disruptive effect of authoritarian parenting on
the parent-child relationship documented by the developmental psychology literature.
Our estimation below indeed finds that ψ2 < 0, i.e., an authoritarian parenting style de-
presses skill accumulation. Second, parenting style affects the parameters α1,p and α2,p ,
capturing the weights of the different inputs. Our estimation finds that the authoritarian
style attenuates the influence of peers. Third, an authoritarian parenting style also affects
the elasticity-of-substitution parameters α3,p and α4,p and the returns-to-scale parameter
(α5,p ). Here the data suggest the parenting style determines whether peer effects are a
substitute or a complement to other inputs in the production of skills.

Parent’s Preferences. We specify the parent’s period utility in (2) as follows:

                       U (Ii,t , Pi,t , i,t ) = δ1 ln(1 − Ii,t ) + δ2 Pi,t + i,t (Pi,t ),       (A-3)

where δ1 and δ2 define the disutility of authoritative investment and of engaging in an
authoritarian parenting style, respectively, and i,t (Pi,t ) is a taste shock that is conditional
on the parenting style. We assume that this shock follows a type-I extreme value distri-
bution. The paternalistic utility of the parent takes the following form:

                              ũ(θi,t , Ii,t , Pi,t ) = δ3 ln(θi,t ) · (1 + δ4 Pi,t ),            (A-4)

where δ3 captures the level of the parent’s paternalistic enjoyment of the child’s skills,
which may depend on the parenting style through parameter δ4 . The utility derived from
the child’s adult skills θi,T +1 takes the same form as the period-by-period paternalistic
utility from skills:
                                          VTn,s
                                             +1 = δ3 ln (θi,T +1 ) .

In the empirical model, we set Z = B = 1. This is without loss of generality. An increase
in either B or Z is equivalent to a proportional decrease in cost parameters δ1 and δ2 .
Changing B and/or Z would affect the numerical estimates of those parameters without
altering the model fit or the counterfactual experiments.

Child’s Preferences. The (marginal) utility child i earns from being friends with child j
relative to not being friends with j is:


  fi,j,t+1 = γ0 + γ1 ln θi,t+1 + γ2 ln θj,t+1 + γ3 (ln θi,t+1 − ln θj,t+1 )2
                               + γ4 1(θj,t+1 < θi,t+1 ) (ln θi,t+1 − ln θj,t+1 )2 Pi,t + ηi,j,t+1 . (A-5)



                                                        41
Here, ηi,j,t+1 is a random taste shock for being friends with child j, which we assume
to be i.i.d. standard logistic distributed. The terms γ1 ln θi,t+1 and γ2 ln θj,t+1 capture,
respectively, the effect of child i’s and child j’s skills on the utility child i earns from
being friends with child j, where γ1 and γ2 are parameters that will be estimated. The
quadratic term (ln θi,t+1 − ln θj,t+1 )2 captures potential homophily bias in the formation
of friends. A negative coefficient γ3 < 0 would imply that the higher the difference in
skills between the two children, the lower the utility for child i to be friends with child j.

The coefficient γ4 captures the effect of an authoritarian parenting style on the prefer-
ences for child j’s skills. In particular, if γ4 < 0, authoritarian parenting imposes a
penalty whenever the child is friends with a lower-skill peer, where the penalty increases
with the GPA gap between the two children. This formulation captures the idea that
parental intervention (through, e.g., moral suasion, threat of punishment, or incentives)
is designed to improve the quality of the child’s peer selection.

We can now characterize the conditional probability that a friendship link between child
i and child j is formed as:18

                                                                   exp(Γi,j )     exp(Γj,i )
             P r(j ∈ Xi,t+1 |θi,t+1 , Pi,t , θj,t+1 , Pj,t ) =                                 ,       (A-6)
                                                                 1 + exp(Γi,j ) 1 + exp(Γj,i )

The presentation of the parent’s and child’s preferences completes the description of the
effects of parenting style in our model. To summarize, authoritarian parenting has a di-
rect effect on the technology of skill formation given the current child’s skill and peers. In
   18
     The conditional probability in Equation (A-6) might suggest a potential strategic interaction
between parents when deciding about their own parenting style. However, under our assump-
tions, only the parent of the higher-skill child can actively affect the probability in Equation (A-6),
so there is in fact no strategic interaction among parents. Note that in our model parents have an
additional motive to invest in their children’s skills, namely, to give them more opportunities to
condition their children’s choice of peers in the future.

                                                     42
addition, authoritarian parenting affects the process of peer formation by discouraging
the child from choosing low-skill friends. Our estimates below imply that, conditional
on an existing set of friends, an authoritarian parenting style entails productivity losses
in the skill formation technology. The reason some parents still choose to be authoritar-
ian must then lie in the benefits of an improved quality of future peers. It follows from
this argument that in wealthy and homogeneous schools, where most potential friends
are highly skilled and there is little risk that one’s child might associate with low-skill
peers, the cost of an authoritarian parenting style is high while the benefit is small. Con-
versely, parents will tend to be authoritarian in schools where children face a high risk of
exposure to low-skill peers.
