                                        ABSTRACT

       We investigate how the better integration of U.S. banks across states has affected economic
volatility within states. In theory, the link between bank integration and volatility is ambiguous;
integration tends to dampen the impact of bank capital shocks on state activity, but it amplifies the
impact of firm collateral shocks. Empirically, the net effect has been stabilizing as year-to-year

fluctuations in employment growth within states fall as that state's banks become better integrated

(via holding companies) with banks in other states. The magnitudes are large, and the effects are
most pronounced in states with relatively undiversified economies. Consistent with our model, we
find the link between economic growth and bank capital within a state weakens with integration,
whereas the link between growth and housing prices (a possible proxy for firm capital) tends to

increase.

I. Introduction

       The United States once had essentially 50 little banking systems, one per state.

States themselves limited geographic expansion with laws blocking entry by banks

headquartered in other states. Once states began opening their borders to out-of-state

banks in the late 1970s, our many systems began rapidly converging toward a more

national banking system dominated by very large holding companies operating banks in

many states (Map). U.S. banks are not just getting bigger as they consolidate; they are

also getting wider. This other dimension of bank consolidation—geographic

integration—has been largely neglected by researchers, hence our paper.

       Under the segregated regime, the fate of a state and its banks were closely tied; as

went the states, so went the banks. Farm price deflation in the early 1980s bankrupted

many farmers and many farm banks. Falling oil prices in the mid-80s wiped out a lot of

Texans and a lot Texas banks. While the price drops probably precipitated these crises,

our maintained premise is that the associated loss of collateral by firms and the loss of

capital at banks prolonged and deepened crises, and that integration--allowing banks to

enter and exit states--should alter the feedback between real and financial shocks.

       As a starting point for thinking about those effects, we work through an extended

version of the banking model in Holmstrom and Tirole (HT,1997). Bankers in that model

both prevent moral hazard—by monitoring firms—and they commit moral hazard—by

neglecting to monitor. Because of these hazards or frictions, equilibrium investment in

an economy depends on the level of firm collateral and bank capital; these seemingly

backward-looking variables give firms and bankers a stake in future investment

outcomes, and that keeps them honest. Negative shocks to either firm collateral or bank




                                             2
                                                    3


capital cause investment to contract. We add a second (physical) state to the HT model,

then investigate how interstate banking alters the impact of these shocks. Both are still

contractionary, but the magnitudes change: bank capital shocks in state A have a smaller

impact with interstate banking, but the impact of collateral shocks gets bigger. The

derivatives are complicated functions of the frictions in the model, but the logic is

straightforward: a holding company that operating in two states can import capital to state

A if lending opportunities there are still good, but a collateral shock in state A will lead

the holding company to export capital and lending away from that state. In essence,

interstate banking immunizes states against bank capital shocks, but exposes them to

collateral shocks.

        Rather than trying to identify these effects separately (the econometric equivalent

of laser surgery), we first investigate whether the net impact of integration has made state

economies more or less stable.1 Table 1 suggests the answer. As states’ banking systems

integrated, the state-specific variation in employment, variation that can be not be

attributed either to aggregate business cycles or to differences in average growth across

states, fell. Volatility in each state declines by more than one-half, from 2.4% in the late

1970s to 1.1% in the middle 1990s.2 Personal income growth displayed a similar trend;

we include these figures in Panel B to show that there was no trend decline toward lower

  Banks and firms share risk to some extent, so they end up inheriting each other’s problems. The precise
division of those risks (and the bad outcome) would depend in a complicate way on ex ante contracts and
ex post bargaining power. Nor do we consider the welfare benefits of integration, but presumably welfare
rises as volatility falls.

  These figures are the root mean squared error from a regression of state employment growth on a time
effect (to remove aggregate cycles) and a state effect (to remove state differences in mean growth). See
Table 1 for details.

state-specific volatility during the 1960s and 1970s, prior to deregulation-induced bank

integration.3

        Our more detailed results suggest that the (negative) correlation between state

volatility and bank integration is more than coincidence. Using a panel of state-year data

on employment growth over 1976-1994, we link fluctuations in employment growth

around the state-year average to banking integration and find that it fell significantly as

banks became increasingly integrated (via holding companies) with out-of-state banks.

Our panel lets us control for trends in volatility across all states (due to macro changes),

so we can isolate how state-specific changes in integration are linked with state-specific

changes in volatility. Integration may be partly endogenous, so as a precaution, we use

instruments for integration. Controlling for the composition of employment in each state,

and the degree of concentration, strengthens the result. The stabilizing benefits of bank

integration are most pronounced in the state with the least diversified economies—farm

or energy states, for example.

        The net stabilizing we find suggests that the insurance or diversification against

bank capital shocks associated with integration more than offset any amplified effect on

collateral. In fact, we show that the link between bank capital growth and employment

growth within states falls substantially as banks in that state tighten ties to banks in other

states. That is certainly consistent with our conclusion that integration over the last

quarter century has helped stabilize state economic activity by helping banks diversify

against shocks to their own capital.


3
  Personal income growth is a somewhat less reliable measure of economic activity that occurs within a
state than employment growth because it attributes income generated from returns on capital earned
anywhere to individuals living within the state. For this reason, we will focus the remainder of our
empirical analysis on state employment growth.


                                                    4
                                             5


       Although our focus here is on volatility in state economies, integration has

important implications for bank stability and risk as well; operating across many states

should have obvious diversification benefits, although how that plays out in terms of

banks’ risk taking is less obvious (Demsetz and Strahan, 1997).

II. Interstate Banking

       Capital and banking market integration have been considered in a variety of

contexts. The international literature on capital market integration (across nations)

focuses mostly on the risk-sharing benefits of integration; cross-country diversification of

asset portfolios tends to smooth aggregate consumption within nations. We doubt that

banking integration in the U.S. has important risk-sharing effects for savers since they

could always diversify via the stock market. In fact, Asdrubali et al. (1996) find that U.S.

capital markets play a more vital role in income and consumption smoothing across states

than do credit markets. The international literature does find, however, that increased

capital market integration may actually amplify the own-country effect of productivity

shocks as capital is able to flee a country afflicted with a productivity slump. Our model

of interstate banking has some of that flavor.

       Williamson (1989) compares the unit banking system in the U.S. to the more

integrated system in Canada. Using an equilibrium costly monitoring model, he argues

that the cross-province banking there should have stabilized the Canadian banking system

relative to the U.S. unit banking system. His model also implies, somewhat counter-

intuitively, that integration amplifies the impact of aggregate real shocks. Integrated




                                             5
                                                     6


banking systems are less volatile, in other words, but the economy as a whole becomes

more volatile.4

         Our paper, by contrast, investigates how banking integration affects state

volatility (rather than bank or aggregate volatility). Our model introduces a second

physical state to the (unit) banking model in Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) to illustrate

how interstate banking can alter the impact of various shocks and thus affect the

amplitude of the business cycle. As it turns out, interstate banking is not necessarily

stabilizing because some types of shocks get dampened, but other types get amplified.

II.1 The Holmstrom and Tirole Model
         The HT model comprises three players: firms, financial intermediaries, and

investors. All are risk neutral. Firms have access to identical project technologies, but

they differ in their initial capital endowments: A0 . Financial intermediaries (“banks”)

and investors can both lend to firms, but only the banks have monitoring know-how; the

uninformed investors must rely on monitoring by the banks. Investors have access to an

alternative investment opportunity.

         Technology. Firms choose between a good project and either of two bad projects.

The “good” project succeeds with probability p H ; both “bad” projects succeed with

probability p L . A key parameter in the model is the good and bad projects’ relative

likelihood of success: ∆ p = p H − p L > 0 . All of the projects return R per-unit

invested if they are successful and 0 if not. R is public. The two bad projects also




4
  The counterintuitive result that integration amplifies the effect of real shocks seems to stem from the
type of shock considered (a mean preserving increase in the projected technology risk) and on a hard-to-
explain effect of bank diversification on the elasticity of credit demanded by firms. His evidence from the
pre-War period is mixed.

produce differing amounts of private benefits (to the firm): type b bad projects produce a

small private benefit (b); type B bad projects produce a larger private benefit (B > b ).

         Moral Hazard and Monitoring. Moral hazard arises because of the private

benefits from bad investments; firms may choose bad projects over good projects (with

higher expected returns) because the former produce private (i.e., unshared) benefits.

Monitoring by a bank can prevent type B investment, but not type b investment. The

idea here is that monitoring is an effective deterrent against obvious fraud and abuse

(e.g., simply absconding with the borrowed funds), but smaller abuses, (shirking, etc.)

must be remedied through incentive schemes. Monitoring costs are proportional to the

amount invested; if investment is I, monitoring costs = cI. Monitoring is itself a private

activity, in that savers cannot determine if bankers have actually monitored a given firm.

Private monitoring creates a second moral hazard; unless it is worthwhile, bankers will

only pretend to monitor. Banks must invest enough of their own capital in the project to

ensure that they will monitor adequately.5

         Contracts. Firms will always choose a mix of liabilities, borrowing from both the

bank and investors. If the project succeeds, the firm, bank monitor, and uninformed

investors receive Rf, Rm and Ru. These shares are determined endogenously by the

opportunity costs of the three parties. We prefer the intermediation interpretation of

financing structure offered by HT: investors deposit their money with the bank, and

banks fund the firms they monitor with those deposits and the bank’s own capital. The




5
 Project risk is not completely diversifiable so banks need a stake in the project (or else they would shirk
on monitoring).



                                                      7

bank’s ability to attract deposits depends on its own capital (which is needed to assure

uninformed investors that it will monitor firms adequately).6

Equilibrium and Comparative Statics. Given the rates of return required by investors

( γ ) and banks ( β ), a firm with initial assets A0 chooses investment (I), its own capital

contribution (A), and its mix of liabilities to maximize its expected profits:


                   max U ( A0 ) = pH RI − pH Rm − pH Ru + γ ( A0 − A)              subject to:


                           RI ≥ Rf + Rm + Ru              (1)

                            Rf ≥ bI / ∆p                (2)

                            Rm ≥ cI / ∆p                (3)

         The main budget constraint (1) limits the sum of returns to the three parties to the

total return on the investment.7 Eq. (2) is an incentive constraint on the firm; the gain in

expected payments to the firm from choosing the good project cannot be less than the

private benefit from choosing the first bad project. Eq. (3) is an incentive constraint on

the intermediary; the expected gain in return to the bank from forcing the firm to choose

the good project must exceed the cost of monitoring, else the bank will not monitor. At

the optimum, all constraints will bind so Eq. (1)-(3) define the maximum income the

project owner can pledge to uninformed investors: pH ( R − (b + c ) / ∆p ) , i.e. the

maximum payment per unit of investment that can be promised to uninformed investors

without violating incentives.


6
 Under the certification interpretation, uninformed investors invest directly in the firm, but only after the
monitor has taken a large enough financial interest in the firm that the investor can be assured that the firm
will behave diligently.

           All firms choose the same optimal policy per unit of own capital, so an economy-

wide equilibrium is easily found by aggegating across firms. Let Kf be the aggregate

amount of firm capital, Km the aggregate amount of informed capital, and Ku the

aggregate supply of uninformed capital. The first two are fixed, while the third is

determined so that the demand for uninformed capital (the sum of the pledgeable

expected returns of individual firms, discounted by γ ) equals the supply of uninformed

capital. Let γ (Ku ) be the inverse supply function, and let K = Kf + Km + Ku is the total

amount of capital invested. The equilibrium rate of return on uninformed capital is

determined by


(1a)                           γ ( Ku ) = pH K (R − (b + c) / ∆p ) / Ku .

The equilibrium rates of return in informed capital markets is determined by

(3)                                     β = p H c ⋅ K /( Km ⋅ ∆p ) ,
           Holmstrom and Tirole show how shocks to each player’s capital affect the

equilibrium returns to investors ( γ ) and banks ( β ) and the rate of investment by firms. A

decrease in informed capital (a capital “crunch”) decreases γ and increases β . A fall in

firms’ capital (a collateral “squeeze”) decreases γ and decreases β .

           The model can also be used to examine how the two types of shock affect the

availability of external finance and firms’ investment spending. First, there is a direct

contractionary effect due to the fact that the capital crunch and the collateral squeeze lead

to a reduction in the amount of capital that can be invested in the firm by the bank and by

the entrepreneur, respectively. Second, there is an indirect contractionary effect due to the

    The other budget constraints (i,ii,iii and iv HT p. 680) are omitted here for brevity.

fact that the collateral squeeze and the capital crunch reduce the pledgeable income that

can be promised to uninformed debtholders without destroying incentives. The decrease

in the pledgeable income affects negatively firms' ability to attract uninformed capital

(see equation 1a).

II.2 Interstate Banking in the HT Model
       We extend the HT model to interstate banking by simply adding another physical

state. The only subtlety is in the treatment of capital mobility across states under the two

banking regimes (unit and interstate) that we want to compare. For simplicity, we make

the extreme assumption that informed capital is completely immobile across states under

unit banking. In other words, unit banking is equivalent to the single state world HT

considered. At the opposite extreme, we assume that informed capital is completely

mobile across states under interstate banking. These extreme assumptions are not

necessary for our results below, however; we obtain qualitatively similar results so long

as informed capital is relatively less mobile under unit banking. Note that we also

assume that the return on uninformed capital is exogenous and equal across states for

both unit banking and interstate banking. This is consistent with the fact that uninformed

investors have access to a nation-wide securities market regardless of the banking regime.

On this securities market, there is a quasi-unlimited supply of investment opportunities,

with a rate of return independent of state-specific shocks.

       The appendix contains details on the extended model, the equilibrium, and the

comparative statics. In short, the own-state effect of a bank capital shock is diminished

under interstate banking because bank capital can flow from other states that did not

experience a shock. The own-state impact of a firm collateral shock is amplified under

interstate banking because banks in the affected state are free to shift their lending across


                                             10
                                              11

the border to firms with better collateral. Thus, the net effect of integration on volatility

is ambiguous. The following propositions compare the impact of the two shocks under

unit banking and interstate banking.

       Proposition 1: with interstate banking, the negative impact of a bank capital

crunch in state 1 on the amount of uninformed and informed capital invested in that state

is smaller than with unit banking. The intuition for this result is that with interstate

banking, the increase in β caused by the bank capital crunch will attract bank capital

from state 2. This will mitigate the impact of the bank capital crunch on the availability

of external finance in two ways. First, the bank capital inflow leads to a lower decrease in

the amount lent by banks to firms in state 1. Second, because the amount lent by banks to

firms in state 1 decreases less, we also have a smaller reduction in the pledgeable income

that can be promised to uninformed investors by firms in state 1 without breaking

incentives. As a result, we have a smaller reduction in the amount of uninformed capital

that firms in state 1 can attract. With unit banking, these mitigating effects do not take

place, since bank capital cannot move across states.

       Proposition 2: with interstate banking, the negative impact of a collateral squeeze

in state 1 on the amount of uninformed and informed capital invested in that state is

larger than with unit banking. The intuition for this result is that with interstate banking,

the decrease in β following the collateral squeeze will induce bank capital to move to

state 2. Here again, two effects must be distinguished. First, the bank capital flight leads

to a decrease in the amount lent by banks to firms in state 1. Second, because of this

reduction of the amount lent by banks to state 1 firms, we also have a decrease in the

pledgeable income that can be promised to uninformed investors. As a result, there is a



                                              11
                                             12

reduction of the amount of uninformed capital that state 1 firms can attract. With unit

banking, these amplifying effects do not take place, since bank capital cannot move

across states.

        In sum, cross-state banking amplifies the effects of local shocks to entrepreneurial

wealth because bank capital chases the highest return. Capital flows in when collateral is

high and out when it is low. Integration dampens the impact of bank capital supply. This

source of instability becomes less important because entrepreneurs are less dependent on

local sources of funding in an integrated market since bank capital can be imported from

other states.

III. Empirical Strategy and Data

        Identifying exogenous components of the two kinds of financial shocks just

discussed seems like a difficult task. Even with the requisite data, the high correlation

between bank capital and borrower collateral would require strong and perhaps

implausible identifying assumptions. Instead, we first ask a more tractable (but still

useful) question: how has banking integration across states affected overall volatility

within states? Do state-specific business fluctuations get bigger or smaller as banks in

the state become increasingly integrated with banks in other states? We know from the

model that if bank capital shocks are more a source of volatility than collateral shocks,

the net effect of integration should be stabilizing. Integration, in other words, should

reduce volatility. We then offer tentative evidence suggesting that the effects of the two

kinds of financial shocks change in ways consistent with our model, with the caveat that

we have no good instruments to identify the exogenous components of these shocks.

Endogenous Integration?




                                             12
                                                    13

         Reverse causality of two sorts concerns us. First, increased cross-state banking

may indicate merely that states’ economies are becoming more integrated; banks may

simply follow their customers across state lines. If so, and if “real” integration (as

opposed to bank integration) affects business volatility, our results may confuse the

effects of real vs. bank integration. Reverse causality could arise also via banking

“hangovers” (from too much farming, or too much oil), as the associated distress and

volatility may attract bargain-hunting banks from other states. (In fact, we find evidence

of this idea below.) To guard against these or other potential endogeneity problems, we

instrument for integration using an indicator equal to one after a state entered an interstate

banking agreement, and the number of years elapsed since the agreement.

A Brief History of Interstate Banking

         Restrictions on interstate banking in the U.S. date back to the infamous Douglas

Amendment to the 1956 Bank Holding Company (BHC) Act. With that amendment,

banks or holding companies headquartered in one state were prohibited from acquiring

banks in another state unless such acquisitions were permitted by the second state’s

government. No states allowed such transactions in 1956, so the amendment effectively

barred interstate banking. Change began in 1978, when Maine passed a law allowing

entry by out-of-state BHCs if, in return, banks from Maine were allowed to enter those

states (entry meaning the ability to buy incumbent banks). No states reciprocated,

however, so the integration process remained effectively stalled until 1982, when Alaska,

Massachusetts, and New York passed laws similar to Maine’s.8 State deregulation was



8
  As part of the Garn-St Germain Act, federal legislators amended in 1982 the Bank Holding Company Act
to allow failed banks and thrifts to be acquired by any bank holding company, regardless of state laws (see,
e.g., Kane (1996) and Kroszner and Strahan, 1999).


                                                    13
                                                    14

nearly complete by 1992, by which time all states but Hawaii had passed similar laws.9

The process was completed in 1994 with the passage of the Interstate Banking and

Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (IBBEA) that mandated complete interstate banking as

of 1997 and gave states the option to permit interstate branching.10

        This roughly 15-year history provides an excellent opportunity to test how the

resulting integration has affected volatility. Luckily for us, the states did not deregulate

all at once, and the subsequent integration across states proceeded at different rates (Chart

1). The staggered deregulatory events provide us with both cross-sectional and time

series variation with which to identify the effects of integration; also, the deregulatory

events themselves provide a good instrument for integration.11

Measuring Integration and Volatility

        Our measure of bank integration equals the share of total bank assets in a state

that are owned by bank holding companies that also hold banking assets in other states

(or other countries). To illustrate, if a state had one stand-alone bank and one affiliated

bank of equal size, integration in that state would equal ½.

        We associate volatility with the year-to-year deviations (from average) in

measures of business activity. Starting with the annual growth rate of series x for state i

in year t, we first subtract off the mean growth rate in x for state i over time.

“Demeaning” by the state average removes long-run growth differences across states.

We then subtract off the mean growth rate of series x across states in year t. Demeaning

9
 State-level deregulation of restrictions on branching also occurred widely during the second half of the
1970s and during all of the 1980s.
10
   IBBEA permitted states to opt out of interstate branching, but only Texas and Montana chose to do so.
Other states, however, protected their banks by forcing entrants to buy their way into the market.

by the national average each year helps control for aggregate business fluctuations. We

are left with the state-specific shock to our measure of business activity. Our volatility

measures will be the square of the resulting deviations, the log of the squared deviations,

or the absolute value of these deviations.

        Our sample starts in 1976, a few years before interstate deregulation began. We

end the sample in 1994, the year that the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching

Efficiency Act became law. Riegle-Neal allowed bank holding companies to acquire

banks in any state after September 29, 1995 and permitted mergers between banks in

different states as of June 1, 1997, which effectively allowed nationwide branch

networks. The law also gave states the right to adopt an earlier starting date for interstate

bank mergers, however, and about half of the states did so (Spong, 2000). In response,

banks such as NationsBank consolidated operations from several other states into its

primary North Carolina bank (NationBank NC N.A.), leading to an increase of this

bank’s (and hence North Carolina’s) assets from $31 billion in 1994 to $79 billion in

1995. Because of this cross state consolidation, we lose the ability to measure bank

assets meaningfully at the state level after 1994.

        Our two measures of business activity are the annual growth rates of total state

employment and small-firm employment, where we define a small firm as one with fewer

than 20 employees.12 Numbers on total employment are available from 1976-94 from the

Census Bureau. Small-firm employment comes from the Bureau’s County Business


11
   While we focus here on interstate banking, Jayaratne and Strahan (1996) report that state-level growth
accelerated following branching deregulation; Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) show that branching
deregulation led to improved efficiency in banking.
12
   The employment data from the County Business Patterns are stratified by establishment size rather than
firm size. Thus, there may be some misclassifications in cases of large firms operating many small-scale
plants.


                                                   15

Patterns series, starting in 1977 (1978 after converting to growth rates).13 In principle,

the more bank-dependent firms in the latter category may be more affected by banking

integration. To isolate the volatility that is specific to these small firms, we remove the

state-specific shock to employment that is common to both small and large firms before

constructing our measure of volatility. We do this by regressing small-firm employment

growth on the state effect (removes the long-run state mean growth rate), the time effect

(removes the current aggregate business cycle) and the growth rate in employment at

large firms (those with more than 250 employees). We use the residuals from this

regression to construct our measures of small-firm volatility.14

         Table 2 reports summary statistics for the integration and volatility measures.

The average share of integrated bank assets over the full sample of state-years was 0.34,

rising from under 0.1 in the 1970s to about 0.6 by the mid-1990s. Overall employment

grew 2.3 percent per year on average over the sample of state-years. The squared

deviation of employment growth from its mean averaged 0.03 percent, and, perhaps more

interpretable, the absolute deviation of employment growth averaged 1.3 percent. Small-

firm employment growth was slightly more volatile than overall employment growth,

averaging 0.04 percent for squared deviations and 1.4 percent for absolute deviations.

We also control for the share of employment in a given state/year in each of eight broad

industrial categories (one-digit SIC), along with the sum of squared shares in these


13
   The small firm and total employment data are not directly comparable as the former excludes self-
employed individuals, employees of private households, railroad employees, agricultural production
employees, and most government employees. We drop Delaware and South Dakota as these two states’
banking sectors are dominated by credit card banks due to their liberal usury laws. See Jayaratne and
Strahan, 1999 for details.
14
   The justification for this procedure is a pragmatic one. We are comfortable that firms with fewer than 20
employees ought to be viewed as “small”, and that firms with more than 250 are “large.” In between lies a
difficult-to-categorize group of firms. We therefore leave these firms out in trying to isolate the shock to
employment growth at small firms.

groups as a measure of the diversification across industries in a given state/year. (We call

the diversification index the “labor share HHI”.) The summary statistics for these

variables are also reported in Table 2.

IV. Results

IV.1 State Business Volatility Declines with Bank Integration

        In view of the ambiguous theoretical relationship between integration and

volatility, we choose to report a variety of relationships. We have two growth measures

(total employment and small-firm employment) and three ways to define volatility. Also,

for each dependent variable, we report both a fixed effects regression (OLS) and an

instrumental variable (IV) estimate. IV seems advisable because the pace of integration

may itself depend on volatility as noted earlier. We use two instruments in the first stage:

an indicator variable equal to zero before a state entered an interstate banking agreement

with other states and one after; and a continuous variable equal to zero before interstate

banking, and equal to the log of the number of years that have elapsed since a state

entered an interstate banking arrangement with other states.15

        As noted, employment volatility will obviously depend on labor force

composition, so we also control for the share of employment in each one-digit SIC sector

(manufacturing, services, etc.) and employment concentration (the sum of the squared

shares). In all specifications we control for the year and state, so the resulting fixed effect

estimates reveal how increased integration within a state in a given year is related to

volatility within the same state and year.16


15
   In the first stage models, both instruments have very strong explanatory power. These regressions are
available on request.
16
   But other important changes occurred during the 1980s, such as rapid adoption of sophisticated financial
models and increased use of securitization, not just for residential mortgages but also for consumer loans,


                                                    17
                                                       18

         Tables 3 and 4 report the estimated coefficients for the twelve specifications. For

overall employment growth, all of the estimates are negative, and five of the six are

statistically significant at the five percent level (Table 3). Integration has had, on net, a

stabilizing influence on state business volatility. In addition, the IV coefficient estimates

are much larger than the corresponding OLS estimates in all three cases, implying that

the stabilizing influence of integration is larger (if less precisely estimated) when we use

deregulation variables to parcel out the endogenous variation in integration.17 In fact, the

portion of integration that is orthogonal to deregulation is strongly positively related to

employment volatility (not reported), perhaps because out-of-state banking companies

opportunistically enter new states when banks in those states are facing difficulties

associated with an economic downturn. (Remember: banks enter new states by buying

their way in.)18

         We do not find evidence in these regressions that diversification across industries,

measured by the labor share HHI index, reduces volatility, as one might expect. There is

very little time-series variation in this index, however, making it difficult to measure its

coefficient in the fixed effects models. If we drop the state fixed effects and estimate the



commercial real estate loans and even commercial and industrial loans (Mishkin and Strahan, 1999). These
new technologies seem to have increased the efficient scale in banking and may be responsible, in part, for
greater integration. For an exhaustive review of the causes and consequences of financial consolidation in
the U.S., see Berger, Demsetz and Strahan (1999).
17
   One might object that interstate banking deregulation itself may be determined, in part, by the volatility
of a state’s business cycle. For example, perhaps political pressure for opening a state’s banking system to
out-of-state competition intensifies during economic downturns (when volatility is high). To rule out the
possibility that endogenous deregulation drives our IV results, we have also estimated the model after
dropping the 3 years just prior to deregulation as well as the year of deregulation itself. In these
specifications, the coefficient increases in magnitude (i.e. becomes more negative), and its statistical
significance increases across all three measures of volatility.
18
   We have also estimated this model with a full set of interactions between the year effects and the state-
level industry employment share variables in order to allow the impact of the aggregate shock to depend on
a state’s industry mix. These results give very similar results for the effect of integration on volatility (i.e.
negative and statistically significant).


                                                       18
                                               19

model with random effects instead, the labor share HHI does enter the regression with a

positive and statistically significant coefficient (not reported).

        We also find declines in employment growth volatility at small firms, where we

expect the influence of banking, and hence banking integration, to be most important

(Table 4). Here, we find a statistically significant effect of banking integration on

volatility in five of our six specifications. Moreover, the declines in volatility are larger

for the small firms than for overall employment in all of the IV specifications.

        The IV estimates for both overall and small-firm employment imply a substantial

stabilizing benefit from integrating bank assets across states. The share of integrated

bank assets rose from around 10 percent in 1976 to around 60 percent in 1994; the

reduced form model (not reported) suggests that about one-half of this increase can be

attributed to interstate deregulation, or an increase in integration of 25 percent. Based on

the coefficient from the IV model, this 25 percent increase in integrated bank assets

reduced the absolute deviation of overall state employment growth by 0.9 percent (Table

3, column 6). This decline is very large relative to the mean (1.3 percent) and standard

deviation (1.2 percent) over the whole sample. For small-firm employment, the IV

estimate suggests that the 25 percent increase in integrated bank assets led to a drop in

volatility of 1 percent (Table 4, column 6).

        Table 5 reports two slightly more complex models in which we test whether

banking integration reduces volatility more in states relatively reliant on one or a few

sectors. A well-diversified state will tend to have well-diversified (unit) banks too, thus

reducing the potential stabilizing effect of integration. In contrast, in a state that relies

heavily on one or two sectors, banks constrained to operating only there will also rely on




                                               19
                                                    20

those one or two sectors. Integrating these banks ought to have greater benefits, and the

results suggest that it has.

        We provide two tests of this idea. First, we interact the labor-share HHI with our

integration variable (Panel A); second, we estimate the basic model separately for large

states (states with above-median income in 1975) and small states (Panel B). Both

approaches support the idea that banking integration stabilizes small and specialized

economies more than large and well-diversified economies. First, we estimate a negative

and significant coefficient on the interaction of HHI with integration, meaning that the

effect of banking integration is more negative in states with more specialized economies

(Panel A).19 Second, we estimate a negative effect of banking integration for small states

using all three measures of volatility, and the coefficient is statistically significant in two

of the three specifications. In contrast, the measured effect of banking integration on

volatility is never significant.

IV.2 How Integration Changes the Correlation between Bank Capital, Collateral and

Business Activity

        We have not directly tested our model of integration due to the difficult task of

identifying exogenous and independent shocks to bank capital and to entrepreneurs’

collateral.20 In this section, however, we offer tests of how the correlation between

proxies for these shocks changes with integration, without attempting to find the

exogenous portion of each shock. We estimate how local employment growth and

19
   Note, however, that the interaction term between the labor share HHI and banking integration loses
statistical significance when we drop Wyoming, the state with the most specialized economy in the U.S.
20
   Peek and Rosengren (2000) used the downturn in Japan to identify an exogenous decline in bank capital.
They show that when Japanese banks faced financial difficulties in the 1990s, they reduced their lending in
California, leading to a decline in credit availability there. This finding is consistent with our model,




                                                    20
                                                      21

lending growth correlate with local bank capital growth (a proxy for bank capital shocks)

and with growth in local housing prices (a proxy for collateral shocks), and how these

correlations change in response to banking integration. To be precise, we regress state

employment growth and aggregate growth of total bank loans and business loans on 1)

the growth in aggregate capital held at all banks in the state, and 2) the growth in Freddie

Mac’s index of housing prices in the state 3) our measure of banking integration, and 4)

interactions between integration and the two local “shocks”. We also include state and

year fixed effects. According to our interstate version of the HT model, the correlation

between bank capital growth and economic activity (employment growth and loan

growth) ought to decline with integration, implying a negative coefficient on the

interaction term. The correlation between housing prices and activity ought to increase

with integration, implying a positive interaction term.21

         The results support these implications (Table 6). As states integrate, local bank

capital becomes much less correlated with all four measures of local economic activity.22

For example, prior to banking integration, a one standard deviation decline in bank

capital growth (a decline of 8.5 percent) was associated with a reduction in employment

growth of 1.2 percent (Panel A, column 1). Based on the mean level of banking

integration in 1994 (0.6), the end of our sample, the model suggests that a one standard


although it emphasizes the downside of integration. While integration insulates an economy from shocks
to its own banks, it simultaneously exposes an economy to banking shocks from the outside.
21
   Other researchers have investigated how holding company affiliation, a concept related to our measure
of banking integration, affects bank lending properties; Houston and James (1997) find that lending by
affiliated banks is less sensitive to the bank’s own cash flow, suggesting the holding company operates as
an internal capital market. Ashcraft (2001) finds that lending by affiliated banks is less sensitive to changes
in monetary policy (i.e., changes in the federal funds rate) than is lending by unaffiliated banks.
22
   We have also estimated these regressions using IV, where an instrument for integration is constructed
from an indicator variable equal to one after state-level interstate banking reform and a continuous variable
equal to the log of the number of years elapsed since reform. These results are similar to those reported in
Table 6.


                                                      21
                                                22

deviation decline in bank capital growth would be associated with a decline in

employment of just 0.3 percent. We find similar effects of banking integration on

employment growth at small firms; bank capital matters a lot prior to integration but

much less after, although both the direct effect of capital, as well as the interaction term,

are larger in magnitude for small-firm employment growth.

        Table 6 also shows that the link between bank capital and loan growth declined

sharply after banking integration. Prior to integration, a standard deviation increase in

bank capital was associated with an increase in business lending of 5.7 percent and an

increase in total lending of 5.5 percent. With integration that prevailed in 1994, the same

increase in local bank capital was associated with just a 3.1 percent increase in business

lending and a 4.2 percent increase in total loans.

        The correlation between housing prices (collateral) and local economic

conditions, again consistent with our model, strengthens following integration. For

example, a standard deviation decrease in housing prices (0.078) would be associated

with a decline in employment of 0.4 percent (0.4 percent for small firms) before

integration, but a decline of 0.7 percent (0.9 percent for small firms) after integration.

The same decline in housing prices would be associated with a drop in business lending

of 1.1 percent (1.0 percent for total lending) before integration, but a decline of 4.1

percent (2.8 percent for total lending) after integration. These changes are all statistically

significant at the 5 percent level or better.

IV.3. Bank Integration vs. Real Integration?

        The negative correlation between bank integration and state business volatility is

probably not an artifact of increased real integration—increased trade that is—among the




                                                22
                                              23

states. It is not obvious that trade among states even stabilizes production within states,

as trade may reflect specialized production and specialization is the opposite of

diversification. Even if we suppose that trade has stabilizing effect, the change in bank

integration and trade integration are not correlated during our sample period (Chart 2).

The only qualifier necessary here relates to our proxy for “real” or trade integration: out-

of-state shipments for each state expressed as a percentage of total shipments. These data

are collected as part of the Commodity Flow Surveys conducted by the Department of

Transportation and the Department of Commerce. While these are the best, most

frequently available data, they are not perfect. The 1977 survey covered only

manufacturers, while the 1993 included wholesale trade firms as well. Wholesalers tend

to ship shorter distances (Hillberry and Hummel, 2002), so their inclusion in the 1993

tends to lower look lower relative to 1977. As long as that survey bias is not correlated

with the change in bank integration over the 1977 to 1993, our point in Chart 2 goes

through: the negative correlation we have found between bank integration and business

volatility does not reflect trade integration in disguise.

V. Conclusions

        The U.S. used to have 50 little banking systems, one in every state. Now, some

15 years after states opened their borders to other states’ banks, we have a much more

integrated banking system, with holding companies operating banks across many states.

As a theoretical matter, the impact of cross-state banking on business volatility is

ambiguous because integration immunizes borrowers from shocks to their own banks but

exposes them to shocks to their own wealth. We find that the fragmented business of U.S

banking before the mid-1980s was, in all likelihood, a source of state business volatility.




                                              23

On net, integration was stabilizing; employment growth fluctuations in a state diminished

as its banks commingled with other states’ banks. State business cycles have become

smaller, in other words, but more alike. As the French say: the more things change, the

more they stay the same.

        Our findings here also bear on developments in Europe, where banks are just

starting to integrate across nations.23 Applied there, our findings imply that further bank

integration abroad should lead to smaller, but more correlated, national business cycles.

More generally, our results may inform thinking about worldwide financial integration,

since “globalization” is just a scaled-up version of the national integration studied here.

        Better bank integration may also be a factor behind the decline in aggregate U.S.

economic volatility over the past twenty years noted by McConnell and Perez-Quiros

(2000) and Blanchard and Simon (2001).24 The possible mechanisms that have been

proposed to explain this stabilization trend are 1) better inventory management (Kahn,

McConnell and Perez-Quiros, 2002), 2) reduced volatility of sales with non-convexities

in the production process (Ramey and Vine, 2001), 3) better monetary policy (Blanchard

and Simon, 2001), and 5), better luck (Stock and Watson, 2001). Our results suggest

adding better finance to the list. In fact, access to finance is a crucial piece of the

inventory-management hypothesis. According to this view, firms began smoothing

production better in the post-1984 period by building up inventories during period of low




23
   Garcia Blandon (2001) finds that foreign bank entry in Europe is impeded by various non-regulatory
barriers, such as cultural distance between consumers, while export levels and the presence of
multinationals are positively correlated with foreign bank penetration.
24
   McConnell and Quiros (2002) mark the break in volatility at 1984. Blanchard and Simon argue that
volatility has trended down since the 1950s, with the 1970s being an aberration to that trend.

sales growth, and vice versa during period of high sales growth.25 These counter-cyclical

movements in inventories are only possible if firms can finance inventory investment

when cash flow (sales) is low. In other words, counter-cyclical inventory investment is

only possible if external finance is available and affordable during downturns. Exploring

the link between improved bank finance and aggregate decline in aggregate volatility

would make an interesting paper.




25
   In fact, the correlation between sales growth and inventory investment went from positive to negative
after 1984 (Kahn, et al, 2002).

Appendix: Comparative statics in the HT Model with unit and interstate

banking


Equilibrium with unit banking

       With unit banking and assuming γ exogenous, equilibrium on the uninformed
capital market in state 1 obtains when

(1a)                     pH ( Kf1 + Km1 + Ku1u )(R − (b + c) / ∆p ) = γ ⋅ Ku1u .

       Solving this equation, we obtain the equilibrium quantity of uninformed capital
attracted by firms in state 1

                                  p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )( Kf1 + Km1 )
(2a)                     Ku1u =                                        .
                                      p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ



       Equilibrium in state 2 can be defined in a similar way.

Equilibrium with interstate banking

       Interstate banking changes the equilibrium in the following way. Assuming
capital can move freely across states, the shares π 1 and (1- π 1 ) of aggregate informed
capital Km1+Km2 invested in each state adjust endogenously to equalize the return on
informed capital across states. When the share of informed capital invested in each state
is endogenous, equilibrium in the uninformed capital market under interstate banking is
defined by

(3a)         p H (Kf1 + π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) + Ku1i )(R − (b + c ) / ∆p ) = γ ⋅ Ku1i


(4a)      p H (Kf 2 + (1 − π 1 )( Km1 + Km2 ) + Ku2i )(R − (b + c ) / ∆p ) = γ ⋅ Ku 2i .

The equilibrium rate of return on the bank capital market is:



                                                    28
(5a)           β = p H ⋅ c ⋅ K1 / (∆p ⋅ π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) ) = p H ⋅ c ⋅ K 2 / (∆p(1 − π 1 )( Km1 + Km2 ) ) .

With K1 = Kf1 + π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) + Ku1i and K 2 = Kf 2 + (1 − π 1 )( Km1 + Km2 ) + Ku2i

         Solving the system of equations defined by (3a)-(5a), we obtain the equilibrium
quantities attracted by firms in each state and the share of informed capital invested in
each state:

                    p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )( Kf1 + Kf 2 + Km1 + Km2 ) Kf1
(6a)      Ku1i =
                          ( p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ )( Kf1 + Kf 2 )

                    p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )( Kf1 + Kf 2 + Km1 + Km2 ) Kf 2
(7a)      Ku2i =
                          ( p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ )( Kf1 + Kf 2 )

                     Kf1
(8a)      π1 =
                  Kf1 + Kf 2


Comparative statics

To get the intuition for proposition 1 and 2, we compare the equilibrium condition for
unit banking (1a) and for interstate banking in state 1 (3a), after substitution of π 1 by its
reduced-form solution in (8a). The equilibrium conditions for the two regimes are plotted
in figure 1.

Let’s first consider the bank capital crunch. With unit banking, the reduction in the
pledgeable income is proportional to the reduction of Km1 . With interstate banking, by
contrast, the reduction in the pledgeable income is less than proportional to the reduction
of Km1 , since π 1 is smaller than unity. Graphically, this implies a smaller reduction of
the intercept of the curve representing the pledgeable income. Because the pledgeable
income decreases less with interstate banking following a bank capital crunch, we also
have a smaller reduction in the amount of uninformed capital that can be attracted by
firms.




                                                     29
A similar mechanism is at work for the collateral squeeze. With unit banking, the
reduction in pledgeable income is proportional to the reduction of Kf1 . With interstate
banking, by contrast, the reduction in pledgeable income is more than proportional to the
reduction of Kf1 , because the share of informed capital π 1 invested in state 1 – which
depends on the amount of capital available in the two states – also decreases following a
decrease of Kf1 . Graphically, this implies a larger reduction of the intercept of the curve
representing the pledgeable income. Because the pledgeable income decreases more with
interstate banking following a collateral squeeze, we also have a larger reduction in the
amount of uninformed capital that can be attracted by firms.

Capital crunch: proof of proposition 1

For the unit banking case, the derivative of Ku1 with respect to Km1 is

Impact on the availability of uninformed capital

For the unit banking case, the derivative of Ku1 with respect to Km1 is


∂Ku1u    p H ( − b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )
      =
∂Km1 p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ


∂Ku1u ∂Km1 is positive. The numerator is positive because the positiveness of the
payment promised to uninformed investors, Rm = K ( R − (b + c) / ∆p ) > 0 , implies
p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p ) > 0 . The denominator is also positive, because the return on
uninformed capital γ has to be larger than the pledgeable expected income
pH ( R − (b + c ) / ∆p ) to have an interior solution for Ku1 (see HT, p. 682). For the
interstate banking case, the derivative of Ku1 with respect to Km1 is


∂Ku1i      pH ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )
      =
∂Km1 2( p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ )

under the above mentioned symmetry conditions.




                                             30
∂Ku1u ∂Km1 is twice as large as ∂Ku1i ∂Km1 .■

Impact on the availability of informed capital

For the unit banking case, the derivative of Km1 with respect to itself is equal to unity.

For the interstate banking case, the quantity of informed capital attracted by firms in state
                                                Kf1
1 is equal to π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) with π 1 =              . The derivative of this quantity with
                                             Kf1 + Kf 2

respect to Km1 is

∂π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) 1
                  =
        ∂Km1        2

under the above mentioned symmetry conditions.

∂π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) / ∂Km1 is smaller than unity. ■



Collateral squeeze: proof of proposition 2

Impact on the availability of uninformed capital

For the unit banking case, the derivative of Ku1 with respect to Kf 1 is


∂Ku1u       p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )
      =                                .
∂Kf1    p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ


∂Ku1u ∂Kf 1 is positive.

For the interstate banking case, the derivative of Ku1 with respect to Kf 1 is equal to


∂Ku1i p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p )( 2 Kf1 + Km1 )
     =
∂Kf1 2 Kf1 ( p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ )




                                                31
under the symmetry conditions Kf 1 = Kf 2 and Km1 = Km2 at initial values. ∂Ku1i ∂Kf 1
is positive.

The difference between the two derivatives is

∂Ku2i ∂Ku2u    p H ( −b − c + R ⋅ ∆p ) Km1
     −      =
∂Kf1 ∂Kf1 2 Kf1 ( p H (b + c − R ⋅ ∆p ) + ∆p ⋅ γ )


∂Ku 2i ∂Kf 1 − ∂Ku 2u ∂Kf 1 is positive. ■

Impact on the availability of uninformed capital

For the unit banking case, the derivative of Km1 with respect to Kf1 is equal to zero,
since Km1 is independent of Kf1 .

For the interstate banking case, the quantity of informed capital attracted by firms in state
                                                Kf1
1 is equal to π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) with π 1 =              . The derivative of this quantity with
                                             Kf1 + Kf 2

respect to Kf1 is

∂π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) Km1
                  =
        ∂Kf1        2 Kf1

under the above mentioned symmetry conditions.

∂π 1 ( Km1 + Km2 ) / ∂Km1 is larger than zero. ■

*Integration equals the share of banking assets in a state owned by a multi-state bank holding company.
We do not have the data to construct this integration measure before 1976 or after 1994. (The figure for the
1994-1997 period is the average for 1994.) Note that interstate integration continued after 1994 due to
cross-state consolidation such as the merger of Bank of America (a west coast bank holding company) and
NationsBank (an southeast bank holding company) in 1998. We cannot construct our measure of
integration after 1994 because bank holding companies began to consolidate their holding of bank assets
across state lines in 1995. We believe that the integration figure would be higher than 59% during the last
years in this table, however.

Bank Integration, Business Volatility and State Labor Share: Summary Statistics
Statistics calculated using state-year observations. Integration is the share of bank assets in each state held
by banks with offices out of the state. Growth is the annual growth in employment or small firm
employment, where a firm is defined as small if it has fewer than 20 employees. Volatility is based on the
deviation in the annual growth of total employment or small firm employment (firms with fewer than 20
employees) from state and national means. To construct this deviation for small firms, we also control for
employment growth at large firms (firms with more than 250 employees).

Small Firm Employment Growth Volatility Declines As Bank Integration Increases
Regressions are based on a panel of state-year observations. Integration is the share of bank assets in each
state held by banks with offices out of the state. Growth is the annual growth in employment at small
establishments, defined as establishments with fewer than 20 employees. Volatility is based on the
deviation in the annual growth of total employment from state and national means; in addition, we control
for growth at large establishments (defined as those with more than 250 employees). Coefficients
estimated with state-year observations over 1976-94 (standard errors in parenthesis). All models include
state and year fixed effects.

Table 5, Panel B
Employment Growth Volatility Falls with Banking Integration,
Particularly in Small States

Regressions are based on a panel of state-year observations. Integration is the share of bank assets in each
state held by banks with offices out of the state. Growth is the annual growth in employment. Volatility is
based on the deviation in the annual growth of total employment from state and national means.
Coefficients estimated with state-year observations over 1976-94 (standard errors in parenthesis). All
models include state and year fixed effects and are estimated with IV.

How Integration affects the Correlation between Employment, Loan Growth and Changes in Bank
Capital and Housing Prices
Reported are fixed effects regression coefficients and standards errors (in parenthesis) estimated for panel
of 48 states and D.C. The dependent variable and associated estimation periods are indicated at the top of
each column. Bank capital growth is the annual growth rate of total capital held by all banks headquartered
in each state. Growth in housing prices is the ratio of Freddic Mac’s index of housing prices in the
state/year (fourth quarter) to that housing price index in the preceding year. Integration is the share of bank
assets in each state held by banks with offices out of the state. All regressions include state and year fixed
effects (not reported).
