                      Self—Selection and Pareto Efficient Taxation



                                        ABSTRACT



     This    paper analyzes the set of Pareto efficient tax structures.

The formulation of the problem as one of self—selection not only shows

more clearly the similarity between this problem and a number of other

problems (such as optimal pricing of a monopolist) which have recently

been the subject of extensive research, but also allow the derivation

of a number of new results. We establish Ci) under fairly weak conditions,

randomization of tax structures is desirable; (ii) if different individuals

are not perfect substitutes for one another, then the general equilibrium

effects ——   until   now largely ignored in the literatures ——        of   changes

in the tax structure may be dominant in determining the optimal tax

structure; in particular if relative wages of high ability and low ability
individuals depends on the relative supplies of labor, the optimal tax
structure entails a negative marginal tax rate on the high ability individuals,
and a positive marginal tax rate on the low ability individuals (the

magnitude of which depends on the elasticity of substitution); (iii) if

individuals differ in their preferences, Pareto efficient taxation may

entail negative marginal tax rates for high incomes; while (iv) if wage

income is stochastic, the marginal tax rate at the upper end may be 100%.

    Our analysis thus makes clear that the main qualitative properties

of the optimal tax structure to which earlier studies called attention

are not robust to these attempts to make the theory more realistic.

      It is now widely recognized that the optimal ihcome tax
problem is one of a number of closely related problems, in

which one agent (a government, a monopolist, a firm) attempts
to differentiate among ("screen") a set of other agents. It
does this by means of a self-selection mechanism; it confronts
individuals with a set of choices, and individuals with different

characteristics (preferences) make different selections from the set.
Their choices thus reveal information about their characteristics.

Although the discrimination may be perfect, it will not in general
be costless; to induce self selection requires structuring the
choice set in such a way that the conventional efficiency conditiOns

(e.g. equating marginal rates of substitution) will not be satisifed.
The problem of the government (the monoplist, the employer, etc.)
is to design "efficient" self—selection mechanisms; to put it some-
what loosely, they seek to structure the choice sets to reveal the
desired information at the minimum cost.

     In this paper, we explicitly formulate the optimal tax problem
as one of self—selection. This formulation not only allows us to
see more clearly the similarity between this problem and a numbe
of other problems which have recently been the subject of extensive
research, but it also allows us to generalize the conventional

results, enabling us to show clearly that most of the qualitative
properties that have been derived are properties not only of
utilitarian tax structures (of the kind studied, e.g. by Mirrlees
(1971) and Atkinson—Stiglitz (1980)), but of any pareto optimal

tax structure.
     Moreover, we are able to provide a new, and we think clearer,
interpretation of the result (Atkinson—Stiglitz (1976)) that, with
an optimal income tax, if the utility function is separable between
leisure and consumption commodities, then there should be no
commodity taxes. For self—selection mechanisms to work, the
individuals must have different indifference curves. We show that
the condition of separability is equivalent to the condition that
the indifference curves (between say commodity 1 and commodity 2)
are identical.
     Finally, and perhaps most important, we are able to derive

four new results.
     First, in the literature on self—selection, it has been shown
that randomization may serve as an effective screening device

(Stiglitz (1981)). High ability individuals always have the
alternative of working less and enjoying a lower level of
consumption. The tax structure must be designed in such a way
that the high abi1ty individuals are willing to "disclose" their
ability by earning higher incomes. If high ability individuals are
more risk averse than low ability individuals (in a sense to be
defined precisely in the paper), by randomizing the taxes imposed
on low ability individuals, the high—leisure, low consumption
                                —3—



alternative of pretending to be a low ability individual
becomes less attractive. The low ability individuals, if
they are risk averse, obviously are worse off as a result of the
randomization; but the ability to differentiate between high and
low ability more easily may allow us to lower the average tax
rate imposed on the low ability individuals; and under certain
circumstances, we can lower it enough that they are no worse off.
Perhaps more striking, we can show that we can do this at the same

time as raising total revenue. Thus, this analysis extends the
earlier results of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and Stiglitz (1976)
on the desirability of random taxation to show that randomization
may characterize a much less restricted set of tax structures (the
earlier analyses were essentially confined to linear tax structures)
      The second major set of new results relate to extending optimal
income taxation to a simple general equilibrium model.1 Most of the
earlier literature limited itself to analyzing the optimal income
tax under the assumption that individual's relative productivities
were exogenously determined. The individuals were perfect substitutes
for one another. Recently, F. Allen (1980) has shown that such
results may be very misleading. He examined optimal linear income
taxes, in a two class model in which the relative marginal productiv—
ities were endogenous. He showed, in particular that the general
equilibrium effects may be dominant in determining the design of the
tax structure. Indeed, under not implausible conditions, it was even
possible for the optimal tax structure to be regressive, even for a
Rawlsian social welfare objective function.

1   After this paper was finished, my attention was called to Section 3
    of N. Stern's paper, "Optimum Taxation with Errors in Administration,"
    where some similar results are derived.
                                 —4—



This paper extends his results by considering optimal tax structures

(i.e. we do not restrict ourselves to linear tax structures) in

the simplest possible general equilibrium
                                            model. We obtain two

important results:

a)   The widely discussed property of the optimal tax structure, that
the most able individual faces a zero marginal tax rate, is only true

if all individuals are perfect substitutes; in all other cases,
the highest ability individual should face a negative marginal tax

rate.

b) The tax which should be imposed on the less able individual
depends on the elasticity of substitution, which determines the
general equilibrium effects of taxation.


        Previous analyses of optimal income tax structures have made

two further restrictive assumptions (besides that all individuals

are perfect substitutes in production) :    (a) They have assumed
that the preferences of all individuals are identical; and (b)

They have assumed that income is a deterministic function of
effort. We do not provide here a general characterization of the
optimal tax structure with heterogenous individuals and stochastic
income. But what we can show, using slight modifications of our
basic two group model, is that either modification necessitates
serious alteration in the optimal tax structure: in one case,

we show that at the upper end, the marginal tax rate is 100% (rather
tha zero, as in the conventional story) while in the other case,
we' show that, at the upper end, the marginal rate is negatives

1. Pareto Efficient Taxation: The Simplest Case
     We begin our discussion with the simplest possible model,
in which there are only two individuals, differing in their
ability but having the same utility function (this, as we shall
see, is not critical for most of the results we shall obtain). The


ith individual faces a before tax wage (output per hour) of WI

and thus, in the absence of taxation, his budget constraint is

simply

(i) •c1 =        wL1
where
         C = the       ith individual's consumption
              =   number of hours worked by ith individual
(L1 could equally well be interpreted as being effort.) Neither

w nor L are separately                 observable, but


(2) Y = w1L            ,    ith   individual's income


is observable. The ith individual receives utility from consuming

goods, and disutility from work:


()      u    =
                  u1(c1,L)
        Ui                 Ui
        i>o L1<°
                                               —6—



His indifference curve is depicted in Figure 1. Assume now the
government imposes a tax as a function of income

()        T.    =
                     T(Y

The LHS         is   the individual's gin1 te of substitution. The RHS
is the after-tax marginal return to                           an extra hour.


The optimal consumption-leisure of the individual before and after
taxes is depicted in Figures la and                  lb.
           In my                   self- zelection problern, it turns out to be useful

to write the utility function in terms of the observable variables:
Here we assume Y1 and T (and hence C1) are the only observables.
Hence, we write'


()        U =
                    u'(c, ri_Ti) = '(C,Y;w1)
     For simplicity, we shall often write U1 (C1,Y1) rather than t11(CiY±;w.).
                                 —7—

Even if all individuals have the same utility of consumption

and-leisure functions, their utility of consumption-and-before tax

income   will differ. It is      clear that individuals of higher ability

have,    in Figure 2, flatter indifference curves: the increase in
consumption that is required.for a given increase in before tax
income is smaller, Since to obtain the given increase in before

tax income they need to forego much less leisure.
         Formulated that way, we can see that income will provide us

with a basis of self-selection: individuals with              different
abilities will     make different choices of (c,y) pairs, since they
                                                                          -

have different indifference curves.
         The problem of the government concerned          with pareto

efficiency is now easily stated. It wishes to maximize the

utility of say, individual 2, subject to (a) individual 1 having
at least a given level of utility and (b) the constraint that it
raises a given amount of revenue. It does this by offering two
(C,Y) packages, one of which will be chosen by the first group,
the other of which will be chosen by the second group.

is    just the dual to the standard problem of a monopolist

attempting to differentiate among his customers                        (Stiglitz

1977, 19f31)

There, the problem was to maximize profits (corresponding to R
here), subject to utility constraints on each of the two                        types
of individuals and subject to the self selection constraint. The
Lagrangian which we form to analyze the two problems is identical:


             = 2(c2,y2)                       + X2((c2,2)          -               )

                                                                       f(c1,y1)
                   + X1(1(c1,y1) -         (c2,y2)) +        v[(Y1-c1)N1    +
                                                                                (y2-c2)N2-R   J



The   first order conditions for this problem are straightforward:

        It   i   easy to see that, under our assumptions concerning the
relative slopes of the indifference curves, there are two possible
regimes:
                                     X1=O,X2>0
 or
                                     X2 = 0,      A1
 i.e.    only one of the two self—selection constraints is binding

provided that, with first best taxation, the equilibrium is not

fully revealing.        (In the two group case, it is possible that the

first best tax structure is fully revealing, as illustrated Ifl

figure 3a.)        Moreover, it is also easy to show that                        > 0 ,   the
constraint on the utility level of the low ability individuals is

binding.

        The "normal" case, on which most of the literature has

    focused, is that where A1 = 0,                        A2 > 0. With a utilitarian

    objective function (p = 1) and separable utility functions it
    can, for instance, be shown that this is the only possibility.
    (See Arnott, Hosios, and Stiglitz (1980).) But more generally,
    the possibility that A3 > 0, A2 = 0                        cannot be ruled out.

Since, by assumption,              c1 >   a2, it therefore follows that

          a2 <   a1       <   1,




               We immediately see that the marinal tax rate facedy the
less able individual will be positive; it will be greater the smaller

the proportion of low ability individuals there are in the population.

2.2 The Optimal Tax Structure with        =   0,    A2 >    0.

     Exactly the same kinds of arguments as used in Section 2.1

can be employed to establish that if      =    0,    X2 >    0, the
marginal tax rate faced by the less able individual is zero,
while the marginal tax rate faced by the more able individual
is negative: self—selection requires that they work more than
they would in a non-distortionary situation.        (See Figure 3d.)

For the rest of this paper, we focus our attention on th
"normalt' case with A1 > 0,   A2 =   0.

3. Desirability of Randomization
     In this section we derive conditions under which randomization
of taxes is desirable. As in other sithilar screening (or principal

agent) problems, the objective of randomization is to increase
the effectiveness of screening (or, to put it another way, to
reduce the welfare loss associated with the self—selection constraints.)
It is easy to establish that it is never

desirable to randornize the tax Imposed on the upper income
individual. Randomizing the tax (the after tax income) enjoyed
by the low ability group lowers their welfare, at the same average
tax rate. To leave them at the same level of expected utility, we
must, at each Y , increase the mean consumption, as illustrated in
figure 4a .   At   the sane time, the maximum mean consumption we can
provide to the low ability group, for each level of Y    ,   and still
have the upper ability group choose the point {Y    ,
                                                        C}    ,   is   raised
by a sufficient amount that the "separating" contract entails a
higher Y and a higher average level of consumption, C1; and it
is possible that C1 has increased by less than Y1, so that the
government revenue is increased.

     The derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions
for the desirability of a small amount of randomization are
straightforward.

Thus, the desirability of random taxation depends on three

and                                  -




        (3)    the differences in the marginal rates of substitution
               (the slopes of the indifference curves) in {C , Y}space)
        We have described the conditions under which a particular

(but natural) kind of randomization is desirable:                              the individual

is told his tax liability only after he has filled in his tax

form; he makes his work decision, of course, before he knows
                    -C

what his tax will be.
        The government could, however, have randomized its tax

schedules prior to the individual undertaking his work decision.
That is, we allow the individual either to declare that he is
among the more able, in which case we confront him iiih a tax

schedule which generates {c,Y}                         ;   or   to declare that he is

among the less able, in which case he will be confronted with,
say, one of two tax schedules, leading                          to {c,Y} or
                                                       Y         must be chosen so that
{C* ,y* }                {C,y,C*,Yt*,C             ,        }



the more able person has a higher utility i'h {c,Y}                                 than

his expected utility with the random tax scheme.
        To see what conditions are required for randomization, let

        The    first constraint is the self—selection constraint,                          the

second assures us that EU1                   is not lowered         by randomization.

randomization is desirable.




  For randomization to be desirable, all we require is that there
  exists some {p,h,n} satisfying (28) such that ri > h. n and h
  do not need to be positive.
                                                —15 C—




     We   have thus shown how, under fairly weak conditions,
randomization may enable a weakening of the self—selection
constraints, and therefore an increase in expected utility.
There is a quite different kind of randomization noted in
Stiglitz (1976) where the maximized value of (expected) utility
is observed to be a (locally) convex function of revenue
raised when distortionary taxation is imposed. In that case,
utilitarianism requires randomization (ex post horizontal
inequity). A s±nple example illustrating this, in the present
context, is provided by the family of indifference curves of

Figure 4b .             This has two critical properties. For each
level of Y(work) ,            there    is a saturation level of consumption

C(Y). For {C,Y} smaller.than the critical level, indifference
curves are straight lines; for convenience, we assume they have

a slope of .
     Thus the optimal tax problem can be represented as
            max U = (C2 - Y2)N2 + C1N1

                                                       +

which can be either positive or negative.1 Thus, rather than
raising i      from the population in a "uniform" manner, it pays
to divide the population arbitrarily into two groups, raising
    — A   from one-half, R +        A   from the other. (See Figure 4c.)

    Although in our example, we have let utility be a linear
    (rather than strictly concave) function of C and Y, for levels
    below saturation, it is clear the result would still obtain provided
    U is not too concave.

3. Utilitarian Optimal Taxes
        The previous sections focused on pareto efficient taxation.
Mjst of •the earlier optimal tax literature assumed a much stronger
objective function: the government wished to maximize a utilitari-an

objective function, i.e. in the present context, it

               max U1N1 +   U2N2

subject to the self selection and revenue constraints. If we
write down the Lagrangean expression for this problem, it is
identical to (13), with one minor difference: while in (13), we

specified U11and       , the   lagrange multiplier associated with the

constraint, was one of the variables to be determined in the
analysis; here it is as if we knew the value of the Lagrange

multiplier       =          we can solve for the value of

which   corresponds to this particular value of the Lagrange
multiplier.    With this slight modification, all of the earlier

analysis becomes directly applicable to this problem.
                               —17—



     Alternatively, suppose we represent consumers by a monotone
(but not necessarily concave) transform of the utility function U

          U      (U1)

Then, in the first order conditions describing the optimal tax
structure, wherever we had U , we now have and 'U ;        similarly
for the second individual. Since '      can take on any value, it is
clea± that the first order conditions describing pareto efficient
taxation and those that describe utilitarian tax structure for

appropriately specified     function are equivalent.

5. Desirability of differentiation. We noted in our introduction
that there was a cost to differentiating among different individuals.
It is not obvious, in the context of say a utilitarian social welfare
function, that it is always desirable to differentiate, or to dif f--

entiate completely if there are many groups. In the general screening
literature, equilibria in which individuals who are different are

treated the same (and in which, as a result, we cannot infer
perfectly the characteristics of the individuals) are referred to

as pooling equilibria (Rothschild-Stiglitz, 1976), and it can be
shown that pooling equilibria can arise in a variety of circumstances
(Stiglitz, 1977). Here, we show (i) if there are two groups, and the
more productive group indifference curves have a flatter slope
in {C, Y} space then differentiation is desirable;
(ii) If more prcccfictive groups have a slope in [c, Y} space,
which at some point,'is the same as that of the less productive
group, then a pooling equilibrium cannot be ruled out;
                                        —18—



 (iii) if there are three or more groups, then pooling among a
 subset may well be desirable;

 (iv) if individuals differ in tastes as well as abilities, then

complete differentiation will not, in general, be possible.
         To see the first result, we have depicted in figure 5 a
case with two groups of individuals "pooled" together. Any
point in the shaded area generates a separating equilibrium, and
any point along the lower envelope of 1 and 2's indifference
curves separates and leaves the welfare of each group unaffected.
We need to see what happens to government revenue. If


(31a) lay!
                 <    1,
       j2
by offering a point such as A , we "separate" and we increase
government revenue, since the required increase in 2s consurntpion
is less than the increase in his output (before tax income)

Similarly, if

a point such as B separates, and the reduction in consumption -
exceeds the reduction in income: government revenue thus increases.
Since

then,



      (i   i   >



Thus, there always exists a separating contract which increases
revenue and leaves utilities of all individuals unchanged.        The

only pareto efficient tax structures entail separation.
        The same argument obviously holds if the less productive
individuals always have flatter indifference curves, but this is

not a particularly plausible assumption.

        In figure       6 we illustrate what happens if the different

types of individuals have different preferences, such that the
more able 's indifference curve is not always flatter than the
less ables. The point P is a point of tangency. The shaded
area represents the set of         C, Y    points which together with

p ,   separate the two groups. But clearly, it is possible that

               =   1.

        Figure 7 illustrates the result that with three or more

groups, partial pooling may be dsirable. Two points are offered,

E1 and E2 , with               chosen by the high ability group, E2 ,

bythe      two low ability groups. The points which separate 2 and 3
are those which lie between their indifference curves; but those

which separate 2 and 3 and also separate 1 are only those
which lie between 2 and 3 below l's indifference curve (the
heavily shaded area). Thus if at E2

(32a)                     <


clearly, we cannot keep everyone on their same indifference
curves and increase government revenue.
        This does not, of course, prove that the {E1, E2} con-
stitutes an efficient tax structure. It may be possible to
raise revenue and increase l's utility level. If            ( 32a) is

true, it is clear that


             <   1   .


(32b) 2
Hence, by offering a new set of points {E ,          E}    as illustrated

in the figure, we can separate, and increase government revenue
collected from individuals of type 2.          At the same time, we

decrease the revenue collected from individuals of the highest

ability (recall, that efficient taxation implies that there is
no distortionary taxation on the highest ability individual)
and hence as we increase their welfare, we decrease work

and increase             consumption; government
revenue collected from him thus must decrease .           Whether total
revenue collected increases or decreases thus depends on the
relative number of individuals of the two types.
                                     —21--




     The same argument obviously holds if we have a continuum
of types. This analysis provides some insights into the results
noted earlier (Nirrlees ( 1971)         ,    Stiglitz   (1977))that the
optimal tax structure with a continuum of individuals will not,
in general, be differentiable; there may well be "kinks" in
the optimal tax structure, which have the property that individuals
with different marginal rates of substitution obtain exactly
the same income (Figure 8)

     Finally, figure 9b           illustrates a case with 2 ability
groups and 2 taste groups. In each ability group, there are
some individuals who dislike working more than others; their
indifferenCe curves (in {c, )               or   Ic, L} space) are accordingly
steeper. The important characteristic is that in {C, Y} space,
the indifference curves of a high ability lazy worker and a low
ability industrious worker may intersect several times, as illus-
trated in figure           9a. This may occur even with an additive
utility function7

     U = u(C)       -   v(L)
       =   u(C) -       v(Y/w)

The marginal rate of substitution at any point is just

                        Vt/Wi=V/W2
Thus, the higher ability individual could have a greater
aversion to work, but if the elasticity of his marginal aversion
to work function is less than that of the low ability individual,
for high enough income levels, his indifference curve is
flatter than the low ability individual's indifference curve.
At low levels of income, however, his indifference curve is
steeper. This is the case illustrated in the figure 9a
The converse case is also clearly possible.
       The result that their indifference curves could intersect
several times (or indeed may completely coincide) should not
be surprising. An individual who has a productivity of k
times another, and an individua.l who receives "disutility"

of work of 1/k times another are indistinguishable on the
basis of their indifference curves                    in c,Y} space; it is
their indifference curves in {c,} space which provide the
basis of the self—selection mechanism. Note that there may
be other ways of differentiating among these individuals ; forinstance,
these individuals do have different levels of consumption of
leisure. Although we cannot observe their levels of consumption
of leisure, we may be able to observe their purchases of goods

 which are complements of leisure, and use this as a basis
 of inferring their ability. We shall examine this possibility
 in greater detail in Section     6

      In Figure 9b we show a tax structure with three points,

 E1, E2 and E3; the high ability low aversion to work individuals
 choose E1; the high ability, high aversion to work individuals
 choose       the two low ability individuals choose   E3. Note
 that there is no point near     which separates (i.e. lies
 between the two indifference curves) and also lies below the
 indifference curve of the high ability—high aversion to work
individual.

     This, of course, is not particularly disturbing. One might
want to argue that one does not wish to differentiate between
individuals on the basis of their attitudes towards work, only
on their ability (but see Section 8     below). But now, let us
reinterpret our result: let U2 be the low ability low
aversion to work individual, and U be the high ability high
aversion to work individual.    (From our previous calculations
we know tint this is a possible configuration.) Then our

analysis shows that efficient taxation may entail treating
hich ability lazy individuals identically to low ability hard
                       1
working individuals.


 Although we have only established the inability to differentiate
 locally, it is easy to extend the arguments to show that the
 equilibrium may be Pareto efficient. Let {CA,YA} and {cB,YB}
 represent the two nearest points to      which separate. Then
          c3-c <_A
 we require    A

                    -



 Moreover, if types 3 and 4 are small relative to types 1 and 2, any
 movement within the shaded area which improves U2's welfare (and
 possibly, as a consequence U1's welfare) will decrease revenue.

and subject to the self selection constraints. These require
a little care to write down                     correctly.     The government, it must

be recalled, does not observe                            and      .   It   only observes

         and          .     If   the wage of the ith group is w ,              if    the first

group has an income of                          and labor input of L, ,        for   the

second group to have the same income as the first group requires

As   the    ratio of L2/L1 increases, w2/w1 decreases O the                            required
labor input of L2 , to obtain the same income one                               has, increases.
Thus we can rewrite the self selection constraints as

 7.    Simultaneous Taxation of Income ax-id Commodities

         Our earlier discussion suggested that if not only income,
but also the levels of consumption of various commodities were

observable, that the government might want to base its taxation
on these variables as well. Consumption of luxuries is often
thought to be a better indicator of well-being than reported
income.

         This problem can easily be analyzed within our framework.
We now let the individual's utility be a function of a whole
vector of consumption goods,
            =
                (C11, C12, C1,.... F

            =
                     22 C23,....

For simplicity, we assume that each of the goods costs one unit
of    labor to produce (this is just a choice of units). The
individual is given a choice of two "packages"; now each   involves
a vector of consumption goods and a level of before tax income.
The government must choose these packages to maximize individual
l's utility, subject to inividul 2 obtaining a given level of
utility, and subject to the self section and budget constraints,.,
                                                         —29—



If we now interpret C as a vector, the Lagrangian for this
problem is identical to that formulated earlier, except for the
term in the budget constraint. The government budget constraint
is now written

          =
              NY       +
                           N2Y2
                                     -
                                         (N1C1
                                                     +



where     e is the unit vector, i.e.

         R>N1Y1+Y2N2—E(Ciji
                          N ÷C2j2
                                N)

         If we now         differentiate             the Lagrangian with respect to

        wc obtain                          -

     Thus, whether commodity j should be taxed or subà sized relative
     to k depends on whether the more able individuals marginal rate of
     substitution of          j     for k exceeds that of the low ability person
     or conversely.
               Thus the result that, with separability, only an income tax is
     needed, which seemed so surprising at first becomes entirely

     understandable        within this frame;ork; if the two groups of individuals
     have the same indifference curves. (locally) between two commodities
     we cannot use the differential taxation as a basis of
     separation; if they differ, we can. By taxing the commodity which
     the   more able individual values more highly, we make the lower
     ability individuals "package" less attractive to him. We thus can
     tax the higher ability individal more heavily without having him trying
to   "disguise" himself as a low ability person.
               Earlier, we remarked that, since the analysis of the
     discriminating monopolist and of pareto efficient taxation were

     formally identical, we could borrow results originally obtained in
     one area to the other. Here, we note that the result we have just
     obtained has immediate implications for the pricing policy of a
     niultiproduct monopolist. If the individual's utility function is

     separable     in "other goods" and the goods purchased from the
     monopolist,       then the monopolist shOuld charge relative prices of

     the different commodities equal to the marginal production cost
                                  —32—


if not, he should tax or subsidize one commodity relative to a
second depending on whether the individuals who consume more have

higher or lower marginal rate of substitution between the two

commodities.

       It should also be obvious that although we have limited our

attention to the problem of optimal taxation, the analysis of the
optimal pricing of a public utility is precisely the same problem.
The only distinction that arises, at least in some cases, is that
the public utility is allowed to control only a subset of the prices.
If we assume that the other prices are fixed, then we can form a.

Hicksian composite commodity (called "other goods"), and the
determination of the total outlay (charge for the package of

services supplied by the public utility) determines the amount
of the "other good" available to the individual. With these
modificationS, (interpreting "Y" now as "other goods") the earlier

analysis is directly applicable to the problem at hand.

       Moreover, if relative prices of the "other goods" are no.t

fixed, then we can modify the analysis of the multi—product case,
in the same way that we earlier modified our analysis of the
single product case, with parallel results: now, even for the
most able individual, we will wish to impose distortionary taxation

(charge distort ionary prices).

8.      Pareto Efficient Taxation with Different Tastes
        The framework we have developed allows us to obtain some

simple but interesting results on the structure of Pareto
efficient taxation with two or more taste groups. As in

Section     5   ,   we assume that some individuals are more

averse to work than others. For simplicity, we assume there

are three groups, two high ability types and a single low

ability type.
        We wish to establish two propositions: First, it is
always Pareto efficient to differentiate on the basis of

tastes; we should never "pool" the two high ability groups
together. Secondly, Pareto efficient taxation often will
entail regressivity, i.e. marginal rates which are less than

zero.

        To see the first proposition, turn to Figure 10 where
we have assumed that the government offers two contracts, E1
and E2, with both of the high ability groups at E1. By the
same kind of reasoning used earlier, clearly any point between
the two indifference curves separates, and either


                      1


or

                      >1


 (or both); hence there exist points which increase government

revenue and leave every individual's utility unaffected. Indeed,
the efficient set of contracts for this example denoted {E1 E,
                                —34—



and
      E2}   are such that the marginal rate paidby both of the
two upper ability groups are zero. We have drawn through E
a line with a slope of 45°. In the figure, it passes below
E. This implies that the increment in consumption in moving
fromE to E exceeds the increment in income, i.e. the mean
marginal rate over that interval is negative; on average,
there is regressive taxation at the upper end of the distribution.


9.     Stochastic Income
       This result on the structure of the optimal income tax
should not, however, be taken too seriously', a second modification,
allowing income to be stochastic, leads to just the opposite
result: marginal rates of 100%.
       Assume that an individual who works L receives an income of

             (w..+A)L
               1

with probability .5 and

            (w. -
               1
                    A)L

with probability .5. Assume, moreover, that he cannot insure
the risk. As before, w and L are unobservable; only income
is observable. The optimal tax structure now requires a
specification of ttwO packages" as before, but the packages
are   more complicated. By deciding on a level of effort (L)
the individual is essentially "purchasing" a lottery. The
structure of th tax structure deterrhnes the pay-off S Ofl the

lottery. Thus, the government will specify four consumption—income

points, denoted {ClL,YlL,C1H,YlH,C2LY2LC2HIY2H} with the
property that (expected) government income is maximized,
subject to the self—selection constraints and subject to the
(expected) utility constraints for each of the twc types. The
problem is thus formally identical to that discussed earlier.

        We will, accordingly, not set up the problem, but we
sha11 borrow one result from our earlier analysis: the
"package" offered to the high ability individuals must be
"non—distortionary," i.e. it maximizes the revenue obtained
from him subject to the utility constraint. But if the
individual is risk averse, this implies that he must receive
the same consumption in the two states. But this, in turn,
implies that the marginal tax rate on incomes in excess of

2L (letting individual 2 be the high ability individual) is
100%.

        Obviously, this two group model is much over simplified;

just as in the conventional optimal income tax problem we
could infer the individual's ability by his income, so too
here; although we hazqe introduced a stochastic element to

his income, we can still infer perfectly the individua1s
ability from his income. More generally, however, we will
not be able to distinguish perfectly a low ability lucky individual
from a high ability unlucky individual. This makes the design
of the optimal tax structure with stochastic income far more
difficult (and more interesting) than the deterministic case
upon which the analysis has thus far focused. But so long as
                                   —36—




there   are a finite number of groups (or even a continuum,

with a finite range) if the probability distribution of
incomes is bounded,the highest incomes observed will always

be received by th c highest ability individuals who are
lucky. Optimal taxation entails 100% taxation at the

margin.
        The unreasonableness of this result arises from the
assumption that individuals have no control over the stochastic
elements in their income stream. Such a tax structure would

have peculiar (and probably undesirable) incentive effects
with respect to risk taking.

10. Concluding Coments
        This paper has examined the structure of Pareto efficient

taxation. Although we ha.re greatly simplified the standard
treatment, by focusing on the special case where there are
only two groups, ehave been able to obtain
considerable insight into the determii.ants of the optimal structure
of taxation. In particular, we have been able to show that
assumptions that were previously taken to be merely simplifying
turn out to play a central role in determining the optimal
                                               -


structure of taxatipn:

        (a)   if tax rates can be randomized, they should be under

              a variety of circumstances

        (b)   if different individuals are not perfect substitutes
                                                                        ——
              for one another, then the general equilibrium effects

              until   now ignored in the literature -—   of   changes

              in   the tax structure are dominant in determining
                              —37--




          the optimal tax structure; the marginal rate
          on the most able individual is always negative;
          on the less able individuals it is

          positive.
     (c) if different individuals have different attitudes
          towards leisure, the tax structure, in the upper

          tail, may be regressive;
     (d) if income is stochastic, the limiting marginal tax
          rate may be 100%.

     The main qualitative properties of earlier analyses
o f the optimal tax structure are clearly not robust to these
attempts to make the theory more "realistic." On the one
hand, our analysis makes it clear that Uzeis much more to
be done. Until a more general theory is developed, none
of the qualitative results can be accepted as a bai of
policy. On the other hand, the extreme sensitivity of the
results to the changes in the assumptions suggests that
results which are sufficiently clear and robust to form the

basis of policy may weilnot be• obtained; rather the objective
of future research should perhaps be the clarification of
the important dimensions of choice (risk taking, effort, etc.)
affected by the income tax structure and the trade-off s which

emerge.
