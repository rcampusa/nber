Can Subsidiaries of Foreign Banks Contribute to the Stability of the Forex Market
in Emerging Economies? A Look at Some Evidence from the Mexican Financial System

                                               ABSTRACT

        Over the last decade, the ownership of the banking sector in Latin America has changed hands
from local shareholders to large foreign banks from Spain and the United States. It is also a fact that the
foreign exchange market in these countries has been segmented through various kinds of restrictions,
because the central bank is unable to function as a lender of last resort in a currency other than its own.
The standing issue is whether in practice, a parent bank effectively takes the role of such lender of last
resort in supporting its subsidiaries overseas. If that were to be the case, the question is if having a
significant participation of foreign subsidiaries is a necessary condition for lifting such restrictions. The
data on the compliance of domestic and foreign banks with the dollar reserve requirements in Mexico is
used to try to address this question. The answer is a qualified yes. When there are weak domestic banks,
it seems that subsidiaries of foreign banks have a better access to funding in foreign exchange, specially
in times of stress. However, when compared with strong domestic banks, the evidence suggests that these
local entities can do as well or even better than the foreign subsidiaries.

Introduction
    The financial markets in most countries of Latin America, perhaps with
the exception of Brazil, Uruguay and Panama, share two distinctive features.
On the one hand, over the last decade the ownership of the banking sector has
changed hands from local shareholders to large foreign banks, mostly from
Spain and the United States. On the other hand, their foreign exchange
market remain segmented to the extent that there are still various forms of
exchange controls, ranging from dual markets to restrictions to borrowing or
lending in foreign currencies 1
    The alluded restrictions are not necessarily the outcome of the policy
objective of fixing an exchange rate at a given level. The truth is, that there
are countries like Chile or Mexico, where in spite of a de facto flexibility of
their currencies, they have kept some restrictions on either capital outflows
or on the foreign currency composition of the balance sheet of commercial
banks.
    In this paper we focus on the case where the segmentation of the foreign
exchange market is a consequence of the fact that that the Central Bank can
not function as a lender of last resort in a currency other than its own. The
standing issue is whether, in times of stress, the parent bank effectively takes
the role of such lender of last resort in supporting its subsidiaries overseas.
    The scenario that we have in mind would be one where the host economy
suffers a shock that adversely affects its access to foreign financing. In such
a situation, it may be the case that the local banks would find it very costly
or even impossible to renew their outstanding short term credit lines, having
to rely on whatever support they may get from the local authorities. It may
also happen that the foreign subsidiaries would recur to their parent bank
for supplementary funding at pre-shock rates.
    If this were the case, a country with a significant participation of foreign
banks in its economy, could afford to lift most restrictions on foreign ex-
change transactions without incurring in significant risks. This also raises the
question of whether having a significant participation of foreign subsidiaries
should be thought as a necessary condition for lifting such restrictions.
    This paper follows two previous ones on the issue of regulation of foreign
exchange transactions that focus on the Mexican banking sector (Reynoso

    See Abrams and Beato [1] for a rather comprehensive list of examples in Latin America
and elsewhere.

[6] and [7]). They explain to some detail, why and how banks are required
to hold a certain minimum amount of liquid assets, denominated in foreign
exchange and issued by A1 − P 1 rated governments or corporations. This
paper also joins others, like Chinn and Dooley [2] and Gultekin and Penati
[4], who look at different sets of data to try to assess the impacto of different
kinds of forex market segmentation.
     Here, we suggest that the setting of Mexico’s regulation, specially during
a period covering from December of 1997 to November of 1999, offers a rather
practical way of looking at the response of domestic banks vis à vis that of
subsidiaries of foreign banks in times of stress:

        • During the time, the Russian, Southeast Asian and Brazilian crises had
          an appreciable effect on the overall cost of funding for bearers of Mexico
          risk.

        • The available information allows to distinguish the performance of the
          dollar book of domestic banks and foreign subsidiaries in Mexico. It is
          possible to see how institutions comply with the statutory requirement
          and to measure the excess reserves on a daily basis.

    • At the time, Mexico still had a substantial proportion of the banking
      sector assets in the hands of Mexican banks while some large foreign
      banks, like Citibank or Santander, were already present. 2

    This paper has four sections. In the first one we present a simple model
of the optimal response of a commercial bank to a reserve requirement, like
the one in place in Mexico. Section two dwells on the observable character-
istics of the model that are relevant for its estimation and testing. Section
three presents the data and the model to be estimated. Section four has the
estimations and test results.


1         A simple testable model
1.1         Optimal excess reserves
   Consider an economy where the regulation of the banking system distin-
guishes between domestic currency and foreign currency transactions. For
    2
        In contrast, today more than 80% of such assets are managed by foreign subsidiaries.


                                               4
notational purposes we will refer to the domestic currency as pesos. The
foreign currency will be the dollar. In this setting, the authorities require
banks to carry two books: one for peso denominated transactions; the other
one for dollar operations.
    Banks may or may not be required to hold liquid reserves for their peso
book. However, they are required to hold a certain proportion of their total
dollar liabilities in the form of liquid assets.
    We will assume that all banks can fund their dollar holdings in the in-
terbank market or by issuing tradeable certificates of deposit placed abroad.
This implies that the general public is not allowed to maintain dollar deposits
in the domestic financial sector.
    We will also assume that there is a subset of banks, the foreign banks,
which can also get their funding from their parent abroad.
    We will look now at the decision of the domestic banks on what should
be an adequate level of excess reserves in foreign exchange. Lets A be such
excess. We will assume that A behaves like equation (1) with z ∼ N( 0,1).

                                      A = µ + σz                                    (1)
   Now, lets define a variable Λ, which is the cost that banks bear from
carrying the excess reserves. This cost has two components: when a bank
complies with the regulation, it pays θ, which is the difference between the
funding rate and the return on very low yield short term instruments. If the
bank does not comply with the regulation, it is fined by the authorities, to
whom it has to pay a penalty rate Θ.

                             Z   0                         Z   ∞
                 Λ = −Θ               f (A, µ, σ) dA + θ           f (A, µ, σ) dA   (2)
                                 −∞                        0
                           1        (A − µ)2
        f (A, µ, σ) =     √   exp −                                                 (3)
                         σ 2π         2σ 2
    Let µ be the control variable used by banks in trying to minimize Λ as
described by equation (2). Take figure (1)as a visualization aid that displays
how much the cost, Λ would be for various choices of µ when Θ = 0.20,
θ = 0.10 and σ = 1.
    Figure (2) results from the solution of the minimization problem. The
surface is the optimal average excess reserves, µ∗ , for various combinations
of values of Θ and σ.

         Figure 1: Cost function. Θ = 0.20, θ = 0.10 and σ = 1

1.2   Testable features
  Two salient facts are worth noticing from the solution above:

  • As the penalty rate, Θ, gets closer to the market funding rate θ, µ∗ gets
    closer to zero. Therefore, if foreign banks can get funding from their
    headquarters at rates below the penalty rate, then they would show,
    in average, lower levels of excess reserves than the local banks, who by
    assumption cannot avoid the penalty whenever they get hit by a large
    enough shock (z ≤ −µ σ
                           )

  • The average excess reserves increases with the volatility of the funding
    needs. Therefore, in times of stress, one should expect to see an increase
    in the average holdings of reserves across banks. Only in the extreme
    case where Θ = θ, changes in volatility would have no impact on µ∗

        Figure 2: Optimal Average Excess Reserves µ∗ for θ = 0.10

2     Observable characteristics of the model rel-
      evant for its estimation and testing.
    Following the reasoning above, our objective would be to test whether,
caeteris paribus, the subsidiaries of foreign banks show significantly lower
levels of excess reserves than the domestic banks.

2.1    Censored observations
    Notice that, regardless of their ownership status, those banks complying
with the reserve requirement would be expected to record a level of excess
reserves described by equation (4)
                              ½ ∗                   ∗
                                 µ + σzt zt ≥ −µ
                        At =                      σ                      (4)
                                 0         otherwise
    From this specification, the sample mean of the excess reserves defined
by (5) will overestimate µ∗ , specially for those banks with unlimited access
to external funding.

2.2    The issue of smooth pasting
    In practice, most compliant banks will not show excess reserve values of
exactly zero. It is reasonable to think that even the bank with the best access
to credit will show some positive level for At , instead of hitting the boundary
every time zt is negative enough . This is like a smooth pasting condition.

 Figure 4: Smooth pasting. Histogram from a sample of 500 observations

    To see what this implies, lets consider that instead of having equation
(4), banks follow rule (7), with φ very small, but larger than 0. One example
of a histogram of excess reserves resulting from this rule is given by figure
(4).
                               ½ ∗                   ∗
                                 µ + σzt zt ≥ φ−µ
                         At =                      σ                      (7)
                                 φ         otherwise
    In a case like this, the solution to the maximum likelihood estimation
problem of equation (6) would be (8). This is because the value for which
we would be making the censoring lies behind the actual point where our
hypothetical bank decided to set its minimum excess reserves. From an esti-
mation standpoint, this result will show the same bias as the one illustrated
in the second panel of figure 3.
                                                           N
                                              M LE      1 X
                                          µ           =       At                      (8)

   One possible solution would be to arbitrarily censor the observations at
some level above zero. This in turns, raises the question on where to censor
the data.

   Three remarks follow from this exercise.
   • Changing the point of arbitrary censoring does not induce any bias in
     the estimator.
   • As the point of arbitrary censoring φ gets farther away from the actual
     mean the distribution of the estimator shows a larger variance.

                                             10
    • This very situation is a consequence of a likelihood function which gets
      flatter with larger values of φ, which not only has the consequence
      of less precise estimations but, depending on the algorithm used, it
      also makes the numerical optimization process slower and, sometimes,
      unable to find a solution.

2.3    Implementation Steps
   In sections 3 and 4 we will define and estimate a model for testing whether
or not banks have differential access to foreign funding depending on who
owns them.
   In doing so, and for the reasons highlighted above, we will proceed along
the following three steps:

    • Building a panel data set that would allow us to compare the trajec-
      tories of excess reserves across banks during a period where credit to
      Emerging Markets was tight.

    • Further censoring the available data on excess reserves to address the
      smooth pasting issue.

    • Estimating the model along the lines of the TOBIT methodology.


3     Model Specification
3.1    The Data
    As we mentioned before, between December of 1997 and December of
1999, the Emerging markets went through the Asian, Russian and Brazilian
crisis. During these episodes, the access of Emerging Economies to the in-
ternational credit markets may have not stopped altogether, but it definitely
got significantly tighter. Even in the more fortunate cases, like Chile, where
a decoupling from other economies crisis was claimed, the spreads of their
sovereign and corporate debt increased appreciably.
    The commercial banks in Mexico were definitely affected by this situation.
Although there is not a comprehensive and publicly available data on the
conditions in which they got their financing, there is a good deal of anecdotal

evidence which suggests that they had to come up with rather creative ways
of building an acceptable collateral to keep the short-term debt rolling over. 3
    At the time, there were 19 commercial banks in Mexico which:

       • Were neither intervened by the authorities nor were in the process of
         liquidation, as a consequence of the 1994-95 crisis.

       • Were active participants in the foreign exchange market.
   3
    One of the best examples is the securitization of credit card receivables for transactions
in dollars. Also, the securitization of receivables from money transfers made by expatriated
Mexican workers in the US



                                               12
    All those banks were subject to regulation 2019/95 4 , which basically re-
quired them to maintain a certain minimum balance in short term US Trea-
suries or equivalent in A1/P 1-rated dollar denominated debt instruments.
    Banks were asked to meet this requirement on a daily basis. To that end,
they filled out a report known as RL004 5 , which shows information on the
term structure of their assets and liabilities in dollars.
    In principle, the information from the RL004 is considered as confidential
by the central bank. Fortunately, there is a study by Hernandez [5] who
focuses on the degree of compliance of the banks during our sample period.
The study contains disaggregated information in such a way that it is possible
to distinguish across banks although, it is not possible to exactly associate
the data to any specific bank. The main reason is that in order to maintain
the confidentiality, Hernandez reports the data after it is normalized by a 30
day centered moving average of the total liabilities due on the next business
day.
    The data used in this paper is described in table 1. The sample has two
years of daily data for 19 banks. These banks are classified according to two
criteria:

Nationality of the owner. We will recognize three categories, Mexican,
    banks with American or Canadian parents, and the rest: European
    and Asian. We will use two dummy variables to capture the effects of
    this classification: one for the Mexican and another for the Americans.
    The constant term will therefore capture the fixed effects of the other
    nationalities. the regressions

Strength of internal controls. Regulation 2019/95 also stated that only
     banks with adequate risk management capabilities could operate with
     dollar-derivatives. The central bank also precluded banks with inade-
     quate capitalization from participating in the derivatives markets. That
     was the case of banks who substantially benefited from the regulatory
     forbearance granted by the National Banking Commission. 6 In some

   6
     It must be noticed that in Mexico, banking regulation is shared by the Ministry of
Finance (through the National Banking Commission) and the autonomous Central Bank.
Their policy approach does not necessarily coincides at all times. That is the reason why
one could see some facilities granted by some authority which are not acknowledged by
the other.


                                           13
       way, this dummy variable can also be thought as a proxy of the under-
       lying financial strength of the institution. 7

     Some macro variables will also be used to reflect the general market
conditions, such as the spread in the peso-dollar market; the one day repo
rate for the 28 day CETE (Treasury Note) and the strip spread of the UMS
11 21 % due in 2026 over the comparable US Treasury instrument.

3.2     The model
    The basic idea is that all banks look every day at the macro environment
and determines a reasonable amount of excess reserves. In principle, all banks
would process the macro information in the same way. Once this is done,
each bank may or may not include an additional amount of reserves. This
will depend on how skilled they are to handle risk and how certain they are
about having a reliable source of funding in times of stress. Equation(10)
tries to describe this behavior.

    Our main purpose will be to compare the situation of a group of banks
relative to the others. For that reason we will focus on the relative value of
the estimates of the constant term, β2 and β3 . In principle, these parameters
give us a ranking of banks from the point of view of their access to funding.
Those with smaller β will be thought as the ones with a better access to the
credit market. Table 2 displays the cases that we will be looking at in the
next section.
   7
     It should be said that the published information on the capital adequacy of banks is
not used here for, in our opinion, such data was excessively contaminated by the accounting
facilities granted by the authorities at the time.

4.1    A point of Reference: FGLS estimation
       Without overlooking the discussion of section 2, we present here the re-
sults of the FGLS estimation of the model in equation(10) as a way of having
a point of reference to compare the results of the TOBIT estimation ahead.
       Table 3 displays the results of a simple panel data estimation under dif-
ferent assumptions about the structure of the variance-covariance matrix of
²i,t .
       The first column corresponds to a pooled OLS estimation where the vari-
ance of the error term is described by equation (11).

                                          0 otherwise
   The second column assumes that each panel is homoscedastic, although
there may be differences across blocks.

       In our opinion, the remarks worth making from these results are:

       • The specification that appears to be more adequate is the one described
         in equation (12), which is the case where we have heteroscedasticity but
         no autocorrelation. To see this, we could perform a nested sequence
         of log-likelihood ratio tests (λ)8 . We compare first the case of auto-
         correlation and heteroscedasticity versus the heteroscedasticity case.
         Here the statistic λ is negative, which implies a p-value (1 degree of
         freedom) of 1.000. Now, the second test, of heteroscedasticity versus
         homoscedasticity reports a p-value (19 degrees of freedom) of 0.000,
         which suggests that we can stop the nested testing here.

       • While the constant term appears to be significantly different from zero,
         the dummies for Mexican and American banks are not significantly
         different from zero. For completeness, table 4 reports the χ2 test for the
         null hypothesis of β2 = β3 , not being able to reject it at any reasonable
         level of significance.

    • Following Bonferroni’s criterion for 5% significance level testing, the
      critical p-values should be around 0.064% for our 8 coefficient model
      9
        . This leaves only the constant term, the coefficient on the lagged
      variable and the DERIVATIVES dummy as significant. Furthermore,
      the DERIVATIVES dummy has similar size and opposite sign as the
      constant. This would lead to the conclusion that it is not the nationality
      of the bank what matters, but its financial and organizational strength.
      Therefore, in the case of a bank with a DERIVATIVES dummy equal
   8
     See Greene [3], sections 11.3 and 11.4. It is established there that λ = Lc −Luc , with Lc
being the log-likelihood evaluated at the estimated parameters in the constrained exercise,
and Luc the corresponding for the constrained one. This statistic has a χ2 distribution
with f degrees of freedom, being these the number of parametric restrictions imposed
   9
     For simultaneous testing, the probability of rejecting at least one of q hypothesis is
P (α, q) = 1 − (1 − α)q

         to one, its steady-state excess reserves will be very close to zero in
         expected value.

       • Although too close to zero for an acceptable level of significance, the
         CETES and UMS coefficients show the sign we would have expected.
         On the one hand, the spread on the UMS increases with a tight dol-
         lar credit market. In such conditions, prudent banks would respond
         by increasing their holdings. On the other hand, the CETES rate is
         highly correlated with the interbank peso market, with which some
         banks would fund dollar holdings 10 . As the cost of funding in pesos
         increases, banks would try to economize as much as possible in their
         excess reserves.

    A further view at the data raises an issue worth exploring in more detail.
During this time, not all banks complied faultlessly with the regulation.
Table 4.1 shows the proportion of the 507 observations per bank when excess
reserves were negative. The problem that could arise with this situation is
that non-compliant banks may report a lower mean for their excess reserves,
not because they handle their liquidity position better than the rest, but
because they show negative values.To address this issue, we run again the
estimation exercise, but this time excluding banks 5, 7, 13, 16 and 17.
    The results that appear in tables 6 and 7 do not alter the story implied
by the estimation including all banks . Perhaps the only aspect that deserves
any mentioning would be that the CETES and UMS coefficients show smaller
  10
    According to Hernandez [5], most banks in the sample reported a long net dollar
position during the period of study

stick to Bonferroni’s testing criterion.

4.2     TOBIT estimation
4.2.1   Methodological considerations
    In this section we will explicitly consider the fact that for most banks and
for most of the time, their excess reserves are bounded at values around zero,
but not exactly zero. The consequences, already explained in section 2.2,
suggest the application of a TOBIT estimation method as a way to avoid a
possible estimation bias.
    Before doing so, there are some standing issues that needed to be resolved
before and during the estimation itself.

Addressing possible Heteroscedasticity . Although we have mentioned
    that the results of the previous section are likely to be biased, we should
    not overlook that there is some indication of possible heteroscedasticity
    across banks. The precise structure of such situation is not known at
    this point, however a place to start could be to normalize the data, both
    dependent and independent variables, using some unbiased estimator
    of the standard deviation of the error for each bank.

        • Step 1. We ran a TOBIT estimation for each bank separately.
          We decided to set the censoring level for this step at A = 0.1. The
          regression model used for each bank was the same as equation (10),
          with the restriction of β2 = β3 = β7 = 0.
        • Step 2. We used the 19 standard error estimates of the regression
          to normalize the data, including the dummies, corresponding to
          each block in the panel.

Defining the point where to censor the data. If a typical sample for
     any bank looks like figure 4, then we know that censoring too soon
     would lead to biased estimators, and censoring too late would not only
     cost in terms of efficiency, but the optimization algorithms would have a
     hard time finding an optimum, as the likelihood function gets more flat.
     For that reason we opted for a criterion that would look at censoring
     points that:


                                      20
           • Are beyond the point where the value of likelihood function 11
             jumps appreciably from the one it has when evaluated with the
             FGLS estimates.
           • Sacrifice as little information as possible. Preferably, choosing a
             censoring point where more than half of the observations remain
             un-censored.
           • Step 3. The observations for the independent variable are then
             censored at different points, until we find those satisfying these
             two criteria.

Choosing the estimation procedure The final step consist of estimat-
    ing a model homoscedastic across blocks (since the data has been nor-
    malized) which, for the sake of increasing efficiency, would consider a
    random-effects type of covariance structure.

           • Step 4. Model in equation (10) is estimated using the xttobit
             routine by STATAr , which assumes expression (14).

                          E(²i,t   ²i0 ,t0 ) =   σ2       i = i0 , t 6== t0   (14)

           • It should be pointed out that, to the extent that the standard
             errors in Step 1 come from a sample censored at the right place,
             σb22 will in turn take values close to 1.

4.2.2     Results
    Table 8 displays the results when we take the sample with all 19 banks
included. As expected, there are some aspects that are worth underscoring .

      • The first column displays results which still look very similar to the
        FGLS estimation. We will leave this column only as a reference.

       • The next two columns show a positive coefficient for the dummy for
         the Mexican banks. This leads to conclude that Mexican banks appear
         to show the kind of response that we would think of institutions with a
         less advantageous access to international markets than European and
         Asian Banks.12
       • In both cases, the constant is also positive. Its size, of about 0.30
         means that even European and Asian subsidiaries place an extra re-
         serves equivalent to 4.7 days of due loans. 13 In contrast, Mexican
         banks would show an excess coverage between 6.4 and 7.6 days, de-
         pending on which column we look at.
       • American banks show, either zero or positive values for the coefficients
         of their respective dummy. However, as suggested by table 9, in these
         two cases, β3 is significantly smaller than the coefficient for Mexican
         banks. This offers some evidence that American banks behaved in a
         way consistent with better access to external funding.
    • The estimated value for σ2 is close enough to one, which should give us
      some comfort with respect to the way in which we conducted the Step
      1 in the estimation sequence.
    • There is a significant and sizeable random effects component in the
      total standard error (θ̂ is around 0.30), which suggests that beyond the
      nationality argument, the funding conditions and decisions are subject
      to relatively large company-specific shocks.
    • Finally, except for the SPREAD macro variable, the other ones become
      significantly different from zero this time around, for a 5% significance
      level. They also display the correct signs.

    In synthesis, the European and American banks fare better than the
Mexican ones. Also, the market conditions appear now to play an important
role in explaining the level and dynamics of the excess reserves.
    Tables 10 and 11 correspond to the case where the so called non-compliant
banks, are excluded. When we do this, some interesting things happen:
  12
    The critical p-value for simultaneous testing is 0.064% for q = 8
  13
    If all remaining independent variables are zero, the steady state level of excess reserves
                  .33
would be ν = (1−0.93)   = 4.7.Now, since the dependent variable is (excess reserves/next-
day-due loans), the interpretation of ν would be a coverage expressed in number of days

       • Notice that the DERIVATIVES variable is not included. The reason
         is that the non-compliant banks and those who are precluded from
         operating with derivatives are almost the same. This bring about a
         situation of near-collinearity with the rest of the dummy variables and
         the constant term. STATA’s r MLE algorithm this finds it hard
         to get a single solution when this variable is included. To solve the
         problem we decided to run the exercise again setting β7 = 0 from the
         outset.

       • The Mexican banks show a small, negative but significant coefficient
         for their dummy. This result, combined with the fact that the Amer-
         ican banks report a coefficient significantly larger than the one of the
         Mexican banks, would come to mean that for the sub-sample of strong
         performing banks, the Mexicans fare better than all foreign subsidiaries.

       • In this exercise σ2 is just shy off 1. In addition, the contribution of
         the random-effects component is far more modest than in the previous
         case (θ is around 0.1).

       • The macro variables are significant in all cases with the exception of
         the peso-dollar spread. They also keep the order of magnitude and the
         sign of the case where all banks were included.


Conclusions
    The title of this paper states the question of whether subsidiaries of for-
eign banks can contribute to the stability of the forex market in Emerging
Economies.
    The answer is a qualified yes. When there are weak domestic banks, it
seems that subsidiaries of foreign banks have a better access to funding in
foreign exchange, specially in times of stress.
    However, when compared with strong domestic banks, the evidence sug-
gests that these local entities can do as well or even better than the foreign
  14
     Bonferroni’s criterion for 5% significance level testing, for simultaneously testing the
null hypothesis of each coefficient being equal to zero implies a critical p-value of 0.073%.
Now, if we test simultaneously the restriction β2 = β3 , plus the rest of the coefficients
being equal to zero, the critical p-value is 0.085%

subsidiaries.
    In that sense, the conclusion of this paper takes us back to a common
place: there is no substitute to sound banking . It also implies that local
authorities can do better by having well capitalized and supervised local
banks than by simply allowing foreign subsidiaries in.
    As for the more complex topic on the repercussions of the globaliza-
tion of banking in the Emerging Economies, there are still some unanswered
questions. For instance, what should be the shared role of supervision and
support of the different financial authorities involved when subsidiaries of
foreign banks become a important players in a local market?; or what would
be the the macro and regulatory conditions that should prevail in the forex
market if a small country would decide to eliminate allow the operation of
branches of foreign banks together with local banks and foreign subsidiaries?.
A look at some other countries with experiences that complement the one
presented here may offer valuable answers on what I think is a very relevant
policy issue.
