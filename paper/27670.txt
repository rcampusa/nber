Previous work on transportation investments has focused on average impacts in high- and middle-
income countries. We estimate average and heterogeneous effects in a poor continent, Africa,
using roads and cities data spanning 50 years in 39 countries. Using changes in market access due
to distant road construction as a source of exogenous variation, we estimate a 30-year elasticity of
city population with respect to market access of about 0.08-0.13. Our results suggest that this
elasticity is stronger for small and remote cities, and weaker in politically favored and
agriculturally suitable areas. Access to foreign cities besides international ports matters little.
Additional evidence points suggestively to rural-urban migration as the primary source of this
population increase, though we cannot fully rule out natural increase or reallocation across cities.

      THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS                        1


      We consider the effect of roads upgraded between 1960 and 2010 on city
population growth in 39 sub-Saharan African countries during that period, as
a result of increased market access to other cities. Using a novel instrumental
variables strategy based on road changes faraway to account for potential
endogeneity of market access, we find that a 10% increase in market access
induces a 0.8­1.3% increase in city population on average over the course of the
30 years after market access changes. The OLS effect is smaller, suggesting that
far from anticipating future growth, roads may be more often built in otherwise
lagging regions. This is consistent with a network that is expanding from the
largest cities at independence to poorer, more remote places later.

      Our approach allows us to explore heterogeneous effects across time and
space.     Effects are similar across the first three decades of road-building,
subsequently falling. Our results then suggest that effects are larger for more
isolated cities, and market access changes to domestic rather than foreign cities,
and weaker in politically favored and more agriculturally suitable areas. We
provide suggestive evidence that these effects stem primarily from rural-to-
urban migration, as opposed to natural increase or reallocation of population
across cities.

      Sub-Saharan Africa is an important context for studying roads and cities. It
is the least urbanized world region, as well as the one with the least developed
transport network. Its urbanization rate crossed one third as the global rate
crossed one half in the past decade (United Nations, 2015). The region's 3.4 km of
roads, 0.7 km of them paved, per 1000 residents, represent less than half and one
fifth of the respective global averages (Gwilliam, 2011). The region's transport
infrastructure is also limited compared to other developing regions. Road density
is less than a third of South Asia's, and only a quarter of the network is paved
(World Bank, 2010a), against 60% in India (Government of India, 2016) and two-
thirds in China (World Bank, 2016b).1 This combination of low urbanization and
poor connectivity means that many people lack access to national and global
markets (Limão and Venables, 2001). High transport costs still separate regions
  1
   According to our data, there are only 3,700 km of highways in Sub-Saharan Africa vs. 24,000
km in India (Government of India, 2016) and 111,900 km in China (Government of China, 2016).

    and ethnic groups within African countries and contribute to their high levels
    of spatial inequality and the persistent weakness of their states (Herbst, 2000).
    Today, sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest urban primacy rate (28%
    of its urban residents live in their country's largest city) and the second highest
    level of inequality (Gini of 43%) (World Bank, 2016b). While road construction
    was rapid in the 1960s and 1970s post-Independence, it slowed substantially in
    the subsequent decades.

          African countries have begun to make large transportation investments
    again.2 Governments and international donors, including new donors like China
    through its expanding Belt and Road Initiative, describe them as having the
    potential to transform their regions, and highlight the potential of road projects
    to develop remote regions and reduce spatial inequality (ADB and UNECA,
    2003). For example, the World Bank writes of a project connecting Abidjan and
    Lagos: "The potential of the corridor to become a catalyst for economic growth
    and regional integration in the sub-region is well documented" (World Bank,
    2010b). Some donors consider these projects in the context of a Trans-African
    Highway (TAH) system. It is thus imperative to consider the effect of earlier road
    construction on the economic geography of the region as a whole, with a view to
    understanding the effect of future projects.

          Our work relates primarily to the empirical literature on the effect of market
    access, and specifically intercity transport costs, on the growth of local areas in
    developing countries (e.g. Faber, 2014; Storeygard, 2016; Jedwab and Moradi,
    2016; Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016; Donaldson, 2018, for a comprehensive
    overview of the literature, see Redding and Turner 2015). More generally, a large
    literature has looked at how market access affects the growth of cities among
    other units of analysis (e.g. Redding and Sturm, 2008; Jaworski and Kitchens,
    2019).3 Another large literature has looked at the effect of large highway projects

    Transport also accounted for 14% of World Bank lending, and 22% of African Development Bank
    disbursements 2012­2015 (World Bank, 2016a; African Development Bank, 2012­5).
       3
         Much of this recent literature has estimated the effects of transport costs and infrastructure
    investment within a general equilibrium trade model. This is not feasible in our environment,
    where data are substantially less available, even compared to the middle-income developing
    THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS                                3


on a variety of outcomes (e.g. Ghani et al., 2016). Finally, a smaller literature has
emphasized the specific role of road quality, which is the main source of variation
in this work (e.g. Casaburi et al., 2013; Gertler et al., 2015; Asher and Novosad,
2020). This paper makes several contributions to this literature.4

    First, we document the development and effects of a 140,000 km continental
paved road network from near its beginnings to the present. This data richness
allows us to consider the timing of effects in ways that previous work, which is
mostly based on two cross-sections instead of our six over 50 years, cannot. In
particular, the effects take place over a period of 30 years and these long-run
effects are nearly three times larger than short-run effects in the first decade.
We also use the universe of paved and improved roads, as opposed to highways
alone as considered by many studies, and study an evolution of the road network
rather than a revolution of the kind that China has experienced since 1988,
building 35,000 km of highways (Faber, 2014; Baum-Snow et al., 2019). To
the extent that gradual evolution is more likely in the future of developing
regions, this is a distinct and instructive context. There are also studies on
rural transportation (Bryan et al., 2014; Stanig and Wantchekon, 2015; Asher
and Novosad, 2020). However, while rural (earthen) roads programs impact
villages, they are far less costly than intercity road investments. Estimates of
road-building costs from Collier et al. (2015) suggest that road upgrades in our
sample cost 17% of endline regional GDP. By comparison, the large rural road
program studied by Asher and Novosad (2020) cost 1.8% of India's GDP. We also
focus on cities, which represent a large share of overall economic activity.5

    Our second contribution is methodological. We develop a novel identifica-
tion strategy, relying on the variation in market access induced by roads built far

countries previously studied. Among the 39 sub-Saharan African countries, median per capita
GDP was about $2,000 PPP in 2015, much less than other developing countries in this literature
(Brazil: $16,000; China: $14,000; India: $6,000; Indonesia: $11,000). In particular, no data
on within-country variation in trade, migration, production, wages, prices and amenities are
available for more than a small subset of our sample over time.
   4
     Berg et al. (2018) uses our panel data set on roads to study the effects of market access on
land cultivation in Africa. The first working paper version of our paper predates their paper.
   5
     McKinsey (2011) estimates that cities' contribution to sub-Saharan African GDP will be 63%
by 2025. The cities in our sample account for two-thirds of night lights in our 39 sample countries.

    away. Our strategy is most closely related to Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016)
    and the contemporaneous work of Jaworski and Kitchens (2019), but we depart
    from their approach especially in further ruling out several potential channels for
    reverse causality.6 Our strategy of isolating variation from non-local changes to
    the road network is akin to using "friends of friends" to estimate peer effects (e.g.,
    Bramoullé et al., 2009; Calvo-Armengol et al., 2009). However, to our knowledge
    this strategy has been used rarely to study the effects of infrastructure, notable
    recent exceptions being Schlenker and Walker (2016) and Jaworski and Kitchens
    (2019).7

          Third, we consider heterogeneous effects along multiple dimensions. These
    have received less attention in the empirical literature, and may be especially
    important given Africa's diverse physical, economic, and political geography.
    We find suggestive evidence for three forms of heterogeneity. (i) The effect of
    market access is stronger for cities that are small and remote. This suggests that
    roads contributed to the decentralization of economic activity in our context, in
    line with some work (Redding and Sturm, 2008), but less so with recent papers
    on China (Faber, 2014; Baum-Snow et al., 2019). (ii) Effects are stronger for
    cities surrounded by poor farm land. This is consistent with Ricardian internal
    trade models, and echoes Asher and Novosad (2020), who find that roads cause
    outmigration from villages with low agricultural productivity. (iii) Cities less

      6
          With respect to the typology of identification strategies introduced by Redding and Turner
    (2015), our sample of 39 countries is not a context in which comprehensive planned or historical
    networks are available, our broad scope limits the possibility of randomized experiments and
    regression discontinuity designs, and the inconsequential places approach, including least-cost
    construction routes, is also not appropriate because of the piecemeal nature of much of the
    road construction. These econometric approaches are most often applied to one country at
    a time, and results depend on the details of the natural experiment studied. More precisely,
    strategies based on planned/historical networks or accidental connections can explain well
    the location of road investments, but limit inference about the timing of effects. Randomized
    experiments and regression discontinuity designs have only been used to study rural roads,
    since their implementation is generally not politically feasible for intercity roads. In contrast,
    our identification strategy, although not as "clean", has the advantage of being implementable
    for most types of transportation infrastructure and in most contexts, which could facilitate the
    comparison of effects across countries and over time. In principle, market access also accounts
    for aggregate effects and displacement of economic activity, unlike other strategies.
        7
          This strategy can ameliorate but not solve the "spatial reflection problem" that every location
    is affected by, and in turn affects, other locations. See Gibbons et al. (2015) for a discussion.
      THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS                            5


likely to be politically favored see bigger impacts. This is consistent with the
literature documenting political motivations in the allocation of roads (Burgess
et al., 2015; Blimpo et al., 2013). If roads are sited based on political rather than
economic returns, they may be less beneficial (Tanzi and Davoodi, 1998). We use
a new dataset reporting place of origin of the 189 heads of state of 39 countries
1960­2010. To our knowledge, this is the first such dataset covering virtually all
of sub-Saharan Africa. If anything, these results suggest that upgrading roads
has decentralized economic activity in Africa, but not all non-primate towns
benefited from such investments.

      Access to ports plays an outsize role, while access to foreign cities in
neighboring countries does not, consistent with the overseas nature of much
African trade, and perhaps not surprising given the non-cooperative nature of
road-building across borders (Felbermayr and Tarasov, 2015). While the stronger
role of access to world markets is in line with Fajgelbaum and Redding (2014) and
Baum-Snow et al. (2019), the differential seems to be smaller in Africa, possibly
due to oligopolistic intermediaries (Atkin and Donaldson, 2015).

      Finally, our work also builds on the literature considering how cities in
developing countries grow.           Previous work on transport and city growth in
Africa has emphasized the earlier railroad revolution (Jedwab and Moradi, 2016;
Jedwab et al., 2017) or variable costs of road transport (Storeygard, 2016), but
not road construction, which is likely to have a larger effect on transport costs
in the future. Other work on urbanization in Africa is primarily cross-country in
nature.8 City growth is the best available proxy for local economic development
in our context, and an object of interest in its own right.9 Previous work has

    No subnational GDP or wage data exist for most countries in the sample. Even total
population (and therefore urbanization rate) is often available only for coarse regions and
more extrapolated in early periods. Henderson et al. (2017) use information on populations
for subnational units of 89 censuses in 29 countries, but these data are not consistently
available back to the 1960s for most countries. While Young (2013) uses household asset
ownership and child mortality from the Demographic and Health Surveys as measures of
economic development, these data do not exist before the late 1980s and have limited geographic
information before the mid-1990s (we use their retrospective data on fertility and mortality for a
limited sample of cities below). For a subsample of decades, we consider night lights, available

    shown how urbanization in developing countries has effects on productivity
    (Meijers et al., 2016; Chauvin et al., 2017), access to amenities (Gollin et al., 2017;
    Jedwab and Vollrath, 2019), and democratization (Glaeser and Steinberg, 2016).

    1. Data and Background
    We construct a new spatial dataset of road surface and city population every 10
    years between 1960 and 2010 for the 42 countries of mainland sub-Saharan Africa
    (c. 2010). Appendix Sections A.1­A.6 provide further details on the data.
    1.1. Roads, 1960-2010
    We combine information from two sets of sources. First, Nelson and Deichmann
    (2004) provides road locations for all of Africa. These data nominally represent
    roads existing in 2004, based primarily on the US government's Digital Chart
    of the World database, with limited information on road type. Second, using
    these road locations as a baseline, we digitized 64 Michelin road maps produced
    between 1961 and 2014 to represent contemporary road conditions for three
    broad regions: Central/South (19 countries), North/West (18) and North/East (5).
    Appendix Figures A.1 and A.2 show the countries and years, respectively, covered
    by each region. The average gap between maps across regions is under 2.5 years,
    and the longest is 7 years. While specific road categories vary somewhat across
    maps, the distinction between highways, other paved roads, improved roads
    (laterite or gravel), and dirt roads is nearly universal.

        The Michelin maps report highways and intercity paved and improved roads
    comprehensively, but their coverage of earthen roads is less complete, with some
    maps changes clearly due to coverage decisions as opposed to new roads. Based
    on the assumption that roads change quality but rarely move or disappear, we
    thus code each segment from the Nelson and Deichmann (2004) map as paved
    or improved in each year it is shown as such by Michelin, and assume that the
    remaining segment-years are earthen. We also code a small number of segments
    as highways in the eight countries where they appear after 1973. Figures 1a and
    1b show roads circa 1960 and 2010.10

    from 1992, as a proxy for city income, following Storeygard (2016).

    Michelin uses four sources to create the maps: (i) the previous Michelin map,
(ii) government road censuses/maps, (iii) direct information from its tire stores
across Africa, and (iv) correspondence from road users including truckers.11
The latter two sources of information are especially important, and new to this
literature.12 Michelin has been producing maps since 1910, with its first map for
West Africa appearing in 1938. As one of the largest tire companies in the world
since the early 1970s (Rajan et al., 2000), unlike other organizations producing
maps, Michelin has long maintained a large network of stores distributing its
tires, in addition to its maps. Many truck drivers in Africa use both, and are
in regular contact with this network. Because inaccurate characterization of
road surface leads to delays or truck damage, truckers complain to the store
managers when the information is inaccurate, and the store managers relay this
information to Michelin cartographers. Michelin also focuses on road surfaces
whereas other maps classify roads as primary/secondary or major/minor, which
is less informative about road quality. We are unaware of another source of maps
with similarly broad coverage over such a long period.

    We believe that this process leads to generally consistent information across
countries and time, but this does not mean that the evolution of every road
segment is perfectly characterized. This has several implications. First, changing
conditions may be reflected on maps with a lag. The lag is unlikely to be long
because: (i) Michelin dealers collect data on ongoing projects and their maps
are intended to reflect the year a road will open and (ii) periods between maps
are generally short. Second, Michelin's network is more sparse in some countries
and periods. Country-year fixed effects should ameliorate the effect of this to
some extent. Coverage of the early 1960s is more limited; as we show, results
are robust to excluding the decade most likely to be affected by 1960s roads.
Finally, we cannot capture the quality of roads within a surface class, so when
a severely potholed paved road is resurfaced, our data do not reflect this. This
work may have been especially prevalent since 2000, as we explain below, so we

shows the Michelin map for Sierra Leone in 1969 and the associated GIS map.

    may underestimate recent changes. Results are robust to excluding the 2000s.

    1.2. City Location and Population, 1960-2010

    We obtained location and decadal population estimates of cities in 33 countries
    from Africapolis I: West Africa and Africapolis II: Central & Eastern Africa.13
    They generated estimates using various sources including population censuses,
    "non-native" population censuses, administrative counts, demographic studies,
    electoral counts, and statistical abstracts. Based on an initial list of cities with
    at least 5,000 inhabitants in the most recent census c. 2000, their final database
    nominally includes all cities that reached a population of at least 10,000 at some
    point since 1960. They also define agglomerations in c. 2000 using satellite
    imagery. If two distinct cities in 1970 later merged, in the sense that their urban
    land cover is contiguous, they are treated as one city in Africapolis throughout.
    Thus we are not studying reallocation within urban areas.

          We build on the Africapolis data in three ways. First, we use analogous
    sources to produce an analogous comprehensive database for 6 southern African
    countries not in Africapolis, and a more limited database for the remaining
    three countries of mainland sub-Saharan Africa: South Africa, Swaziland, and
    Lesotho. Comparable cities data covering the range of populations and years
    we use are not available for these three countries, so they are not included in
    our analysis sample. In calculating measures of market access for the remaining
    39 countries, we do however include the 20, 1, and 1 largest (in 2010) cities in
    South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, to minimize bias in measures for cities near
    them. Second, we add a small number of missing cities in Africapolis countries
    that achieved a population over 10,000 at some point between 1960 and 2010.
    Finally, we add missing locations and correct some locations based on Google
    Earth, GeoNet, and Wikipedia, aggregating multiple administrative cities into
    one agglomeration using more recent satellite imagery from Google Earth.14

          The raw population data sources used for each of the 237 available country-

     14
       Jedwab and Moradi (2016) use the Africapolis data and similar but not identical data for the
    other six countries. City data details are in Appendix Section A.2.

years are listed in Appendix Table A.1. For example, for Botswana we used the
Population Censuses of 1956, 1964, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. Of these
237, 177 take population counts for each individual city directly from population
censuses. In robustness checks, we show that results are similar when we limit
analysis to country-decades with estimates that are the most likely to be reliable,
i.e. estimates based on a census year not too far from the actual decadal year
used in the regressions. Since the source dates vary across countries, population
figures for all cities are exponentially interpolated and extrapolated between raw
data years to obtain estimates for 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010.15

      The resulting sample includes population estimates for all 2,911 cities with a
population of over 10,000 at some point since 1960, in all sample years in which
their population exceeded 10,000, and in 60% of sample years in which they did
not reach 10,000. Information on smaller cities is not systematically available for
our sample region and period. We are thus studying the intensive margin of the
growth of cities over 10,000. We do not consider their entry into the sample, as we
do not have consistent information on whether that entry involves growing from
9,990 or 1,000 to 10,000 in the previous decade. However, over our sample period
1960­2010, 84% of urban population growth, representing 171 of 203 million new
urban residents, was on this intensive margin only.16 We show below that results
are similar when we include estimates below 10,000 where available.

1.3. Data integration and unit of analysis

Our cross-sectional unit of analysis is a 0.1 by 0.1 degree grid square
( 11 x 11 km). There are 199,814 such cells in our 42 countries. Using these units
dramatically simplifies computation compared to the full vector road network,
and avoids problems due to missing topological information, concerning which


 15
     In our sample, the initial and final populations of a decade are both at least 5 years from
a population data source for about 6% of country-decades. Alternatively, the initial or final
populations of a decade are more than 5 years from a population data source for about 64% of
country-decades. We thus investigate how results change when dropping these country-decades.
  16
     Further, 98% of the 1,721 extensive margin cases are growth from below 10,000 to above it;
the remaining 2% are declines to below it. Since we do not have data on the exact population of
all city-decades with a population below 10,000, we ignore the extensive margin in our analysis.

 segments connect to each other and which do not, in vector roads datasets.17
 We assign to each grid square in each year a speed of travel for the fastest road
 segment type falling in the grid square in the year, or a baseline speed if no
 roads are present. We assume 80, 60, 40, 12, and 6 km/hour on highways, paved
 roads, improved roads, earthen roads, and areas with no roads, respectively.
 The precise values are illustrative; results are insensitive to a scale factor.18 The
 urban population of each cell is the population of the city whose location falls
 within it, or in the small minority of cells with multiple cities, the sum of their
 populations.19 In our econometric analysis, we focus on the cells with a total city
 population of at least 10,000 in two consecutive decades since 1960 in the 39 of
 these countries with comprehensive cities data.

 1.4. Other data

 We compile several additional datasets and assign them to cells: (i) navigable
 rivers; (ii) the mean and standard deviation of altitude; (iii) average rainfall 1900­
 1960; (iv) land suitability for food/cash/all crops today (assuming low input
 levels and no irrigation); (v) open mines (including fields) 1960­2010 (N = 288);
 (vi) the identity of national and provincial capitals in 1960 (N = 346) and 2010 (N =
 481); (vii) 1960 province identifiers; (viii) railroad lines and when each was built;
 (ix) 65 and 44 international ports in 1960 and 2005 respectively; (x) 466 airports
 in 2007; (xi) 837 customs posts circa 2010; (xii) natural parks covering 26,252 cells
 circa 2015; (xiii) historical ethnic group identifiers; (xiv) the locality of origin
 and ethnicity of the 189 heads of state 1960­2010; (xv) night lights 1992­2010;
 (xvi) conflict locations 1990­2010; (xvii) 1980­2009 fertility and infant mortality
 histories from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for 16 countries.

          We also obtained country-year-level data on: (i) population, per capita GDP,
 polity score, refugee count, and total fertility, infant mortality, crude birth and


     17
      Mean road length for 85,344 cells with a road in Nelson and Deichmann (2004) is 11.6 km.
 This suggests that our 11 x 11 km cells have on average about 1 road crossing them fully.
   18
      We show below that results are similar if we use alternative speeds.
   19
      Our 2,911 city locations fall in 2,789 distinct cells. We effectively assume each city falls entirely
 in one cell (120 km2 ), but verify below that results are similar if we drop the largest cities, which
 are the most likely to span multiple cells.

crude death rates; and (ii) whether the country was still a colony, experienced
an international/civil war, or suffered a multi-year drought in each decade.
Appendix Section A.5 provides details.

1.5. Aggregate Patterns in Road Building and Urban Growth

Appendix Figure A.4 shows aggregate lengths of highways and paved and
improved roads over time. In 1960, a length of less than 5% of today's network
was paved. Following the independence of most African countries in the early
1960s and into the 1970s, the paved network expanded rapidly, fueled by massive
public investments (e.g. O'Connor, 1978; Wasike, 2001; Pedersen, 2001). The
stock of improved roads also increased in the 1960s, but it decreased in the 1970s
as more initially improved roads were paved.

      Beginning in the mid-1980s, worsening macroeconomic conditions decreased
the pace of road transformation markedly (Konadu-Agyemang and Panford, 2006;
Gwilliam, 2011). Although investment may have increased again since the mid-
2000s, this is not reflected in our data. We believe this is because investment may
have been directed primarily towards restoring and rebuilding existing paved
roads. As explained by World Bank (1988) and Konadu-Agyemang and Panford
(2006), roads deteriorated badly in most African countries in the 1980s and after,
as road maintenance agencies were systematically underfunded.20

      Figures 1c and 1d map cities over 10,000 in 1960 and 2010. The sheer
number of such cities has increased dramatically, from 418 in 1960 to 2,859 in
2010. In 1960, a large fraction of these cities were trading centers or regional
administrative centers established by colonial administrations (Bairoch, 1988;
Coquery-Vidrovitch, 2005). The urban population of the 39 countries, here
defined as the total population of all cities over 10,000, has increased from
less than 25 million in 1960 to almost 250 million in 2010. The analogous

 20
    For example, the Kenyan government has invested heavily in rebuilding the Mombasa-
Nairobi road (Burgess et al., 2015). Jedwab and Storeygard (2019) discuss country-level patterns
in greater detail, and report evidence that our data are consistent with other sources at the
country level. Specifically, in an unbalanced panel of 609 country-years between 1960 and 2002
that we report in common with Canning and Farahani (2007), our two independent measures of
paved roads are correlated at 0.7.
12                          REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 urbanization rate increased from only 9% in 1960 to 28% in 2010.

 2. Empirical Methods

 We study how increased market access to other cities affects city population
 growth in 2,126 urban cells in 39 sub-Saharan African countries sampled every
 ten years between 1960 and 2010.21 We now describe: (i) how we construct
 market access; (ii) our baseline specification; and (iii) our identification
 strategies.

 2.1. Construction of Market Access to Other Cities

 Our definition of market access follows Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), who
 show that it summarizes direct and indirect effects of network changes in a
 large class of multi-region models.22 Origin cell o 's market access (MA) in year
                                
 t , is MAot =          P d t -
                              od t
                                   , where P is urban population, d indexes destination
                 d =o
 cells, od t is travel time from cell o to cell d , and  is the elasticity measuring
 how trade volumes fall as travel times increase. Departing from Donaldson and
 Hornbeck (2016), we use travel times rather than iceberg trade costs, because
 no appropriate shipment value is available. We instead follow Duranton et al.
 (2014), whose central estimate of the elasticity of inter-city trade with respect to
 highway distance in the United States is -1.27, and Atkin and Donaldson (2015),
 whose results imply a trade cost-distance elasticity three times larger in Nigeria
 than in the United States. Combining these estimates, we apply a baseline value
 of 1.27 × 3 = 3.8 for  to assumed travel times and consider alternatives below. In
 our analysis, we focus on how changes in the road network affect travel times.23
     21
       These 2,126 cells are the subset of the 2,789 noted above that have an urban population over
 10,000 in at least two consecutive decades, so that changes are well-defined.
    22
       The model of Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) includes both firm and consumer market
 access (MA) terms, similarly to how Redding and Venables (2004) define supplier and market
 access. However, these two terms are proportional in their model, so our empirical specification,
 like theirs, includes a single MA term that reflects benefits to both firms and consumers.
    23
       Appendix Table A.9 considers an iceberg specification with a plausible shipment value. We
 are not aware of any work identifying an elasticity for intercity trade in Africa. Buys et al. (2010)
 report a trade-distance elasticity of -3.84 to -2.05 in a sample of country-pairs in sub-Saharan
 Africa. Elsewhere in the developing world, Morten and Oliveira (2017) report a trade-travel time
 elasticity of -2.65 across Brazilian meso-regions. We rely on the Duranton et al. (2014) estimate
 because it allows us to use the crosswalk to Africa inferred from Atkin and Donaldson (2015).
    THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 13



    The time required to travel from each cell to all cells containing cities is
calculated every ten years from 1960 to 2010 using Dijkstra's algorithm, the road
speed assumptions above, and the great circle distances between neighboring
cell centroids.24 When a map is not available for a given year, we interpolate
speeds between the closest map years before and after.25

2.2. Baseline Specification

We are interested in how market access MA affects urban population P , so our
initial specification (for cell o in country c in year t ) is:

                           ln P ot = 0 ln MAot + o +  c t +       0ot                        (1)

which includes cell fixed effects o and country-year fixed effects  ct to account
for time-invariant city characteristics and flexible national trends, respectively.
We consider several lags of market access change, suppressed from equations
for clarity, to look for changing impacts over time, as we do not expect the effect
of road changes on population to be instantaneous.

    In first differences (at ten-year intervals, since we have urban data every ten
years), cell fixed effects cancel and this becomes:

                          ln P ot = 0  ln M A ot +  ct +           0ot .                     (2)

    We further control for initial log population in the first-difference specifi-
cation to account for any divergence (convergence) if large cities grow faster
(slower) than small cities, due to local increasing returns/agglomeration effects
or mean reversion, as it is standard in the literature on the growth of cities (Du-
ranton and Puga, 2014). We also include a third-order polynomial in longitude
and latitude interacted with year fixed effects to control for unobservables corre-
lated across space within country-decades. This is equivalent to the main spec-

Appendix Figure A.8 shows how results vary with respect to the choice of  .
  24
     See Appendix Section A.3 for details. Appendix Figure A.5 shows how we obtain market access
changes for Sierra Leone between 1970 and 1980. Appendix Figure A.6 shows the change in
market access between 1960 and 2010 for the 187,900 cells of the 39 sample countries.
  25
     For roads in 1960, we assign roads from the earliest available year (1961 for Central/South,
1965 for North/West, and 1966 for North/East). This assumes no road building between 1960
and the first map, which underestimates road building in the 1960s. We show later that results
are similar when dropping the decade plausibly affected by 1960s road-building.
14                             REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 ification of Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016, eq. (13)), using population as an
 outcome instead of land rents.26 We will nonetheless show that the results are
 similar if no additional controls are added except for the country-decade fixed
 effects. Finally, we cluster standard errors by province (using province bound-
 aries c. 1960). We will show that estimated standard errors clustered by country
 are usually larger but modestly so and do not affect inference substantially.

          Suppressing fixed effects and controls, stacking across all o , and defining the
                                                                        
 matrix T t with off-diagonal elements in row o and column d equal to -
                                                                      od t
                                                                           (and
 diagonal elements equal to zero), (1) becomes:

                                         ln P t = 0 ln(T t P t ) +    0t                                     (3)

 a log-transformed spatial lag specification, where the log is applied element-
 wise.27 Then, using (3), (2) becomes:

      ln P t = 0  ln(T t P t ) +       0t

              = 0 [ln(T t P t ) - ln(T t -10 P t -10 )] +    0t
                                                                                                             (4)
              = 0 [ln(T t P t ) - ln(T t -10 P t -10 ) + ln(T t P t -10 ) - ln(T t P t -10 )] +    0t

              = 0 [ln(T t P t ) - ln(T t P t -10 )] + 0 [ln(T t P t -10 ) - ln(T t -10 P t -10 )] +     0t


          Changes in market access come from either changes in the population of
 other cities (weighted by travel times T in t ) or changes in travel times T to these
 other cities (weighted by the population of cities in t -10). From (3) and (4), it is
 apparent that market access is mechanically endogenous, since city o 's growth
 affects the growth of other cities d , which in turn affects city o 's growth.

 2.3. Identification Strategies

 Our chief identification concerns are this reverse causality and omitted variables.
 Market access changes due to both changes in the population of city trading
 partners and changes in the roads connecting them.                               Unmeasured factors
 increasing a city's population could also increase its' neighbors' population, and
     26
      Land rent is the appropriate dependent variable, based on their model, but we do not have
 data on land rent. They show that population will also respond log-linearly to market access, but
 that the slope of this relationship will depend on the level of population mobility.
   27
      An explicit matrix formulation appears in Appendix Section A.6.
    THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 15



therefore its market access. Furthermore, roads could be built in anticipation
of city growth, or in anticipation of city stagnation in order to prevent it.
Misspecified functional form and measurement error may also bias estimates.

    Our first two identification strategies, excluding population change and
excluding nearby road changes, are inspired by the econometric framework
of Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016). The remaining strategies go farther in
addressing the possibility of endogeneously built roads farther away, based on
several different reasons why roads might be built to a city. Our instruments also
likely reduce the bias due to measurement error.

Instrument fixing population. We first propose an instrument for the change
in market access  ln MAo that fixes population of the other cities P d in t -10,
and thus only relies on changes in travel times/roads T between t -10 and t (the
second component in (4)), limiting the scope for reverse causality:
                                                                                          
                  R ln MAot = ln(           P d ,t-10 -
                                                      o ,d ,t ) - ln(        P d ,t-10 -
                                                                                       o ,d ,t-10 ).            (5)
                                     d =o                             d =o

Instrument also excluding local road changes. An important problem with
the instrument in (5) is that local road changes do not necessarily satisfy the
exclusion restriction. Unobserved factors may drive both city o 's growth/decline
and surface improvement/deterioration of roads from o to neighboring cities d .
One solution to this problem is to restrict attention to changes in non-local roads,
i.e. road changes taking place sufficiently far away from city o that they are less
likely to be driven by local factors that also drive city o 's growth.

    Defining "far away" as outside an exclusion circle of radius j  (5, 10, 15) cells
(roughly 55, 111, or 167 km) of city o , we define a class of instruments:

   out , j                                                                                             
 R           ln MAot = ln     P d ,t-10 -
                                        od ,t +       P d ,t-10 -
                                                                od ,t-10 - ln              P d ,t-10 -
                                                                                                     od ,t-10   (6)
                            d :(d ,o ) j            d :0<(d ,o )< j                   d =o

where  is the Euclidean distance metric. They exploit the variation in the change
in market access  ln MAot coming from changes in roads more than j cells away
from city o . Figure 2a illustrates this setup. City o 's overall market access at time
t is a function of the cost of traveling to cities d 1 ­d 4 and their population at time
t . In calculating the change in market access from t - 10 to t , the instrument
16                          REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 uses population from t - 10, as well as changes to non-local roads outside the
 exclusion circle (r 2 , r 3 , r 4 , r 5 and r 8 ) between t - 10 and t . Any changes to local
 roads inside the exclusion circle (r 1 , r 6 and r 7 ) between t - 10 and t are excluded
 from the instrument, because they could be endogenous to city o 's growth.
      out , j
     R          ln MAot (or more simply IV j ) is a valid instrument as long as changes in
 non-local roads are excludable from equation (2). Excludability is threatened if
 there are factors that affect both city o 's growth and the construction of these
 non-local roads. As the exclusion circle radius j increases from 5 to 15 cells,
 we exploit less local road changes, and are more likely to satisfy the exclusion
 restriction. However, faraway road changes are less likely to determine changes
 in market access, so instruments exploiting road changes far away are weaker.
 Given this trade-off between excludability and strength of the instruments, we
 report results for multiple radii. Since we generally include two lags of market
 access, we use two lags of the instrument as well, for a total of three instruments
 for three endogenous variables.

 Excluding selected non-local road changes. Some types of non-local road
 building may also be endogenous to city o 's growth. We consider five such
 types. First, construction of faraway radial roads could proxy for construction
 of near radial roads, which are due to city o 's growth, with both being driven by
 policymakers wanting to connect city o to elsewhere. We call this phenomenon
 co-investment. For example, in Figure 2a, the government may upgrade roads r 1 ,
 r 2 and r 3 in order to better connect city o and city d 1 . In that case, road changes
 outside the exclusion circle (r 2 and r 3 ) may not satisfy the exclusion restriction
 because they are correlated with road changes inside the exclusion circle (r 1 ).

     Second, construction of faraway radial roads could be due to city o 's growth
 inducing demand for a connection between city o and faraway cities, but if roads
 near city o are already good, they may not be (measurably) improved, leaving
 measurable improvements to be found only far away. We call this phenomenon
 radial extension outward. In Figure 2a, the government may decide to upgrade
 roads r 2 and r 3 in order to better connect city d 1 to city o .             If r 1 cannot
 be upgraded further, this will not constitute co-investment, but road changes
   THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 17



outside (r 2 and r 3 ) may not satisfy the exclusion restriction if they are correlated
with nearby non-road investments also causing city o 's growth.

   Third, while the converse of this, inner roads built extending outer roads
toward city o , are already excluded in our instrument, there is a subtle variant
that requires a different solution. Specifically, a road built toward city o in
anticipation of its growth may see faraway sections completed before near
sections. We call this radial extension inward.

   In order to address these three concerns, we harness the idea that this
connection between near and far road construction is much more likely if they
are both in the same direction from city o . We thus introduce a discrete local
radial coordinate system for city o . A road can be built in either the inner or outer
ring (s  [1, 2]) with respect to city o , in one of 8 octants (q  [1, 8]), subtended
by the 8 cardinal and intermediate directions of the compass. Let the stock of
(improved, paved and highway) roads in octant q in ring s with respect to city
o in year t be R ot q s . In this framework, changes in    q ,s R ot q s are what drive
                                                                   out , j
road-based changes in market access, and the       instrument R            ln MAot above
is entirely based on road changes in the outer rings (s = 2),      q R ot q 2 .

   Using this notation, co-investment is equivalent to cor r (R ot q 2 , R ot q 1 ) > 0
driving cor r (R ot q 2 , P ot ) > 0 due to an omitted variable inducing road building
toward city o from elsewhere. In this case, road building in the outer ring is
proxying for potentially endogenous road building in the inner ring. We address
this by excluding city-periods with octants in which there is inner and outer
radial road-building, or more formally, dropping city o in years t , t + 10, and t + 20
(i.e. all years in which road-building between t - 10 and t appears on the right
hand side, given two lags) if q : R ot q 1 > 0 & R ot q 2 > 0. In Figure 2a, this
means dropping city o in year t if in any decade between t - 30 and t , r 1 and r 2
(or, e.g., r 6 and r 8 ), were both upgraded. We do not require the upgraded inner
and outer radial roads to be contiguous. We limit consideration to roads that
pass through designated bands (in gray in the figure) in the inner and outer rings
of the same octant, to ignore non-radial roads such as r 9 and r 10 in Figure 2a.

   Radial extension outward then implies R ot q 1 = 0 but only because octant q
18                       REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 already has a good radial road in its inner ring (R o,t -10,q 1 > 0). We address it by
 excluding city-periods where an outer road is built in the same octant where a
 paved or improved inner road already exists. Formally, we drop city o in years t
 to t + 20 if q : R o,t -10,q 1 > 0 & R ot q 2 > 0. In Figure 2a, this means dropping city
 o in year t if in any decade between t - 30 and t , r 2 (or r 8 ) was upgraded when r 1
 (r 6 ) was already paved or improved. Radial extension inward implies that outer
 ring road building (R ot q 2 > 0) anticipates city growth (P ot > 0) even before a
 connecting inner road is built (R ot q 1 = 0, but R o,t +10,q 1 > 0). Formally, we drop
 city o in years t to t + 20 if q : R o,t +10,q 1 > 0 & R ot q 2 > 0. In Figure 2a, this
 means dropping city o in year t if in any decade between t - 30 and t , r 1 (r 6 ) was
 upgraded in the decade after r 2 (r 8 ) was upgraded.

     The fourth type of road building we exclude is along or near potentially
 important routes to large cities. Specifically, we create a larger exclusion zone
 for each city that extends along the shortest path to the nearest city of at least
 100 thousand people in t - 10. Formally, this is the convex hull of the exclusion
 circle and that nearest large city. Figure 2b shows this exclusion zone for city o if
 city d 1 is the nearest large city. The resulting instrument relies on non-local road
 changes not directly targeted at city o (e.g., r 5 ).

     Fifth, as a variant of this, we exclude from consideration changes to roads
 deemed "transcontinental" in the Michelin maps from the first year available
 (circa 1960), as they are the most likely to be upgraded due to non-local factors,
 and therefore be endogenous to city o 's growth even if they are far away from
 it. Thirty-three of the 37 cities over 100 thousand people in 1960 were in the
 same cell as a transcontinental road (and the other 4 cities are within 50 km of
 such a road). In addition, transcontinental road cells were much more likely to
 have been paved by 2010 (61% vs. 6% for non-transcontinental road cells). By
 making our instrument only rely on non-local changes that do not take place
 along transcontinental roads, we guarantee that identification does not come
 from these potentially endogenous connections to large cities.

 Dropping potential growth hubs. The above strategies account for endogenous
 road building that is nearby, or in the same octant as nearby road building

or good roads, or deemed transcontinental. As a complementary, more direct
approach, we also drop selected cities with observable characteristics that may
cause them to grow and cause roads to be built towards them, even from far away.
Specifically, we drop city-decades with a set of known shocks, or local resources
most likely to drive such shocks, that might affect city growth and road building:
largest cities, mines, cash crop regions, head of state's hometown, ports, airports,
customs posts, natural parks, colonial status, wars, refugee camps, and droughts.
Alternatively, we simultaneously control for many of these factors. Lastly, cities
far away from other cities might have roads built towards them precisely because
of their isolation. We thus drop isolated cities, and alternatively, countries where
cities are relatively far from each other on average.

Addressing correlated regional growth. Note that in (6) the instruments are
constructed using the population of the other cities d in t - 10 as weights for
the changes in travel times/roads. While we control for the initial population of
city o in t - 10, we cannot control for the initial population of all nearby cities in
t - 10. However, if city o 's past growth (between t - 30 and t - 10) is correlated
with the past population growth and thus population level of the other cities d ,
these weights could also be endogenous. In that case, the instruments may not
satisfy the exclusion restriction. One solution to this problem is to use the initial
population of the other cities d in 1960, as opposed to t - 10, as weights in the
instruments.28 Alternatively, we use population in 1960 (or t-10) to define not
just the instruments but also the main change in market access variable: MAot =
                   
       P d ,1960 -
                 od t
                      . We do not use population in 1960 in our baseline specification
d =o
because only half of the cities with a population of over 10,000 at some point
since 1960 had a population above 10,000 in 1960. These cities are generally
substantially larger than the full sample average.

       Finally, road investments far away from city o may be endogenous if city o 's
region is large and road investments far away are targeted at other cities in that
region because of their growth or decline. In this case, investments far away may

population in (6). We thus run this test on a sample dropping the 1980s as well.

 be correlated with regional growth/decline which may also be correlated with
 city o 's growth/decline. We will address this issue by showing that regions are
 not large in our sample and by directly controlling for the growth of other cities
 in the same region as city o , using various definitions for "regions".

 3. Results: Average Effects
 3.1. OLS Results

 Table 1 Panel A reports estimates of equation (2), along with variants adding
 and removing lags and leads. In this and all subsequent tables, values of the
 dependent variable are multiplied by 100, so that coefficient can be interpreted
 as elasticities multiplied by 100.             In Column 1, only the contemporaneous
 change in market access is included. It has a modest impact on city population,
 with an elasticity of 1.3%. Columns 2­4 add lagged changes in market access
 from previous decades. Changes in market access in the decade prior to the
 population change in question and in the decade prior to that each appear to
 have broadly similar but somewhat smaller effects. The overall effect of a 10%
 increase in market access in each decade, across these three decades, is thus over
 0.3%.29 In column 4, the prior decade, 30 years before the measured population
 change, has a smaller effect that is imprecisely measured. We thus only include
 two lags for the rest of the paper, so the sample contains the three decades 1980­
 2010.30 Appendix Table A.3 contains descriptive statistics for this main sample.

          In column 5, we investigate reverse causality by adding a lead to the column
 3 specification; it is small and insignificant. The last row of coefficients in Table
 1 Panel A reports the sum of the contemporaneous coefficients and all included
 lags. Once the second lag is included, the overall 30-year effect is quite stable,
 regardless of the presence of the lead, with an elasticity of 3.4­4.2%.




     29
      To see this, note that our results imply that a change in market access between t - 30 and
 t - 20 has impacts in three decades: t - 30 to t - 20, t - 20 to t - 10, and t - 10 to t , so the overall
 30-year elasticity is the sum of the contemporaneous elasticity and the two lags.
   30
      The 2-lag specification has lower Aikike and Bayesian information criteria than the 3-lag one.

3.2. Instrumental Variables (IV) Results

IV Results. Table 1 Panel B reports the results of the IV specifications where
the instruments defined in equation (6) are used to disentangle the causal
effect of market access due to roads on city growth.31 Columns 1­3 instrument
with changes in market access due only to roads built more than 5, 10 and
15 cells away, thus excluding changes due to roads built nearby as well as
recent city growth everywhere.             As expected, the instrument is stronger at
lower radii, because it includes road changes closer to the city. Effects are
larger than in the OLS specification, with 30-year elasticities between 8.3% and
16.5%, increasing with the radius. Alternatively, these results imply that a one
standard deviation increase in market access growth is associated with a 0.43-
0.85 standard deviation increase in city population growth. The first lag is larger
than the contemporaneous term for IV10 and IV15, though not significantly so.
This may be because the contemporaneous term includes roads build late in a
decade, with little time to have an impact. Moreover, Section 3.4. shows that
population effects are slower to develop than effects on night lights.

      If we add a lead, instrumented analogously, it is not significantly different
from zero. Thirty-year elasticities are somewhat smaller, between 6.6% and 9.1%
(Appendix Table A.5). However, this specification requires dropping the 2000s,
and doing that alone has a similar effect (Appendix Table A.8, row 14).

IV vs. OLS Estimates. The fact that the IV estimates are larger than the OLS
is consistent with the literature (Redding and Turner, 2015). While the initial
identification concern in this literature was that more roads are built to cities
expected to grow faster, in practice, roads appear to be more likely to have been
built toward lagging cities. Indeed, before the 1960s when most sample countries
became independent, European powers disproportionately built roads around
the capital city. For example, Herbst (2000, p.167) writes: "The colonialists
essentially built the minimum number of roads necessary to rule [...] That means
that colonies with large geographic masses had relatively low road stock because
most of the road building under white rule was concentrated around the capital."

 31
      The corresponding first stage regressions are reported in Appendix Table A.4
22                      REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 After 1960, African governments increasingly built roads towards remote regions.
 For example, O'Connor (1978, p.156) explains that "many new highways have
 been built into less developed districts [in African countries]." Consistent with
 this, in our sample market access is mean-reverting. When we regress log change
 in market access on log market access in t-10 with our baseline controls, we find
 an elasticity of -0.06***. Using log distance to the capital and the two largest cities
 in 1960 as an alternative measure of initial remoteness gives similar results.

     The higher IV could reflect heterogeneity in the overall effect, if the cities
 most likely to be impacted by road changes far away (the "compliers") are
 cities for which changes in market access have stronger effects.            However,
 below in Section 4., we show that the compliers are cities for which changes
 in market access have if anything smaller effects, especially with the larger-
 radius instruments. Therefore, we expect that IV strategies measure local average
 treatment effects that are no larger than the average effect.

     Downward bias may be the result of measurement error in the market access
 measure. If measurement error in road coverage is correlated across space, as is
 likely given that road projects often span more than one cell, instruments relying
 on nearer roads (i.e., IV5 for which the exclusion radius is 5 cells) may also be
 affected by the same measurement error. If so, instruments relying on roads
 farther away (e.g., IV15) could reduce measurement error because they (or their
 own classical measurement error) are less correlated with the measurement error
 of the instrumented market access variable. However, as we show in Appendix
 Section A.7, this also depends on the strength of the instruments, and IV15
 is weaker. We thus cannot know the extent to which our instruments reduce
 measurement error.

     Finally, since larger exclusion circles remove more local road-building,
 instruments based on them are more likely to satisfy the exclusion restriction,
 so IV15 should be more excludable than IV5.            However, the higher-radius
 instruments are also weaker, especially in several robustness checks, which
 means any violation of the exclusion restriction creates a larger bias. Thus, to
 be conservative, we emphasize the IV5­IV10 results.
   THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 23



   In summary, we expect that the IV coefficients are higher than the OLS most
likely due to omitted variable bias and potentially due to measurement error,
though it is possible that for the weakest instruments, especially IV15, the large
magnitudes reflect violations of the exclusion restriction.

Magnitude. We find a 30-year elasticity of 0.08­0.13, with a slightly wider range
in robustness checks below. This implies that a 10% increase in market access
will increase city populations by 0.8 to 1.3%. How might one increase market
access by 10%, given our assumptions? In a symmetric context where all roads
are unpaved, paving a random 3.1% of them, or improving 3.5%, would increase
market access by 10%. In a context where all roads are improved, paving 7.4% of
them would similarly increase MA by 10%.

   The magnitude of the effects we find is smaller than the 0.25 to 0.3 reported
for total population in U.S. counties by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), the
most similar specification to ours in the literature. There are several possible
reasons for this. First, there are likely to be higher costs of trade and migration
in this context, especially between countries and across ethnic territories, in part
because of limited land markets. In that sense our context may be closer to China
with its restrictive Hukou system. Second, there was much lower economic
growth overall in our context. Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) study the period
1870­1890, when the U.S. was experiencing its Second Industrial Revolution and
receiving massive inflows of immigrants. They also estimate discrete effects of
rail construction on agricultural land prices, which allows for a comparison to a
wider literature. As noted by Redding and Turner (2015), these discrete effects
are substantially larger than the effects of roads and railroads on land prices and
wages elsewhere in the literature, by a factor of two or more in some cases. We
make no comparison to the literature identifying direct effects of nearby roads as
our context lacks a source of variation identifying them separately. Section 3.4.
compares effects on night lights to related literature.

3.3. Robustness checks

As discussed in Section 2.3., there are several reasons why faraway road changes
may not satisfy the exclusion restriction. In Table 2, we investigate how results
24                        REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 change when we account for: (i) selected non-local road changes; (ii) growth
 hubs; and (iii) correlated regional growth. Rows are structured like Table 1 Panel
 B but only report overall 30-year effects. In many cases, the 15-cell instrument
 becomes somewhat weaker.

 Excluding selected non-local road changes. Rows 1­3 exclude cities with any co-
 investment, radial extension outward, and radial extension inward, respectively,
 as defined above. In each case, we define the inner ring between 2 and 3 cells
 from the city, and the outer ring 15­16 cells away. Sample sizes fall by 40­
 65%, but results are generally consistent with the baseline. Row 4 redefines the
 instrument excluding any road building within the convex hull of the 5-, 10- and
 15-cell exclusion circle and the nearest city of at least 100 thousand. This convex
 hull is the area where a road to such a nearby large city is most likely to be built.
 Row 5 excludes roads deemed transcontinental in early 1960s maps from the
 instrument (i.e. in constructing the instrument, they are assumed to remain with
 their t - 10 speed in t ). Results change little.32

 Dropping potential growth hubs. Row 6 drops from the sample each country's
 5 largest cities and national and regional capitals from 1960. This is akin to
 the identification strategies of Michaels (2008) and Faber (2014), in that they
 do not rely on large cities, whose growth has driven the placement of road
 construction. Instead, they rely on small cities, which were more likely to be
 connected incidentally. Results are similar to baseline.33

 Correlated regional growth. In row 7, population is fixed at its 1960 level in
 constructing the instruments, and in row 8, in constructing the instrumented
 market access (MA) as well. Row 9 reports results controlling for regional growth,
 i.e. the growth between t -10 and t of the other cities belonging to the same region
     32
      Appendix Section A.8 and Appendix Table A.6 report several variants of these specifications.
     33
      Appendix Section A.8 and Appendix Table A.7 report specifications dropping several other
 sets of cities with features that might be driving road construction, including nearby national
 cities, isolation, mines, cash crops, presidential origins, ports, airports, border crossings
 and national parks and unusually large positive or negative changes in population or MA,
 and controlling for local conflict and neighboring country's growth, among other potentially
 correlated factors. Appendix Section A.8 and Appendix Table A.8 show that results are similar
 if we drop countries that became independent late or country-decades in which the country
 experienced a war, received refugees or suffered a multi-year drought
      THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 25



as the city. We define regions in three ways: administratively (1960 provinces),
along ethnic lines (ethnic zones from Murdock (1959)), and geometrically (circles
of different radii). Provinces and ethnic groups are not large in our sample.
A 15-cell radius circle ( 90, 000km 2 ) is at the the 50th and 88th percentiles,
respectively, of the province and ethnic area size distributions. In other words,
50% of provinces and 88% of ethnic areas are smaller that our largest exclusion
zones. In row 9, we simultaneously control for total population growth of the
other cities of the same 1960 province and ethnic area and circle of 15 cells. We
drop cities for which one of these three growth rates is likely to be imprecisely
measured because the region does not contain at least two other cities. The
effects are somewhat smaller, at 6.1­8.7%, and the IV10 and IV15 instruments
considerably weaker.34

      To control even more flexibly for any nearby trends, in row 10 we add
province-year fixed effects, using provinces from 1960, the beginning of our
sample period. There are 287 provinces and 804 province-years in our sample
of 4725 observations, hence only about 6 observations per province-year on
average, with considerable variation depending on the density of provinces
across countries. Two hundred fifty of the 804 province-years have exactly one
city-year, so they do not help to identify the effect of interest. Another 125 have
two city-years. Thus, roughly half of the province-years, which provided roughly
10% of the degrees of freedom on the baseline specification now provide less
than 3%. OLS and IV5 coefficients fall substantially, and IV10 and IV15 are again
quite likely to be weak.

      Given the variation in the way countries define provinces, we try an
alternative strategy in row 11. Here we divide each country into four quadrants
relative to the median latitude and longitude of the country, and control for
quadrant-year fixed effects. There are 138 quadrants and 395 quadrant-years
represented in the sample. OLS, IV5 and IV10 coefficients fall by a quarter to a
third from baseline but remain precisely estimated. The IV15 instrument is again
quite weak and its coefficient falls further.

 34
      Appendix Section A.8 and Appendix Table A.6 report variants on these specifications.
26                         REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 Other specification and sample checks. Appendix Section A.9 and Appendix
 Table A.8 drop various sets of countries and country-years for which population
 and/or road data are likely to be measured with the most error. It also reports
 results for samples varying the city population threshold, including a fully
 balanced panel. Results are generally very similar to baseline.

     In Appendix Section A.10 and Appendix Table A.9, we further consider
 alternative specifications and functional forms. We show the effects are broadly
 robust to: (i) removing controls; (ii) replacing the country-decade fixed effects
 with decade fixed effects; (iii) clustering by country; (iv) weighting observations
 by initial population; (v) using alternative speeds; (vi) allowing railroad travel;
 (vii) using alternative values of  ; (viii) adding uniform costs of crossing borders;
 (ix) using iceberg costs with an example container value; (x) excluding sample
 countries bordering non-sample regions in South Africa, North Africa or the
 Arabian Peninsula, as their market access may be differentially underestimated.
 Defining market access changes due to paving alone and improving alone
 suggests that if anything market access changes due to improving have slightly
 larger effects (Appendix Table A.9). This difference is not statistically significant,
 and of course it is sensitive to the speed assigned to each surface.35

     Appendix Table A.10 considers alternative specifications that control for
 access to total (urban and rural) population and to mines, each of which might
 also make a location more attractive. There is no evidence of an impact of either
 of these alternative measures, and little effect on the main urban market access
 coefficient, though both new variables are likely to be highly mismeasured.

 3.4. Effects on Night Lights

 We expect better market access in a city to increase population in the context
 of a wide class of models allowing for spatial equilibrium. Our results, implying
 that populations may take up to 30 years to reallocate, suggest that the resulting
 migration is costly. In the interim away from equilibrium, the increase in market
 access could produce an increase in welfare, via lower prices and increased

  35
     As we discuss in the same Appendix Section and Table, regressing t       t -10 ln(Population)   on
 t
 t -30 ln(Market Access) results in a standardized effect that is about half as large as baseline.
      THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 27



productivity and wages. Unfortunately, in this data-poor context, we do not have
panel data on wages, prices, or amenities at the city level.

      To explore this idea, we consider changes in night lights as a proxy for overall
output.36 The sample includes 3,591 observations, for the periods 1992­2000 and
2000­2010 only, because lights data begin in 1992. Appendix Table A.11 panel A
shows that the 30-year overall effects on population for this restricted sample are
similar to those for the full samples.

      Table 3 reports results for night lights. While OLS estimates of the market
access coefficients are not large and much less precisely specified than in the
population regressions of Table 1, in each IV specification, market access has
substantially larger effects on lights than on population.                  The effect size is
comparable to what Alder (2019) finds for the Golden Quadrilateral in India,
but substantially larger than the 0.2­0.3 found by Chiovelli et al. (2018) in post-
conflict Mozambique, where transport costs fall due to both road-building and
landmine clearance. The effects are entirely in the first decade. Appendix
Table A.11 panel B shows that the effect on night lights per capita is also
only contemporaneous in IV estimates. In panel C, the effect on population
controlling for contemporaneous night lights change are also substantially
positive but limited to the two lags. These results suggest that roads increase
economic activity relatively quickly (in the first decade), while the population
effects take much longer to evolve (over three decades). This is consistent with
slow migration limiting the transition to spatial equilibrium, as Chauvin et al.
(2017) show for India.37

3.5. Channels: Induced Urbanization, Reallocation and Natural Increase

Results shown thus far do not allow us to distinguish between different sources of
population growth from the perspective of an individual city. Increased market
access could induce a city to grow by attracting rural residents (what we call
induced urbanization), by attracting urban residents from other cities (urban
 36
     Henderson et al. (2012) show that in a sample of developing countries, changes in night lights
are correlated with changes in GDP   , with an elasticity of about 0.3.
  37
     Gollin et al. (2017) argue more broadly that urbanization trends in the developing world are
inconsistent with simple static notions of spatial equilibrium.
28                        REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 reallocation), or by increasing its differential of births over deaths (urban natural
 increase). In this section we provide evidence about the sources of this growth
 and discuss important limits of that evidence. Broadly speaking, we find some
 evidence against reallocation and evidence for a small role of natural increase.
 This suggests to us that to the extent we can rely on this evidence, the residual
 category of induced urbanization is likely to be responsible for the plurality of
 the effect.

          Our first piece of evidence against reallocation is that only 18% of sub-
 Saharan African population was urban (based on localities above 10,000) in 1980
 at the beginning of the regression sample, and this number increased only to
 28% by 2010. This means that the pool of rural potential migrants was always 3-4
 times as large as the pool of urban potential migrants.38

          Table 4 provides some further evidence distinguishing between the first
 two possibilities. In rows 2­4, we restrict to country-decades with successively
 smaller urban shares in year t - 30. With low urbanization rates, they have the
 most limited sources of potential urban-urban migrants, and are therefore least
 likely to see reallocation across cities. In row 2, restricting to country-years under
 the median urbanization rate (18%) has very little effect on results. In row 3,
 restricting to the bottom quartile (<10%) reduces magnitudes somewhat more,
 though in the case of IV15, this may be driven by instrument weakness in a
 small sample. Furthermore, using only the lowest-urbanization decile (<7%) of
 countries in row 4, results are more similar to the full sample (though again the
 IV15 and now IV10 instruments are quite weak).

          Row 5­8 offer a more direct test of local reallocation. Each row repeats
 the baseline regression on successively larger units of analysis, created by
 aggregating individual cells into mutually exclusive square blocks, or mega-cells.
 In row 5, each unit is a 3x3 square of the original units. Because some such 3x3
 squares contain multiple cities, the sample size shrinks. By row 8, the average
 9x9 square contains approximately two cities. If all urban growth induced by

     38
    This differs from the context of middle- or high-income countries like China (urban share 
 55% today) and the U.S. (80%). Urban reallocation is mechanically more likely there.
   THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 29



roads was pure reallocation within such 9x9 grid squares, we would expect no
effect on this sample. Effects do on average become smaller and noisier, with
weaker instruments, as is expected given the smaller sample size, but they are
generally at least half as large as baseline results, suggesting that the majority
of the effect is not due to local reallocation. We cannot distinguish reallocation
between cities across longer distances using this method, as aggregation to larger
squares produces small sample sizes and weak instruments. However, to the
extent that most migration is local, this is important evidence against a large role
for urban reallocation.

   From the perspective of central place theory (Christaller, 1933), longer-
distance migration is especially likely to the largest cities. Appendix Table A.12
repeats the tests of rows 5­8, restricting the sample to mega-cells that do not
contain the capital or any of the 5 largest cities or regional capitals of each
country in 1960. These mega-cells are the least likely to be destinations of long
distance migration, especially if there are ethnic differences across mega-cells.
Results are again noisy but similar. They do not rule out urban reallocation, but
they are broadly inconsistent with the story that our results are driven mostly by
urban residents migrating up the urban hierarchy to the largest cities.

   To consider the possibility that the effect on population is driven by urban
natural increase, we replace population growth in our baseline specification with
the rate of natural increase (RNI) based on the infant mortality rate (IMR) and
the crude fertility rate (CFR) for women 15­33 estimated for 751 cell-decades
using data for 16 countries from the Demographic and Health Surveys. We
convert each city's CFR to a crude birth rate (CBR) using its country-years's
share of women 15­33 in the overall population. We convert the IMR to a crude
death rate (CDR) using the country-year-level regression relationship between
IMR and CDR in our overall sample. Appendix Section A.4 describes the details
of generating these estimates.     The city-decade-specific RNI is then simply
the CBR minus the CDR. Given the small values of RNI involved (so that the
approximation x  ln(1 + x ) works well), we interpret these percentage changes
as good approximations of the natural increase component of  ln(population).
30                     REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



     Table 4 row 9 reports results of our baseline specification for this limited
 sample of 751 cell-decades. Results are remarkably similar to baseline on this
 small sample, though the instruments are quite weak. Row 10 reports results for
 the same sample with RNI as the dependent variable. Focusing on IV5, the effect
 of market access on RNI is positive and about one third of the effect of market
 access on population growth. The OLS regression shows no effect on RNI. The
 other, weaker, instruments suggest that about half of induced population growth
 is RNI.

     There are at least two broad reasons to be cautious about this result. The
 first is likely upward bias in the share of induced population growth assigned
 to RNI because we cannot know whether the births we measure took place in
 the city, or rather to mothers that subsequently moved to the city. This means
 that births we assign to the city could instead be births that happened elsewhere,
 and thus likely represent migrants instead, to the extent that children move with
 their mothers. While the converse is also true (mothers who gave birth in the
 city and then moved away are not captured), to the extent that urban-to-rural
 migration is less prevalent (and rural fertility rates are higher), the overall role
 of natural increase is likely to be overstated. The second is that there is a lot
 of noise in this result, not all of which is likely to be captured in the standard
 errors because this is a small subset of our overall sample, roughly one sixth of
 the total. Among other reasons, all the instruments, including IV5, are quite
 weak in this sample (but of course not differentially so between RNI and total
 population change, so this does not imply bias in the RNI share). In addition,
 all of the demographic estimates are based on relatively small samples of births
 in each city, and the translation from CFR and IMR to CBR and CDR relies on
 relationships in national-level data that are themselves interpolated.

     To the extent that this result is correct, it is inconsistent with the standard
 theoretical prediction associated with the demographic transition that if MA
 increases income it should therefore reduce fertility. A possible reason for this is
 that the induced migrants have high fertility relative to existing urban residents,
 because migrants tend to be young, in high fertility age groups. (Note that this
   THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 31



is separate from the measurement issue discussed above ­ here we are talking
about births that happened after a migrant moved to the city.)

   Alternatively, in Row 11, we report the baseline regression on the same DHS
sample with controls for contemporaneous CFR and IMR. Results are similar to
baseline, with the same caveats as above: a small sample, weak instruments, and
measurement error in demographic rates (which could now bias the coefficients
of interest in either direction). They however suggest more strongly that natural
increase is not driving the bulk of our main effect.

4. Results: Heterogeneous Effects

Transport investments may have different effects depending on the local context
in which they take place. Table 5 explores heterogeneity of results with respect to
several factors highlighted in recent literature on economic geography, structural
change, and political economy. As in Tables 2 and 4, each row shows 30-year
estimates of a variant of equation (2). We control for the dummy variable shown
at left and interact it with contemporaneous and lagged changes in market
access, and the analogous instruments. For the IV5 estimation strategy the table
reports the 30-year coefficient for the dummy=0 group, the dummy=1 group,
and the difference; for IV10 and IV15, which are weaker instruments, only the
difference is reported. At left, each row also reports first stage Kleibergen-Paap
F-statistics and the share ("Sh") of the dummy=1 group.

   These exercises are demanding on the data, with six endogenous variables
and six instruments per regression. Therefore, each type of heterogeneity is
considered one at a time. All in all, differences shown are illustrative of broadly
consistent general patterns but not all are robustly significantly different from
zero across the four specifications.

Economic Geography. Row 1 of Table 5 compares cities above and below the
median in distance to the country's top (capital, largest and second largest) cities
in 1960. More remote cities see stronger effects of a marginal improvement. This
is consistent with decreasing marginal returns to transportation investments,
and suggests that remoteness raises their returns. Appendix Table A.13 also
32                         REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 shows that cities initially (in t - 30) smaller than their country's median city
 generally see larger effects. Core-periphery models predict that reduced trade
 costs increase the size of big cities more than small cities. If anything, reduced
 trade costs lead to a decentralization of urban population in our context.39

 Physical Geography. Sub-Saharan Africa has a large agricultural workforce,
 and much urbanization reflects workers moving out of agriculture. Cities in
 regions with differing levels of agricultural suitability may thus be more or less
 able to take advantage of better transport to attract workers into secondary and
 tertiary sectors. Row 2 shows variation with respect to a measure of agricultural
 land suitability within one cell of the city, cutting the sample at 25% percent
 suitability.40 The weaker IV10 and IV15 instruments suggest that cities near
 worse land are more positively affected by increases in market access. This is
 consistent with a smaller opportunity cost of leaving poor farmland, and with
 cities in less agricultural areas specializing in more transport intensive activities
 that benefit more from the roads. The OLS and IV5 estimates are much noisier
 and in opposite directions.41

 Political Geography. Row 3 of Table 5 allows for a differential effect for city-
 decades of road-building that may have been favored because they were within
 150 km of the place of origin of a head of state in power for at least two years
 in the decade (the mean decade-specific tenure). We use 150 km because this
 represents a 3­4 hour driving time from the hometown given a driving speed
 of 40-60 kph (what we assume for improved/paved roads). The differential is
     39
      Appendix Section A.12 and Appendix Table A.13 show that differentials based on each of the
 following are in the consistent direction: (i) distance below the median to the country's top cities
 in both 1960 and 2010, the continent's top cities in 1960, or dropping the top cities in 1960; (ii)
 access below the median to paved/improved roads (in 1960), railroads (1960), ports (1960 or
 2005), or airports (2007); (iii) market access below the country's 25th, 50th or 75th percentile or
 the continental median; and (iv) population below the country's 25th or 75th percentile in t - 30,
 or the continental median, or alternatively dropping the top cities in 1960.
   40
      FAO's Global Agroecological Zones (GAEZ) dataset defines crop-specific land suitability
 based on soils, terrain and climate. Overall land suitability here is the maximum suitability across
 all potential crops (see Appendix Section A.5).
   41
      We find generally analogous effects when we cut the sample at 75% suitability, define
 suitability based on food crops or cash crops only, and when we study interaction effects with
 rainfall (see Appendix Section A.12 and Appendix Table A.14). We find less evidence of a
 differential for cities closer to mines, a sector whose labor intensity varies.
      THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 33



negative, suggesting that changes in market access have smaller effects when
roads are built towards the cities surrounding the place of origin of a head of state
(the p-value for the coefficient of the difference for IV15 is 0.103). However, the
instruments are even weaker here than in rows 1 and 2. In Appendix Section A.12,
we report more results that overall suggest stronger negative effects for leaders
with a longer tenure and whose regime is not democratic.42

      A leader's origin penalty is surprising given that such areas were likely to also
get complementary public investments and subsidies, which should increase
the returns to transportation investments. The uninteracted effect of the leader
favoritism dummy has a positive and significant coefficient between 0.05 and
0.07 (not shown), implying that cities around the leader's place of origin grow
faster than the country's other cities controlling for market access. It is however
consistent with the idea that such roads were politically but not economically
optimal. Conversely, and unlike large cities in general, regional capitals see
if anything larger effects of market access on their growth, consistent with,
for example, complementarity between government services and transport-
sensitive activities (see Appendix Section A.12 and Appendix Table A.14).

First stage heterogeneity and local average treatment effects (LATEs). The
results from Table 5 suggest that market access has stronger effects on the
population of more remote cities. As noted in Section 3.2., the market access
of remote cities could also be more strongly influenced by faraway road changes
than the market access of less remote cities. In this case, both the first and second
stage effects in our baseline IV regressions could be increasing with remoteness.
Since IV estimates reflect the LATE, this is a possible explanation for why our
baseline IV estimates in Table 1 are larger than their OLS counterparts. In that
case, we would expect the overall average effect to be lower than the LATE.

      To consider this possibility, we investigate heterogeneity by remoteness (far
from top 1960 cities) in the first stage in Appendix Table A.15 panel A. For each
instrument set (IV5, IV10, and IV15), there are three first stage equations, one
 42
   Appendix Section A.12 and Appendix Table A.14 show that the differential is consistently
negative, though often not precisely estimated, when varying the distance, the minimum tenure
and other aspects of the specification.
34                          REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 for each lag (t - 30 to t - 20, t - 20 to t - 10 and t - 10 to t ). More remote cities
 have if anything a weaker first stage relationship than less remote cities. This
 suggests that our main effects capture LATEs that that are concentrated among
 less remote places, where results from Table 5 suggest that market access has
 weaker effects. Thus we expect that the overall average effect of market access is
 if anything larger than the LATEs estimated in Table 1.43

 Foreign, domestic, overland and overseas. The effect of market access may also
 depend on what markets are being accessed. Measures of market access shown
 so far assume that crossing a border is costless, but that crossing an ocean is
 infinitely costly. Results in Appendix Table A.9 show that adding substantial
 uniform border costs has little effect on results. In Table 6, we decompose market
 access, first into access to domestic cities versus foreign cities within sub-Saharan
 Africa, and then into access overland to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa versus
 access to overseas markets, proxied by access to cities with a port. For market
 access to foreign cities, we construct an instrument restricting attention to roads
 built outside the country rather than outside a radius (IV-Foreign); all other terms
 are instrumented as above, calculating access only to the set of destinations
 under study. There are six endogenous variables (two market accesses × three
 lags) and six instruments, so instrument sets are weaker.

          Row 1 of Table 6 reports the effects of domestic vs. foreign market access. The
 six instruments always include IV-Foreign and its two lags, while the remaining
 three differ by column as shown.                Access to domestic markets consistently
 increases the size of cities. The impact of access to foreign cities is smaller,
 indistinguishable from zero in all IV specifications.44

          Row 2 investigates the effects of overland vs. overseas market access. We treat
     43
      Panels B and C show analogous results based on an alternative form of remoteness (less than
 median 1960 MA; panel B) and city size (population below the national median in t - 30; panel C).
 The coefficients of interest are highlighted in bold in the table. If anything, the differential effects
 are more negative for IV15 than for IV5, another indication that the IV effect does not increase
 with the radius because it captures the LATEs of smaller and more remote places.
   44
      Connections to wealthier cities/countries may be more important than connections to
 poorer cities/countries. However, Appendix Section A.12 and Appendix Table A.16 show that
 results are similar when market access is constructed weighting destination city populations by
 their country's contemporaneous per capita GDP.
       THE AVERAGE AND HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS 35



market access to 44 major ports in 2005 as a proxy for overseas market access
because ports are the primary conduits of international trade. Overseas market
access thus capture road changes and population changes for the cities with a
2005 port. While we do not have comprehensive historical measures of port
traffic, the port cities' 2010 populations are highly correlated (at 0.68) with their
port traffic volume (in 20-foot equivalent units) in 2005. We thus believe that the
population of a port city is a reasonable proxy for port traffic.45 Overland market
access captures access to cities without a major port in 2005. The two measures
are correlated at 0.31. The six instruments always include IV5 and its two lags for
overland, while the remaining three for overseas differ by column as shown. 46

       Rising access to overland markets generally increases the size of cities. Point
estimates suggest that overseas access (to non-African countries) is generally
more important that foreign access (to other African countries), but it is only
significantly different from zero for IV10 and IV15.47

Summary.        We find suggestive evidence that the effect of market access is
stronger for: (i) remote (and small) cities; (ii) cities whose hinterlands do not
have a comparative advantage in agriculture; and (iii) cities less likely to be
politically favored, except for administrative reasons. Since we control for initial
city size, this is not convergence per se, but these are different (and largely
uncorrelated) components of being less developed. Market access to domestic
cities matters more than access to foreign cities, but international ports do
matter. Although these results vary somewhat across specifications, they provide
suggestive evidence that transportation investments may be heterogeneous

  45
     We use a list of 44 major ports from 2005 rather than a 1960 list because several small colonial
ports declined after independence, and new ports emerged and grew fast before 2005. We thus
believe that the 2005 list better represents the overall location of ports during the 1960-2010
period. For 36 ports with the relevant data, in 1960 log population was correlated with log exports
and imports at 0.63 and 0.74, respectively. As noted below, results are similar using 1960 ports.
  46
     We control for log distance to the coast interacted with country-year change fixed effects, as
we do not want overseas access to capture trends specific to coastal areas. In many countries,
coastal and hinterland areas have distinct geographies and histories and have experienced
different evolutions after 1960 (Austin, 2007).
  47
     Appendix Section A.12 and Appendix Table A.16 show effects are similar when: (i) dropping
the ports themselves and nearby cities; (ii) including the ports in calculating overland market
access and its instrument; (iii) using 1960 populations; and (iv) using 1960 instead of 2005 ports.
36                     REMI JEDWAB AND ADAM STOREYGARD



 depending on the context in which they are placed.

 5. Concluding Discussion

 We find that increased market access due to road construction in Africa since
 1960 has accelerated city growth, not only at the time of construction but in the
 subsequent two decades as well. We report suggestive evidence that effects are
 due primarily to induced urbanization, and that they differ by context. They
 are larger for smaller and more isolated cities, and market access changes to
 domestic rather than foreign cities, and weaker in politically favored and more
 agriculturally suitable areas.

     In Appendix Section A.13, using additional assumptions we quantify
 aggregate effects from two perspectives: in terms of new urban residents induced
 to move to the city during the sample period due to roads built, and in terms
 of new predicted urban residents due to the proposed Trans-African Highway
 (TAH) network. Under the scenario of no reallocation across cities, our estimates
 attribute 3­6% of the intensive margin increase in the urban share between
 1960 and 2010 to these road upgrades. Applying our estimated elasticities to
 the proposed TAH network suggests a comparable effect on the urbanization
 projected over the subsequent 30 years.

     Several mechanisms could be driving our results.      Most theoretical and
 empirical work has focused on reductions in the cost of transporting goods.
 However, other work show that reduced intercity transport costs encourage the
 flow of information and labor. Future work will be needed to disentangle these
 channels and to consider what an optimal road network would look like, given
 the region's heterogeneity in physical, economic, and political geography.

 Notes: Panel (a): We instrument city o 's change in market access to other cities (here, d1 ­d4 ) with
 the change in market access due to road changes far away (i.e., outside the dashed circle) while
 fixing population of all cities at their initial levels. The exclusion restriction is that road changes
 outside (here, r2 , r3 , r4 , r5 , r8 and r10 ) are exogenous. Robustness checks exclude (i) cities in
 which inner and outer roads, defined as passing through the cell-based equivalent of the inner
 and outer gray bars in the figure) are upgraded in the same octant in the same decade (e.g. r 1 and
 r 2 ; co-investment); (ii) cities where an outer road (r 2 ) is built in an octant where an inner road
 (r 1 ) is already paved or improved (radial extension outward); and (iii) cities where an inner road
 is upgraded in the decade after an outer road in the same octant is improved. Panel (b) In the
 convex hull strategy, all roads built near the line from city o to the largest city of 100,000 (d 1 ) are
 excluded. Specifically, that region is the gray area, defined as the convex hull of city o 's exclusion
 circle and d 1 . Here, any changes in r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , and r 4 are excluded, leaving only changes in r 5 .

in market access measures shown, where t indexes years 1960 to 2010. "Overall Effect" is the
sum of the contemporaneous effect and all lags shown. Each regression controls for country-
year-change fixed effects, ln(urban population) in t - 10, and third order polynomials in
longitude and latitude interacted with year fixed effects. In columns 2­4 of Panel B, measures
of ln Market Access that exclude road surface changes within the radius shown (5, 10 and 15

     Notes: This table is structured like Table 2. Rows 2­4 limit the sample to countries below the
     urbanization rates shown. Rows 5­8: Baseline regressions for mega-cells that are a 3x3, 5x5,
     7x7 or 9x9 square of the original 1x1 cells, respectively. The instruments are defined for the
     central cell of the mega-cell. Rows 9­11 use the sample of cell-decades with DHS data and
     drop the ln(pop t -10 ) control. In rows 9 and 11 the dependent variable is 100t t -10 ln (urban
     population); in row 10 it is 100*RNI. Robust SEs, clustered by 1960 province, are in brackets.

Notes: Each row reports results from variants of Table 1 (N=4,725), where the three market
access variables are interacted with the dummy variable shown at left. IV5 results show the
30-year (t - 30 to t ) effect for both groups, along with the differential between them. The OLS,
IV10 and IV15 columns show the differential only. The 1st stage F-statistics ("F") and the share
of cell-decade-changes with the dummy equal to one ("Sh") are reported in the left column.
Robust SEs, clustered by 1960 province, are in brackets. *, **, *** = 10, 5, 1% significance.

Notes: Each column contains summed 30-year coefficients from two separate regressions. In
row (1), market access to domestic and foreign cities, and their lags, are entered separately
(N=4,697). The six instruments always include IV-Foreign and its two lags for foreign cities,
while the remaining three (for domestic) differ by column as shown. In row (2), market access
to overland and overseas cities, and their lags, are entered separately (N=4,723). The six
instruments always include IV5 and its two lags for overland cities, while the remaining three
(for overseas) differ by column as shown. In addition to our standard controls from Table 1
we control for log distance to the coast interacted with country-year change FE. Robust SEs,
clustered by 1960 province, are in brackets. *, **, *** = 10, 5, 1% significance.
