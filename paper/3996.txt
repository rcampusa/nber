   LOCAL VERSUS GLOBAL CONVERGENCE ACROSS NATIONAL ECONOMIES


                                         ABSTRACT


      This paper reexamines the ability of the Solow-type growth models to explain the

pattern of cross-country growth rates. Recent authors, most notably Mankiw. Romer and

Weil [1990], have argued that differences in national growth rates are compatible with the

view that each country has access to a common, neoclassical aggregate production function.

Such models imply that, conditional on population growth and savings rates, disparate

economies are converging over time to the same level of per capita output We argue that

cross-country growth is better explained by a model of local versus global convergence.

Countries converge locally in the sense that economies with similar initial conditions tend to

converge to one another. However, we find little evidence of convergence across economies

with substantially different initial conditions as measured by per capita output or literacy

rates. Further, the impact of capital formation on aggregate output increases with the level

of economic development. These results are consistent with models of multiple equilibria in

long run behavior. Our results suggest that the Solow growth model should be supplemented

with a theory of aggregate production function differences in order to fully explain

international growth patterns.

Introduction


        Starting with Baumol [1986], a number of authors have explored the behavior of
output growth across different aggregate economies. These authors have generally been
interested in understanding whether economies exhibit convergence — defined                as a
tendency for per capita output to equalize over time. This question has important
implications for the utility of various theoretical growth models. In particular, the
neoclassical growth model developed by Solow predicts that different economies will
converge in the sense that per capita output differences due to initial conditions will
asymptotically disappear as economies are assumed to have access to identical concavc
production technologies. The new growth theory pioneered by Romer [1986), Lucas
[1988], and Grossman and Helpman [1991], on the other hand, shows how various types
of production nonconvexities can interact with market imperfections to produce multiple
long run output equilibria for a given microeconomic specification, which means that per
capita output differences can be persistent.

        Much of the empirical work on convergence has been concerned with determining
whether poor economies grow faster than wealthier ones, which is equivalent to
identifying a negative cross-section correlation between a country's initial per capita
output and subsequent growth rate for a fixed period afterwards. Formally, if (Y/L)T
equals the per capita output of country i at T, convergence across a set of N countries is
said to occur over a fixed epoch r if the coefficient /3 in the cross-section regression


            ln(Y/L);,r÷ ln( Y/L)1,r = (+ 131n( Y/L)I,T+ JIX +c, I = 1...N                    (1)


is negative. Here, X1 denotes a set of control variables with associated coefficients II,
usually meant to control for microeconornic heterogeneity. A negative correlation is
generally necessary for income differences to narrow, although as shown in Bernard and
Durlauf [1991], the condition is far from sufficient.




                                               1
        Overall, the evidence on convergence is somewhat mixed, with results depending
on both the sample of countries studied as well as the choice of control variables. One
robust result is that in the absence of any control variables, a negative 3 canbe found for
OECD economies, as demonstrated by Baumol 119861 among others, whereas the value of
                                                                                      for a
fi is typically zero or even slightly positive when cross-section regressions are run
large country data set such as the one developed by Summers and Heston [1988], as
shown by many authors. Second, it is clear that there exist many plausible choices of X1
control variables which can extend the convergence results to a wide cross-section of
economies. For example, Barro [19911 shows how controlling for education, investment
rates and political stability, among other variables, can allow a negative $ to emerge for
the countries in the Summers-Heston data set.

        One of the most careful and provocative of the pro-convergence studies is due to
Mankiw, Romer and Well [1990] who study a cross-section regression where the control
variables are not ad hoc additions to the equation but rather are directly suggested by the
law of motion for per capita output produced by a human capital-augmented version of
the Solow model. These variables control for the rates of savings of human and physical
capital and the rates of population growth, technical change and depreciation- These
authors not only find that there is strong evidence of convergence for a broad country
sample, but also conclude that nearly 50% of the cross-country variation in growth can be
attributed to the Solow model.

         One difficulty with the body of cross-section studies is that they often do not
make clear the nature of the null and alternative models associated with a particular
statistical test. For example, does a negative j3 in a regression restricted to a group of
 advanced industrialized economies such as the OECD represent evidence supportive of the
 Solow model as opposed to the Romer-Lucas class of models? The answer is no. Many
 new growth models, such as Azariadis and Drazen [1990], imply the existence of several
 locally stable equilibria in long run per capita output. In their framework, the OECD
 could represent a group of economies which are converging to a (relatively) high



                                              2
production equilibrium. Such multiple equilibrium models predict that one will observe
convergence once one has isolated economies which are associated with the same
equilibrium. In this sense, restrictions of the cross-country sample under consideration
can lead to spurious inferences with respect to competing growth theories.

        Further, as argued in Bernard and Durlauf (1991), it is not clear that the
estimation of (1) will fail to produce a negative /3 for samples where convergence does not
hold. To see this, suppose that there exist M different long run equilibria for economies.
In addition, suppose that the "correct" model of the evolution of these economies is


                       —
                           ln( Y/L) i,T = (,+ 131n( Y/L)T + ll + c,    i = 1,.. .,N     (2)


where ( is determined by the country's long run equilibrium. In this case, the law of
motion for each economy is the same except for the constant term. A version of the
capital complementarities model described in Romer [1986] can be shown to obey an
equation of this type. The use of ( rather than of ( in the regression will, of course, bias
the coefficients.   However, this misspecified model will reject convergence only if /3
becomes nonnegative, which will depend in a complicated way on the covariance structure
of ( with the remaining right hand side variables. Bernard and Durlauf 119911 in fact
show that a negative j3 is compatible with a nontrivial class of multiple
equilibrium/endogenous growth models.
         Similarly, one can also see how the addition of control variables to the basic
equation (1) can spuriously induce a negative /3 for data generated by a multiple
equilibrium model. Proxying for the missing (, control variables can have the effect of
permitting the regression to separate countries into subgroups. For example, suppose
 that there are two equilibria for aggregate economies, which can be distinguished by
 different mean levels of growth. If some control variable r is added to equation (1)
 which positively correlates with the growth rates across economies (such as per capita
 years of schooling), the variable can act to segregate the data into different regimes and




                                              3
again lead to a negative estimate of /3.

        The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the cross-section behavior of growth
rates in the Summers-Heston data set to see in what sense the data are supportive of
convergence. We do this by distinguishing local convergence from global convergence.
By local convergence, we refer to the case where there exist groups of countries in the
ileston-Summers data set such that convergence occurs within the groups.           Global
convergence holds when all economies converge to one another.

       Our analysis takes the regressions studied by Mankiw, Romer and Weil (which
we shall designate as M-R-W) as a starting point and asks whether the same data are
compatible with, and indeed better (in a standard goodness-of-fit sense) modeled as
realizations from a model with multiple equilibria. We choose the M-R-W paper because
we regard it as the most compelling evidence in favor of the Solow model in the
literature. We do not dispute their conclusion that the Solow model has substantial
explanatory power for cross-country variation in growth rates. What we do is show that
extending the Solow model to allow for additional factors, in particular aggregate
production function differences, is important. In fact, by segregating countries, into
locally converging groups which allow for different aggregate production functions, we
find that the Solow model has substantially more explanatory power than has been
previously suggested.
         Our empirical conclusions are twofold. First, we provide evidence that there exist
 groups of countries exhibiting local rather than global convergence. Mechanically
 splitting the Summers-Heston data by either initial income or initial literacy generates a
 statistically significant improvement in the ability of a Solow-type model to explain
 growth rates within each group. We reject the null hypothesis that the groups of
 economies are converging to one another. Second, by applying both maximum likelihood
 and regression tree procedures to the data in order to endogenously identify convergence
 groups, we find that different countries in the data set obey very different production
 functions. Our analysis finds that the share of labor in total income tends to decline with



                                             4
the level of development as measured by initial income levels or literacy rates, implying
that, other things equal, more developed countries will have higher output/labor ratios
than implied by their capital/labor ratios alone. These results verify the idea of Baumol
[1986] that there may be several "convergence dubs" in the world economy.
        Methodologically, these results illustrate the sorts of specification and estimation
exercises which need to be applied in growth studies in order to identify the uniqueness
versus multiplicity of long run equilibria. Empirical work which seeks to assess those
theories necessarily must attempt to identify different data regimes in order to ensure
testing power. Our specification tests provide a way of overcoming the low power of
standard cross-section tests as documented in Bernard and Durlauf [1991 and our use of
maximum likelihood and regression tree methods illustrates a straightforward way of
identifying the different regimes.

        Section 1 reviews the link between standard growth models and the cross-section
regressions we study. Section 2 describes the data we analyze. Section 3 performs some
specification tests on cross-country regressions estimated on the Summers-Ileston data.
 Using initial income and literacy rates to segregate the countries, we reject the null
 hypothesis that the data come from a single regime. We also check the robustness of our
 results for some different formulations of the single regime model. Section 4 uses
 maximum likelihood and regression tree techniques to endogenously identify groups of
 locally converging economies. The analysis allows for the interaction of different control
 variables in determining data regimes. Section 5 provides summary and conclusions.
 Data and Technical Appendices follow.




 1. Convergence and cross-section behavior


         In this section, we illustrate two senses in which cross-section regressions of the




                                              5
form (1) are appropriate tests of convergence. Following the exposition of M-R-W, we
define the following variables which shall also be used in the empirical section. The
subscripts i and I index countries and time periods respectively.


A1 = level of technology at 1, assumed constant across i.
L1,1 = labor input.
      = aggregate output.
      = physical capital input.
      = human capital input.
  = population growth rate, assumed constant across t.
g = rate of technical change, assumed constant across i and t.
S = depreciation rate of physical and human capital, assumed constant across i and t.


4 = savings rate for physical capital, assumed constant across t.
s' = savings rate for human capital, assumed constant across t.


         Equation (1) can be justified first as the law of motion generated by the Solow
growth model. To see this, we consider the case where the production function is Cobb-
Douglas,


                                  =                                                     (3)



          Labor and the level of technology each grow exponentially,


                                                  nt                                    (4)
and


                                                                                        (5)




                                              6
         The evolution of physical and human capital per labor input are similarly
determined by the interaction of the exogenously determined physical and human capital
savings rates with depreciation.

         These laws of motion for technology and the various production inputs lead to a
law of motion for output per worker, (Y/L)1, over any interval T to T-4-r.

 Here,   e = 1— 1_ 71n()— ln(A0) — 9T      and A1 =      (1— a — y)(n1 +   g + 6), the country-
 specific convergence rate towards the steady state.

        Equation (8) thus provides a way of explaining cross-country growth rates
 through a common technology and country-specific input growth. Observe that, if we
 impose the restriction A1 = for all i, as M-R-W do, the equation takes on the form of
 equation (1). In this case, the coefficients comprising II are functions of the structural
 parameters a and 7, which allows one to consider both unconstrained and constrained
 versions of (8). However, since         = (1 — a — )(n1 + p + 6), the restriction of equal
 convergence rates across countries is valid only if population growth occurs at a constant



                                               7
rate in cach country. This is far from the case — in our sample the coefficient of variation
of population growth is similar to that of other variables.1        In the absence of the
restriction A = A, equations (1) and (8) are not nested. One can construct an alternative
equation which nests them both but we use equation (1) because of its relationship to the
work of others. We refer to equation (1) as "unconstrained" and equation (8) as
"constrained" for ease of reference.2

        A second justification for the cross—section regression is as follows. Assume that
we wish to test whether contemporaneous output differences tend to narrow, i.e. whether
the conditional expectation of the difference in output between economies i and j over a
fixed horizon i- is smaller than the contemporaneous disparity. For information set ff,
this means that


            E(ln( Y/L)1, T+r — ln( Y/L), T-1-r I aT) C ln( Y/L)I,T — ln( Y/L),T.         (9)


Suppose the growth of output obeys the relation


                    E(1fl(Y/L')ir+r In( Y/L)1 T I        = (+ 131n(Y/L)IT               (10)


In this case, a negative    is necessary for (9) to hold across a set of economies. Notice
that if the conditional expectation of output changes depends on more than initial
income, i.e. equation (10) is misspecified, then the cross-section regression generally
ignores information in assessing whether convergence holds.

         The behavior of the cross-section regression (1) when the sample contains

         'Using the data described below, the coefficient of variation of the average rate of
 population growth over the period 1960-1985 is .404. Those for the average rate of GDP
 per capita growth over the same period and our measures of physical and human capital
 accumulation are .465, .448, and .643, respectively.
         2Equation (8) does, of course, impose more restrictions than equation (1) on the
 model that nests them both.



                                              8
diverging economies is, of course, extremely sensitive to the specific alternative under
question. We outline the implications of two possible specifications of the aggregate
production function which fail to generate convergence even under the Solow savings
specification.
        Much of the work on alternatives to the Solow model has argued that there exists
a region of capital values over which the aggregate production function is not concave,
which will lead to different long run steady states for different initial conditions.3
Following Romer [1986], this could occur if social increasing returns to scale are present
in the economy due to effects such as learning-by-doing. To formalize this alternative in
the context of the Solow model, let the production function obey

                                                               a—

 with (  c. It    is straightforward to show how a suitable choice of 4(.) will induce two
 locally stable equilibria. From the perspective of the cross-sectioxi regressions, data
 generated by economies associated with a particular equilibrium will obey equation (8).
 A regression mixing economies from the two equilibria will be misspecified in the sense
 that the parameter e    in (8) will be a function of a given economy's equilibrium. The

         3Many multiple equilibrium models imply the existence of aggregate production
 function differences which distinguish underdeveloped and developed countries. Murphy,
 Shleifer and Vishny [1989] equate industrialization with the conversion of an economy to
 more efficient production; Durlauf [1991] shows how industrialization can occur through
 the build up of localized technological complementarities which expand aggregate
 productivity.

where e1 = 1 — 1 — ln(ql' ) — ln(A0) — gT if economy i is associated with the low
production equilibrium and        = i — — 7ln(ç5 ) — ln(A0) — gT if the economy is
associated with the high production equilibrium.

        A similar law of motion is generated by the model of human capital threshold
externalities explored by Azariadis and Drazen [1990]. Azariadis and Drazen argue that
there may exist human or physical capital accumulation thresholds which identify shifts
in aggregate technology. For example, some minimum level of human capital per worker
may be required to permit the use of more advanced technologies. One way to model this
idea is to posit the existence of a human capital threshold H such that

        Again, this type of nonconvex technology will generate multiple equilibria when
combined with exogenous savings rates. As before, there is no necessary implication that
a cross-section growth regression using data from this model will produce a nonnegative
jI. However, in this case, a switching regimes analysis of cross-section data will produce
different coefficients for all of the variables found in equation (8), which allows for a more
general alternative to a single law of motion.



                                             10
          The cross-section regression (1) is correctly specified for subsets of countries when
the aggregate technology obeys (13) or (14). In fact, under our versions of the Homer
and Azariadis-Drazen specifications, the Solow model holds locally even though the
aggregate production technology exhibits nonconvexity over some range. Against this
class of alternatives, the testable implications of the Solow model are summarized in the
requirement that the cross-section data are generated by a common law of motion for all
countries.




2. Data


          All cross-country growth rates we employ are based upon the Summers-H eston
[1988] international output estimates. With the exception of the data on literacy rates,
which are taken from the World Bank's World Development Report (various issues), all of
the data that we use are from M-R-W.4 The variables are defined as follows:


           = real GDP per member of the population aged 15-64, country i at L

(II V)1      fraction of real GDP devoted to investment (including government investment),
country i, annual average for 1960-1985.


   = growth rate of the working-age population, country i, annual average 1960-1985.

SCHOOL1 = fraction of the working-age population enrolled in secondary school, country
i, annual average 1960-1985.

        4The primary sources are the data set constructed by Summers and Heston [1988]
and the World Bank's World Tables and World Development Report. M-R-W discuss the
construction and some of the limitations of the data. A Data Appendix at the end of the
paper lists the 98 countries in our data set as well as some selected characteristics.



                                                11
          = adult literacy rate, fraction of the population aged 15 and over that is able to
read and write, country i, in 1960.


        We follow M-R-W in assuming that p = 0.02 (implying that gr = 0.5, a value
that we impose in estimation) and 5 = 0.03, figures that are approximately true for the
United States. We also follow these authors in using (1/ Y)1 to represent s and
SCHOOL1 to represent 4a.



3. Specification tests for multiple regimes



         In this section we attempt to identify separate regimes in the data through the
use of specification tests which take a single regime model as the null hypothesis. We do
this by mechanically splitting the data into subgroups based upon different control
variables and examining whether model parameters are equal across groups. We consider
two estimating equations. First, we fit


                   ln(Y/1411985 — ln(Y/L)1         = (+ P1n(Y/L)1,1


                  + ir1ln(I/Y)1 + ir21n(n + g + 5) -4- ir3ln(SCHOOL) + c1               (15)



         5For some countries the 1960 literacy rate is unavailable so the 1975 rate is used
instead. As most of these have literacy rates of 90% or greater this has little effect on our
results. In addition, for many countries, the "1960" literacy rate is actually calculated for
some (unknown) year between 1958 and 1962. It seems unlikely that literacy changes by
very much in a two year period so the magnitude of the resultant measurement error is
probably small. Also, since we use the literacy rates to classify countries rather than as a
regressor, the importance of small measurement errors is minimal. Two of the countries
studied by M-R-W, Botswana and Mauritius, are omitted due to lack of data on literacy.

by least squares over each subgroup. We refer to this equation as the unconstrained
version of the Solow model since we use equation (8) to determine the right-hand side
variables without restricting the regression coefficients as implied by (8). We separately
estimate a constrained version of the model by imposing these restrictions.

        We consider two different control variables to group countries with similar
characteristics. The first variable we employ is per capita output at the beginning of the
sample period, (Y/fl110. Most models of multiple long run equilibria predict that if
economies are concentrated around several equilibria, then their initial per capita output
levels will fall into nonoverlapping categories. Second, we examine sample splits based
upon the adult literacy rate of each country in 1960. The use of literacy as a segregating
variable makes sense if one thinks of the potential regimes in the data as stemming from
a broad notion of social and economic development.6

        Table 1 reports the results for several different data splits. Each entry represents
the significance level of a Wald test of the null hypothesis that all parameters are equal
across the subsamples under analysis.7 The first panel of the Table divides countries into
two equal sized groups by segregating high and low initial income and initial literacy
countries into separate categories. Each subgroup thus consists of 48 countries. The
second panel divides countries into three equal groups of 32 according these variables.
The third panel allows interactions between the variables. In this case, we divide
countries according to whether they lie in the high or low half of the sample according to
our two controls. This segregation results in four categories: high income/high literacy
(42 countries) high income/low literacy (6 countries), low income/high literacy (6
countries) and low income/low literacy (42 countries).8
        6See Rauch [1989] for corroborating evidence of literacy-based regime differences.
         7Following Barro [1991] and others, we use heteroskedasticity-corrected test
statistics and standard error estimates, (see White (1980]), in order to allow for different
error variances for observations from different countries.                White's [1980]
heteroskedasticity test reveals some evidence against a homoskedastic null. Assuming
homoskedasticity in the computation of the Wald statistics increases the number of
rejections of the single regime model.

        As the Table indicates, we find substantial evidence that the laws of motion for
growth within each subgroup are different. For three of the four initial income splits,
equality of coefficients across the groups is rejected at the 3% level. 'When initial literacy
represents the control variable, we reject in two of the four cases at about 1%. Further,
we overwhelmingly reject the equality of regime parameters for both unconstrained and
constrained regressions based on the interactive four regime specification. This change in
the significance level of the tests indicates the importance of allowing both variables to
identify separate data regimes.

        Table 2 reports the original M-R-W regression along with estimates of the
regressions associated with the high initial income/high initial literacy and low initial
income/low initial literacy splits described above. (The high initial income/low initial
literacy and low initial income/high initial literacy splits are omitted due to lack of
degrees of freedom.) Several of the subsample coefficients are substantially different from
both one another and from the M-R-W regression. For the unconstrained regressions, the
coefficient on initial income, ln( Y/L)1960, is approximately equal for the high
literacy/high income and low literacy/low income groups at -.434 and -.444 respectively;
these estimates are much larger than the -.289 estimate for the whole sample. This
difference reveals a faster convergence rate for the subsamples than suggested for the
single regime. Further, the ln(I/ Y)1 coefficient for high income/high literacy countries is
.689, which is over twice as large as the .310 estimate for the low income/low literacy
countries and over 25% higher than the .524 estimate for the whole sample. Similarly,
the implied physical capital share in output for the constrained regressions is far larger for
the high income/literacy countries at .509 than for the low literacy/income countries at
.275, and somewhat larger than the .431 share for the whole sample. Conversely, the low
income/literacy countries exhibit a much larger coefficient for the human capital
        8The initial two-way income splits are based on (Y/L)119 <$1950 and
$1950 (Y/L)11960; the three way splits are based on (Y/L)1,1960 < $1150,
$1150 (Y/L)10 $2750 and $2750 < (Y/L)11960. For initial literacy, the two-way
splits are based on LB11960 < 54% and 54% S LB1,10; the three way splits are based on
LB11960 <26%, 26% LB11960 72% and 72% <LB1

investment measure ln(SCHOOL)1 as well as the associated human capital output share
than high income/literacy countries, although both subsample estimates are below those
for the whole sample. These estimates suggest that the aggregate production functions
are substantially different across subsamples, which supports a multiple regime
perspective.


        Robustnen and additional control variables


        One explanation of these results is that the set of control variables dictated by
the Solow model is too small to account for some important differences in growth
performance so that our evidence of multiple regimes is actually due to omitted variables.
In this case, inclusion of these variables among the X1 would render the specification
correct and eliminate the statistical significance of the sample splits.

        Barro (19911 uses a broader set of control variables than M-R-W in an attempt to
model a wide variety of potential influences on growth. We therefore investigate whether
our rejection of the single equilibrium model is robust to the addition of some of Barro's
variables to those dictated by the strict Solow model. We focus on the role of
government spending and education variables in Barro's work.9 The variables are:


(G''/Y)1 = ratio of government consumption to GDP, country i, annual average for
1960-1985 (or the largest available subperiod).


PRIM60 = primary-school enrollment rate, country i, 1960.


        9We choose these particular variables because they represent natural extensions of
the Solow model, as (GC/Y)1 can proxy for taxes and PRIM60 and SEGtO1 can act as
additional proxies for the human capital savings rate. We have also verified that our
rejections of the single regime model are robust with respect to including other variables
employed by Barro; this work is available upon request.

SEC6O1 = secondary-school enrollment rate, country i, 1960.10


        In order to assess the impact of additional control variables, we projected
                                 and the explanatory variables in equation (15) on various
subsets of the logarithms of these variables (and a constant) and then used the respective
residuals from these projections in place of the variables in equation (15) in calculating
the test statistics for the splits described in Table 1.

        Table 3 gives the results. As the Table indicates, adding ln(G'/Y)1 as an
additional regressor has some effect on the significance of the various splits. Only one of
the four splits by income is now significant, although the three-way unconstrained
regression is only marginally insignificant. Further, the significance of the literacy splits
has been eliminated. The addition of ln(PRTM6O)1 and ln(SEC6O)1 as controls has less
effect on the hypothesis tests. All of the income splits are significant at the 11% level
and two are significant at the 1% level. Two of the four literacy splits are still significant
at 3%. On the other hand, the strong significance of the four-way interactive splits is
unaffected by any variable additions. The evidence of multiple regimes therefore seems
robust to the addition of these variables, although the government spending variable
reduces the significance of some data splits.




4. Properties of local convergence grouj



         In this section, we study the behavior of unconstrained and constrained growth
regressions for different country groups. Although the exogenously imposed data splits of
the previous section permit straightforward specification testing, they do not address the
         '°SECt0 differs from SCHOOL1 as it measures the ratio of secondary students to
the population between 12-17 rather than to all working age persons and because it equals
a point estimate for 1960 rather than an average over 1960-1985.

problem of accurately identifying economies with similar laws of motion. In order to
identify economies with similar characteristics, it is necessary to allow the data to
endogenously determine the location of the different regimes. We perform two sets of
exercises to identify blocks of locally converging economies.


        Single control variable eztimafts


        In order to allow the data to endogenously determine which countries belong in
which group, we first employ an approach suggested by Quandt [1958]. This method
consists of exogenously choosing the number of splits and then choosing their location
according to a control variable so as to maximize the likelihood function of the data. We
choose the number of splits to be three. Let z1 be the variable used to split the sample.
For any two fixed numbers, <,
                           ,                   sample can be split into three subsamples
                                         the
according to whether t1<           z. < i,   or < z. Let N, j = 1,2,3, be the number of
observations in each of the respective subsamples. The maximized log quasi-likelihood is
given by LL,) = —EN1n(&),              where = residual sum of squares divided by N
based on estimating equation (15) on subsample 5. We choose the regime split (z ,)
that maximizes L(z ,i), subject to the feasibility of least squares estimation for each
subsample.

        Using initial income as the control variable, the likelihood function is maximized
for regimes identified by the splits (Y/L)119 <$800, $800 <(Y/L) 1960 $4850, and
$4850 c (Y/L)   1960.11   Table 4 reports the unconstrained and constrained regressions for
the estimated regimes. In terms of overall fit, we find some improvement over the single

         11See the Data Appendix for the classification of each country into estimated
high, intermediate, and low initial literacy and income groups. We have also considered
whether the endogenous splits are statistically significant by computing (through Monte
Carlo methods) the distribution of the sup of the Wald statistics over all possible 3—way
income and literacy splits when there is one regime and comparing the Wald statistics for
our estimated splits to these distributions. We find that the income and literacy splits
are significant at 3% and 2% respectively.

regime specification. Whereas M-R-W found that they could explain 46% of overall
growth variation in the unconstrained model, we find that for the poorest economies, we
explain 57%, for intermediate economies 52%, and for high income economies fully 82%
of the total growth variation. Similar results hold for the constrained regressions.

         In terms of the individual coefficients, clear evidence exists for regime-dependent
sensitivity of growth to the different control variables. The coefficients on ln(I/ 1') are
.314, .449, and .475 for the low, intermediate, and high income groups respectively. The
effect of the variable on growth is thus over 30% smaller for low income economies when
compared to their intermediate and high income counterparts. Further, the coefficient
estimates for ln(SGHOOL), -.028, .331, and .341, for low, intermediate, and high income
groups, imply that the human capital accumulation has virtually no marginal impact on
growth for poor economies, whereas the variable is strongly significant outside of this
group.    Finally, we find some evidence of local convergence, as measured by the
coefficient on initial income In( Y/L)1 196o For the poor economies, the point estimate of
-.791 is far higher than the single regime case and statistically significant at 5%. Further,
the coefficient for the intermediate economies, -.172, is also negative, although not
statistically significant. Interestingly, for the high income economies, the point estimate
for the convergence variable is positive at .069, providing no evidence of convergence.
This failure parallels the results of DeLong [1988] who rejected convergence over a much
longer time span when studying economies with similar high initial incomes. These
estimates imply that the gap between initial and steady state incomes has a half life of
about 11 years for the poor economies, while for the intermediate economies the half life
is over 8 times as long.

         The second part of Table 4 reports the results of the associated constrained
regressions.   These results parallel the unconstrained results. We find that the
intermediate economies have the largest physical capital share of .401, while the high
income economies have a share of .333 (17% smaller) and the poor economies have a
share of .306 (almost 25% smaller than the intermediate economies). In terms of the

human capital share, we find a point estimate near zero for the poor economies. In
addition, the share for high income countries, .455, is 50% higher than the .302
intermediate economy estimate.

        Estimating a three regime split based upon initial literacy, the quasi-likelihood
function is maximized when countries are split into the categories LiZ1, 1960 < 50%,
50% LR, 1960       66%,   and 66% < LiZ1, 1960• Table 5 presents the estimates of the
constrained and unconstrained models.

         As Table 5 indicates, segregation by the literacy rate also produces much
heterogeneity across the unconstrained and constrained regressions. There is substantial
variation in the ability of these regressions to explain the growth experiences of the
countries in the different groups. The overa]l fit of the model is dramatically improved
for the intermediate literacy economies. For the low and high literacy countries, the
unconstrained and constrained regressions produce R2 estimates below .35 while for the
intermediate group the estimates equal or exceed .95.

         In terms of the unconstrained regressions, high and intermediate literacy
economies exhibit far greater sensitivity to fluctuations in the physical investment ratio
ln(I/ }') than low literacy countries. The estimated coefficients for the low, intermediate,
and high income groups are .324, 1.114, and .686 respectively. All are statistically
significant at the 5% level. Conversely, human capital investment, 1n(SCHOOL), seems
to have little effect on the high literacy economies, but does significantly affect the other
groups. The estimated coefficients for the low, intermediate, and high income groups are
.214, .164, and .032 respectively, with the latter being statistically insignificant at the 5%
level. Perhaps most important, the estimated coefficients on ln( Y/L)119 reveal a
consistent pattern of local convergence within the literacy regimes. The low,
intermediate, and high literacy coefficients, -.270, -.427, and -.376, are all negative and
statistically significant. This pattern represents strong evidence, in light of the
heterogeneity of the coefficient estimates, of local rather than global convergence in the
Summers-Heston data.



                                             19
        The constrained regression results in Table 5 reinforce the evidence of
heterogeneity across groups.   The physical capital share coefficient for low literacy
countries, .294, is less than half the size of the .635 value for intermediate literacy
economies, and the .595 estimate for high literacy economies. The human capital share
declines as literacy increases with low to high literacy group estimates of .266, .165 and
.047. In addition, the share is statistically significant only for the low and intermediate
literacy economies. Given that our human capital variable measures secondary school
enrollment, it is plausible that, for high literacy economies, the return to secondary
education is low on the margin, while for relatively illiterate economies, large returns to
secondary education still exist. This is difficult to reconcile1 though, with the large
human capital share for high initial income economies.

        Using both income levels and literacy rates to identify different regimes, we have
found substantial evidence of heterogeneity in production technologies and of local rather
than global convergence in national economies. However, the characteristics of the
regimes differ according to which variable is used to split the sample. These differences
indicate the importance of exploring interactions between the control variables. At the
same time, mechanically splitting the data to allow interactions will quickly eliminate all
degrees of freedom; for example, a three-way split by income and literacy will create 9
categories for only 96 observations. Further, since the number of regimes and nature of
the interactions are not dictated by any economic theory, it is desirable to employ a data
sorting method which allows the data to endogenously select these features.


        Regression tree estimates


        We now turn to regression tree methods for identifying separate data regimes.
This technique, described in Breiman et al [1984}, provides a general nonparametric way
of identifying multiple data regimes. The technique allows us to search for an unknown
number of sample splits using more than one control variable.

        Constructing a regression tree is quite complicated; the specific atgorithm is
described in a Technical Appendix to the paper. Heuristically, the method works in two
steps.  First, all possible binary data splits based on either initial income and initial
literacy are separately computed with the restriction that within each sample split there
must be more countries than regressors. Equation (15) is estimated over the subsamples
in each split and the total sum of squared residuals over all observations is computed.
The split with the minimum sum of squared residuals is then taken as the first split of
the data. Within each subsample of countries produced by the first split, this procedure
is then repeated, i.e. all possible binary splits for either income or literacy are again
computed. A second set of splits is added to the first by again choosing those splits
which minimize the sum of squared residuals. This procedure is repeated until no more
splits can be computed.

         The set of sample splits at this point is certain to severely overestimate the
number of regimes in the data since we have not accounted for the possibility of spurious
splits due to the elimination of degrees of freedom in the regressions. The second step in
the procedure "prunes" the tree by eliminating data splits which lead to (relatively) small
reductions in the error variance. By eliminating data splits according to a penalty
function which trades off error variance reduction against the number of splits, and by
employing "cross-validation" methods which will provide unbiased estimates of residual
variance, one can show that it is possible to consistently decompose the data set by
regime.12 The procedure bears some similarity to the use of information criteria to
identify distributed lag lengths. No known asymptotic theory exists to test for the
number of regimes in the data as uncovered by the regression tree. The virtue of the
procedure lies in its ability to uncover multidimensional data splits.

         The result of this procedure is the regression tree shown in Figure 1. Squares in

       12The method is consistent in the sense that if the data exhibit a finite number of
regimes, these regimes will be identified as the number of observations becomes large.
Further, if all the data are generated by a single process, then the regression tree will
asymptotically converge to one regime.

this figure indicate the splitting criteria for the sample; circles represent terminal nodes
which contain different subsamples. The subsamples are:         1) (Y/L)119 <$800, 2)
$800    (Y/fl6,1950 $4850     and   LR1 <46%, 3) $800 (Y/L)10 $4850                    and
46% LR,1960, and 4) $4850 < (Y/L)1%0. Note that the first and fourth subsamples
contain precisely the countries classified as low and high income countries in Section 3.
In effect, the regression tree has partitioned the intermediate income countries according
to whether or not LR11960 is greater or less than 46%. The fact that, given the
opportunity to split the sample by either income or literacy, the regression tree shows a
preference for income splits suggests that income dominates literacy as a variable useful
in identifying separate regimes in the data.

        Table 6 details the countries in each subsample. The Table indicates that there
is substantial geographic homogeneity within each group. The low income/low literacy
group is composed almost exclusively of poor African countries. The intermediate
income/low literacy group is largely made up of relatively resource rich African economies
and subcontinental Asian countries. Far eastern Asian and Latin American countries
dominate the intermediate income/high literacy group. European economies make up
most of the high income group. Any classification procedure such as a regression tree can
lead to some individual countries being misassigned. For example, Japan is an obvious
outlier in the third group. (We certainly would not want to claim that the aggregate
production function for Japan is more similar to that of El Salvador than the United
States!) The groupings do, however, seem quite reasonable overall and are certainly
compatible with a local convergence interpretation.

        Table 7 presents estimates of the unconstrained and constrained models for each
of the subsamples. Perhaps the most striking feature of these estimates is how much they
differ across subsamples.     As we saw in Table 4, the estimated coefficient on
ln(Y/L)11950 is significant for the first group and insignificant for the fourth group. The
point estimates for the second and third subsamples, -0.086 and -0.316, are both negative
although only the latter is significant. The regression tree has thus identified a group of




                                               22
clearly locally convergent countries within the intermediate income countries.

          Similar heterogeneity holds for other variables. The coefficient on ln(I/Y)1 is
significant in the first, third, and fourth subsamples, but the subsample estimates vary
greatly, ranging from .314 in the first subsample to 1.110 in the third subsample. The
estimated coefficient on In(SCHOOL); is insignificant for the first and third subsamples,
and is over a third larger in the second subsample (0.469) than in the fourth (0.341).

          Estimation of the constrained model produces vastly different estimates of both
the physical and human capital shares across regimes. The estimated physical capital
share in the third subsample (.758) is more than twice that in the first (.306) and fourth
(.333) and is not statistically significant in the second (.186). The estimated human
capital share are near zero for the first and third subsamples and are approximately equal
for the second and fourth subsamples at .416 and .455. The fourth subsample is the only
case where both shares are significant. Our estimates are strongly consistent with the
view that different economies have access to different aggregate technologies.

          The striking differences in the human capital share can be interpreted in different
ways. One possibility is that economies go through production regimes which are indexed
by different thresholds of human capital formation, in a way similar to the model of
Azariadis and Drazen [1990]. Suppose that certain forms of organization of production
within a firm or industry are constrained by the educational level of the labor force.
Once these constraints no longer bind, then marginal increases in human capital would
appear to have low marginal product, until an economy grows to the point where
production is reorganized, creating a need for more human capital. In this case, the
second and fourth nodes may represent regimes where human capital accumulation still
augments the employed technology. Again, the different estimates might also reflect the
 weakness of the human capital variable, ln(SCHOOL)1. This variable only measures
secondary school enrollment. If primary, secondary and college human capital formation
 have regime-specific output shares, then this variable may simply perform poorly in some
 cases.




                                              23
        Finally, it is interesting to note the pattern of labor shares across country groups:
.728 for node 1, .398 for node 2, .315 for node 3, and .212 for node 4. These figures
clearly illustrate how the labor share declines as an economy becomes more developed in
terms of literacy and production. This path for the evolution of the aggregate production
function suggests that the high productivity of advanced economies is due not only to
capital deepening, but to the way in which capital per worker is converted into output
per worker.13 The idea that high output economies more effectively utilize capital
resources relative to low output economies is a common feature of many multiple
equilibrium models, and is one way to interpret Romer's [1986] model of capital
complementarities. The distinction between the differences in the capital/labor ratio and
differences in the productivity of capital per worker is exploited by Durlauf and Johnson
[1992] to identify the sources of cross-country income disparities.



5. Summary and conclusions


        A large body of empirical work has concluded that international output data
exhibit convergence when adequate account is taken of microeconomic heterogeneity.
This literature is important as it bears upon the empirical relevance of various
endogenous growth models. A major difficulty with these studies is that the natures of
the null and alternative hypotheses are not made clear. In particular, the empirical
convergence literature has assumed that a negative correlation between initial income and
subsequent growth is necessarily evidence of convergence. This paper proposes a new set
of empirical methods for studying convergence which explicitly allow for the possibility of
multiple equilibria in the data.

        Taking as a starting place the work of Mankiw, Romer and Weil [1990], we have


        13Recall that for the two factor Cobb-Douglas technology, output per worker
increases monotonically with the capital share.



                                            24
reexamined the Summers-ileston data set to see whether the pattern of cross-country
growth rates is compatible with a model of global convergence. We do this by explicitly
allowing for the possibility that the data exhibit local rather than global convergence.
Our approach uses information known at the start of the sample period to identify
countries with similar initial conditions. We then see whether segregating countries into
groups by initial conditions improves overall model fit. Conditioning initial income
and/or initial literacy rates, specification tests support a multiple equilibrium
interpretation. Using regression tree methods to find optimal splits in the data reveals
substantial differences between the aggregate production functions of economies with
different initial conditions. Consequently, our results demonstrate that the behavior of
national growth rates in the postwar period is quite compatible with a multiple
equilibrium perspective.

        One important extension of our work is to see whether the apparent multiple
regimes in the Heston-Summers data can be explicitly identified as arising from some of
the production or demand complementarities which have been proposed as explanations
for long run divergence. The identification of these complementarities is essential in
understanding the policy implications of the endogenous growth literature.

Technical Appendix: Regression tree analysis


        This Appendix contains a brief introduction to regression tree methods. We draw
extensively from Breiman, ci ci [1984] throughout. The method is designed to uncover
general forms of nonlinearity in data; Breiman ci ci show that the regression tree method
is consistent in the sense that under suitable regularity conditions, estimates of the
regression function converge to the true data generating process. The idea behind
regression trees is that the prediction of y based on the vector X, which we call d(X),
may be improved (in the sense of reducing E(y — d(X))2) by allowing the function d(X)
to change according to the values taken by some set of control variables Z.

         A tree, {T, I, r}, is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, T, and two
functions, l(.) and r(- ), from T to T U (0) such that, for each t E T, (1) either
1(1) = r(t) = 0 or 1(t) > t and r(t) > I, and (ii) if t f min{t E T) there is exactly one
S E T, called the parent of 1, such that, either, t = i(s) or t = r(s).     The value of
min{t T) is also called the root of the tree. Intuitively, these properties partially order
the elements of T. In this ordering, each node I is either terminal or is followed by left
and right elements 1(t) and r(t).

       Each element of T is called a node of the tree. Typically, T = {1, 2,..., r} for
some r 1. For simplicity, we will abuse notation and use T to denote the tree (7', 1, r}.
The root node has no parent, and by (ii) above, every other node has a unique parent.
Let pareni( .) denote the function from T to 7' U {0} defined so that parent(rooi(T)) = 0
and pareni(i) is the parent of I. The node t is an ancestor of the node s if t is the in—
fold composition of parent(s) for some in. If t is an ancestor of s then s is a descendent
of I. When 1(1) and r(t)   0, the nodes 1(1) and r(t) are, respectively, the left and right
descendants of I. A node is called terminal if 1(t) = r(t) = 0, i.e. it has no descendants,
otherwise it is called nonierminal. The set of terminal nodes is denoted 7' - The set of
terminal descendants of I is denoted    (I). Given T C 7', define 1 and r from T to
7'* u {0} by

                         =                            and      r'(t) = fr(t)                          (A.l)

Then, T is a subtree of T if {T', (, r) is a tree. If T is a subtree of T and
root(T) = root(T), then T is a pruned subtree of T, denoted T -< T. The relation -<
is   transitive and T -< T indicates T -< T and T                T.

      Let Z E fi C R" be the vector of control variables associated with X. The
elements of Z may or may not be distinct from the variables in X. A regression tree
partitions Q by a sequence of binary splits, one at each nonterminal node. Let w(t) be
the subset of (1 associated with node 2, so that w(rooi(T)) = fl and U                       ;(t) = ci. For
all nonterminal nodes, t, w(l(2)) fl .i(r(t)) = 0 and w(1(t)) U w(r(t)) = w(2). Then, for
Z w(t),
                                             I w(l(t)) if z ' 7 '.    R
                                                                                                      (A.2)

for some 1     i      n, where       is the split value for z. For each 2            , the predictor of y
given Z w(t) is d(X).
          There are two main steps to growing the sample regression tree from the sample
S = {(y, X1, Z1), I = 1,..., N).'4 One first grows the largest tree allowed by the sample.
Second, the tree is pruned in order to achieve an estimate of the optimal predictor dt(X)
for each t E      .   We restrict attention to the case where d2 is linear in its parameters and
write d(X) = I3X, where fl is a vector conformable with X if the Z associated with X
is in w(t). Let 1(1) = {1 <i < N I Z1 E w(t)} and define the within—node residual sum of
squares R(t) = E;()(YI—2(XI))2 where 2(X)= /31X and $ is the within—node OLS
estimator of fl.15 The improvement in the sum of squares from a split at 2 is given by

a1 = .11(2) — R(I(t')) R(r(t)) 0. Beginning at the root, we grow a tree by choosing, at
                         —


each currently terminal node, 2, the partition of w(t) which maximizes a1 over choices of
both and        i.e. for each element of Z, we choose the split value which maximizes ts
and use that element of Z with the largest maximized a to perform the split. We
continue in this way until there are too few observations in each terminal node to allow
any further splits.

       This tree is a very unparsimonious representation of the data and the final
estimate of the error variance, cr2(T) = 4    R(t) (known as the "resubstitution"
estimate), is an overly optimistic estimate of the model's accuracy as the model has been
chosen to minimize this quantity. Further, no penalty has been imposed for the degrees
of freedom lost as the tree was grown. The second step is to prune the tree. For any
node, s, define the error complexity measure, Ca(s) = R(s) + a, where a is the complexity
parameter, the cost of a terminal node. We then make a nonterminal node 2 terminal

between 0 and ,          one   induces a sequence of trees T1 >.- ... >- T. T1 is the largest tree
that can be grown from the sample and Tq is the trivial tree containing only the root
node. These are the candidates for the optimal tree.

         The optimal tree is selected from this sequence using cross—validation estimates of
the error variance of the model associated with each tree in the sequence. For a given
tree, consider the observation (y1, X1) at node 2. For each observation, a predictor f3'x1
is associated with each y, where fi') denotes the estimated coefficient vector at node
after omitting observation i. The prediction error for an observation will therefore equal
  —             The sample mean of (y —                        over   all observations is the cross—
validation estimate of the error variance for the tree in question. Performing this
procedure for each tree in the sequence generates a sequence of estimated error variances,
one for each tree. The optimal tree is the one with the smallest estimated error variance.
