A general equilibrium model featuring multiple realistic sources of financial frictions is
developed to study how different constraints interact in equilibrium. We highlight, distinguish,
and evaluate their differential impacts and rich interactions. The economic impact of financial
inclusion policies in an economy depends not only on which constraint is alleviated, but also on
the tightness of other constraints. Policy instruments should target the most binding constraint,
which likely varies across countries. Moreover, there are important tradeoffs between financial
inclusion, GDP, and the distribution of income. The transitional dynamics also differ from those
in steady states. Policy makers should consider both.

1      Introduction

The development of a financial system is multi-faceted in nature. In general, the stage of
financial development and the extent of financial inclusion in a country are mainly reflected
in the breadth (ability of firms to access credit), depth (the amount of collateral required
for borrowing), and efficiency (ability of financial intermediaries to provide services at low
cost) of its financial system. These three characteristics can be proxied by the fraction of
firms with credit, the loan-to-collateral ratio, and one minus the interest rate spread. More
developed financial systems are usually associated with greater breadth, depth, and efficiency.
However, there are significant cross-country difference, and the correlations among the three
measures are not high (see Figure 1).

Note: Data is from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys and World Development Indicators. The breadth, depth, and efficiency
of a country’s financial system can be measured by the fraction of firms with credit, the loan-to-collateral ratio, and one minus
the interest rate spread, respectively. Among the 139 countries in our sample, the correlation is 0.11 between the measures of
breadth and depth, 0.09 between the measures of depth and efficiency, and 0.37 between the measures of efficiency and breadth.

    For this reason, policy instruments to foster financial inclusion will necessarily vary across
countries. Instead of deriving optimal policies based on specific objectives and cost functions,
the goal of this paper is to highlight, distinguish, and systematically examine the tradeoffs
between various policy instruments as an essential first step in policy design. Reduced-form
empirical techniques, however, are less likely to offer revealing answers, because different
constraints have nonlinear interactions with each other and economy-wide policies inevitably
have general-equilibrium effects. These challenges lend themselves to a structural approach
followed in this paper.

                                                                               2
      We develop a general equilibrium model of heterogeneous agents with multiple sources of
financial frictions to study the equilibrium interactions among different financial constraints
and their implications on GDP, TFP, and the distribution of income. Our model has two
key implications. First, policy instruments should target the most binding constraint, which
likely varies across countries. Likewise, assuming there is only one generic type of constraint
across all countries can give inaccurate predictions of an economy’s response to lowering
that constraint. For example, relaxing the collateral constraint may significantly boost GDP
in one country, but may not be as effective in other countries, where financial inclusion
is constrained by a high borrowing cost. Second, there are important tradeoffs between
financial inclusion, GDP, and the distribution of income. Further, short-run transitional
effects may differ from outcomes in long-run steady states, which may be years away.1 For
example, policies that increase GDP may lead to high income inequality and the extent of
these tradeoffs can vary over time after implementation. We provide a roadmap for policy
makers so that they know what they are likely to face in the future, thereby allowing them
to build in some commitment if possible or to choose another path if not.
      Our model is built on the workhorse model of occupational choice in the macro-development
literature (see, e.g., Banerjee and Newman, 1993; Gine and Townsend, 2004; Buera and
Shin, 2011, 2013). In the model, agents are heterogeneous in wealth and entrepreneurial
productivity, and can choose to be workers or entrepreneurs. Workers supply labor for wages
in return. Entrepreneurs use capital and labor for production.
      Our major deviation from standard models is that we make the more realistic assumption
that agents face multiple sources of financial constraints rather than a single one. First, agents
who borrow from financial intermediaries incur a credit entry cost. This cost captures the fixed
transaction costs, documentation requirements, and other access barriers. Second, the amount
of loans obtained is constrained by a collateral constraint as in Jermann and Quadrini (2009,
2012). Finally, the interest rate charged by loans is higher than the deposit rate, reflecting
  1
      In Appendix C.5, we study the transitional dynamics after implementing financial inclusion policies.

an informational or intermediation cost. Existing studies have emphasized the quantitative
importance of each type of financial friction. For example, Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990)
and Townsend and Ueda (2006) study the credit entry cost. Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2011)
and Buera and Shin (2013) focus on the collateral constraint. Greenwood, Sanchez and
Wang (2010, 2013) quantify the importance of the intermediation cost. These three types of
financial constraints distort the allocation of capital and entrepreneurial productivity. They
naturally give rise conceptually to three policy instruments, each alleviating a specific type
of constraint.
       Real-world counterparts of these constraints are easy to find. For example, the existing
literature has documented that the distance to a bank branch matters for credit access, sug-
gesting that policies to promote branch opening in rural locations with unbanked populations
could help reduce the credit entry cost in our model.2 During the global financial crisis of 2007
– 2008, many countries relaxed the collateral constraint by widening the range of securities
that could be accepted as collateral with the aim of boosting lending to firms and households.
Finally, financial inclusion can lead to increased competition among financial institutions,
accelerating investment in financial technology, thereby improving intermediation efficiency
and lowering the intermediation cost.3
       In order to assess and quantify the interactions and tradeoffs of policy instruments,
we calibrate the model using data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys and World
Development Indicators for a number of countries. We choose the model’s key parameters to
match the data moments reflecting the key characteristics of a financial system, in particular
the percentage of firms with credit, the collateral-to-loan ratio, and the interest rate spread,
   2
     Many developing countries have implemented such policies to increase credit access. For example, after
nationalizing a bank in 1969, the Indian government launched an ambitious social banking program that
sought to improve the access of the rural poor to formal credit and savings opportunities (see Burgess
and Pande, 2005). Also see Assuncao, Mityakov and Townsend (2012), Alem and Townsend (2013), Gilje,
Loutskina and Strahan (2016), Aguirregabiria, Clark and Wang (2017), Celerier and Matray (2017), and
Nguyen (2017).

     For example, from 1985 to 1994, the Thai banking sector became more capital-intensive, substituting
physical capital for labor. The average cost of raising funds decreased from 14.40% in 1985 to 5.61% in 1994
for large banks (see Okuda and Mieno, 1999).

as well as other moments such as the real interest rate, the gross savings as a percentage of
GDP, and the firm employment distribution.
   Our lead illustrative example is taken from the Philippines, although we also consider
other countries. We first examine the steady-state implications of alleviating different financial
constraints on GDP and TFP by conducting counterfactual experiments. Policies that relax
the collateral constraint away from its calibrated value have a larger impact on increasing
GDP and TFP than policies that reduce the credit entry cost or the intermediation cost.
Moreover, the model implies that the increase in GDP and TFP is attributed to different
margins depending on which policy instrument is used. Specifically, when the credit entry
cost is reduced, GDP and TFP will initially increase mostly through the intensive margin;
that is, the few entrepreneurs who already have access to finance will expand their scale
of production. This is because most entrepreneurs do not have sufficient wealth to pay
the upfront cost and are excluded from the credit market. When the credit entry cost is
further lowered, however, GDP and TFP will increase through the extensive margin; that
is, productive but wealth-constrained entrepreneurs who were previously excluded from the
credit market will start to gain access to finance. By contrast, when the collateral constraint
is relaxed, both intensive and extensive margins will contribute significantly to the increase
in GDP and TFP. When the intermediation cost is lowered, the increase in GDP and TFP is
attributed only to the extensive margin. More generally, the model structure provides these
decompositions in theory with formulas, which are also quantified in the data, as are the
general equilibrium effects on wages and interest rates.
   We further study the equilibrium interactions of these financial constraints. In partial
equilibrium, our analytical results reveal that when multiple constraints are relaxed simul-
taneously, the effect is amplified through the intensive margin but dampened through the
extensive margin. This implies that policies that alleviate multiple constraints could, in
principle, yield a larger or a smaller effect than policies targeting individual constraints,
depending on whether the overall interaction effect between different constraints is positive or


                                                5
negative. For example, if the interaction effect through the intensive margin dominates, policy
makers should develop a more balanced financial system, as different financial constraints
are complements in constraining GDP. In this case, policies that alleviate the most binding
financial constraint would be most effective. On the other hand, if the interaction effect
through the extensive margin dominates, policy makers should focus on alleviating a single
constraint while ignoring all other constraints.
   Using the calibrated model, we conduct a sequence of counterfactual experiments to study
the equilibrium interactions between financial constraints. We find that the interaction effect
between different constraints is positive, suggesting that effective financial inclusion policies
should be designed to develop a well-rounded financial system by alleviating the currently
most binding constraint. As noted earlier, policies that are effective in increasing GDP in
one country may not be equally effective in others. Therefore, identifying the most binding
constraint is important for designing financial policies.
   In terms of the distributional implications, we find that policies that relax different
constraints tend to bring differential benefits to agents, depending on their wealth and
productivity. Although reducing the credit entry cost benefits every agent in the economy,
the welfare of some agents will fall when the collateral constraint is relaxed or when the
intermediation cost is reduced due to general equilibrium effects.
   To demonstrate how our model can be harnessed to help identify the bottleneck constraint
in a financial system, we separately calibrate the model to six representative countries. Three
of them, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Brazil, have relatively extreme financial constraints.
For example, only 6.7% of firms in Pakistan have access to credit; the average collateral
requirement in Bangladesh is 271.4% of the loan size; and in Brazil, the interest spread
between lending rates and deposit rates is as high as 35.4%. The model implies that policies
that relax the collateral constraint in Bangladesh and reduce the intermediation cost in
Brazil would be more effective in increasing GDP and TFP, which is consistent with the
inference directly drawn from the tight collateral constraint in Bangladesh and the high


                                               6
interest rate spread in Brazil. However, choosing the policy instrument entirely based on
descriptive statistics could be misleading because these statistics are endogenously determined
in equilibrium. For instance, the model implies that relaxing the collateral constraint rather
than reducing the credit entry cost would increase the GDP of Pakistan more, even though
the country’s credit access ratio is low.
   The other three countries analyzed are the Philippines, Kenya, and Zambia, which have
relatively balanced financial constraints. It is difficult to tell which financial constraint is
most binding simply by looking at the descriptive statistics for the credit access ratio, the
collateral-to-loan ratio, and the interest rate spread. By calibrating the model to these
countries, we are able to systematically evaluate the potential impacts of different policy
instruments, and hence shed light on the real underlying bottleneck. Our model provides a
structural framework to systematically study the potential implications of different financial
inclusion policies, providing complementary and arguably more accurate evaluations than
simple summary statistics.
   Finally, to evaluate our model’s ability to explain real-world policy intervention, we apply
it to the analysis of a large-scale financial liberalization policy implemented in Thailand
during the period from 1986 to 1995. The model is able to explain a large fraction of the
cumulative growth in GDP and TFP, and can also generate a hump-shaped income Gini
coefficient that resembles the data. Importantly, the model allows us to separately quantify
the extent to which relaxing different constraints can drive economic growth and the dynamics
of income inequality.


Related Literature. Our paper is related to the literature that uses models of occupational
choice and financial frictions to study the aggregate and distributional impacts of financial
intermediation (see, e.g., Banerjee and Newman, 1993; Lloyd-Ellis and Bernhardt, 2000;
Gine and Townsend, 2004; Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006; Jeong and Townsend, 2007, 2008;
Amaral and Quintin, 2010; Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011, 2012; Greenwood, Sanchez and



                                               7
Wang, 2013; Moll, 2014). In contrast to these studies, our model introduces multiple financial
frictions to the occupational choice framework to highlight multiple dimensions of financial
inclusion within an economy. The model also uncovers how different frictions interact with
each other.
   Our paper is particularly related to studies in which multiple financial frictions co-exist
and are compared. For example, Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004) and Clementi and
Hopenhayn (2006) find that moral hazard and limited commitment have different implications
for firm dynamics. Abraham and Pavoni (2005) and Doepke and Townsend (2006) illustrate
how consumption allocations differ under moral hazard with and without hidden savings
versus full information. Ahlin and Townsend (2007) emphasize regional variations in obstacles
to trade and financial constraints. Martin and Taddei (2013) study the implications of
adverse selection on macroeconomic aggregates and contrast them with those under limited
commitment. Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) estimate the financial/information regime in
place for households (including those running businesses) in Thailand and find that a financial
regime constrained by moral hazard fits the data best in urban areas, while a regime that is
more limited by savings is more applicable for rural areas. Relatedly, Paulson, Townsend and
Karaivanov (2006) argue that moral hazard best fits the data in the more urban central region
of Thailand but not in the more rural northeast. Kinnan (2014) uses a different metric based
on the first-order conditions characterizing optimal insurance under moral hazard, limited
commitment, and hidden income to distinguish between these regimes in Thai data. Moll,
Townsend and Zhorin (2014) develop a general equilibrium framework that encompasses
different types of frictions, and examine their interactions. More recently, Nikolov, Schmid
and Steri (2018) develop a rich structural corporate model incorporating multiple financial
frictions, with the goal of identifying sources of financial constraints using firm-level data.
Our paper is different from these studies in that we emphasize the rich interactions among
financial constraints and the tradeoffs between different policy instruments.
   Our paper is also related to the literature on misallocation (see, e.g., Hsieh and Klenow,


                                              8
2009; Banerjee and Moll, 2010; Caselli and Gennaioli, 2013; Midrigan and Xu, 2014; Moll,
2014; Bassetto, Cagetti and De Nardi, 2015) and inequality (see, e.g., Davies, 1982; Huggett,
1996; Aghion and Bolton, 1997; Quadrini, 2000; Castaneda, Diaz-Gimenez and Rios-Rull,
2003; Nardi, 2004; Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006, 2009; Benhabib, Bisin and Zhu, 2011, 2015;
De Nardi and Yang, 2016; De Nardi, Giulio and Yang, 2016). Our contribution is to show
that policy instruments that target different financial sector frictions have differential impacts
on resource allocation and inequality.



2     Model

We develop a general equilibrium model of heterogeneous agents with multiple sources of
financial frictions to study the equilibrium interactions among different financial constraints.


2.1    Agents

Heterogeneity and Demographics. Time is indexed by t. The economy is populated by a
continuum of agents of measure one and there is no population growth. Agents live indefinitely
and are heterogeneous in terms of wealth bt and entrepreneurial productivity zt . Wealth
bt evolves endogenously, determined by forward-looking savings decisions. Productivity zt
follows an exogenous stochastic process. In particular, with probability γ, agents retain their
productivity in the previous period; with probability 1 − γ, agents draw a new productivity
from a time-invariant Pareto distribution µ(z) governed by the tail parameter θ. The shocks
to productivity can be interpreted as changes in market conditions that affect the profitability
of individual skills (see Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011).


Preferences. Agents derive utility from consumption ct and have preferences

Technology. In any period t, agents can choose to be workers or entrepreneurs. Each worker
supplies one unit of labor inelasticly and earns the equilibrium wage wt . Each entrepreneur
operates a technology that uses capital kt and labor lt as inputs to produce output. The
profitability of an entrepreneurial business depends on the agent’s productivity; specifically,
the output f (kt , lt , zt ) is given by


                                      f (kt , lt , zt ) = zt (ktα lt1−α )1−ν ,                      (2.2)


where 1 − ν is the span-of-control parameter, representing the share of output accruing to
variable factors. Out of this, a fraction α goes to capital and 1 − α goes to labor. Production
exhibits diminishing returns to scale, with ν > 0. Capital depreciates at rate δ. Our
specification of technology follows Buera and Shin (2011), and is also close to Quadrini (2000)
and Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) among many others.4


2.2       Financial Markets

The only asset in the economy is capital. This is equivalent to assuming the existence of
a perfect technology that can freely transform capital into consumption goods. Perfectly
competitive financial intermediaries receive deposits from all agents and lend to entrepreneurs.
The deposit interest rate rt is determined endogenously by the capital market clearing
condition at time t. Following Buera and Shin (2011), we focus on within-period credit for
production purposes. We do not allow borrowing for consumption smoothing across periods
by imposing bt ≥ 0. Therefore, only entrepreneurs borrow from intermediaries.
       The key distinction of our model is that we introduce and examine three sources of
   4
     Unlike Quadrini (2000) and Cagetti and De Nardi (2006), we do not model heterogeneous working ability
or the corporate sector. We focus on the entrepreneurial sector to demonstrate the interactions among
different financial constraints and what important role they might play in policy evaluation. As discussed
in Appendix C.2, introducing the corporate sector would affect the response of interest rates and wages to
financial inclusion policies, which may consequently have different implications for wealth inequality.

financial frictions in a unified framework. Each source of friction reflects one particular aspect
of financial market imperfection. These three types of financial constraints naturally give
rise conceptually to three policy instruments, each targeting a specific constraint. The three
frictions are described below.


Limited Credit Access. Entrepreneurs incur a fixed credit entry cost ψ to borrow from
intermediaries. The modeling of fixed entry costs for obtaining credit follows Greenwood
and Jovanovic (1990) and Townsend and Ueda (2006) among others. It captures, for
example, various fees associated with financial accounts, the cost of bookkeeping and exchange
(transportation), and others (see, e.g., Townsend, 1983).
   We assume that an agent lives in a “credit regime” if the agent pays the cost ψ and can
borrow, and in a “savings regime” if the agent does not pay ψ and can therefore only save. In
equilibrium, the fixed entry cost ψ is more likely to exclude poor entrepreneurs from financial
markets, as it amounts to a larger fraction of their wealth.


Collateral Constraint. The credit contract that entrepreneurs receive is subject to a col-
lateral requirement due to limited enforceability of debt contracts. In particular, consider
an entrepreneur with wealth bt who approaches financial intermediaries for a loan xt at the
competitive equilibrium lending interest rate rtl . After obtaining the loan xt , the entrepreneur
transforms her wealth-on-hand bt − ψ + xt costlessly into capital kt = bt − ψ + xt , which is
then used as collateral to secure the loan xt . The entrepreneur is free to default and walk
away with her income and wealth at any time, but if she does, the financial intermediaries
will seize the collateral. Following Jermann and Quadrini (2009, 2012), we assume that the
liquidation value of capital is uncertain at the time of contracting. With probability 1 − ξ
intermediaries recover the full value kt , but with probability ξ they recovery nothing. Thus
to avoid default, the amount of loan xt that intermediaries are willing to lend is restricted to
xt ≤ (1 − ξ)kt . Substituting xt , we can derive the entrepreneur’s capital constraint in terms



                                               11
of her wealth bt :
                                               ξkt ≤ bt − ψ.                                       (2.3)

The single parameter ξ ∈ [0, 1] parsimoniously captures the tightness of the borrowing
constraint, with ξ = 1 corresponding to financial autarky, where all capital must be self-
financed by entrepreneurs with their wealth bt − ψ.


Intermediation Inefficiency. We assume that the lending interest rate rtl is higher than the
deposit interest rate rt by a margin χ, i.e., rtl = rt + χ. Thus for the loan xt , entrepreneurs
pay intermediation fees equal to χxt . The interest rate spread χ reflects the efficiency of
financial intermediation. For example, as noted by Townsend (1983), costly intermediation
could arise from the cost of enforcement and monitoring when information is imperfect.


2.3     Agents’ Problem

We formulate the agent’s problem recursively. Denote by Vt (bt , zt ) the value function of the
agent of type (bt , zt ). Denote by Wt (bt , zt ) or Et (bt , zt ) the agent’s value if she chooses to be
a worker or an entrepreneur at time t. The occupation choice is made to maximize utility,


                              Vt (bt , zt ) = max {Wt (bt , zt ), Et (bt , zt )} .                 (2.4)


The value function also generally depends on time t because we consider transitional dynamics.
For ease of exposition, we denote variables and distributions in steady states by omitting the
subscript t. The worker’s value is given by

                                                  c1−σ
                                                   t
                            Wt (bt , zt ) = max        + βEt [Vt+1 (bt+1 , zt+1 )]                 (2.5)
                                             ct   1−σ
                       s.t. ct + bt+1 = (1 + rt )bt + wt , with ct , bt+1 ≥ 0.


   The entrepreneur’s value is determined by comparing the cases with and without borrowing


                                                      12
from financial intermediaries. Denote by Ets (bt , zt ) or Etc (bt , zt ) the entrepreneur’s value when
capital is financed with savings only or with credit as well. The borrowing decision is made
to maximize utility,
                               Et (bt , zt ) = max {Ets (bt , zt ), Etc (bt , zt )} .            (2.6)

   In the savings regime, the agent finances production herself and the remaining wealth is
deposited in financial intermediaries for interest earnings. The value function in the savings
regime is

                                                c1−σ
                                                 t
                  Ets (bt , zt ) = max               + βEt [Vt+1 (bt+1 , zt+1 )]                 (2.7)
                                   ct ,kt ,lt   1−σ
              s.t. ct + bt+1 = zt (ktα lt1−α )1−ν + (1 − δ)kt − wt lt + (1 + rt )(bt − kt ),

                          kt ≤ bt and ct , kt , lt , bt+1 ≥ 0.


   In the credit regime, the agent takes out loans to finance production. Without loss of
generality, we only consider the case in which the agent invests kt > bt in the credit regime,
because investing kt ≤ bt but paying the credit entry cost is obviously not optimal. Thus, we
can write the value function in the credit regime as

                                        c1−σ
                                         t
             Etc (bt , zt ) = max            + βEt [Vt+1 (bt+1 , zt+1 )]                         (2.8)
                           ct ,kt ,lt   1−σ
         s.t. ct + bt+1 = zt (ktα lt1−α )1−ν + (1 − δ)kt − wt lt − (1 + rt + χ)(kt − bt + ψ),

                    ξkt ≤ bt − ψ and ct , lt , bt+1 ≥ 0 and kt > bt .


   Panel A of Figure 2 illustrates the choice of occupation for agents with different levels
of wealth and productivity. Depending on whether the occupation choice is constrained by
wealth, we identify four categories of agents: unconstrained workers, constrained workers,
constrained entrepreneurs, and unconstrained entrepreneurs. As shown in the figure, there is
a certain level of productivity below which agents will always find working for a wage better
than operating a business. These agents are identified as unconstrained workers, because their

Note: Panel A illustrates the occupation choice in the presence of financial frictions (i.e., ψ = 0.05, χ = 0.05, ξ = 0.5). Panel
B illustrates the occupation choice in a perfect financial market (i.e., ψ = χ = ξ = 0) in partial equilibrium with the same
interest rate and wage as panel A. In general equilibrium, when we move from an economy with financial frictions to an economy
without financial frictions, the interest rate and wage will also change, which is analyzed in Section 4. The other parameters
for plotting the figure are r = 0.05, w = 0.8, δ = 0.06, ν = 0.19, α = 0.33.

                     Figure 2: Occupation choice with/without financial frictions.

productivity is so low that they will never find it optimal to become entrepreneurs. Above
this level of productivity, there are three regions. The left region refers to constrained workers.
These agents are productive but do not have sufficient wealth to operate businesses at a
profitable scale. The middle region represents constrained entrepreneurs who have sufficient
wealth to operate profitable businesses, but their scale of business is constrained. Agents in
the right region choose to be entrepreneurs, operating businesses at the unconstrained scale,
with the marginal return on capital equal to the marginal cost. Thus, they are classified as
unconstrained entrepreneurs.
    In the presence of financial market frictions, the decision to become an entrepreneur and
the scale of business not only depends on productivity zt but also on wealth bt . By contrast,
when the financial market is perfect (i.e., ψ = χ = ξ = 0), panel B of Figure 2 indicates
that productive agents always choose to be entrepreneurs and operate their businesses at the
unconstrained scale. We formally state this result in Proposition 1.

Proposition 1. In the absence of financial frictions, there exists a threshold of entrepreneurial
productivity z t , and the agent will choose to be an entrepreneur if and only if z ≥ z t .

3         Data and Calibration

We use data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys and World Development Indicators
to discipline the model. We calibrate the model by first matching the moments for the
Philippines, which serves as our benchmark calibration. The sample contains 1,335 firms
interviewed from November 2014 through May 2016. In Section 5.1, we calibrate the model
to target moments of other countries and show that it could be used to conduct cross-country
analyses.
        We set the risk-aversion parameter σ = 1.5 and the span-of-control parameter ν = 0.19
following standard practice. The one-year depreciation rate δ is set to 0.06. The aggregate
income share of capital α is set to 0.33. The remaining six parameters are calibrated by
matching relevant moments in the data as shown in Table 1.
        The three key parameters, ψ, ξ, and χ, capturing the financial frictions, are calibrated to
match the three moments that reflect the country’s financial development. These moments
are the percentage of firms with access to credit, the collateral-to-loan ratio, and the interest
rate spread.5 The 4% interest rate spread directly identifies the parameter χ. For firms
    5
        Appendix Figure C.1 presents the sensitivity of these moments to each key parameter.




                                                      16
with access to credit, the average collateral as a percentage of loans is 156.7%, indicating
that for each unit of credit, the firm has to post 1.57 units of collateral on average. This
moment provides information about the tightness of the collateral constraint, governed by
the parameter ξ. In the Philippines, the fraction of firms with credit access is 29.9%, which
identifies the credit entry cost ψ.6
        Buera and Shin (2011) and Moll (2014) show that with persistent productivity, en-
trepreneurs can accumulate wealth on their own and overcome financial constraints. We thus
identify the parameter γ by matching the gross savings as a percentage of GDP.7 We set
the discount factor β to match the real interest rate of 6.2%. The parameter θ governs the
distribution of agents’ entrepreneurial productivity. A lower θ implies that the distribution is
more right-skewed, and hence top entrepreneurs will employ a larger fraction of labor in the
economy. We thus calibrate θ to match the employment share distribution. Specifically, we
use four brackets of employment shares, corresponding to the fraction of labor employed by
the top 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40% of entrepreneurs ranked in terms of their business income.



4         Distinguishing the Impact of Policy Instruments

In this section, we systematically examine the aggregate implications of different financial
inclusion policies on GDP and TFP in steady states. We first present formulas to decompose
changes in GDP and TFP. Next, we evaluate the aggregate implications of policy instru-
ments and how they interact with each other in equilibrium. Finally, we shed light on the
distributional implications of these policies on welfare.
    6
     The calibrated value of ψ amounts to about 10.4% of the average wealth of entrepreneurs in the credit
regime. Our model requires a high value of ψ in order to rationalize the low credit access ratio in the data.
In the literature, Townsend and Ueda (2006) calibrate a fixed entry cost that amounts to one-third of wealth
to match the low credit access ratio in Thailand in 1976.
   7
     A more direct way to estimate γ is to use the information on entry and exit rates of entrepreneurship.
However, it is difficult to find uniform and high-quality data on business entries and exits for different
countries studied in this paper. When applying our model to Thailand in Section 5.2, we use the information
on households’ business turnovers to calibrate γ in a more direct manner.

In our model, financial inclusion is reflected in lower values of the parameters, Ω ≡ (ψ, ξ, χ).
We decompose the effect of financial inclusion through the extensive and intensive margins.
On the one hand, relaxing financial constraints can increase GDP and TFP through the
extensive margin by increasing the credit access ratio (i.e., entrepreneurs move from the
savings regime to the credit regime). On the other hand, relaxing financial constraints enables
entrepreneurs who already have access to credit to scale up their production, boosting GDP
and TFP through the intensive margin. In particular, the effect of financial inclusion on
GDP and TFP can be decomposed as follows.

Proposition 2. Consider a financial inclusion policy that relaxes the constraints from Ω to
Ω0 , with Ω0 ≤ Ω. The increase in steady-state GDP is given by

                        Z Z        b(z;Ω)
                                             y (b, z; Ω0 )h(b, z; Ω0 ) − y S (b, z; Ω)h(b, z; Ω) dbdz
                                             C                                                 
      GDPΩ0 − GDPΩ =                                                                                            (4.1)
                          z    b(z;Ω0 )
                              Z Z ∞
                                               y (b, z; Ω0 )h(b, z; Ω0 ) − y C (b, z; Ω)h(b, z; Ω) dbdz
                                               C                                                 

                               z    b(z;Ω)

                                                    S                                                 

where b(z; Ω) denotes the threshold of wealth above which entrepreneurs of productivity z will
choose to access credit in the steady state of the economy with Ω. The variables y S (b, z; Ω)
and y C (b, z; Ω) are entrepreneurs’ output net of the deadweight loss arising from financial
frictions in the savings and credit regimes, respectively (see Appendix A).

   The first term on the right-hand side of equation (4.1) captures the increase in GDP
through the extensive margin, because when b(z; Ω0 ) < b(z; Ω), more entrepreneurs will move
from the savings regime to the credit regime and they will produce more. The second term
captures the increase through the intensive margin, because when y C (b, z; Ω0 ) > y C (b, z; Ω),
entrepreneurs who are already in the credit regime will expand their scale of production. The
third term reflects the general equilibrium effect on entrepreneurs who remain in the savings

regime after the financial inclusion policy is implemented.
       We define the model-implied steady-state TFP as TFPΩ = YΩ /(KΩα L1−α
                                                                        Ω ), where YΩ ,

KΩ , and LΩ are steady-state aggregate output, capital, and labor in the economy with Ω.8
By exploring the equivalence between growth accounting by factor and growth accounting
by regime, we can decompose the economy’s change in steady-state TFP along similar
dimensions.9

Proposition 3. Consider a financial inclusion policy that relaxes the constraints from Ω to
Ω0 , with Ω0 ≤ Ω. The increase in steady-state TFP is given by


 TFPΩ0 − TFPΩ =gpc spy − αspk − (1 − α)spl TFPΩ + scy gyc − αsck gkc − (1 − α)scl glc TFPΩ
                                                                                  


               + ssy gys − αssk gks − (1 − α)ssl gls TFPΩ ,
                                                   
                                                                                       (4.2)


where spy , ssy , scy , spk , ssk , sck , spl , ssl , scl are defined in Appendix B.3. gpc is the percentage
change in the fraction of entrepreneurs with credit access after the financial inclusion policy
is implemented. gys , gyc , gks , gkc , gls , and glc are the percentage change in the average output,
capital, and labor in the savings regime and the credit regime after the financial inclusion
policy is implemented.

       In equation (4.2), the first term on the right-hand side captures the increase in TFP
through the extensive margin, attributed to entrepreneurs who move from the savings regime
to the credit regime. The second term captures the increase in TFP through the intensive
margin, attributed to entrepreneurs who are already in the credit regime before the financial
inclusion policy is implemented. The third term captures the general equilibrium effect
from entrepreneurs who remain in the savings regime after the financial inclusion policy is
implemented.
   8
      Moll (2014) shows that when entrepreneurs have constant-return-to-scale production technology, TFP is
equal to the average individual productivity weighted by wealth.
    9
      Our decomposition is in a similar spirit to the approach of Jeong and Townsend (2007), who decompose
the increase in TFP into the occupational shift effect, the financial deepening effect, the capital heterogeneity
effect, and sectoral Solow residuals.


                                                       19
   Because the extensive and intensive margins benefit different agents, by analyzing by how
much different financial inclusion policies increase GDP and TFP through the two margins,
we can better understand the implication of these policies on inequality and the distribution
of income. In the rest of this section, we use these formulas to quantitatively assess the
contribution of the two margins to increases in GDP and TFP, and discuss their link to
inequality.


4.2    Aggregate Implications of Financial Inclusion

In this section, we analyze the steady-state implications of the three policy instruments in the
Philippines. In particular, we vary the value of ψ, ξ, or χ, holding the other two parameters
at their calibrated values. These counterfactual experiments capture what would happen
in the steady state if the government uses a single policy instrument to increase financial
inclusion.
   In Figure 3, we plot the increase in steady-state GDP (the blue solid lines in panels A,
B, C) and TFP (the blue solid lines in panels D, E, F) when ψ, ξ, or χ is reduced while
the other two parameters are held at their calibrated values. For example, panels A and D
imply that when the credit entry cost ψ is reduced from 2 to 0, steady-state GDP and TFP
increase by about 12.5% and 8.2% respectively; panels B and E show that steady-state GDP
and TFP increase by about 71.8% and 53.3% respectively when the collateral constraint ξ is
lowered from 0.7 to 0; and panels C and F show that steady-state GDP and TFP increase by
about 1.4% and 0.8% respectively, when the intermediation cost χ is lowered from 0.08 to 0.
These counterfactual experiments clearly illustrate that steady-state GDP and TFP respond
differently to various financial constraints. In Section 5.1 below, we apply our model to
different countries and demonstrate that it can be used to identify the most binding financial
constraint in a country.
   We use formulas (4.1) and (4.2) to understand the margins through which steady-state
GDP and TFP increase after financial constraints are relaxed. The red dashed line shows

Note: In panels A – C, the blue solid line plots the percentage increase in GDP relative to the benchmark economy associated
with the leftmost parameter value on the x-axis (i.e., ψ = 2 in panel A, ξ = 0.7 in panel B, and χ = 0.08 in panel C). For each
parameter value on the x-axis, we use formula (4.1) to decompose the corresponding increase in GDP relative to the benchmark.
The red dashed line plots the contribution of the savings regime (the third term in formula 4.1). The height of the light grey
area represents the contribution of the intensive margin (the second term in formula 4.1). The height of the dark grey area
represents the contribution of the extensive margin (the first term in formula 4.1). In panels D – F, we perform the same
exercise for TFP using formula (4.2). The blue circle in each panel represents the corresponding value under our calibration in
Table 1.

           Figure 3: Impact of financial inclusion on GDP and TFP in steady states.

that owing to a general equilibrium effect, the savings regime negatively contributes to the
overall increase in steady-state GDP and TFP. Intuitively, as financial constraints are relaxed,
resources are more efficiently allocated toward more productive entrepreneurs, increasing
the demand for capital and labor, which drives up the equilibrium interest rate and wage.
Entrepreneurs who remain in the savings regime do not benefit from the relaxed financial
constraints. Instead, a higher cost of production leads to their optimally choosing to produce
less output. In addition, there is a composition effect. As relatively productive entrepreneurs
obtain credit, the average productivity of entrepreneurs in the savings regime will fall,
negatively contributing to the overall increase in steady-state TFP. Quantitatively, when ψ,
ξ, and χ are reduced from their leftmost values on the x-axis to zero, the savings regime
contributes to about -4.9%, -55.4%, and -1.2% of the increase in steady-state GDP, and -2.3%,

                                                                            21
-18.0%, and -0.2% of the increase in steady-state TFP, respectively.
       The heights of the light and dark grey areas in Figure 3 represent the contributions of the
intensive and extensive margins, respectively. Although both margins contribute positively
to the increase in steady-state GDP and TFP when financial constraints are relaxed, our
simulation suggests that the magnitude of their effects largely depends on the values of ψ, ξ,
and χ. Specifically, panels A and D of Figure 3 show that the intensive margin contributes
to a significant portion of the increase in steady-state GDP and TFP. This is because a
lower credit entry cost ψ increases pledgeable collateral, allowing entrepreneurs in the credit
regime to expand their production. By contrast, our simulation suggests that when ψ is
reduced from 2 to 0.9, the extensive margin has a negligible contribution to the increase in
steady-state GDP and TFP. Only when ψ is further reduced to values below 0.9 does the
extensive margin start to play a role. Intuitively, this is because high values of ψ lead of to
financial exclusion. Unless ψ is sufficiently reduced, most entrepreneurs cannot afford the
high credit entry cost.10
       By contrast, panels B and E show that when the collateral constraint ξ is reduced, both
intensive and extensive margins contribute significantly to the increase in steady-state GDP
and TFP. Relaxing the collateral constraint allows entrepreneurs with access to credit to
borrow more to expand their production, increasing steady-state GDP and TFP through the
intensive margin. Moreover, the lower collateral constraint also encourages more entrepreneurs
to pay the credit entry cost and enter the credit regime, thereby increasing steady-state GDP
and TFP through the extensive margin.
       Panels C and F show that when the intermediation cost χ is reduced, most of the increase
in steady-state GDP and TFP is attributed to the extensive margin instead of the intensive
margin. Intuitively, a lower intermediation cost effectively reduces the user cost of capital,
which motivates entrepreneurs to invest more and expand their businesses. However, because
the parameter ξ remains unchanged, the scale of business is restricted by the tight collateral
  10
    As shown in panel A1 of Appendix Figure C.1, the credit access ratio remains low when ψ is greater
than 0.9, and this ratio starts to increase significantly only when ψ is further reduced.


                                                 22
constraint, limiting the effect of reducing χ. On the other hand, a lower intermediation cost
encourages more productive, but wealth-constrained entrepreneurs to enter the credit regime,
contributing to the increase in steady-state GDP and TFP through the extensive margin.


4.3       Equilibrium Interactions of Policy Instruments

Our previous analysis indicates that policy instruments targeting different financial constraints
may have differential effects on GDP and TFP. In principle, countries may also adopt more
comprehensive policies that alleviate multiple financial frictions at the same time. What
would their potential effects on GDP be and through which margin? To what extent does
the effect of targeting one financial constraint depend on the tightness of other financial
constraints?
   In this section, we explore these questions to understand how different constraints interact
in equilibrium. We first examine individuals’ output and credit access in partial equilibrium
to analytically characterize the interaction effect. Next, we use the calibrated model to
quantitatively evaluate the interaction effect in general equilibrium. Our findings suggest
that it is important for policy makers to identify and alleviate the most binding financial
constraint.


Interactions in Partial Equilibrium As discussed in Section 4.1, financial inclusion policies
increase GDP through both the extensive margin (by increasing the credit access ratio) and the
intensive margin (by allowing entrepreneurs with credit access to scale up their production).
Below, we relax multiple constraints simultaneously and study the interaction effect through
each margin. For analytical tractability, we focus on a stylized partial-equilibrium example
with fixed interest rate r, wage w, and constant-returns-to-scale production function (i.e.,
ν = 0).

Proposition 4. (Extensive Margin) Let b(Ω) ≡ b(z; Ω) be the threshold of wealth above which
entrepreneurs of productivity z choose to access credit in the economy with Ω. Consider fixed

                                               23
interest rate r, wage w, and ν = 0. We have
    i. Tightening (relaxing) each financial constraint reduces (improves) credit access:

                                     ∂b(Ω)      ∂b(Ω)       ∂b(Ω)
                                           ,          ,           ≥ 0.                       (4.3)
                                      ∂ψ         ∂ξ          ∂χ

   ii. b(Ω) has submodularity in Ω, suggesting that the effect through the extensive margin
       of relaxing one constraint is smaller when the other constraints are more relaxed:

                  ∂ 2 b(Ω)   ∂ 2 b(Ω)     ∂ 2 b(Ω)   ∂ 2 b(Ω)     ∂ 2 b(Ω)   ∂ 2 b(Ω)
                           =          ,            =          ,            =          ≥ 0.   (4.4)
                   ∂ψ∂ξ       ∂ξ∂ψ         ∂ξ∂χ       ∂χ∂ξ        ∂χ∂ψ       ∂ψ∂χ

   The first-order partial derivatives are positive, indicating that relaxing any constraint
(i.e., reducing ψ, ξ, or χ) unambiguously reduces the threshold of wealth b(Ω). Since a
lower b(Ω) means more entrepreneurs will gain access to credit, Proposition 4.i indicates
that relaxing these constraints will increase the credit access ratio. The second-order cross
partial derivatives are positive, indicating that the impact of relaxing any constraint on
b(Ω) would be smaller when the other two constraints are more relaxed (i.e., lower ψ, ξ,
or χ). Therefore, Proposition 4 indicates that the three policy instruments dampen each
other’s effect through the extensive margin. For example, when the credit entry cost ψ is
lower, relaxing the borrowing constraint ξ or reducing the intermediation cost χ would have
a smaller effect on reducing the wealth threshold b(Ω). Intuitively, when the credit entry
cost ψ is low, most firms already have access to finance. As such, there is little room for
increasing credit access further by relaxing the other two constraints.

Proposition 5. (Intensive Margin) Let y C (Ω) ≡ y C (b, z; Ω) be the net output of entrepreneurs
of productivity z and wealth b in the credit regime (see its formula in Appendix A). Consider
fixed interest rate r, wage w, and ν = 0. We have
    i. Tightening (relaxing) each financial constraint reduces (raises) output:

                                  ∂y C (Ω)     ∂y C (Ω)     ∂y C (Ω)
                                           ,            ,            ≤ 0.                    (4.5)
                                    ∂ψ           ∂ξ           ∂χ

                                                 24
   ii. y C (Ω) has supermodularity, suggesting that the effect through the intensive margin of
          relaxing one constraint is larger when the other constraints are more relaxed:

             ∂ 2 y C (Ω)   ∂ 2 y C (Ω)     ∂ 2 y C (Ω)   ∂ 2 y C (Ω)     ∂ 2 y C (Ω)   ∂ 2 y C (Ω)
                         =             ,               =             ,               =             ≥ 0.   (4.6)

   The first-order partial derivatives are negative, indicating that relaxing any constraint
(i.e., reducing ψ, ξ, or χ) unambiguously increases the output y C (Ω) of entrepreneurs with
credit access, increasing GDP through the intensive margin. The second-order cross partial
derivatives are positive, indicating that the impact of relaxing any constraint on y C (Ω) would
be larger when the other two constraints are more relaxed (i.e., lower ψ, ξ, or χ). Therefore,
Proposition 5 implies that relaxing any two constraints has complementary effects on output.
For example, when the credit entry cost ψ is lower, relaxing the borrowing constraint ξ or
reducing the intermediation cost χ would have a larger effect on increasing y C (Ω). Intuitively,
when the credit entry cost ψ is lower, entrepreneurs are left with more wealth after entering
the credit regime, which increases pledgeable capital for borrowing. As a result, relaxing the
collateral constraint ξ or reducing the intermediation cost χ would have a larger effect on
output.
   Our analytical results reveal that different constraints are complements through the
intensive margin and substitutes through the extensive margin. This implies that relaxing
multiple constraints simultaneously could, in principle, bring larger or smaller GDP gains
than relaxing each constraint separately, depending on whether the overall interaction effect
is positive or negative. For example, if the interaction effect through the intensive margin
dominates, policy makers should develop a more balanced financial system, because different
financial constraints are complements in constraining GDP. In this case, policies that alleviate
the most binding financial constraint would be most effective. On the other hand, if the
interaction effect through the extensive margin dominates, policy makers should alleviate a
single constraint while ignoring all other constraints.

Quantitative Evaluation. We now use our calibrated model to quantitatively study the
interaction effect through the extensive and intensive margins. We present a sequence of
counterfactual experiments in general equilibrium where the interest rate, wage, and the
distribution of wealth and productivity are endogenously determined in the steady state of
each counterfactual experiment. In each experiment, we measure the percentage increase in
steady-state GDP after relaxing one financial constraint (i.e., the target constraint) conditional
on different values of the second constraint (i.e., the moving constraint), while at the same
time keeping the third constraint unchanged. Thus, our experiments essentially measure
the interaction effect between the target and the moving constraint. For our three financial
constraints (ψ, ξ, χ), six combinations are possible as presented in Figure 4.
   Panel A considers ψ as the target constraint and ξ as the moving constraint. On the
y-axis, we plot the percentage increase in steady-state GDP (the blue solid line) resulting
from reducing the target constraint ψ from its calibrated value of 0.95 to 0.8 for different
values of the moving constraint ξ (from 0.7 to 0 as shown on the x-axis). The dark grey
and light grey areas, and the red-dashed line represent the increase in steady-state GDP
attributed to the extensive margin, the intensive margin, and the savings regime respectively.
   Moving from the left to the right along the x-axis, as the collateral constraint is relaxed
(i.e., lowering ξ), we observe that the intensive-margin effect increases while the extensive-
margin effect diminishes, consistent with the implications of Propositions 4 and 5. Moreover,
the interaction effect through the intensive margin dominates that through the extensive
margin. That is, when we relax the collateral constraint, the (increasing) intensive-margin
effect is larger than the (decreasing) extensive-margin effect. As a result, reducing ψ increases
steady-state GDP more when the collateral constraint is relaxed (see the upward-sloping blue
solid line). Similarly, in panel B, we hold ψ as the target constraint and consider χ as the
moving constraint. Again, moving from the left to the right along the x-axis (i.e., lowering
χ), the intensive-margin effect increases whereas the extensive-margin effect diminishes. The
former dominates the latter, resulting in a larger increase in steady-state GDP from reducing

Note: This figure visualizes the interaction effects among financial constraints in general equilibrium with fixed interest rate,
wage, and distribution of agents. Panels A and B present the percentage increase in steady-state GDP when ψ is reduced from
its calibrated value of 0.95 to 0.8. Panel A visualizes the interaction effect between ψ and ξ when ξ is varied from 0.7 to 0 while
χ is kept at its calibrated value. For each value of ξ, we decompose the increase in GDP (owing to reducing ψ from 0.95 to 0.8)
into three components according to formula (4.1). The red dashed line plots the contribution of the savings regime (the third
term in formula 4.1). The height of the light grey area represents the contribution of the intensive margin (the second term in
formula 4.1). The height of the dark grey area represents the contribution of the extensive margin (the first term in formula
4.1). Panel B studies the interaction effect between ψ and χ when χ is varied from 0.08 to 0 while ξ is kept at its calibrated
value. Panels C and D present the percentage increase in steady-state GDP when ξ is reduced from its calibrated value of 0.335
to 0.29, interacting with different values of ψ and χ. Panels E and F present the percentage increase in steady-state GDP when
χ is reduced from its calibrated value of 0.04 to 0, interacting with different values of ψ and ξ.

ψ. These patterns are also observed in panels C and D, where we reduce the target constraint
ξ from 0.335 to 0.29, as well as in panels E and F, where we reduce the target constraint χ
from 0.04 to 0.
    Our results imply that the net effect on GDP is larger when policy makers alleviate multiple
financial constraints together than when they relax the financial constraints individually. In
other words, effective financial inclusion policies should be designed to develop a well-rounded
financial system, as reflected in a high breadth (i.e., high credit access), depth (i.e., relaxed
collateral constraints), and efficiency (i.e., low intermediation costs).

4.4       Distributional Implications of Financial Inclusion

We now move to the distributional implications of financial inclusion policies in steady states.
We conduct three counterfactual experiments for the Philippines. In the first experiment,
we reduce the credit entry cost ψ from the calibrated value of 0.95 to 0. In the second
experiment, we assume that borrowing is frictionless by reducing the collateral constraint ξ
from the calibrated value of 0.335 to 0. In the third experiment, we assume perfect financial
intermediation by reducing the intermediation cost χ from the calibrated value of 0.04 to 0.
Figure 5 presents the change in steady-state welfare (consumption-equivalent measure) for
agents of different wealth and productivity.11
       Panel A shows that reducing the credit entry cost ψ increases the steady-state welfare for
all agents, but by different magnitudes. Agents in the region enclosed by “4” obtain relatively
small welfare gains (less than 4%). These agents are mostly unconstrained entrepreneurs
(see Figure 2) who are wealthy but not productive, operating businesses at small scales and
do not demand much external credit. Thus reducing the credit entry cost does not benefit
these entrepreneurs much as most of them are currently unconstrained. Agents in the region
enclosed by “8” obtain the largest welfare gains (more than 8%). These agents are currently
  11
    Note that due to the existence of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, agents who are productive now can be
unproductive in the future, and vice versa. Our value functions derived from forward-looking agents already
capture the effect from such dynamic changes in individual characteristics. In Appendix C.2, we discuss the
implications of financial inclusion on the distribution of income and wealth.



                                                                              28
constrained workers, who are productive but poor. A lower credit entry cost allows them to
access credit and start businesses, significantly increasing their life-time utility. The agents
in the middle region obtain modest welfare gains, between 4% and 8%. These agents are
currently either unconstrained workers who obtain welfare gains due to higher wages, or
constrained entrepreneurs who expand their businesses due to a lower credit entry cost.
   In contrast to panel A, we find that not everyone gains when the collateral constraint ξ
is relaxed or the intermediation cost χ is reduced. Panel B shows that when the collateral
constraint ξ is relaxed, agents in the (white) region enclosed by “0” incur welfare losses
in the new steady state. These are the entrepreneurs who are moderately productive and
wealthy. Their businesses are operated at the unconstrained scale, and thus further relaxing
the collateral constraint does not benefit them much. However, relaxing the collateral
constraint results in a general equilibrium effect that increases the cost of production (i.e., the
equilibrium interest rate and wage), reducing their profits. Our simulation implies that the
biggest winners are the most productive but constrained entrepreneurs and the unconstrained
workers, whose welfare increases by more than 10%. The former group benefits from increased
scale of production and the latter from the significant increase in the equilibrium wage.
   Panel C shows that when the intermediation cost χ decreases, agents who are currently
moderately productive but poor (in the region enclosed by “0”) incur welfare losses in the
new steady state. These agents are entrepreneurs who operate their businesses at small scales
due to low productivity. They do not demand much credit and receive little benefit from a
lower intermediation cost. However, they suffer from a higher production cost due to the
rise in the equilibrium interest rate and wage. The agents who obtain the largest welfare
gains (more than 3%) are those in the upper-right region and in the bottom-right region,
enclosed by “3”. The former group consists of constrained entrepreneurs who borrow the
largest amount of credit. Thus, a lower intermediation cost significantly reduces their cost
of production. The latter group consists of wealthy workers, who receive significantly more
interest earnings from their large amounts of savings when the equilibrium interest rate goes

5     Model Applications

The interaction effects among the three financial constraints suggest that effective financial
inclusion policies should be designed to target the most binding constraint. Moreover,
policies that are effective in increasing GDP in one country may not be equally effective in
other countries. As one application of the model, we show that it can be used to evaluate
and compare the effectiveness of implementing different financial inclusion policies across
countries. As another application, we apply our model to the analysis of a large-scale
financial liberalization policy in Thailand and evaluate its ability to explain real-world policy
intervention.


5.1    Identifying the Most Binding Constraint

We consider two groups of countries (see panel A of Table 2). In the first group, we intentionally
choose three countries with extreme financial constraints. These countries are Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Brazil. Their financial systems exhibit sharply different characteristics.
For example, fewer than 6.7% of firms in Pakistan have access to credit whereas the figures
are 34.1% and 59.2% in Bangladesh and Brazil respectively. Among the 139 countries in
our sample, only four have a lower percentage of firms with credit than Pakistan (thus,
the percentile rank of Pakistan is 5/139 ≈ 3.6%). However, among those firms that have
credit access, those in Bangladesh must post collateral that amounts to as much as 271.4%
of the face value of their loans, whereas the figures are 153.4% and 95.1% in Pakistan and
Brazil respectively. Surprisingly, although firms in Brazil tend to have access to credit and
face a more relaxed collateral constraint, the loan interest rate is 35.4 percentage points
higher than the deposit rate. By calibrating our model to these countries (see Appendix
Table B.1 for parameter values), we can test the model’s ability to identify the most binding

constraint and quantitatively evaluate the potential gains from relaxing different constraints.
In the second group, we choose three countries with relatively balanced financial constraints:
the Philippines, Kenya, and Zambia. Kenya’s financial system is relatively developed for a
country with its level of income and also compared with many other Sub-Saharan African
countries. Zambia is a low-income country with an underdeveloped financial system reflected
in all three dimensions: a low credit access ratio, a high collateral requirement, and a high
interest rate spread. Unlike countries in the first group, it is difficult to see which financial
constraint is most binding from a simple eyeball test. Our calibrated model, however, allows
us to identify the bottleneck in their financial systems.
    Panel B presents the changes in steady-state GDP, TFP and income Gini when the six
countries adopt the best-possible financial intermediation technology along a single dimension
(i.e., ψ = 0, ξ = 0, or χ = 0). Regarding the first group of countries, the model implies that
the high intermediation cost is the key friction that hinders aggregate production in Brazil.


                                                                 31
Reducing χ to zero increases Brazil’s steady-state GDP and TFP by 42.44% and 38.31%,
while reducing ψ to zero almost has no effect on steady-state GDP and TFP due to the high
intermediation cost. The model implies that Bangladesh’s most binding financial friction is
the tight collateral constraint. If we relax ξ to zero in Bangladesh, steady-state GDP and
TFP would increase by 111.92% and 77.48% respectively, while reducing either ψ or χ to
zero only increases steady-state GDP by 8.94% or 0.50%. Regarding Pakistan, steady-state
GDP and TFP would increase by 24.96% and 9.71% respectively when the credit entry cost
ψ goes to zero, while keeping ξ and χ unchanged. Relaxing the collateral constraint ξ to zero
boosts steady-state GDP and TFP by 89.71% and 55.59% respectively, while reducing the
intermediation cost χ to zero increases steady-state GDP and TFP by only 0.11% and 0.01%.
Therefore, our model suggests that the most binding financial constraint for Pakistan is the
collateral constraint. This differs from our direct inference from the descriptive statistics in
Table 2. Although only 6.7% of firms in Pakistan have access to credit, the credit entry cost
                                                                   12
is not necessarily the most binding constraint on GDP.
       We conduct similar counterfactual experiments for the second group of countries. The last
three rows of panel B indicate that the collateral requirement is the most binding constraint
in the Philippines and Zambia whereas the credit entry cost is the most binding constraint
in Kenya. In terms of the income inequality, our simulation suggests that reducing the
intermediation cost always increases the income Gini and relaxing the collateral constraint
always reduces the income Gini. Reducing the credit entry cost lowers the income Gini
in all six countries except for Bangladesh.13 In Appendix C.5, we study the transitional
dynamics after implementing financial inclusion policies. We show that short-run transitional
effects may differ from outcomes in long-run steady states, which may be years away. For
  12
     In fact, as we show in Appendix Figure C.1, the credit access ratio is an endogenous variable determined
by all three constraints, not simply the credit entry cost. Thus, the low credit access ratio could be largely
attributed to the tight collateral constraint in Pakistan rather than the high credit entry cost. On the other
hand, our model suggests that reducing the credit entry cost is more effective at boosting GDP in Pakistan
than in Bangladesh. This suggests that the credit entry cost is indeed a more binding constraint in Pakistan
than in Bangladesh.
  13
     In Appendix C.4, we shed light on the margins through which steady-state GDP and TFP increase in
these countries.


                                                     32
example, the short-run interest rate could rise and overshoot the target, resulting in high
borrowing costs. Similarly, reducing the cost of intermediation increases GDP and widens
income inequality, but the short-run effect on GDP could be smaller whereas that on income
inequality is larger. Such intertemporal tradeoffs may raise concerns for policy makers or
lead to time-inconsistent behavior.


5.2    Application: Policy Evaluation in Thailand

Between 1986-1996, Thailand’s economy underwent deep structural changes, including the
liberalization of its financial sector and the economic integration with global financial and
product markets. A series of financial liberalization policies were rapidly adopted with the
intention to develop a highly functional financial system with efficient financial institutions
through the market mechanism.
   Before these financial policies were adopted, the prime lending rate to small- and medium-
sized companies differed substantially from the commercial bank’s deposit rate. The interest
rate spread, measured as the difference between the prime lending rate and the deposit rate,
decreased from about 8% in 1986 to about 2% by the end of 1995 (see panel A of Appendix
Figure C.6).
   Moreover, the competitive market environment created after the implementation of these
policies gave the financial institutions strong incentives to expand their bank branch networks
(see panels B and C of Appendix Figure C.6), which improves the access to credit for Thai
households.
   Third, the Thai government also enacted policies to further open up the capital account in
the late 1980s and early 1990s. As reviewed in Alba, Hernandez and Klingebiel (1999), during
1986 the tax impediments to portfolio inflows were reduced, in particular for purchasing Thai
mutual funds, with the aim of fostering the development of Bangkok as a regional financial
center. This capital account liberalization resulted in a surge in private capital inflows and
rapid credit growth (see panel D of Appendix Figure C.6).


                                              33
Model-based Evaluation As a quantitative exercise, we take these policy shifts as given
and evaluate the distinct roles played by these policies on GDP, TFP, and income inequality
using our model. We solve the model’s transitional dynamics using the algorithm in Appendix
D. The three parameters, ψt , ξt , and χt , governing the degree of financial frictions are allowed
to vary from 1986 to 1995, to capture the financial inclusion policies implemented during this
period.14 In particular, we calibrate the path of intermediation costs χt by directly fitting the
average annualized quarterly interest rate spread in each year. We calibrate the initial credit
entry cost ψt in 1986 so that 10% of households have access to credit at the beginning of the
simulation, as in the data. We assume that the value of ψt decreases by the same amount in
each year until it vanishes in 1996. We do not have reliable data to calibrate the tightness
of the collateral constraint in 1986. Because the public development bank in Thailand had
much fewer branches than commercial banks, loans were mostly made by commercial banks
which were quite stringent in lending (see Assuncao, Mityakov and Townsend, 2012). We
thus set a high initial value of ξt in 1986 and allow it to decrease by the same amount in each
year until 1996. The value of ξt in 1996 is calibrated to match the median loan-to-collateral
ratio in the 1997 Townsend Thai annual survey.
       In addition, we introduce net international capital flows to the model, which increases the
aggregate supply of capital (i.e., the right-hand side of equation 2.9) by an amount equal
to ςt GDPt , where ςt is chosen to match the yearly ratio of net capital inflows to GDP. The
capital inflows during this period effectively lower the borrowing cost, thus playing a role
similar to lowering intermediation cost, for entrepreneurs by increasing the supply of credit.
All other parameters are calibrated according to Appendix C.7 and their values are fixed in
our analysis.
       Over 1986-1995, GDP more than doubled in Thailand whereas the model can generate
about 93.5% cumulative growth (see the blue solid line in panel A of Figure 6), suggesting
that other forces like technology adoption and human capital accumulation were also at
  14
    But their values are fixed after 1996 so that we can attain a steady state at which backward induction is
applied to solve the transitional dynamics.

work. The model also generates a smaller increase in TFP than the data (see the blue solid
line in panel B). The income Gini is much lower in the model due to the lack of worker
heterogeneity, however, the model is able to capture the hump-shaped dynamics of income
inequality (see the blue solid line in panel C).15 Using the model, we run three counterfactual
experiments to evaluate the relative contribution of reducing the credit entry cost, relaxing
the collateral constraint and cutting the cost of credit (i.e., the downward trend in χt and
the surge in capital inflows). In each counterfactual experiment, we allow ψt , ξt , or χt (plus
ςt ) to vary over time while keeping the other two parameters fixed at their values in 1986.
Our simulations imply that if only the collateral constraint is relaxed, GDP increases by
about 42.7% and TFP by 9.2% (the red dash-dotted lines in panels A and B). Reducing the
credit entry cost alone increases GDP by about 24.5% and TFP by about 4.5% (the black
dashed lines in panels A and B), whereas cutting the cost of credit increases GDP by about
19.1% and TFP by 6.1% (the green dotted lines in panels A and B). Moreover, the lower cost
of credit results in a higher Gini coefficient of earnings whereas the lower credit entry cost
and relaxed collateral constraint reduce income inequality. It is the joint effect of the three
policies that generates the hump-shaped income Gini dynamics (see panel C).
  15
    Jeong and Townsend (2008) show that the standard occupation choice model does not generate a high
income Gini due to the lack of worker heterogeneity. Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) introduce heterogeneity in
both working ability and entrepreneurial ability, and they calibrate the variance of the former to match the
Gini coefficient of earnings. Cagetti and De Nardi (2008) provide a comprehensive review on the issue of
wealth inequality. They emphasize that it is even more difficult for models to generate the observed degree of
wealth concentration from observed income inequality.

6     Conclusion

In this paper, we develop a tractable general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents
to study how different financial constraints interact in equilibrium. Our model highlights
three different dimensions of a financial system: breadth, depth, and efficiency. These
dimensions reflect different sources of financial frictions whose tightness can be captured by
three indicators, the credit access ratio, the loan-to-collateral ratio, and the interest rate
spread.
    Our analytical and quantitative analyses indicate that the three financial constraints
should be jointly analyzed due to their rich interactions in equilibrium. The quantitative
as well as qualitative implications of financial inclusion on GDP, TFP, and the distribution
of income not only depend on which constraint is alleviated, but also on the extent to
which other constraints are binding. Analytically, we show that relaxing these constraints
increases GDP through both the extensive margin and the intensive margin. However, the
interaction between different constraints tends to dampen the effect through the extensive
margin and amplify the effect through the intensive margin. Quantitatively, we find that
the interaction effect through the intensive margin dominates, indicating that more effective
financial inclusion policies should be designed in a balanced manner.
    Our model provides insights into financial inclusion policies. The main value of our model
lies in clarifying the tradeoff among different policy instruments and in distinguishing their
impacts on various macro and micro variables in both steady states and transitions. The
financial frictions incorporated in our model are not meant to be exhaustive, but our intention
is to suggest an approach that might be applied to more complete and realistic models.

A      GDP Formula
Consider the steady state of an economy with constraint parameters Ω ≡ (ψ, ξ, χ). The
income I(b, z) for each agent of wealth b and productivity z is equal to the sum of her wage
(or business profit) and interest earnings. The amount of each component depends on her
occupation and credit access. In particular,

I(b, z; Ω) =                                                                            (A.1)

   According to the income approach, the economy’s GDP is equal to the total national
income plus depreciation

B         Proofs
B.1         Proof of Proposition 1
Consider the entrepreneur’s problem, where labor is a freely adjustable input. Taking the
first-order condition with respect to lt , we can derive the optimal labor demand as a function
of capital kt and productivity zt
                                                     "                                    1
                                                                                     # ν+α(1−ν)
                                                                            α(1−ν)
                                                      (1 − α)(1 − ν)zt kt
                                      lt (zt , kt ) =                                             .                          (B.1)

   Because there is no uncertainty within each period, maximizing utility is equivalent to
maximizing the end-of-period wealth b̃t , defined by b̃t = ct + bt+1 . Substituting the optimal
labor demand (B.1) into the entrepreneur’s budget constraint yields

b̃t (bt , zt , kt ) = zt (ktα lt1−α )1−ν + (1 − δ)kt − wt lt + (1 + rt )(bt − kt )

   In the absence of financial frictions, capital kt is optimally chosen to maximize b̃t . By
taking the first-order condition with respect to kt , we derive the optimal (unconstrained)
capital demand ktu :

Growth Accounting by Factor. Rewrite the formula of TFP as

                                                                YΩ = TFPΩ KΩα L1−α
                                                                               Ω .                                                             (B.9)

    Taking the logarithm of both sides of equation (B.9) yields

                           log(YΩ ) = log(TFPΩ ) + α log(KΩ ) + (1 − α) log(LΩ ).                                                             (B.10)



                                                                             OA-4
   Moving from the steady-state economy with Ω to the steady-state economy with Ω0 , we
have a similar expression:

                    log(YΩ0 ) = log(TFPΩ0 ) + α log(KΩ0 ) + (1 − α) log(LΩ0 ).          (B.11)

   Taking the difference of log(YΩ ) and log(YΩ0 ) using equations (B.10) and (B.11) yields

     log(YΩ0 /YΩ ) = log(TFPΩ0 /TFPΩ ) + α log(KΩ0 /KΩ ) + (1 − α) log(LΩ0 /LΩ ).       (B.12)

   Equation (B.12) can be approximated by first difference,

               YΩ0 − YΩ   TFPΩ0 − TFPΩ    KΩ0 − KΩ           LΩ0 − LΩ
                        =              +α          + (1 − α)          .                 (B.13)
                  YΩ         TFPΩ           KΩ                  LΩ

   Let gx = (xΩ0 − xΩ )/xΩ denote the percentage change in the value of variable x when the
economy moves from Ω to Ω0 . Thus equation (B.13) can be written as

                                   gY = gTFP + αgK + (1 − α)gL .                        (B.14)

Growth Accounting by Regime. The economy’s aggregate output YΩ is equal to the sum
of the output of all regimes,

                                   YΩ = EΩ (1 − pcΩ )y sΩ + EΩ pcΩ y cΩ       ,                   (B.34)

where y sΩ and y cΩ are the average output produced by entrepreneurs in the savings and credit
regimes. By definition, we have
              ZZ                        ZZ
       y sΩ          h(b, z; Ω)dbdz =          z[k(b, z; Ω)α l(b, z; Ω)1−α ]1−ν h(b, z; Ω)dbdz,   (B.35)

    With constant returns to scale, optimal capital demand has a bang-bang solution. If the
agent chooses to be an entrepreneur, then k = b in the savings regime and k = (b − ψ)/ξ in the
credit regime. Given z and b, the entrepreneur’s utility is increasing in current consumption
c and the future value V (z 0 , b0 ), which increases with the next-period wealth b0 for every
realization of the next-period productivity z 0 . Therefore, the optimal borrowing decision is
determined to maximize the end-of-period wealth b̃e = c + b0 .
    Substituting equation (B.44) into the budget constraint in problems (2.7) and (2.8), we

C     Supplementary Information on Model Analysis
C.1     Financial Characteristics and Equilibrium Prices
Our calibration uses the credit access ratio, the collateral-to-loan ratio, and the interest rate
spread to determine the three key parameters ψ, ξ, and χ. Figure C.1 illustrates how these
moments are jointly determined by the three parameters. As shown in panels A1, B1, and
C1, reducing the credit entry cost ψ, relaxing the collateral constraint ξ, and reducing the
intermediation cost χ all lead to a higher credit access ratio and more inclusion. However, as
we have discussed in Section 2, these financial frictions are meant to capture different types
of constraints. Particularly, the parameter ψ captures an ex-ante friction in obtaining credit
access, but not the ex-post terms of loan contracts within the credit regime. Thus, a lower ψ
increases the credit access ratio but has a negligible effect on the collateral-to-loan ratio and
the interest rate spread (panels A2 and A3). The other two parameters, ξ and χ, capture
ex-post frictions within the credit regime. Thus, a lower ξ and a lower χ imply a lower
collateral-to-loan ratio (panel B2) and a lower interest rate spread (panel C3), respectively.
Better terms of loan contracts motivate entrepreneurs to access credit by paying the credit
entry cost ψ. Thus, even if ψ remains unchanged, the credit access ratio increases due to
lower ξ and χ.

C.2           The Distribution of Income and Wealth
In panels A1, B1, and C1 of Figure C.2, we plot the steady-state income Gini when ψ, ξ, or
χ is reduced while holding the other two parameters at their calibrated values.
    Panel A1 of Figure C.2 indicates that the steady-state income Gini increases before


                                                                 OA-13
declining when the credit entry cost ψ is reduced from 2 to 0. We obtain this inverted U
curve due to reasons mentioned for Figure 3. For high values of ψ, reducing the credit entry
cost does not generate a significant effect through the extensive margin and GDP increases
mainly through the intensive margin. However, entrepreneurs in the credit regime already
earn more than others. Thus, a policy change that further increases their income leads
to higher income inequality. When ψ is further lowered, the effect through the extensive
margin starts to dominate as more entrepreneurs in the savings regime enter the credit regime.
The improved credit access for these entrepreneurs not only increases their income but also
generates significant upward pressure on the equilibrium wage, thereby reducing income
inequality.
    We can also see the rich dynamics of different income groups in panel A2, which plots
the share of total income for the top 10% and the bottom 50% of the steady-state income
distribution, and for the middle class. The top 10% mainly consist of wealthy and productive
entrepreneurs within the credit regime, whose income share (the blue solid line) displays a
shape similar to the income Gini. The bottom 50% consist of workers, whose income share
(the black dashed line) displays a U shape, opposite to the top 10%. The middle class (the
red dash-dotted line) mainly consists of productive, but less wealthy entrepreneurs plus some
rich workers with high interest income. Clearly, the main driver for the turning point (at
ψ = 1.1) of the steady-state income Gini curve is the rise of the middle class due to improved
credit access. The dramatic expansion of the middle class’s businesses results in a wage
takeoff (panel A4 of Figure C.1), which increases the income share of the bottom 50% and
lowers that of the top 10%.
    Panel B1 shows that the steady-state income Gini also increases before declining when
the collateral constraint ξ is relaxed. Similar to the turning point in the previous experiment,
the turning point in the experiments of ξ also coincides with the value of ξ at which the
equilibrium wage takes off (panel B4 of Figure C.1). As shown in panel B2, the main driver
for the wage takeoff is the middle class who expands production due to relaxed collateral
requirements. By contrast, our simulation indicates that reducing the intermediation cost χ
always leads to higher income inequality (panel C1). Panel C2 shows that there is a slight
increase in the steady-state income share of the top 10% (the blue solid line) and a slight
decrease in that of the bottom 50% (the black dashed line). The middle class’s steady-state
income share is barely changed (the red dash-dotted line) and as a result, the equilibrium
wage stays put (panel C4 of Figure C.1).
    In panels A3, B3, and C3, we plot the share of total wealth for the top 10% and the
bottom 50% of the steady-state wealth distribution, and the middle class. The composition
of each wealth group is similar to that of the corresponding income group. The steady-state

refers to people whose income/wealth is below the 10% threshold and above the 50% threshold. The blue circle in each panel
represents the corresponding value under our calibration in Table 1.

     Figure C.2: Impact of financial inclusion on the distribution of income and wealth.

wealth share of the top 10% always decreases after any one of the three financial constraints
is relaxed. This is because when financial constraints are relaxed, credit effectively becomes
cheaper and more accessible. Thus, in steady states, wealthy and productive entrepreneurs
do not need to accumulate as much wealth to operate their businesses at the unconstrained
scale (Figure 2). Therefore, they reduce savings, leading to a lower wealth share of the top

                                                                     OA-15
10% and a higher wealth share of the rest.
    Our results on wealth inequality seem to be contradict the work of Cagetti and De Nardi
(2006), who show that when financial constraints become more stringent, both the wealth
share of entrepreneurs and wealth inequality decrease. We obtain a different implication
on wealth inequality because of the different sensitivity of the endogenous interest rate to
financial constraints. Specifically, tightening the financial constraints lowers the equilibrium
interest rate in our model whereas it increases the equilibrium interest rate in the model
of Cagetti and De Nardi (2006). A lower interest rate dampens the incentive for workers
to save, resulting in a lower share of wealth for workers and higher wealth inequality. By
contrast, a higher interest rate motivates workers to save, which increases their share of total
wealth, resulting in lower wealth inequality.
    The key reason why our interest rate responds negatively to a tighter financial constraint
is because we do not model the corporate sector. In our model, a tighter financial constraint
exacerbates the misallocation of entrepreneurial productivity (see, e.g., Moll, 2014, for
insightful discussions), which lowers the economy’s TFP. A lower TFP reduces the marginal
product of capital, which in turn lowers the interest rate. This negative effect on the interest
rate through the endogenous TFP channel dominates the positive effect on interest rate caused
by a lower aggregate capital (and higher aggregate labor), leading to a lower equilibrium
interest rate. By contrast, in the model of Cagetti and De Nardi (2006), the economy’s TFP is
a weighted average of the productivity of the corporate sector and the endogenous aggregate
productivity of the entrepreneurial sector. Since the productivity of the corporate sector
is a constant, introducing the corporate sector dampens the response of TFP to tightened
financial constraints. In other words, the negative effect on the interest rate through the
endogenous TFP channel is weaker in their model. Based on their calibration, the negative
effect through the endogenous TFP channel is dominated by the positive effect through lower
aggregate capital (and higher aggregate labor), and thus the interest rate responds positively
to a tighter financial constraint (see Table 7 of Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006).
    We find that our results are consistent with the findings of Quadrini (2000), whose model
also has a corporate sector. In particular, Table XII of Quadrini (2000) reports that when
the economy is moving from one with zero intermediation cost to one with intermediation
cost (i.e., the baseline economy), the wealth share of the top 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%
will increase and the wealth Gini will also increase. This seems to suggest that in a model
with both the corporate sector and the entrepreneurial sector, the response of the equilibrium
interest rate to financial constraints largely depends on the calibration, and in particular, the
relative importance of the two sectors in determining the economy’s TFP.

C.3            Interactions in Partial Equilibrium
In this appendix, we conduct similar counterfactual experiments to the ones in Figure 4 to
study the interaction effect in partial equilibrium. Specifically, in these experiments, the
interest rate, the wage, and the distribution of agents are fixed at their steady-state values of
our calibrated economy.
    Comparing the general-equilibrium simulation results (Figure 4) with those of the partial
equilibrium (Figure C.3), two differences stand out. First, the increase in steady-state GDP
owing to relaxing financial constraints is smaller in general equilibrium (the blue solid line)
because of the increase in the equilibrium interest rate and wage. Second, the savings regime
negatively contributes to the increase in steady-state GDP in all counterfactual experiments
of general equilibrium whereas the contribution of the savings regime to the increase in
steady-state GDP is always zero in partial equilibrium. However, our main finding in general
equilibrium, that the interaction effect through the intensive margin dominates that through
the extensive margin, remains robust.

C.4     Decomposition of the Increase in GDP and TFP
We use formulas (4.1) and (4.2) to understand the margins through which steady-state GDP
and TFP increase after relaxing various forms of financial constraints. Tables C.2 and C.3
present the decomposition of the increase in steady-state GDP and TFP for all six countries.
For each country, we conduct three experiments: (1) the general equilibrium where the
deposit rate and wage are endogenously determined in the new steady state; (2) the partial
equilibrium where the deposit rate and wage are fixed at their values in the initial steady
state before various forms of financial constraints are relaxed; and (3) the small-open-economy
experiment where the interest rate is fixed at its value in the initial steady state but wage is
endogenously determined in the new steady state. The third experiment is useful because
several of these countries have fairly open capital accounts, and are not well represented by a
closed-economy model. Moreover, the third experiment allows us to understand the relative
importance of the interest rate and wage movement in driving the difference between the
results of general equilibrium and those of partial equilibrium.
    The following conclusions can be drawn from our analyses: (1) The increase in steady-state
GDP and TFP caused by reducing the collateral constraint ξ to zero is mainly attributed to
the intensive margin; (2) depending on country characteristics, the increase in steady-state
GDP and TFP caused by reducing the credit entry cost ψ to zero could be mainly attributed
to the extensive margin (Pakistan, the Philippines, Kenya, and Zambia) or the intensive
margin (Bangladesh); (3) reducing the intermediation cost to zero usually has a smaller effect
on steady-state GDP and TFP except for Brazil. In Brazil, the large increase in steady-state
GDP and TFP from reducing the intermediation cost is mostly attributed to the intensive
margin; (4) the savings regime always negatively contributes to the increase in steady-state
GDP and TFP, because relaxing any financial constraint would motivate more productive
entrepreneurs to move from the savings regime to the credit regime; (5) the most binding
constraints identified in partial equilibrium are the same as those in general equilibrium,
although the increase in steady-state GDP and TFP is larger; (6) the small-open-economy
experiment suggests that in most cases, both the endogenous movement in the interest rate
and wage should be considered when analyzing the steady-state increase GDP and TFP in
general equilibrium.


C.5     Transitional Dynamics of Financial Inclusion
In this appendix, we study the transitional dynamics after implementing financial inclusion
policies. Starting from the calibrated steady state of each country, we consider an unexpected
shock that occurs in year 5, which permanently reduces one of the financial constraint

parameters (i.e., ψ, ξ, or χ) to zero. Figures C.4 and C.5 plot the transitional dynamics of
GDP, TFP, the income Gini coefficient, interest rate, and wage.
    Across the six countries, GDP, TFP, and the income Gini coefficient converge to their
new steady-state values in about 10 – 20 years. Transition is gradual because reallocation of
capital is intermediated through imperfect financial markets (see, e.g., Jermann and Quadrini,
2007; Buera and Shin, 2011). For the simulated path of transitional dynamics in each country,
we observe overshooting in the equilibrium interest rate; that is, the interest rate in the short
run is higher than that in the long run after financial inclusion (panels A4, B4, and C4 of
Figures C.4 and C.5) There is no overshooting of the equilibrium wage. In all six countries,
and across the three different financial inclusion policies, the equilibrium wage surges in year
5, reflecting the immediate increase in demand for workers when constraints are relaxed.
Moreover, the equilibrium wage steadily increases thereafter to reach its new steady-state
value due to the gradual accumulation and reallocation of capital (panels A5, B5, and C5 of
Figures C.4 and C.5).
    GDP increases substantially in year 5 and more gradually thereafter (panels A1, B1, and

  Note: When performing the decomposition of the savings regime in partial equilibrium, we focus on agents that are in the
 savings regime both before and after financial inclusion for consistency with our GDP decomposition in partial equilibrium.



C1 of Figures C.4 and C.5). The positive effect of financial inclusion on GDP is larger in the
long run than in the short run. Intuitively, this is because it takes time for entrepreneurs to
accumulate wealth to fully reap the gains from financial inclusion policies. This intuition
is closely related to the finding of Moll (2014), who shows that the negative welfare effect
of financial frictions is larger in the short run than in the long run as entrepreneurs can
accumulate capital to alleviate constraints.
    In terms of TFP, we find that reducing the credit entry cost ψ to zero generates overshooting
in the short-run dynamics (panel A2 of Figures C.4 and C.5) in all six countries, although
the overshooting may happen with a lag in some countries (see the red dash-dotted line
for Zambia in panel A2 of Figure C.5). By contrast, relaxing the collateral constraint ξ
to zero does not generate an overshooting effect (panel B2 of Figures C.4 and C.5). In all
six countries, TFP surges in year 5 before plateauing to reach its new steady-state value.
Reducing the intermediation cost generates an overshooting effect in all six countries except
for Brazil (panel C2 of Figures C.4 and C.5), although the magnitude of overshooting is small

Note: In all experiments, we start with the steady state of the calibrated economy in year 1, and consider an unexpected shock
in year 5, which reduces one of the financial constraint parameters (i.e., ψ, ξ, or χ) to zero permanently. Panels A1-A5, B1-B5,
and C1-C5 plot the model-implied transitional dynamics of GDP, TFP, the income Gini coefficient, interest rate, and wage for
reducing ψ, ξ, and χ to zero, respectively.

due to the relatively small long-run effect on TFP in these countries. Brazil’s TFP displays
different dynamics because its high intermediation cost is the most binding constraint, which
is not the case in other countries.
    In terms of income inequality, we find that reducing the credit entry cost ψ may lead to a
higher or a lower long-run Gini coefficient, depending on the country (panel A3 of Figures C.4
and C.5). Relaxing the collateral constraint ξ results in a lower Gini coefficient in the long
run, and overshooting occurs in the short run (panel B3 of Figures C.4 and C.5). Reducing
the intermediation cost χ leads to a higher Gini coefficient in the long run (panel C3 of
Figures C.4 and C.5). In Brazil, reducing the intermediation cost leads to higher GDP and
income inequality. However, the effect on GDP is smaller in the short run than in the long
run whereas the opposite is true for income inequality (see the red dash-dotted line in panel
C3 of Figure C.4).
    Overall, our simulation indicates that the short-run implications of reducing different

financial constraints on GDP, TFP, income inequality, and the equilibrium interest rate and
wage could be very different than their long-run effects. Such intertemporal tradeoffs may raise
concerns for policy makers depending on their objectives. For the same financial inclusion
policy, the transitional dynamics in different countries share many common features. However,
the dynamics also exhibit some degree of heterogeneity, depending on the characteristics of a
country’s financial system.

Welfare Gains during Economic Transitions. To understand the welfare implications of
financial liberalization, we use the model to compute the welfare gains along the transition
paths.
    Suppose financial inclusion policies are implemented unexpectedly in year t = t0 in a
steady-state economy of financial characteristics Ω (as in above experiments). These policies
change the financial characteristics permanently to Ω0 for all t ≥ t0 (similar to our experiments
in Figures C.4 and C.5). By varying t0 from −∞ to 0, we can capture an economy that is
−t0 years after the implementation of financial inclusion policies from the perspective of year

                                                                                                 OA-22
t = 0. For example, in year t = 0, the economy has already reached the steady state of Ω0
if t0 = −∞; the economy is 10 years after financial liberalization and is still in transition if
t0 = −10; and the economy has just started financial liberalization if t0 = 0. Therefore, by
considering different values of t0 ≤ 0, we can calculate welfare gains from financial inclusion
policies at any point in time along the transition path.
     Our welfare calculation is based on the consumption-equivalent measure. Denote by
{ct }∞t=0 the consumption path of a generic agent for t ≥ 0 in an economy where financial
inclusion policies were implemented at t0 ≤ 0. Denote by {ct }∞ t=0 the consumption path of a
generic agent in an otherwise identical economy in which financial inclusion policies were not
implemented, namely, this economy stays at the original steady state with Ω. The conditional
welfare gain ω(b, z) for type-(b, z) is defined as

   Because u(ct ) = c1−σ
                     t   /(1 − σ), we can exploit the homogeneity of the utility function and
the equation above becomes

where V (b, z; Ω) represents the value function in the steady state of the pre-financial-inclusion
economy with Ω; and V0 (b, z; Ω0 , t0 ) represents the value function at t = 0 in the economy
with Ω0 whose financial inclusion policies are implemented at t0 ≤ 0. The conditional welfare
gain is

    In Table C.4, we report ω(Ω0 , t0 ) for t0 = 0, t0 = −10, and t0 = −∞, corresponding to the
welfare gains immediately after financial inclusion, 10 years after financial inclusion, and in
the new steady state after financial liberalization. It is shown that the welfare gains from
financial inclusion policies are about 20 - 40% larger in the long-run steady state than in
the short run, immediately after implementing these policies. Moreover, most of the welfare
gains are realized in the first 10 years. This is because the productive but poor agents would

enjoy benefits of the financial inclusion policies only in the distant future, after accumulating
enough capital to make it worthwhile for themselves to utilize financial services. By contrast,
a steady-state on–off comparison implicitly assumes that the allocation of capital across
agents has been sufficiently made more efficient so that productive agents can better use
financial services immediately after a policy change. As emphasized by Townsend and Ueda
(2010), transitional dynamics create more complex effects than in a simple on–off experiment.


C.6       Comparison with Models with a Single Constraint
A unique feature of our model is that it incorporates three different sources of financial
frictions. Each source of friction reflects one particular aspect of financial market imperfection.
By modeling all of them in the same framework, we can not only better match the data on
financial system characteristics, but also study how these constraints interact in equilibrium
and thus offer richer policy implications. In this appendix section, we take our lead calibration,
the Philippines, as an example to illustrate how the quantitative performance of our model
differs from existing models with only one constraint.
    In the macro-development literature, for example, the seminar work of Greenwood and
Jovanovic (1990) introduces the idea of a fixed entry cost, and Townsend and Ueda (2006)
take a quantitative version of their model seriously to the data. Buera, Kaboski and Shin
(2011) and Buera and Shin (2013) focus on the collateral constraint. Greenwood, Sanchez
and Wang (2010, 2013) quantify the importance of the intermediation cost. By modifying
our model with one single constraint, we can capture the main feature of existing models. In
particular, we consider the following three special cases of our model. In the first case, we fix
ξ = χ = 0 and calibrate ψ to match the country’s ratio of private credit to GDP, following
the standard in the literature. In the second case, we fix ψ = χ = 0 and calibrate ξ to match
the country’s ratio of private credit to GDP. In the third case, we fix ξ = χ = 0 and calibrate
ψ to match the country’s ratio of private credit to GDP. The other parameters are calibrated
similarly as described in Section 3. We then compare these models’ implications with those of

our baseline model. When calibrating the baseline model, we follow the calibration in Section
3 by targeting the percentage of firms with credit, the collateral-to-loan ratio, and the interest
rate spread; and we treat the country’s ratio of private credit to GDP as a non-targeted
moment.
    Table C.5 reports the implied financial characteristics of these four different models. It is
shown that our baseline model with all three frictions implies a private credit-to-GDP ratio
that is lower than the data. The other three models are calibrated to match the credit-to-GDP
ratio. However, they do not match the country’s other characteristics.
    Specifically, the first model with only credit entry cost ψ implies that only 18.8% of
the firms have access to credit compared to 29.9% in the data. Moreover, targeting the
credit-to-GDP ratio requires a calibration of ψ = 4.9, which is about 24.6% of the average
wealth of entrepreneurs in the credit regime. If the model were calibrated to target the 18.8%
credit access, it would imply a credit-to-GDP ratio equal to 112%, which is much larger than
the value in data. The collateral-to-loan ratio and interest rate spread are not matched well
due to the lack of collateral constraint and intermediation costs. The second model with
only collateral constraints implies that every entrepreneur has access to credit due to the
absence of credit entry cost. The third model with only intermediation costs also implies that
a large fraction of entrepreneurs would obtain credit access once it is calibrated to match the
credit-to-GDP ratio. Moreover, the interest rate spread implied by the model is 34%, which
is also much higher than the value in the data.16
    We further evaluate the quantitative implications of these models on GDP, TFP, and
inequality, by moving from the calibrated value of financial frictions to an economy with a
perfect financial market. That is, in our baseline model, because we have three constraints
governed by three parameters, we set all three parameters ψ = ξ = χ = 0 to obtain a perfect
financial market. In the first model, the only financial constraint is the positive credit entry
cost ψ, and so we set ψ = 0 to obtain a perfect financial market; in the second model, the
only financial constraint is the collateral constraint governed by parameter ξ, and so we set
ξ = 0; and in the third model, the only financial constraint is the positive intermediation
  16
     In the literature, the models emphasizing intermediation costs choose to target the interest rate spread,
instead of the credit-to-GDP ratio.

cost χ, and so we set χ = 0.
    Table C.6 shows that our baseline model implies the highest increase in GDP and TFP
and the largest decrease in the Gini coefficient of income once the economy’s financial frictions
are removed. For example, the baseline model implies an increase in GDP by 135.2% whereas
the first model, which only focuses on the credit entry cost, implies an increase in GDP by
109.0%.
    Further, the baseline model allows us to separately evaluate how relaxing different
constraints contributes differently to GDP, TFP, and income inequality. For example, in
panel B of Table 2, we can see that for the Philippines, reducing the credit entry cost increases
GDP by 9.25%, whereas relaxing the collateral constraint increases GDP by 59.73% and
reducing the intermediation cost increases GDP by 0.70%. Therefore, if our goal is only
to evaluate the effect from alleviating one particular constraint, e.g., the credit entry cost,
our baseline model would imply a smaller effect (i.e., 9.25%) than that implied by the first
model (i.e., 109.0%), which only focuses on the credit entry cost. This result is perhaps
not surprising. Given that these models only focus on one specific financial constraint, they
tend to attribute the overall effect of financial inclusion to the relaxation of one particular
constraint.
    Moreover, comparing the baseline model’s implication in Table C.6 to its implication
in panel B of Table 2 where we remove each financial constraint separately, we find that
removing all constraints simultaneously increases GDP by 135.2%, which is much larger
than the sum of the increases in GDP from removing the constraints individually, i.e.,
9.25%+59.73%+0.70%=69.68%. This is consistent with our analysis in Section 4.3, which
suggests that the interaction effect of different constraints through the intensive margin
dominates that through the extensive margin, leading to an overall positive interaction effect
on GDP. In other words, our baseline model implies that removing one particular financial
constraint would have a much smaller impact on GDP than removing all three financial
constraints together. By modeling all three constraints in a unified framework, our model can
help policy makers to better evaluate and understand different sources of financial frictions,
and hence to design more relevant financial inclusion policies.

Note: Panel A plots the trend of interest rate spread (prime lending rate minus deposit rate) between 1986-1995. Data are from
various issues of Financial Institutions and Markets in Thailand, published by the Bank of Thailand. Financial policies led to
the expansion of business operations of banks. As of 1987, Thailand’s formal financial system consisted of commercial banks,
finance companies, credit financier companies, government savings banks, private and government insurance companies, and
a number of sectorally and functionally specialized financial institutions. The central players in the Thai financial system are
commercial banks which absorb 80.9% of deposits and account for 73.1% of total financial system assets. The second largest
players are specialized government banks, known as Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), capturing
9.5% of total financial system deposits and 14.2% of total financial system assets. The competitive market environment created
after financial liberalization gave the financial institutions strong incentives to expand their business operations. Panel B
presents the number of branches operated by commercial banks and BAAC in different locations over the period 1981-1996.
The number of commercial bank branches had been steadily increasing since the late 80s, and more than doubled by the end
of 1996. Importantly, a substantial number of branches were opened in different locations to explore underdeveloped areas,
thereby leading to a significant decrease in the car-travel time to the nearest bank branch (panel C). Panel D plots capital
flows between 1980 and 1995. Data are from Alba, Hernandez and Klingebiel (1999, Figure 2) and the Bank of Thailand. The
Bank of Thailand includes nonbank and bank capital flows. The former includes foreign direct investment, portfolio capital,
nonresident baht accounts, trade credits, and syndicated borrowing by domestic corporates from overseas financial institutions.
The bank flows are resident banks borrowing from overseas sources.

    In this appendix, we provide details on calibrating the model to evaluate the Thai economy
in Section 5.2. Since our focus is on evaluating the financial liberalization policies from 1986
to 1995, we allow the key parameters ψt , ξt , and χt governing credit access in Thailand to be
potentially time-varying. Their values are fixed after 1996 so that we can attain a steady

state at which backward induction is applied to solve the transitional dynamics. In particular,
the parameter χt is calibrated to match the average annualized quarterly interest rate spread
in each year (see panel A of Figure C.6) from 1986 to 1995. We introduce net international
capital flows to the model, which increases the aggregate supply of capital by an amount
equal to ςt GDPt . We calibrate ςt year by year according to panel D of Figure C.6. The capital
market clearing condition in equation (2.9) is modified as follows:

where ytS (b, z) and ytC (b, z) are defined according to Appendix A:

                    ytS (b, z) = z(kt (b, z)α lt (b, z)1−α )1−ν ,                                                 (C.6)
                   ytC (b, z) = z(kt (b, z)α lt (b, z)1−α )1−ν − χt (kt (b, z) − b + ψt ) − ψt .                  (C.7)

    We calibrate the initial credit entry cost ψt to be 0.72 in 1986 so that 10% of households
have access to credit at the beginning of the simulation, as in the data. We assume that
the value of ψt decreases by the same amount in each year until it vanishes in 1996. We do
not have reliable data to calibrate the tightness of the collateral constraint in 1986. Because
the public development bank in Thailand had much fewer branches than commercial banks,
the loans were mostly made by commercial banks which were quite stringent in lending (see
Assuncao, Mityakov and Townsend, 2012). We thus set the initial ξt in 1986 to a high value,
0.9. We allow it to decrease by the same amount in each year until it reaches 0.19 in 1996,
which allows the model to match the median loan-to-collateral ratio in the 1997 Townsend
Thai annual survey. The values of these policy reform parameters are tabulated in Table C.7.
    The other parameters are calibrated as follows. We set the risk aversion parameter to
σ = 1.5. We set α = 0.33 and ν = 0.16 according to the estimate of Paweenawat and Townsend

                                                        OA-28
(2014) using the Townsend Thai data. In the Townsend Thai data, households’ production
activities are classified into four types depending on the sector: business, cultivation, fish and
shrimp, or livestock. Cultivation activity is the most labor-intensive, while fish and shrimp
activity is the least labor-intensive. Our calibration relies on the average estimates of the
four activities weighted by the number of observations. The one-year depreciation rate δ is
set to 0.08 according to the estimate of Samphantharak and Townsend (2009). We calibrate
the annual discount factor β = 0.85 to match the real interest of 11.5% in Thailand in 1986.
We calculate the parameter θ = 3.7 to match the fraction of labor force (72.2%) employed by
the top 20% of firms (sorted by total employment) in the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys
of Thailand.
    The 1997 Townsend Thai annual survey has 10,602 respondents reporting the number
of years that household members have been involved in the current business. This provides
information to identify the persistence parameter γ governing the probability of a change in
productivity. We calibrate the value of γ to 0.72, which allows us to capture the cumulative
distribution of the number of years that households have maintained in their current businesses
(see Figure C.7).

D      Numerical Algorithm
We allow wealth b to vary from 0 to 5, and verify that further increasing wealth does not
affect the simulation results. To ensure accuracy, we use 1,000 grids with equal length to
discretize the support of wealth when approximating the value functions. We use 100,000
grids to discretize the support of wealth when running simulations. The values between
wealth grids are approximated by linear interpolation. We allow productivity z to vary from
1 to the value corresponding to 99.95% of the cumulative distribution function. We use 50

search method to find the optimal decision rules. The advantage of the golden-section search
method is that it is robust to the choice of initial values because convergence is guaranteed.
The numerical algorithm is implemented with parallel computing using C++ and OpenMP.

Computing the Steady State.

(0) Start from some arbitrary distribution h0 (b, z).

(1) Guess the wage in the steady state, w.

(2) Guess the interest rate in the steady state, r.

(3) Given the interest rate r and wage w, solve the agent’s problem (2.4-2.8) and obtain
     optimal policies c(b, z; w, r), k(b, z; w, r), and l(b, z; w, r) as well as the set of agents
     who choose to be entrepreneurs ΦE (w, r) and the set of entrepreneurs who choose to
     enter the credit regime ΦC (w, r).

(4) Forward simulate the model by T periods using the optimal policy functions. We
     set T = 100, which is long enough to ensure that the economy reaches the steady
     state. Calculate the steady-state joint distribution of wealth and productivity hT (b, z)
     according to equation (2.11).

(5) Check the capital market clearing condition (2.9) in period T . If there is excess capital
     demand (supply), choose a new interest rate r that is greater (smaller) than r and
     return to step (3). We use bi-section search to form the new guess.

(6) Check the labor market clearing condition (2.10) in period T . If there is excess labor
     demand (supply), choose a new wage w that is greater (smaller) than w and return to
     step (2).

Computing the Transitional Dynamics.

(0) Solve the steady-state distribution before implementing the financial inclusion policy
     hpre (b, z), and the steady-state distribution after implementing the financial inclusion
     policy hpost (b, z).

(1) Start from the steady-state distribution before implementing the financial inclusion
     policy, i.e., h0 (b, z) = hpre (b, z).

(2) Guess the wage path {wt }Tt=0 , where T is set long enough to ensure that the economy
     can reach the steady state after implementing the financial inclusion policy.

(3) Guess the interest rate path {rt }Tt=0 .

(4) Taking the wage path {wt }Tt=0 and interest rate path {rt }Tt=0 as given, solve the agent’s
     problem (2.4-2.8) for t = T, ..., 0 using backward induction, starting from t = T . We
     obtain optimal policies {ct (b, z; w, r), kt (b, z; w, r), lt (b, z; w, r)}Tt=0 as well as the set of
     agents who choose to be entrepreneurs {ΦE                 T
                                                     t (w, r)}t=0 and the set of entrepreneurs who
     choose to enter the credit regime {ΦC               T
                                             t (w, r)}t=0 .


(5) Forward simulate the model by T periods using the optimal policy functions, starting
     from t = 0. Calculate the joint distribution of wealth and productivity {ht (b, z)}Tt=0
     according to equation (2.11).

(6) For each t = 0, 1, ..., T , holding ht (b, z) and wt constant, find the implied interest rate r̃t
     that clears the capital market (2.9).

(7) Calculate diffr = max{|rt − r˜t |, for t = 0, 1, ..., T }. If diffr > 10−5 , replace rt with
     (rt + r̃t )/2 for t = 0, 1, ..., T and return to step (4).

(8) For each t = 0, 1, ..., T , holding ht (b, z) and rt constant, find the implied wage w̃t that
     clears the labor market (2.10).

(9) Calculate diffw = max{|wt − w̃t |, for t = 0, 1, ..., T }. If diffw > 10−5 , replace wt with
     (wt + w̃t )/2 for t = 0, 1, ..., T and return to step (3).
