                                              ABSTRACT

While there is general agreement that technology differences must figure prominently in any successful
account of the cross-country income variation, not much is known on the source of these technology
differences. This paper examines cross-country income differences in terms of factor accumulation,
domestic R&D, and foreign technological spillovers. The empirical analysis encompasses seventeen
industrialized countries in four continents over three decades, at a level disaggregated enough to identify
innovations in a number of key high-tech sectors. International technology transfer is found to play
a crucial part in accounting for income differences. We also relate technology transfer to imports, showing
that imports are often a major channel. At the same time, our analysis highlights that international
technology transfer varies importantly across industries and countries.

I. Introduction

       There is broad consensus among economists that productivity differences must figure

prominently in any successful account of the cross-country income variationdifferences in

labor and capital are just not big enough (Hall and Jones 1999). At the same time, we do not

have a good understanding yet of where productivity differences come from and how they evolve

over time. In this paper, total factor productivity differences across countries are explained in

terms of domestic technical change and international technology transfer. Research and

development (R&D) spending is the major input in technical change, generating knowledge

which has both private and social returns. Past innovative efforts benefit today’s inventors, and

today’s inventions generate externalities, or spillovers, for producers in the future.

       Since today’s level of economic integration is unprecedented in the economic history of

the world, our model of income differences must also incorporate the enormous interdependence

of countries for technology transfer across countries. In this framework, international technology

transfer occurs whenever technology investments by entrepreneurs in one country generate

technology spillovers to producers in other countries. International market transactions are a

likely conduit for such technology spillovers. In this paper we will specifically assess the

contribution of imports in this process.

       Many theories of income differences are based on hard-to-observe factors. This makes

rigorous testing of those theories difficult if not impossible. In comparison, our account of cross-

country income differences through technical change and international technology transfer is

empirically straightforward. Our results are based on a comprehensive new data set on R&D,

factor inputs, imports, and productivity for a broad sample of twenty-two manufacturing

industries in seventeen industrialized countries and the years 1973 to 2002.




                                                  2
          The analysis shows, first of all, that R&D has an important effect on productivity. A 10%

increase in domestic R&D translates on average into about 1.5% higher productivity in our

sample. At the same time, the contribution of international technology transfer often exceeds the

effect of domestic R&D on productivity. On average, the combined impact of R&D investments

in six countries close to the world’s technology frontier, the US, Japan, Germany, France, the

UK, and Canada, is about three times as large as that of domestic R&D.

          Moreover, we show that the global patterns of technology transfer are highly asymmetric.

For example, the impact of US R&D on UK productivity is twice as large as the US effect in

Germany or Spain. We also find that some countries benefit more from foreign technology than

other countries across the board. Canada, for example, benefits about 50% more from Japanese

R&D and 33% more from French R&D than the average country. This suggests that Canada has

a relatively high absorptive capacity for benefiting from international technology spillovers.

          In addition, Canada benefits very strongly from US R&D, which is surely in part because

of its geographic proximity (Keller 2002). However, geography cannot be the whole story, since

productivity in Ireland is far more strongly affected by US R&D than productivity in similarly

located England. A more complete picture emerges when we link technology transfer to

international trade between countries. It is shown that the majority of all technology transfer

from the US and the UK occurs through imports, whereas Germany and Japan transfer

technology abroad primarily through non-trade channels. We also find that across the board,

technology transfer has become much more important during the 1990s relative to the period

before.

          This paper makes a number of contributions. First of all, it is the most comprehensive

study of its kind. It encompasses more countries and a longer sample period, and perhaps most




                                                  3
importantly, it allows isolating major high-technology sectors that were the drivers of economy-

wide productivity trends during the late 1980s and 1990s. On the econometric side, we employ

instrumental-variable and control-function approaches, which enable us to estimate causal effects

as opposed to correlations. Our analysis is rich enough to reveal a substantial amount of

technology-sender and –recipient heterogeneity, thereby setting the stage for future studies

towards a better understanding of the global web of technology transfer.

           We also present new results on the role of imports in international technology transfer,

where the early evidence has been mixed. 4 In contrast to much of the literature that seeks to

address this issue (including Xu and Wang 1999, Caselli and Coleman 2001, and Eaton and

Kortum 2001), we specify an explicit alternative to trade-related technology transfer. This not

only provides a more powerful test of the hypothesis, but also allows us to assess the relative

magnitude of imports-related technology transfer relative to all international technology transfer.

           The remainder of the paper is as follows. In section II we describe the new dataset that is

underlying our empirical analysis, before turning to estimation issues in section III. The

empirical results are found in section IV, and section V provides a concluding discussion.



II. Data

           The sample period for this analysis covers the years 1973 to 2002. With three decades of

data, the period is long enough to include both the productivity slowdown in the 1970s as well as

the surge of innovations in the 1990s. We study technical change at the industry-level. This is

important because technical trends tend to break in an uneven way across sectors; in the 1990s, it

was primarily information and technology sectors. Thus, rather than analyzing manufacturing or

the entire economy, where such changes tend to be muted, we examine disaggregated data for
4

                                                          4
twenty-two manufacturing industries. This allows special emphasis on particularly technology-

intensive sectors, which is important since recent evidence suggests that international technology

transfer varies substantially across industries (Keller and Yeaple 2007). Moreover, our analysis

is global in the sense that the 17 advanced countries in our sample are located in four different

continents and account for most of the world’s R&D expenditures.5

        Internationally comparable figures on employment, output, and sectoral prices come from

Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC) database (van Ark et al. 2005) for the

years 1979-2002. We have combined this with data on employment, output and sectoral prices

for 1973-78, from the OECD’s STAN database (OECD 2005a). This is also the basis for the

GGDC figures. Also from the OECD’s STAN database comes data on investment. Data on

sample countries’ business R&D (ANBERD database, OECD 2005b), as well as on the bilateral

trade among them (BTD database, OECD 2005c) are also from OECD.

        The measure of output in this analysis is value added, since internationally comparable

data on intermediate inputs is not available.6 Labor inputs are measured by the number of

workers. We have constructed capital stocks and R&D stocks for each industry in each country

and year from the investment data using the perpetual inventory method as given in Appendix C.

For each country, there are 660 possible observations (with 22 industries and 30 years); however,

actual data availability varies. As Table 1 indicates, the dataset is complete for many series. The

major exceptions are (i) Belgium, for which R&D data become available only in 1987; (ii)

Ireland, for which investment data started only in 1992, and (iii) South Korea, where R&D data

are only recorded from 1995 onwards. In addition, there are some missing values during the

1970s. By industry, there is a maximum of 510 observations for each industry. As the lower part

  The countries in sample are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and USA.

  Details on data sources, construction and estimation are provided in the Appendices A through C.


                                                      5
of Table 1 shows, data availability by industry varies little. This means that such data availability

differences will not have an important influence on the results.

        Table 2 provides information on R&D intensities (average of the sample period), defined

as R&D expenditures over value added, in both the country and the industry dimension. Across

countries, the R&D intensity varies by a factor of three to four, with values from 3.1% for the

low R&D-intensity countries Ireland and Spain to values of 10.0% and 10.6% for the high R&D-

intensity countries US and Netherlands, respectively. 7 The R&D intensity varies a great deal

more across industries, from 0.6% on average in the wood products industry to 26.1% in the

radio, television, and communications equipment industry. Also high are the R&D intensities of

the aircraft (23.8%), computer (21.3%), and pharmaceuticals (18.0%) industries. Moreover, as

the table indicates, there is a substantial amount of variation in R&D intensities for a given

country or industry. For instance, Ireland’s computer industry (industry #14) has an R&D

intensity of only one tenth of the average across countries, while in another high-R&D intensity

industry, communications equipment (industry #16), Ireland’s R&D intensity is quite close to the

average across countries. There is also substantial variation in R&D intensities across industries

in a country. For example, Canada’s R&D intensity ranges from as low as 0.5% in food products

to as high as 37% in radio, television and communication industry.

        Tables 3 to 5 provide summary statistics on employment, capital stocks, and R&D stocks

by industry and by country. In particular, Table 5 indicates that the size of the US industry’s

R&D is by far the largest of all 17 countries: the median US industry’s size in terms of R&D is

39.6% of the sample. Next in size is Japan (median of 27.4%), followed by Germany (7.5%),



7
 South Korea’s average R&D intensity is, with 6.1%, considerably higher than Ireland’s or Spain’s, but this is in
part due to the fact that for South Korea the average is computed with data from 1995 onwards, a time by which
South Korea’s R&D spending had substantially grown.


                                                         6
France (6.5%), and the UK (4.9%). Also the remaining G-7 countries, Canada and Italy, are

among the more important producers of technology (R&D shares 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively).

           It is well-known that international trade varies substantially across countries and

industries. Table 6 gives a glimpse of that by showing the share of the US in total imports by

partner country and industry. In Canada almost three quarters of all imports come from the US.

In contrast, most European countries import only around 10-15% of their goods from the US

(except the UK where the US share is 21.6%). By industry, the US share of total imports has

been highest for aircraft, followed by computers. For imports, we study their importance for

technology transfer from Canada, France, Germany, the UK, Japan, and the US (referred to as

the G6 countries)

           We now turn to the major estimation issues.



III. Estimation

           Technology in this paper is the residual contribution to output that is not due to measured

inputs (Solow 1957). Consider the Cobb-Douglas production function for industry i at time t in

country c:

                             β
(1)        Y cit = Acit K citk L cit β l   ,

where i = 1,…, 22; c = 1,…, 17; and t = 1973,…, 2002. Here, Y is output, K is capital, L is labor,

and ßk and ßl are the elasticities of capital and labor, respectively. 8 The term A in equation (1) is

an index of technology, or productivity. It follows that

(1')          ln Acit = ln Ycit − β k ln K cit − β l ln Lcit




8
    These may vary by industry or country, which we will discuss below.


                                                               7
        If one fixes the values of ßk and ßl —a choice roughly in line with national income

statistics is ßk =1/3 and ßl =2/3 —, the technology term A can be computed from (1') with data on

inputs and outputs. In this paper, regression analysis is used to estimate ßk and ßl while at the

same time the implied technology term is related to R&D spending. From equation (1),

(1")    y cit = β k k cit + β l lcit + u cit ,


where for any variable Z, z = lnZ, and ucit is equal to ln Acit = a cit . Following Griliches (1979) and

others, a is determined by domestic R&D expenditures, R, and other factors, X

(2)     a cit = β 0 + γ rcit + Xβ + ε cit ,

where ε is a stochastic error term. One major element of X is foreign R&D, which may have an

effect on domestic technology through international technology transfer. In addition, we will

examine imports as a mechanism of international technology transfer. Substituting (2) in (1")

yields our main estimation equation

(3)     y cit = β 0 + β k k cit + β l l cit + γ rcit + Xβ + ε cit .

        Equation (3) is an augmented production function. A number of generic issues exist in

the estimation of the capital and labor coefficients, and in the multivariate regression context any

bias in ßk and ßl generally leads to biases in the other regression coefficients as well. A major

econometric issue confronting production function estimation is the possibility that some of these

inputs are unobserved. In that case, if the observed inputs are chosen as a function of the

unobserved inputs, there is an endogeneity problem, and OLS estimates of the coefficients of the

observed inputs will be biased. Specifically, even in the case where capital and labor are the only

inputs, if the error term is composed of two parts

(4)     ε cit = ωcit + u cit ,




                                                               8
where u cit is noise (or measurement error in ycit ), while ωcit (which could be a determinant of

productivity or demand) is observed by agents who choose the inputs. This implies that OLS will

generally not yield unbiased parameter estimates because E[lcit ε cit ] ≠ 0 or E[k cit ε cit ] ≠ 0 , or

both. The unobservable factor ωcit does not have to be varying over time or across groups in

order to have this effect. 9 Along these lines, ωcit = ωci may capture time-invariant productivity

differences across industries, or ωcit = ωt may be shocks that affect all industries in the sample.

           We will employ several estimators in order to address this issue. First, we assume that the

unobserved term ωcit is given by country-, industry-, and time-effects that are fixed and can be

estimated as parameters:

(4')       ε cit = η c + µ i + τ t + u cit ,

If (4') holds, OLS will yield consistent and unbiased estimates; in fact, OLS will then be the best

linear unbiased estimator. Second, we will employ the General Method of Moments (GMM)

techniques developed by Arellano, Blundell, Bond, and others (Arellano and Bond 1991,

Blundell and Bond 2000). Assume that

(4")       ε cit = ς ci + τ t + ucit ,

where year fixed effects ( τ t ) control for common macro effects; ς ci is the unobservable industry

component, and ucit is a productivity shock following an AR(1) process, u cit = ρu cit −1 + ψ cit . The

industry component ς ci may be correlated with the factor inputs (lit, kit, and rit) and elements of

X, and ς ci may also be correlated with the residual productivity shock ucit. Assumptions over the

initial conditions and over the serial correlation of ucit yield moment conditions for combining

equations in levels (of variables) with equations in differences (of variables) for a System GMM

9
    A group here is a country-by-industry combination, denoted by the subscript ci.


                                                           9
approach. In both equations, one essentially uses lagged values to construct instrumental

variables for current variables.

         Third, we adopt the approach developed by Olley and Pakes (1996). This involves

assumptions on the structure of the model (on timing, invertability, dimensionality, etc.) such

that ωcit can be expressed as a function of investment icit and capital kcit.

(4''')   ε cit = ωcit + ucit = g (iit , kit ) + ucit ,

where the function g(.) is unknown. 10 The idea is that conditional on capital, we can learn about

ωcit by observing icit , that is, icit = f (ωcit , kcit ) = g −1 (ωcit , kcit ) . In essence, investment serves as a

proxy for the unobserved ωcit . Once a consistent estimate of ωcit is obtained, the source of the

potential endogeneity problem in equations (3, 4) is eliminated, and the production function

parameters can be estimated. We will employ both a variant of Olley and Pakes’ two-step

procedure as well as the more recent one-step GMM procedure proposed by Wooldridge (2005).

         We also compare these regression-based estimates of β l and β k with direct estimates

from on the OECD STAN’s data on labor’s share in total compensation, as cost minimization

together with CRS implies that β l is equal to labor’s share, and β k is equal to one minus labor’s

share in total costs. This yields an alternative estimate of the technology term a.



IV. Empirical Results

1. The Contributions of Labor and Capital

         Initially we focus our attention on the input parameters for capital and labor. Table 7

reports OLS estimates for β k and β l from


10
  See also Griliches and Mairesse (1998) and Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2005) for a discussion of these
assumptions.


                                                         10
(5)      ycit = β 0 + β k kcit + β l lcit + ε cit ,

which is a restricted version of equation (3).11 The columns in Table 7 correspond to results for

different assumptions on the regression error ε cit . When the equation only includes a constant,

β k is estimated around 0.43 and β l at about 0.57, and the null hypothesis of constant returns to

scale cannot be rejected (p-value of 0.27).12 Including time- (7.2), country- (7.3), and industry

fixed effects (7.4) improves the fit in terms of R 2 of the equation, and it leads to relatively modest

changes in the estimates ( β k falls to 0.375, while β l rises to 0.626). Also with fixed effects, the

model seems well-characterized with constant returns to scale (p-value of 0.98 in 7.4). When we

allow for deterministic fixed effects for each country-by-industry combination (also called

within-estimation), however, we estimate β k to be much higher and β l to be much lower (see

7.5).13 It is likely that this reflects well-known problems of the within-estimator in the presence

of measurement error (Griliches and Hausman 1986).

         Since OLS may suffer from endogeneity problems, in Table 8, we compare the least

squares estimates with alternative estimators. First, consider the case where there is no

unobserved heterogeneity (no fixed effects). Column one of Table 8 repeats the least squares

estimates of column one in Table 7 for convenience. Specification (8.2) employs the System

GMM IV estimator (Blundell and Bond 2000). Labor and capital are treated as endogenous and

may be correlated with the error through a random group fixed effect ς ci . Labor and capital are

instrumented with their own appropriately lagged values, which accounts for the lower number

of observations in the System GMM compared to the OLS estimation. We include three

11
   We have computed physical capital stocks using the perpetual inventory method and depreciation rate of 5%. The
R&D stocks are computed using a rate of depreciation of 15%. The labor measure is the total number of employees.
12
   Heteroskedasticity-consistent (Huber-White) standard errors are reported in all OLS regressions.
13
   This within-estimator involves estimating C x I = 17 x 22 = 374 group fixed effects. In contrast, (7.4) involves C
+ I = 17 + 22 = 39 fixed effects for the country and industry dimensions.


                                                         11
instruments, lt-2, lt-3, and kt-2, and given two endogenous variables (lt, kt) there is one

overidentifying restriction. At the bottom of (8.2), the p-value of 0.968 for the Sargan test of

overidentification statistic says that one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments, as

a set, are exogenous. 14

         The last two rows in Table 8 test for serial correlation in the equation’s first differences

using LM tests. Generally, as the lag length increases, the quality of the instrument declines. In

order to avoid a weak-instruments problem, the lag order should be low while at the same time

the lagged value should not be itself endogenous. The AR(2) test in the last row of Table 9

indicates that because the evidence for second-order autocorrelation in the first-differenced

residual is limited, variables at date (t-2) and earlier are marginally valid instruments.

         The next two columns present two different versions of the Olley-Pakes (1996) estimator.

Specification (8.3) follows closely the Olley-Pakes (OP) original two-step procedure. In step one

the unobservable ωcit (see equation (4''')) is approximated by a third-order polynomial in

investment and capital, which allows the identification of β l . In the second step, the assumption

that capital is uncorrelated with the innovation ωcit , which follows a first-order Markov process,

ensures the identification of β k . In column (8.4), we show the results of implementing the Olley-

Pakes estimator in the one-step GMM procedure recently proposed by Wooldridge (2005), which

is denoted as OP/W. 15 The OP results yield a labor coefficient of 0.53 (see 8.3), similar to that

for the one-step variant (8.4), where we estimate β l to be 0.51. However, the capital coefficient




14
   It is possible to reject the null that the instruments as a set are exogenous if we include further lagged values as
additional instruments. At the same time, it is well-known that this test has low power when the number of
overidentifying restrictions is high, since then there is an overfitting problem.
15
   This assumes that ω cit is a random walk (not only first-order Markov), and the identification for both β l and β k
comes solely from moment conditions that correspond to Olley and Pakes’ second stage.


                                                           12
using the OP method is estimated to be 0.63, considerably higher than 0.45, obtained with the

OP/W estimator, and our OLS estimates of β k .

        For all three estimators, System GMM, OP, and OP/W, the introduction of fixed effects

leads to a slightly higher labor coefficient, as it does for OLS (see Table 8). However, the capital

coefficient using the OP method is now estimated to be not significantly different from zero

anymore (p-value of about 0.14), and the point estimate is also quite different from the earlier

one without fixed effects (0.23, before 0.63). In contrast, the OP/W one-step estimator is

producing results that are more stable.16

        It is instructive to compare the estimates of β l and β k with the average labor and capital

shares in the data. This labor share is 0.647, which with constant returns to scale yields 0.353

for β k .17 These values are quite close to System GMM estimates with fixed effects in

specification (8.6). To summarize, we estimate the labor elasticity in the range of 0.56 (in 8.8) to

0.68 (in 8.6), with a midpoint estimate of 0.62. Given that the assumption of CRS is not rejected,

this puts the capital share at around 0.38.

        We are now turning to the impact of R&D.



2. The effects of domestic and foreign R&D

        After having examined the quantitative contributions of capital and labor to value added,

we now turn our attention to R&D spending. In Table 9, the OLS specification in column 2

introduces the industry’s domestic R&D stock in addition to its capital and labor (shown again in

column 1 for convenience). For this, we have estimated equation (3) by excluding the X control

16
   This may suggest that step-one identification in OP is weak in this context; Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2005)
discuss some of the issues involved.
17
   The average labor share in the data is computed as the average of labor compensation over value added (the
median is, with 0.662, similar).

variables. Both capital and labor coefficients fall with the inclusion of R&D ( β l now estimated

0.437, and β k 0.299). The coefficient on R&D is 0.271, which is at the higher end in the range

presented in the literature. 18 The R&D elasticity of 27% implies a rate of return of about 80%.19

In the System GMM specification shown in column 3, R&D is treated as endogenous; its

coefficient estimate is not very different than if it is treated as exogenous (0.246 in (9.3) versus

0.271 in (9.2)).20 Using the one-step Olley-Pakes estimator leads to a somewhat lower R&D

coefficient, at 0.179, and to a higher capital coefficient, as before (see Table 8). Overall, these

results are consistent with earlier studies showing that domestic R&D is an important

determinant of productivity.

         The analysis of international technology transfers begins with spillovers from the US,

which conducts most of the R&D in the world. The OLS results in the first column of Table 10

estimate positive and significant R&D elasticities for both domestic and US R&D. 21 The major

concern with using OLS is endogeneity, so we employ the System GMM and Olley-Pakes

techniques in columns (2) and (3). US R&D is estimated with a foreign elasticity of between

23% and 35%, higher than the domestic R&D elasticity, which comes in between 15% and 18%.

Does this mean that for the average country, US R&D has a stronger effect on its productivity

than domestic R&D? Not necessarily, since this specification may be omitting important


18
   This may be due to at least two factors: first, relative to other R&D studies we use broader industry aggregates.
With manufacturing divided into 22 industries, our estimate may pick up some industry-level externalities. Second,
we do not control yet f or foreign technology spillovers; as will become clear from Table 10, they are important. See
Griliches (1995) for more discussion.
19
   The average of value added here is 10251, the average R&D is 3402.7, and 0.271*10251/3402 = 0.817.
Additional rates of return for foreign R&D will be reported below.
20
   We include lt-2, l t-3, k t-2, and rt-2 as instruments, where rt-2 is the R&D stock lagged by two years.
21
   In these regressions, we avoid double-counting of the foreign R&D variables. Under domestic R&D variable, the
data of each country enters for its domestic industries, whereas under foreign R&D the data for domestic industries
are zero. In the first specification of Table 10, for example, under variable “domestic R&D”, US R&D data enter for
US industries, while under variable “US R&D” US R&D data enter for industries in all other countries except for
the US. In general, foreign R&D variables are introduced as Ic·r c, where Ic is an indicator variable that is 0 if this
observation is for country c, and 1 otherwi se.

international R&D spillovers. In some countries, especially in Europe, the R&D from other

major technology producers may well be more important than US R&D.

         Some evidence for that can be seen by the drop for the US R&D effect, from 35% to

17%, when Japanese and German R&D are included in column 4. Adding also the next three

largest countries in terms of R&D, France, the UK, and Canada, one sees that the international

R&D spillovers are in fact relatively diffuse: for all six countries, we estimate significant

spillover effects in the average sample country (columns 5 and 6). We will refer to these six

countries, US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, and Canada, as the G6 countries. At the same time,

international spillovers from these countries vary substantially: the preferred System GMM

estimates (column 5) range from 4.2% for the UK to 15.2% for Japan. 22 This suggests that the

effects are highly heterogeneous depending on the source country. Moreover, in contrast to

column 2 where only the US is considered a source of foreign technology, when R&D for all G6

countries is included, the elasticity of domestic R&D is estimated to be higher than that from any

foreign source. This highlights the importance of domestic technology creation.



         A crucial question is whether international R&D spillovers have changed over time—

specifically, is there evidence for more technology transfer in recent years? The results presented

in columns 7 and 8 of Table 10 shed new light on this by dividing the sample into two

subperiods. We present results for, roughly, the 1980s and 1990s. For all G6 countries with the

exception of the UK, the foreign R&D elasticity has increased over time. The effect is substantial



22
   In the IV GMM specification, we include lt-2, l t-3, k t-2, and rt-2 as instruments, as before, while the foreign R&D
variables is treated as exogenous. The Sargan overidentification test provides evidence that the instruments, as a set,
are exogenous ( p-value of 0.313). Moreover, there is some evidence for first-order serial correlation in the
differenced residuals (p-value of LM test of 0.210), whereas there is none for second-order serial correlation (p-
value of 0.989). The IV GMM technique thus seems to work well.


                                                          15
in some cases: in the case of the US, for example, the R&D elasticity almost tripled.23 This

suggests that even though the effect of R&D in the domestic economy has remained the same,

the international transfer of technology has become significantly stronger over the last three

decades.24



3. Total factor productivity and labor productivity as dependent variables

        By estimating a single elasticity each for capital and labor, our analysis so far has

implicitly assumed that factor elasticities are identical across countries, years, and industries. We

now relax that assumption by presenting results based on total factor productivity (TFP),

computed using information on the cost share for labor together with imposing constant returns

to scale (using equation 3). We will also present results for labor productivity in this section. 25

        These results are in Table 11. When the dependent variable is TFP, the domestic R&D

elasticity is estimated to be lower than with value added as dependent variable. This may in part

be due to the fact that industries with large capital stocks tend to have high capital shares as

well.26 By assuming that the capital elasticity is constant, the value added regression does not

account for that, and the high value added is attributed in part to R&D (which is positively

correlated with capital). Furthermore, in the value added regressions, we did not impose CRS

assumption, in which case R&D might be capturing any non-CRS effects.

        The size of the international R&D spillover coefficients for Germany and the UK is lower

than in the value added regressions (the UK’s is not significant anymore), but the coefficients for


23
   Similar results are obtained when the entire sample period of 1973 to 2002 is divided into two subperiods with 15
years each. However, given the unbalanced panel, we prefer to focus on the 1980s and 1990s for this part of the
analysis.
24
   Our findings extend the results of Keller (2002) in this respect.
25
   For the impact of private and public R&D on labor productivity in OECD countries at the aggregate level, see
Acharya and Coulombe (2006).
26
   The correlation of the physical capital stock with it its share in total cost is 11%.


                                                        16
the US, Japan, France, and Canada are comparable (see Table 11, columns 3-4). The highest

foreign spillover elasticities are estimated for R&D from Japan, the US, and Canada. 27 This is

exactly what we found when factor elasticities were restricted across sectors, countries, and time;

see the right-most column in Table 11 which reports the baseline IV System GMM estimates

(Table 10, (5)) for reference. One difference is that for the TFP specification we are unable to

find suitable instruments, as the LM test for second-order serial correlation indicates (p-value of

3.7%).28 In the value-added specification, this is not the case; it is one reason of why we prefer it

to the TFP specification in this context.

        Finally, we also report results with labor productivity as dependent variable, shown in

column 5 of Table 11. Relative to the value-added results (column 6), the domestic R&D is

estima ted to be somewhat lower (12.0% versus 15.7%), but otherwise the estimates are quite

similar. Overall, these results are broadly consistent with those based on value added as

dependent variable, and they suggest that the restrictions imposed by common factor shares are

not what are driving our results.



4. Source and Destination Heterogeneity

        The average R&D spillovers from the major technology producing countries is only part

of the full picture of international technology diffusion, since there is evidence that international

R&D spillovers vary substantially across bilateral relations (Keller 2002). There are two

dimensions that are of particular interest to us here. First, we consider the US as the technology



27
   The strong result on Canada may be in part explained by the fact that the US contributes to Canadian R&D
through R&D conducted in US-owned multinationals located in Canada. More generally, it is important to keep in
mind that the OECD’s R&D statistics are compiled on the basis of geography, not on the basis of ownership.
28
   We estimate the model with two period lagged R&D, rt-2, as instrument for the endogenous rt, so the equation is
just identified. If we include further lags of R&D as additional instruments, the Sargan test rejects the
overidentification restrictions.


                                                        17
source and ask how the strength of US technology spillovers varies across recipient countries.

Second, we examine the degree to which Canada, as the technology recipient country, benefits

from foreign technology spillovers originating in different countries.

         The average US spillover is around 23%, as we have shown in Table 10 (specification 3,

using the Olley-Pakes/Wooldridge one-step GMM method). Allowing for heterogeneity across

countries, using the following equation,

         ycit = β 0 + β k k cit + β l lcit + γ rcit +        ∑            β c ' rUSit +         ∑             β c '' rc ''it +ε cit
                                                        c '∈16, c '≠ US                   c ''∈G 5, c ' ≠US


one finds that US R&D has effects ranging from a low of 18.6% in France to a high of more than

twice that, 46.5%, in Ireland (Table 12a, column 2). Controlling for R&D spillovers from other

G6 countries, the spillover effects from US R&D vary widely. They range from essentially zero

to the maximum of 27.7% in Ireland (column 3). The strong effect in Ireland may in part reflect

technology transfer related to US foreign direct investment (for example, Dell Computers).29 In

Canada, we estimate an elasticity of 16.5% (second only to Ireland). In contrast, the average for

the other nine countries in which US R&D has a positive effect is only 5.7%. Moreover, in five

countriesAustralia, France, Italy, Korea, and the Netherlands, US R&D has no significant

positive effect at all once we control for R&D spillovers from other G6 countries. Overall, the

benefits for Canada from US technology creation are considerably above those that other

countries are experiencing.

         If US R&D generates heterogeneous spillover effects, this may well be the case for other

G6 country R&D as well. While generally estimating more spillover parameters makes both the

model less parsimonious and yields less precise estimates, we can focus on a given country and



29
  At the same time, Ireland is a somewhat special case in this analysis, because Irish data becomes only available in
the mid-1990s, at the height of the recent technology boom (see Table 1 on data availability).


                                                                                18
ask whether it benefits from G6 R&D more or less than other countries in the sample. In the case

of Canada, Table 12b summarizes the results of estimation of the following equation:

(6)      y cit = β 0 + β k k cit + β l lcit + γ rcit + γ CAN I (CAN ) rcit +    ∑ (β     c'   + β c' ,CAN I (CAN ))rc ' it + ε cit ,
                                                                               c '∈G 6


where I(CAN) is an indicator function that equals one if c = Canada, and zero otherwise. The set

G6 includes the countries Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US. In equation (6),

( γ + γ CAN ) measures the domestic R&D elasticity in Canada, while γ estimates the domestic

R&D elasticity in the average sample country. Similarly, the spillover effect from US R&D in

Canada is given by ( β US + βUS ,CAN ), whereas the average spillover effect from US R&D is just

ßUS, and analogously for the spillovers from the other G6 countries.

        Abstracting from international technology transfer, the domestic R&D elasticity in

Canada is about 0.47 while in other countries it is only about 0.25. Once we control for G6 R&D

spillovers, in the average sample country the domestic R&D elasticity is about 14%, in Canada it

is about 50% (Table 12b, column 2). Hence Canada’s domestic technology creation appears to be

highly productive. 30

        Turning to the foreign spillover effects, we see that Canada tends to benefit more from

foreign technology than the average sample country. Specifically, Canada gains two to three

times as much from US and German R&D than countries do on average. In contrast, Canada

does not appear to benefit more from Japanese and French R&D than other countries. These

results are obtained using either the System GMM or the one-step Olley-Pakes methods

(columns 2 and 3, respectively). The results suggest that producers in Canada have a relatively

high capacity to absorb foreign technology.


30
  Note that a substantial part of the R&D conducted in Canada occurs in affiliates of foreign-owned companies. It is
not obvious that foreign R&D conducted in Canada has the same implications for economic welfare as Canadian-
owned R&D.


                                                                     19
        Overall, there is tremendous heterogeneity in international technology transfer by source-

and destination countries.



5. Technology transfer through imports

        International trade has long been considered as a channel of technology transfer. The

most influential test of this hypothesis is based on open economy versions of endogenous growth

models of the early 1990s (Grossman and Helpman 1991). It asks whether a country’s

productivity is higher, all else equal, if it imports predominantly from high-R&D countries.31

This would be consistent with technology being embodied in the imported goods, and there

could also be imports-related learning effects. Empirically authors tend to find that the

composition of imports of countries has not a major effect on productivity along these lines. 32 In

general, this could mean that imports are indeed not a major conduit for technology transfer.

Alternatively, the result could merely imply that an ancillary assumption of the approach is

rejected. Specifically, a maintained assumption in the typical approach is that foreign R&D

elasticities are the same in all countries. This hypothesis is easily rejected in our sample; recall

that the size of average R&D spillovers varies by a factor of three or more among countries such

as Japan and the UK (Table 10). Moreover, spillover patterns may not be captured well by linear

import shares. As we have seen above, US R&D has no significant effect in about one third of

the sample countries, although they import on average roughly the same from the US as the other

countries in the sample. 33



31
   Coe and Helpman (1995) were the first to test this prediction.
32
   See Keller (2004) for additional discussion.
33
   Australia, France, Italy, Korea, and the Netherlands do not significantly benefit from US R&D once other G5
technology sources are controlled for (Table 12a, (3)). These five countries import on average 20% from the US,
while the other eleven countries import on average 21% from the US (Table 6).


                                                        20
        Therefore we opt for a more flexible approach, the results of which are presented in Table

13. For a given industry and year, we compute US share of country c’s imports

( mcUSit
    ,    = M cUSit
              ,    / ∑c ' M c ,c i' t ), and interact that variable with US R&D to estimate


(7)      ycit = β 0 + β k k cit + β l lcit + γ rcit +    ∑        β c ' rc 'i t + χ US mcUSit
                                                                                         ,    rUSit + ε cit ,

where χUS is the new parameter of interest. If χUS > 0, industries that import relatively much

from the US benefit from imports-related R&D spillovers, in addition to any other US R&D

effect picked up by ß US. Because the degree to which any industry imports from the US is

endogenous and likely affected by how high US R&D spending in this industry is, we use the

System GMM estimation technique. 34 In specification (1) of Table 13, χUS is not significantly

different from zero at standard levels. Since we have primarily considered R&D spillovers from

the G6 countries, we focus the analysis to imports from these six countries as well. Hence we

define import shares as a fraction of total imports from these six countries,

 c,c 'i t = M c, c ' it / ∑c '∈G 6 M c ,c ' it , and include both its interaction with US R&D as well as the import

                                                                                      mcUSit
                                                                                        ,    rUSit +            ∑                ν cG"6 mcG',6c " rc "it + ε cit .

        Specification (2) in Table 13 indicates that χUS
                                                      G6
                                                         is estimated at 0.221, while the direct US

spillover effect falls essentially to zero (ßUS = 0.004). This suggests that spillovers from the US

are strongly related to imports. The value of 0.221 implies a US spillover elasticity of 5.7%,

evaluated at the mean import share (of 25.6%). This is lower than the value of 8.7% (Table 10,

Column 5), the value we found for the direct US R&D without allowing for imports-related

spillovers. The difference is, however, that now the US spillovers that an industry receives are a

  The US imports-R&D interaction is instrumented by its value two years lagged. Diagnostic tests at the bottom of
column 1 provide evidence that this IV strategy is valid. The foreign R&D variables are treated as exogenous.


                                                                              21
function of its import share. That ranges from 0 to 98.97 percent in our sample, which means that

the US R&D spillover elasticity ranges from 0 to 21.9%, a range that includes the earlier

spillover estimate of 8.7%. 35

         The result that US R&D spillovers are strongly related to imports from the US does not

change as we extend equation (7') to include imports effects for Japan and Germany, as well as

import effects for France, the UK, and Canada (specifications (3) and (4) in Table 13,

respectively). As is the case for the US, spillovers from UK R&D appear to be also primarily

related to imports from the UK; both the System GMM and the Olley-Pakes/Wooldridge GMM

results, columns 4 and 5, find insignificant R&D but significant imports-R&D interactions

effects for the UK. The opposite is true for Germany and Japan, where the direct R&D effect is

positive, while there is no evidence for imports-related R&D spillovers. For the remaining two

countries, Canada and France, we find both imports-related and other R&D spillover effects,

with the evidence for spillovers associated with imports from Canada being stronger.

         It is interesting to see what the relative economic importance of spillovers related to

imports, versus not related to imports is. Canada’s direct R&D elasticity estimate is 0.129 in the

System GMM specification, and the imports-R&D interaction effect is 0.193. In this sample, on

average about 4.9% of the G6 imports come from Canada, so that the average imports-related

R&D elasticity is slightly less than 1 percent (0.193 times 0.049). At the 95th percentile,

Canada’s share in G6 imports is 27%, leading to an imports-related R&D elasticity of around 5

percent. What does this mean for the relative importance of imports-related R&D spillovers

from Canada vis-à-vis its total spillover? Evaluated at the average import-share of 4.9%, the


35
  There is a negative correlation between imports from the US and value added ( ν US G6
                                                                                        is equal to -2.102). This does
not necessarily mean that a higher import share from the US is associated with lower productivity—it depends on
the size of US R&D in this particular industry. The elasticity of productivity with respect to the import share at the
average US R&D level is -0.21, while at the 75th percentile it is 0.12.


                                                          22
fraction of spillovers from Canada related to imports is about 7%. 36 For countries with higher

import shares from Canada, such as the US, the value at the 95th percentile of imports may be

more relevant, and it is about 29%.

           The case of France, for example, differs mainly because the countries in the sample

import more from France than from Canada; on average, France accounts for 13.9% of all

imports from G6 countries in this sample. On average, imports-related R&D spillovers account

for a fraction of 0.16 in the total spillovers from France, and this value goes to 0.33 and higher

for countries that import substantially from France. 37 Overall, for bilateral relations where

international technology transfer is related to imports, the latter account for between 10 and 20

percent of the total effect.



V. Summary and Discussion

           The previous analysis has yielded a number of key results. First of all, R&D has an

important effect on productivity. A 10% increase in domestic R&D translates on average into

about 1.5% higher productivity in our sample. At the same time, the contribution of international

technology transfer often far exceeds the effect of domestic R&D on productivity. On average,

the combined impact of R&D investments in six countries close to the world’s technology

frontier, the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, and Canada, is about three times as large as

that of domestic R&D according to our estimates.

           Moreover, we show that the global patterns of technology transfer are highly asymmetric.

For example, the impact of US R&D on UK productivity is twice as large as the US effect in

Germany or Spain. We also find that some countries benefit more from foreign technology than

36
     This is calculated as (0.193*0.049)/(0.129+0.193*0.049), where 0.129 = ßCAN in Table 13, column 4.

other countries across the board, a finding which suggests that there are important differences in

absorptive capacity. These could be related to domestic R&D investments or high levels of

education, for example. International technology transfer has also become much more important

during the 1990s relative to previous decades.

       In addition, we confirm earlier results that geography has a strong influence on the extent

to which countries benefit from foreign technology. Canada, for example, benefits very strongly

from US R&D. However, the results indicate that geography is not the whole story. A more

complete picture emerges when we link technology transfer to international trade between

countries. Technology transfer between some countries is primarily occurring through

technology embodied in imports, while in other cases non-trade channels are much more

important than technology embodied in imports.

       While a complete account of the source- and destination heterogeneity in international

Appendix A: Data Note
The paper uses several databases of OECD which have been supplemented from other different sources as required.
The main data we have used from OECD are: Analytical Business Expenditure in Research and Development
(ANBERD) database, Structural Analysis (STAN) database, Commodity, Trade and Production (COMTAP)
database, and Bilateral Trade (BTD) database. We have also used data from Groningen Growth and Development
Centre (GGDC). Data on employment of US foreign affiliates in foreign countries are taken from US Bureau of
Economic Analysis. Besides, we have used data directly from the website of national statistical agencies in Canada,
Japan, the UK and the US to complement some of the missing cells. The industries for the study are based on
International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Rev. 3 code. We have used data from both old system
Revision 2 (ISIC Rev. 2), and ISIC Rev. 3. Since ISIC Rev. 2 has data on only 22 manufacturing industries and ISIC
Rev. 3 has data on 31 industries, including 22 that are in ISIC 2, the study takes the 22 industries which are common
to both systems as sample (the ISIC rev. 3 code and industry names are provided in Table 1). The data for the study
covers 30 years, from 1973 to 2002. In what follows, we will provide a detail data description and related
concordance that we have used.

ANBERD: These data are available in two series: ANBERD 2 and ANBERD 3, the former based on ISIC Rev. 2,
and the latter based on ISIC Rev. 3 industry code. Although these two data series covers different number of
countries and industries, they are c omplement to each other. ANBERD 2 data start from 1973 and covers till about
1995-97, and ANBERD 3 data start from 1987 and go at least till 2002 for most of the countries (except for Ireland
in which case they stop at 2001). Regarding country coverage, ANBERD 2 has data only for 15 countries in the
sample (missing are Belgium and Korea) whereas the ANBERD 3 covers all 17 countries.

         We have combined both data series; if there were overlap between two datasets, we have taken them from
ANBERD 3. For 13 countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Japan,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and USA) we have taken data from ANBERD 2 from 1973 to 1986 and from
ANBERD 3 from 1987 onward. For the remaining four countries, we have proceeded as follows. For Italy, the data
from 1973 to 1990 are from ANBERD 2, and for the rest of the years, they are from ANBERD 3. For Belgium, the
R&D data start in 1987, and that for Korea, it starts in 1995. Regarding Germany, the ANBERD 2 data covers West
Germany from 1973 to 1995 and united Germany from 1991 to 1995, and ANBERD 3 covers united Germany from
1995 and onward. So to create a complete series for Germany, we took data for West Germany from 1973 to 1990
and for united Germany from 1991 to 1994 (both from ANBERD 2) and from united Germany from 1995 to 2002
(from ANBERD 3).

         For all countries the ANBERD 2 database and for most countries the ANBERD 3 database are in national
currency. The only difference is that for Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Spain
the ANBERD 3 data are in Euro, whereas the ANBERD 2 data for these countries are in national currency. Hence,
to bring data in common currency, we converted the ANBERD 2 data for these countries into Euro using irrevocable
exchange rate.38

          When combined, the data are available from 1973 to 2002 for all countries and industries with the
following missing values. The data for 6 countries (Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and Sweden) are
available for all industries throughout the sample period. For Canada, Italy and US, the data are missing only for one
industry each. For another three countries (Finland, UK and Netherlands), data for two industries are missing for
some years. For remaining five countries, data were missing for more than three industries, in most cases though not
throughout the sample period but for some years.

        Since the ANBERD (both series) data are in current price, we use the industry value added deflator based
on GGDC and STAN databases (more on these two databases later) to convert them into 1995 prices. Finally, using
we converted them into 1995 purchasing power parity (PPP) US dollar.

COMTAP and BTD: Trade data come from three OECD databases: (1) COMTAP for years 1970-1979, (2) BTD 2
for years 1980-1989 and (3) BTD 3 for years 1990-2003. Trade data are complete for all 17 countries except for
Korea, which starts only from 1994. Both COMTAP and BTD 2 are based on ISIC Rev. 2, whereas BTD 3 is based
on ISIC Rev. 3. For Germany, the import data are taken for West Germany from 1970 to 1989 and for united
Germany from 1991 and onward. We converted all three COMTAP, BTD 2 and BTD 3 databases into 22 sample
industries.

  The national currency per EURO rate is as below: Belgium = 40.3399; Finland = 5.94573; France = 6.55957;
Germany = 1.95583; Ireland = 0.787564; Italy = 1936.27; Netherlands = 2.20371, and Spain = 166.386.
                                                         40
          The trade data, which are in US dollar, are converted into 1995 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollar. Since
the PPP to US $ exchange rate is not readily available, we used two other available series from STAN database to
obtain it as follows:
           PPP in U.S. dollar       National currency U.S. dollar
                               =
                U.S. dollar      National currency PPP in U.S. dollar
Multiplying the U.S. dollar trade data by the rate on the left hand side in year 1995, we obtained trade data in PPP at
1995 rate.

STAN: We have used value added, gross fixed capital formation (investment), employment (persons engaged and
hours worked) and labor compensation data from STAN database. We have used mainly STAN 3 database which
are based on ISIC Rev. 3 industry code and start coverage from 1970 till more recent years. However, it appears that
for early years for some countries, data that are available on STAN 2 database are not available in STAN 3. In such
cases, we used the STAN 2 database to cover the missing values in STAN 3. Furthermore, we realize that some of
the entries which are empty in both STAN 2 and STAN 3 databases were available in old STAN data CD. In such
cases, we have used data from old CD to refill the empty cells. Thus our data construction was based on the premise
that use as much as they are available in STAN 3, if possible recover the missing cells from STAN 2, and if still
missing recover them from old CD.

         In STAN 3, value added and investment data are available in nominal terms, and in real terms, i.e. as
volumes. The former are in national currencies. The volumes are expressed as index numbers with national
reference year equal to 100. Since, for the study, we need both value added and investment in value not as index, we
performed the following two steps. First, we converted the index into value. Second, since different countries index
values were based on different reference year, we re-based the reference year for all countries in 1995. The first step
was performed the follows:

                    I t × pr q r
(A1)     p r yt =                ,               t = 1973 to 2002,
                       100
where pr q t is the constant price value added in reference year price, r; p t yt is the value added in current price, and
pr q r is the current price value added in the reference year, and I stands for index data in the database (in case of
investment, the similar equation was used with value added data replaced by investment data). Since both I t and
 p r yr are available in the data, we were able to compute the expression on the left-hand side. The calculation in (A1)
is based on the fact that I t = ( pr q t pr q r ) ×100 .39

         In the data, the reference years are not the same for all sample countries. For both value added and
investment indices, the reference year is 2000 (2000 = 100) for six countries, 1995 for nine countries and 1997 for
Canada. 40 In the second step, for those countries whose reference years are different from 1995, we converted their
value at constant price given by equation (A1) into 1995 by using the following mechanism:
                         p1995q1995
(A2)     p1995q t =                 × p r qt ,                             t = 1973 to 2002,
                          p r q1995


39
   However, the volume indices were not available for some industries in some countries and year. So in an attempt
to use the same indices across all countries, we have moved up to more aggregate indices to compute constant price
investment. This amounts to assuming that the price change for more disaggregate level of industries was the same
as the price change in more aggregate industry level. In sum, we used the index of ISIC 24 for ISIC 24x2423 and
ISIC 2423 for all countries and of ISIC 2423 for Norway; the index of ISIC 27-28 for industries ISIC 271 and ISIC
273. Furthermore, we used the index of ISIC 30-33 for industries ISIC 30, ISIC 31, ISIC 32, and ISIC 33. And
finally, we used the index of ISIC 34-35 for industry ISIC 34 and for industries ISIC 351, ISIC 353 and ISIC
352+359.
40
   A note on West Germany (GEW) and United Germany (GER)) is needed here. For GEW, data run from 1970 to
1991, whereas for GER they run from 1991 to 2002. We have taken data for a period of 1970-1990 from GEW and
for a period of 1991-2002 from GER to make a complete (1970-2002) series for Germany. However, in volume
index, it needed some work to make them based on the same reference year, as the index for GEW is based on 1991
= 100 and the volume index for GER is based on 1995 = 100. We choose to base them both in year 1995 = 100. For
this purpose, we took the benefit of the fact that for both GEW and GER, there are indices for year 1991. So based
on the index of GER in 1991 basing it on 1995 = 100 and combine them with GER series.
                                                            41
where p1995q t is value added in 1995 price; p1995 q1995 is current price value added in 1995; pr q1995 is value added
in 1995 in reference year price, and pr qt is the value from equation (A1). Note that for countries whose reference
year was 1995 Equation (A2) holds as an identity. We repeated (A2) for investment series as well.

         STAN 2 current price value added and investment data were in the same currency as in STAN 3 except for
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Spain, which in national currency, not in Euro.
We converted STAN 2 data for these countries into EURO first. Regarding constant price data, unlike STAN 3, the
STAN 2 database does not have investment data in constant price and those in value added are also in actual value,
not in index. But they are based on 1990 prices. We converted the constant price value added from 1990 price to
1995 prices using the following formula:
                      p1995q1995
(A3)     p1995q t =               × p1990qt
                      p1990 q1995
Similarly, the constant value added data from old CD, which are basically STAN 2 data, are also in value but in
1985 prices. To convert these data into 1995 price, we need to do the following:
                      p1995q1995
(A3')    p1995q t =               × p1985qt .
                      p1985 q1995
However, since we have neither current value added, p1995 q1995 , nor constant value added, p1985q1995 , data for 1995
in this source, we converted the data in old CD into 1995 prices using the following procedure:
                    p q 
(A4)     p1995q t =  1995 1990  × p1985 qt ,
                     p1985q1990  M
where the expression inside the parenthesis is for total manufacturing, denoted by subscript M. The expression
inside the bracket has no industry dimension but has only country dimension as we have estimated it for each
country. The numerator in this expression is taken from STAN 3 and the denominator from data in CD. We used this
ratio of constant value added in year 1990, one based on price in 1995 and the other in year 1990, for all industries.

       By doing so, we have data on value added and investment (both at constant and current prices)
employment, and compensation.

GGDC: We have taken data for value added (both in current price and in constant price) and employment (both
persons engaged in employment and hours worked) from GGDC. This dataset is comparable with the OECD STAN
database but provides a dataset without gaps by complementing STAN with information from industry and services
statistics and additional (historical) national accounts data for individual countries. The GGDC database have total
of 57 industries, with 27 in manufacturing. We concorded these 27 industries into the 22 industries of our sample.
The industries in GGDC could be easily concorded, except for two industries in which case we have to decompose
these two GGDC industries into two each. In GGDC, the ISIC 24 is not split into ISIC 24x2423 and 2423. Similarly,
industry ISIC 27 is not disaggregated into ISIC 271 and ISIC 272.

         To split GGDC 24 and 27 into two industries each, we used the value added at current price data from
STAN database where data on ISIC 24x2423, ISIC 2423, ISIC 271 and ISIC 272 are reported separately. We
computed the annual share of value added of 24x2423 and 2423 in ISIC 24 and used that share to decompose GGDC
ISIC 24 into two categories. We did the same for ISIC 271 and 272, using the value added shares of these two
industries in ISIC 27. This refilling mechanism was possible only for 13 countries. Among the remaining four
countries, for the Netherlands the STAN database has data on 24x2423 and 2423, whereas those for ISIC 271 and
ISIC 272 are available only from 1995 to 1999. Hence, to split data throughout the sample period for ISIC 27, we
used the average share of these two industries in that period. For Ireland, we had no information to split ISIC 27. For
Norway it was just the opposite, we could split ISIC 27 but not ISIC 24. For Australia, STAN did not have
information on either of two industries. Hence, to split ISIC 27 for Ireland, ISIC 24 for Norway, and both ISIC 24
and ISIC 27 for Australia, we used the 50/50 rule. Even though this type of breakdown is not very realistic, we don’t
expect these cells to bias our results as they represent only 0.1 percent of the data cells for the study.

         We combined the data on value added (both at current and constant price) and employment from STAN
and GGDC, taking data from STAN for years 1973 to 1978 and from GGDC for years 1979 and onward. The reason
for taking data from GGDC whenever they were available rather than from STAN was that the data on the former
were complete, whereas on the latter there were several missing cells. Then using the combined value added data in


                                                         42
current price and constant price, we calculated value added deflator, d t , which was used to deflate the investment
and R&D data.
 (A5)     dt = p t q t p1995q t ,                                                  t = 1973 to 2002,
where pt qt is the current price value added given in the data. Then, we converted these national currency value
added and investment data into 1995 PPP. Furthermore, the PPP converted series of constant price value added was
used to compute labor employment per person engaged.

Employment of US Foreign Affiliates in Foreign Countries: These data are taken from US Bureau of economic
analysis. They are available for all sample industries except for the ISIC 35 which was not decomposed into three
industries that we are interested in. Hence, we divided the entry in ISIC 35 into three industries by one-third. The
drawback, however, of these series is that they are available only for seven countries: from 1983 for Canada and
Japan and from 1989 for Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and UK. We have used this data as a
separate variable in our estimation, with other countries as missing values.

Appendix B: Supplementing and Estimating Missing Data
         The variables that are used for the study are trade, US employment in foreign affiliates, value added,
employment, R&D, labor compensation, and physical investment. The data on trade are almost complete except for
few years for Korea, so we have not estimated the missing values for this variable either. Even though the data on
employment in US affiliates are missing, we did not estimate them, as there is no reasonable way to do so. The value
added and employment data after 1979, when we had them from GGDC, are complete. However, there are some
missing values prior to 1979 for these variables. Among the three remaining variables, even though there are some
data missing for R&D and labor compensation, the frequency of missing cells is more frequent in investment data.
Below, we describe how we estimated some of the missing cells in investment data. We have also estimated few
missing cells in value added, employment, R&D expenditure and labor compensation using similar techniques.

          As mentioned above, the investment data are available in both current and constant prices. For the study,
the preference would be to use constant price investment data, as they are based on more appropriate deflators.
However, if we rely in constant price investment there will be a lot of missing cells. In terms of availability, the
constant price investment data are a subset of current price investment in a sense that almost all data that are
available in former series are also available in the latter but not vice versa. For example, even though the investment
data in current price are available, they are completely missing in constant price for three countries (Australia, UK,
and Korea). Similarly, even though the data in current price for Finland, France, Japan, Denmark and Sweden are
available from 1973, the constant indices for these countries start only in 1975, 1978, 1980, 1993 (for the last two
countries) respectively. Finally, there is a gap of four years in data availability for Ireland, as the current price data
start in 1991 and those in constant price in 1995. Besides, even for other countries and years, when we compare data
availability by industry, the data gap in current price and constant price are substantial. Hence, in this study, we have
used the current price investment data by deflating them by value added deflators.

           For the missing value, when possible, first we used national statistical agencies’ to refill the data if
possible. This was done only for UK, Canada, the US and Japan. For UK, all of 2001 and 2002 data were obtained
from Table 6 “gross fixed capital formation” of Input-output Supply and Use Tables from National Statistics UK.
Data for Canada for most of 2001 and 2002 were taken from Statistics Canada. Similarly most of the data for 2001
and 2002 for the US were supplemented using Bureau of Economic Analysis “historical-cost investment in private
fixed assets by industry” from the website. For Japan, the STAN database has investment data only in current price
that too only in STAN 2 which extends only till 1993; STAN 3 does not have data on Japan. We supplemented these
data by acquiring a file from Department of National Accounts, Economic and Social Research Institute in Japan,
which has data from 1980 onward in constant price. Hence our investment series for Japan will be a mixed of two
series: till 1979 we use the investment in current price by deflating with value added deflator, and from 1980 to 2002
we use data series which were already in constant price (using investment deflator).

          Before describing estimation methods of the missing values, a closer look at the industry level current price
investment data shows that even though the data for industries ISIC 15-16, 17-18, 21-22, 25, 26 and 36 were more
or less complete, there were missing values for other industries. With sample period of 30 years (1973-2002), 22
industries and 17 countries (30 x 22 x 17), we have total of 11,220 cells of information. Out of them, 1,930 (about
17 percent) cells of data were missing. To estimate part of missing cells we used three different approaches. The first
approach is based on the assumption that the investment share of 3- or 4-digit level industry in 2-digit level industry
remained the same as it was in the preceding three years. This method is used to estimate data mostly for industries
at 3- and 4-digit level and for more recent years. Since there are two 4-digit industries (ISIC 24x2423 and ISIC

                                                           43
2423) and three 3 -digit industries (ISIC 351, ISIC 353, ISIC 352+359), we have used this method mostly for these
five industries. The method, called Method 1, is given by the following equation:
(B1)     i t ( 3/4) ≡ ωit ( 2 ) ,
           where i t ( 2 ) is the investment at 2-digit industry; i t ( 3 / 4 ) is the investment at 3 or 4 digit industries
                                                                   it −k ( 3 / 4) 
within that 2-digit industry in time period t; ω =  ∑                                3 , (k = 1, 2, 3), is the average share of
                                                                      it − k ( 2 ) 
                                                               k

investment at 3- or 4-digit industry within its 2-digit industry investment in the preceding three years. Since the data
at 3- and 4-digit industries were missing only for the most recent years, this method is mostly used to fill data for
years 1999 through 2000. But in few cases, we have used this method to regain data even earlier period. For a
couple of countries we used this method to decompose data for individual industries ISIC 30, 31, 32 and 33, when
data on ISIC 30-33 was given, and for ISIC 271, 272 when data for ISIC 27 was given and for ISIC 351 and
352+359 when data for ISIC 35 was given.

          The second estimation method —Method 2— is used for those industries which have data available for at
least three-fifths and less than four-fifths of sample period (between 18 and 23 years). We used the change in current
price value added to estimate investment as given below:
(B2)       it +1 = it exp  ln ( yt +1 yt )  ,
where it is investment in current price, and y is value added in current price. In most cases the data were available
for early periods and we used (B2) to estimate data for later period. In few cases, the data were available for later
periods and were missing for earlier period. In this case, we used it −1 = it exp  ln ( yt −1 yt )  to estimate the
missing values. In very few cases, the data were missing in both ends with data available only for the middle period.
In that case, we used (B2) to estimate data only for the later period and left the earlier period empty.

        For those industries which have data for at least 24 years, we used the growth rate of investment—Method
3—to estimate investment in the current year as follows:
(B3)       it +1 = it 1 + ln ( it it −1 ) 
Equation (B3) is good to estimate data for later period given that the earlier period data were available. To refill data
for earlier period, we used it −1 = it 1 + ln ( it it +1 )  .

          For investment, 140 cells were filled up using method 1; about 466 cells were filled up using Method 2, and
about 126 cells were filled up using Method 3. Hence, altogether 732 of the 1,930 missing cells were filled up. The
remaining 1,198 were left empty either because the data for industries were empty throughout or were available for
less than 18 years, the cut off number of years for data refinement. Among them, nine industries (distributed in
different countries) had no entry at all (contributing 270 empty cells). The other empty cells were distributed in
different industries and countries, more in Belgium, Ireland, Denmark and few in France, Spain and Sweden.

         Then we used value added deflators to convert adjusted current price investment into constant price, and
further converted them into 1995 PPP dollar.

          In very few cases, we have augmented the value added and deflator prior to 1979 using Method (3). In case
of current value added, we filled 143 cells and in case of deflator, we filled 274 cells. In case of R&D, we filled 270
cells using this method.

           We have also augmented data for labor compensation using the following mechanism:
(B4)       wt +1 = wt exp  ln ( et +1 et ) 
where w is the labor compensation, and e is the labor employment. For most of the empty cells we have used
equation (B4). However, for a few cells, especially if they occur at the beginning of the period (year 1973) where we
don’t have the employment growth rate for this year, we used the following process
(B4')      wt −1 = wt 1 + ln ( wt wt +1 ) 
The labor compensation data for Canada for year 2002 were missing from the database and were supplemented
using data from Statistics Canada.

                                                                       44
         For those industries whose labor compensation to value added shares were greater than 0.85 and less 0.2
have been replaced by median value of compensation to value added, median across all countries and all years for
the given industry.

Appendix C: Method to Construct Capital Stock
Using two sets of constant price physical investment and the combination of two as another set, we computed three
sets physical capital stock. We also computed capital stock of R&D expenditure. For that purpose, we used the
following perpetual inventory method to construct the stock of R&D and of physical capital for country c, industry I
year t:
(C1)     κ cit = ι cit −1 + (1 − δ ) κ cit −1 ,
where κ represents both physical and R&D capital and ι represents both physical and R&D investment, and δ is the
depreciation rate. Based on the common practice, we use 5% depreciation rate for physical capital and 15% for
R&D. The beginning of period capital stock (both physical and R&D) was given as follows:

         κ1 = ι0 + (1 − δ ) ιt −1 + (1 − δ ) ιt − 2 + ...
                                             2

  s=0                       s =0  1 + g    g +δ
where g is the average annual growth rate of constant price investment and R&D expenditure throughout the study
period.
